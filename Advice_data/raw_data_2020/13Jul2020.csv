0,"Hey there, I’m a 20-year old Ukrainian student in Denmark. I don’t really have anyone “wise” to ask this really, so that’s why I’m turning to reddit to see if anyone has some insight.

So I just recently hit my 20, and let me give you a little context of what I’m going through. I think this is the age where everybody struggles in the career area and deciding on what you want to do in life is hard. Some say it will come along but I’m not too sure about that. I have finished high school about a year ago and have moved for university about half a year ago. Going to a uni and let alone in a foreign country is something big for my family, as not many people in my family have a proper education. There’s a lot of things I think that are expected of me now, as they’re fully supporting me financially (Currently I’m struggling to find a job due to the corona thing)

The uni I chose has to do with hotel and restaurant businesses, but I have only chosen this because of my background in working as a receptionist for 5 years in the past and I thought it would be a great idea but I am not sure whether this is what I want to dedicate my life to. I have a lot on my mind so please bare with me.

I guess I always thought of this as the “guaranteed backup career” as you can’t really go wrong with going to uni and getting a paper that says you’re educated. That alone can secure me a proper, well paid job in the future. However I want to focus on so many more things such as singing, archery and yadayada but these are always risky because I don’t think there is that much of a possibility of making a career out of it. I am not saying that I necessarily want to drop out, but this is not what “feels right” to me. 

I cannot stress enough how I realize that life is so so short and I get pressured by this into making quick decisions which aren’t always the best. One day, I’d like to know for myself that when someone asks my parents “are you proud of your son?” That they will say yes without a doubt. I could not have wished for better parents and half of the reason I’m posting this is because of them. I want to make them proud. I want to repay everything they have provided me even when they had to sacrifice some of their lives to make mine better. I can’t describe just how grateful I am for these people to be in my life and support me. 

But having this mindset only pressures me into trying really, really hard as I know I’m not doing this for just for myself and when something doesn’t work out, the consequences are worse because I think of myself as a failure, and I think I disappoint my parents as well. 

Even if, let’s say I’d like to become a singer, how do I go about that? Who do I talk to? Is there some “music” authority who I can call and ask questions :( ?
You can tell I’m really lost and I have severe mood swings and I am unstable because I think about this everyday since I started uni. All I know is that I can’t go on much longer unless I find some solution, or something I can look forward to.

I apologize for the long post, if you have made it down here I love you &lt;3",13Jul2020,1
1,"So I’m a brown female and like most of my peers I have a lot of peach fuzz. It’s everywhere, my face, arms, torso, etc. Somehow I’m still get hit on a lot and told I’m attractive. I’m tall, thin, have a decently looking butt and symmetrical face but I don’t see it, the hair bothers me. I’m at a point where I wanted to laser it off this summer since I could finally afford it but then COVID happened. Now I can’t get the treatment and I’m kinda bummed because I don’t wanna shave or wax anymore than I already do, at the moment only legs, arms, and facial hair. It feels so restricting because I know that if it weren’t for the hair I’d feel better about myself. Maybe I’d see myself how others see me, I’ve always been told I could be a model but unfortunately I feel like the hair holds me back. I’m getting to the point where I’m exhausted of shaving and can almost begin to feel attractive. Before I didn’t even want to see myself naked in the mirror and now I actually think I’d look good in a two piece bikini but again the hair part is an issue. Can I ever really learn to accept myself? And even if I do what will other people think when I bare my fuzzy torso in a two piece? Some people say they don’t notice until I mention it but I just don’t believe that it’s so obvious it’s all over my face. Should I just go for the laser anyway? Stop shaving? Keep shaving?i just want to fit into society and not feel like an outsider because my skin is covered in hair but i don’t know what would be acceptable.",13Jul2020,1
2,"So my cousin Henry, is 30 years old, but hasn’t the education to past a 1st grade math test. His mother was an obese, borderline narcissist who “homeschooled” both her kids. Needless to say, she was a crap teacher. My cousin has lived under the wing of various aunts and uncles houses with his moocher mother, who was also a hoarder. From this, he has learned that change is bad, and that changing means losing your identity. His identity as a person is a confederate rebel, who believes  the south will rise again and all that. That war is coming and he wants every part of it. 
But despite this, he is a great friend, loyal, and knows much about civil war, because it is his favorite subject. He just doesn’t know how to be anything. I’ve tried to get him motivated for his GED. But he doesn’t do it unless you stand over him and help him. I was watching him on his tablet and saw him struggling and rubbing his face. I walked over, and saw it was single division. His hand writing is also 3rd grade. He has many opinions, but he isn’t motivated. 
I am the only person who is trying to help.And in all honesty, he just doesn’t know how to change. He doesn’t understand, leaving behind the past and being someone new. I need help to teach him to be someone. Any advice would be great.",13Jul2020,1
3,"This guy started working here about 6 months ago and is absolutely lazy. He’s alway calling in, since he started working here he’s never worked a full 40 hour week. He’s also always hiding in the bathroom for hours, on his phone to avoid doing any work. My boss caught on to this and said tomorrow slip a note under her door if I catch him. I don’t want to get anybody in trouble or potentially fired. 

This happened before with another guy, I tried warning him. He kept doing it and got caught. He went into the office and snitched on me for giving him a heads up. Like he wanted to bring me down with him. 

If I lie and say he didn’t do anything, my boss can watch the cameras to see if I’m lying. Even though they’re not allowed to, unless something bad happens. They’re doing this because they want to fire him. He’s already threatened to bring them to court before over another issue. So they absolutely hate him. What should I do? I don’t want to get him or anybody in trouble.",13Jul2020,1
4,"Tl;dr: Neither my girlfriend nor I see much reason to have a wedding ceremony, yet it will upset members of my family if I don’t have one.


So I’m a 20 year old guy who is a US citizen and my girlfriend (19) and I are planning on getting married soon. She lives in Mexico. We were planning on getting married not only as a way to facilitate her coming immigration process, but that is a factor. I decided a long time ago I was ready to commit my life to her, and she feels the same. We love each other and want to spend our lives together.

Thing is, for me the whole wedding ceremony thing isn’t a huge concern. I don’t feel the need to have our relationship hinge on a wedding ceremony. It doesn’t appeal to my girlfriend either. Neither of us believes it is necessary for our relationship to have a ceremony and that we would be fine without one. I don’t care much for the label and see marriage more as something that will help us and our relationship navigate the world, not that marriage is what defines our relationship, if that makes any sense at all. 

However I was talking to my sister and she told me it would be selfish and weird to “just show up with my new wife” and not include my family in some sort of wedding ceremony. How it would break my mother’s heart for her to not be there. That a wedding ceremony was a way for family to come together and support the relationship and hold the people accountable. And while I understand this way of thinking, I don’t understand why there’s an expectation for my relationship with my girlfriend to end up as a “marriage.” I just want the woman I love to be close to me and for us to not have to navigate so many obstacles, legal and otherwise. I’ve talked to my girlfriend about it and she said she doesn’t feel the need for a wedding, as I said before. Our reasoning for getting married is that if having the “married” label attached to our relationship helps her coming her to live with me so we can be together, then that’s fine, but neither of us sees marriage as a step in our relationship that we have to get to. We just want to be together and spend our lives together. It’s not about getting married for either of us. We already consider ourselves “married” in a way. 

I’m kind of at a loss for what to do. All of these people are important to me but I’m seeing a wedding as an obligation and not necessarily something I need to do.",13Jul2020,1
5,"My roommate (21f), i’ll call her Sam, and i (21f) have made friends with someone (20f), I’ll call her Maddie, that lives two floors below us in our apartment building.
Sam and I both work (with masks on!), but other than that and grocery runs once a week, we are cautious of what we do and who we hang around. I personally have to go my grandfathers every day or every other day to help with day to day life and help make his life easier. I wear a mask there, and worry about passing it to him. Sam understands this so she’s careful about what she’s around like i am so we don’t pass it to my grandfather. Maddie goes to parties multiple times a week, works at a daycare, and never wears a mask unless at her job. She is not cautious about who she’s around. She told Sam and I that we had to get tested because she wanted us to so she doesn’t have to and told us we have to wear a mask if we want to be around her so she doesn’t have to. 
Maddie told us that at her daycare, child’s parents got tested and it came back positive and that the child was never tested. Then changed her story the next day and told us that the child’s parents actually never tested positive, then changed it again and said no one ever got tested. She couldn’t keep her story straight. She then got tested for Covid-19 on a free testing day and claimed that it actually was the antibody test and not the swab like originally claimed and she tested positive and says she can’t catch Covid-19 now because she apparently already had it. Everything about what she’s been saying has been fishy to me and making me uncomfortable to be around her during this time due to the uncertainty of her state of health. 
Sam and I go hang out on our friend’s porch. I’ll call this friend Kenzie. Kenzie lives alone and quarantines aside from only hanging with us and going to work with a mask and groceries. So we feel safe being around her, and only hanging out outside where there’s space. Maddie will see us outside through her window and come down and hangout with us.
None of us feel comfortable hanging around her for the time being. We don’t want Covid-19 and don’t want to pass it to anyone. We need help deciding how to tell Maddie, as kindly as possible, we don’t feel comfortable being around her right now. Thank you in advanced!",13Jul2020,1
6,"Hi everyone, I'm facing a difficult situation, and although I'm not directly involved, It does concern and affect me. I was hoping to get an unbiased outside opinion and some guidance on this. I don't really go on reddit often but I hope this is the appropriate place for this. It's a long post so please bear with me.

So a bit of background about my friend - (I'll call Ben) he has always been a bit of an odd duck, and he also seems to gravitate towards woman that are bad for him (cheat, manipulate etc). He is a bit of a wild card outside of a relationship. Ben is unpredictable, outgoing, a bit chaotic. But he has a lot of good traits aswell, like kindness and loyalty. The issue is that every time he gets into a relationship it's like his entire personality changes to fit whatever the girl wants, and he becomes a bit of a doormat. He always brings his current girlfriend into the group, which is a good thing for the most part, as having a good friendship with your friends girlfriend is always a plus, and most people are welcomes in our friend group. Ben does take this a bit far though, and we never get him alone now. It's kind of a package deal, that if he comes, she is there too.

A bit of background on his current girlfriend (I'll cally Katy) of over a year. At first she seemed really nice, if anything a bit too friendly. She was outgoing and bubbly, and would try and get to know everyone in the group intimately. She seems to thrive on attention and enjoys the spotlight a bit. It could be a bit overwhelming at times, but most of us didn't have a problem with her hanging around with the group. She shares a lot about herself, and told us all about how abusive her ex-boyfriend would be, and the horrible things he would do to her. Upon hearing these things, mine and everyone else in the groups default inclination is to sympathize with and support her, as I've never met anyone who would fabricate such things.

However, the past 6 months, Katy has been causing a lot of unnecessary drama, and discomfort in the group. She has accused a lot of our friends of terrible things and rubs a lot of us the wrong way. I won't go into too much detail, as there's a lot. I'll try and present the facts, and also give my opinion. However, I am conflicated on a lot of this and don't know what to think. Please ask for more detail if you need it:

* Katy accused one of my friends of cheating on his current girlfriend with no proof.
* Katy has accused my best friend of punching her in the face while we were out at a bar. It was a very public place, and there were multiple witnesses that saw nothing. I have been friends with the guy since I was 5, and have never seen him be violent with anyone, he's like a big teddy bear! Ultimately, i believe this is untrue, or at the very least a massive exaggeration of events.
* Katy has accused a friend of assualting some girl. I don't know the entire situation admittedly, but Katy was telling everyone who would listen about ""what she heard"". I think that ultimately my friend was trying to hit on the girl (and failing) but no assault took place, and something small got turned into something extreme. The girl he was hitting on eventually had to come out and defend my friend before the allegations got out of hand.
* We were at a small house party, and one of my friends was pretty wasted and being annoying. He was being a stereotypical drunk, being clumbsy and spilling drinks, and he ended up throwing up into the toilet. Happens to everyone from time to time I guess, so it wasn't a big deal, we'd just tell him to tone it down next time. The host (close friend of the drunk) wasn't too bothered so long as he didn't break anything. Katy took it upon herself to try and physically remove the drunk friend from the house against everyone's wishes. Next thing we know, she's having a panick attack and screaming/crying on the ground. Only a couple friends had witnessed this, and said that the drunk friend never hit her, but was trying to stop her from pushing him out the flat. Everyone ended up just leaving the flat after that and the night was pretty much over. Once again, I don't really know what to think about this.
* Katy has accused Ben of hitting her. I've never known this friend to be violent with women. He can be unpredicatble, but it doen't fit his characterat all (he is kind hearted and loyal to those close to him). I don't know what to think about this, but with everything else going on I find this hard to believe.

It does hurt me, and I feel very guilty about casting doubt over all these accusations. I know a lot of women struggle to be believed over similar issues, but in these cases I just don't trust her. Am I in the wrong here? All of this happened before lockdown, and over lockdown most of the group have just avoided the issues (I assume they don't really know what to do either). It's only really came up as an issue again recently as we were starting to meet up again. We were at a small backyard gathering last week, hosted by one of the group members. Another small group meeting happened a couple weeks prior, but it was just a few guys, so we had Ben there aswell and it was fun, although Ben left early. We had an excuse not to invite Katy as it was a ""boys only night"". This week however, girlfriends were invited so we had no excuse. I wasn't aware until we were at the friends house that Ben didn't know about the gathering. I felt bad, and Ben was hurt by this and our friend (the host) and Ben ended up getting in an argument over text. The host seemed to come up with excuses as to why he wasn't invited but never told him the real reason. It was because noone felt comfortable with Katy being there.

It's horrible to hear that about a loved one, which is why it's so hard to tell him. It was wrong that he wasn't invited, but none of us know what to do. I don't think Ben would understand, and would cut ties to our group. He's been a dear friend since shool, and I value our friendship. I also believe that he needs our friendship and support. He has been struggling a lot lately, and I think Katy is quite manipulative towards him and is just making him unhappy in general. I think deep down, maybe he knows this too, but he's scared to end things. I'm at a loss and don't know what to do, but I believe that there's something that I should do to help. Do we confront him as a group and hope he listens? If so, how do we word it in a way that he actually listens and understands? Thanks for reading all of this.

tl;dr: friends girlfriend of a year has been causing a lot of drama within friend group and I don't know what to think about all of it. Should we be honest with him?",13Jul2020,1
7,"So back story, this girl and my girlfriend have been friends for years, and they also dated. And slept together on other occasions. She is someone my girlfriend talked about distancing from, because of her drinking issues and the fact she was having thoughts that she's attracted too my girlfriend still, and won't come around if she feels that way that day. The one instance that cemented my distaste for this girl comes later. One night me and the s/o go too a party and enjoy a night of music, at this party a mutual friend sexually assaulted my girlfriend. The next day as friends do she told her friend what happened. And the same day, she not only went over too the man who assaulted hers house too hang out. But also ended up sleeping together. Despite my girlfriend telling her of the events the prior eve. 



 So three weeks go by, and my girlfriend, out of the blue says she's going with her 10 hours away for a week vacation. I decide too tell her I feel its a bad idea, and that it makes me uncomfortable. She refuses too see anything wrong. I won't make her not go, as that's not healthy. But am I wrong too not want her too go?",13Jul2020,1

11,"My uncle is 64, he married into the family (married my dads sister). I’m a 17 year old male. 

When I visited him here are some things that happened 

- hit on waitresses multiple times that were in their late teens or early 20s and full on sexually harassing them (ex: he asked a Puerto Rican waitress “how do puerto ricans kiss?” While puckering his lips. 

- he has cameras in the house and found one pointed right at the bed I was sleeping it, after I told my mom and she brought it up he removed it. 

- he sat and watched the cameras and made fun of me for whatever was shown of me on the cameras even tho I didn’t do anything wrong (he did this all right in front of me)

- constantly told me over and over again how much women want his penis 

- constantly asked me “what are you, jacking off or something?” whenever I wanted to go to my bed. 

- he used to abuse his stepson emotionally when he was a kid and all throughout his teen years. He constantly bullied his stepson and making homophobic jokes towards him (even though he wasn’t gay) and went as far as to show up at him prom (around 1998) and told all his friends he was gay so they’d laugh at him even though it wasn’t true. He started doing the same thing to me by constantly calling me gay and straight up saying “bone_her_sauce likes it in the ass” and did it right in front of my cousin and cousins best friend while we went out to eat. He even went as far as to call me by his step sons name (the same one he emotionally abused). 

-He also wanted me leave a week early and go home and MADE ME pay for my own flight even though he was the one who wanted me to leave

- he constantly hits on my mother and even drove from Minnesota to Texas one year just to try and go out with her

15,"TLDR at the bottom. 

My older brother (M29) is in the middle of a serious existential crisis. He dropped out of two different educational programs and is now trying to work out what to do with his life. It’s been about a year since he quit his last job, and he has been living off his savings ever since, which have now run out. As a last resort he has now moved in with my mom, who hopes that he’ll figure things out while he lives there for free. 

However, he makes no real effort at this and is very upfront about not doing anything. We’ve tried to help him in different ways, but he has temper issues, is condescending and gets very angry, particularly at my mom, because she tends to get too emotional with worry. He doesn’t want to see a shrink again, or other expects who are qualified to help or guide him. He says he knows he has an issue, but just doesn’t want to deal with it. And that he doesn’t think he can get motivated before things get more desperate for him. But they are desperate. 

Today my mom said he couldn’t live with her free of charge unless he either gets a job, starts an education, gets professional help or applies for cash benefits (which everyone can get where I live, but it’s a very rough way to live), but it made no difference to him. He called her bluff, because he knows she is too worried to kick him out of the house if he has nowhere to stay. She insists that the very minimum effort he should put in is be nice to her and avoid fights, but again he can call her bluff on any consequences.

I’m very worried about both of them and slightly caught in the middle. My mom is getting so worried and is also stressed out about being yelled at all the time. She has had problems with stress before, and I really don’t want her to get hurt. I definitely side with my mom, but I also don’t want to ruin my relationship with my brother, who I love very much. I suspect he has a depression, but a doctor said he didn’t, and my brother agrees. There must be something wrong, however, it’s absolutely not normal behavior for a grown adult. He maintains it’s an existential crisis and a lack of motivation. 

I have no idea what to do. It’s really starting to affect me and my mom, and I know that my brother must be in such a shitty place. Is there a good way to tell him he needs professional help? I’ve hinted that he is causing my mom a great deal of stress, but I don’t think he understands how serious it is. 

Any advice would be welcome.

TLDR: My brother (M29) lives with my mom for free and refuses to do anything to get on with his life or get professional help. He gets very angry with my mom, who is anxious for him and wants to help. I think he has a depression or some other issue. How can I help him or my mom?",13Jul2020,1

18,"Currently live out in the middle of nowhere basically, don't have access to a car, but do own a bike. I am currently trying to get to a better fitness level to handle riding into town and back within a day without the use of what's technically an illegal motor attached to the bicycles, even though I've yet to be pulled over by law enforcement by it.

I have experience has a landscape photographer, tech with basic programming, web design, electronic repairs, and cashiering.

I also have residual damage in my joints due to prior injuries that prevent me from handling retail style jobs for long enough in a day to handle a job like that anymore of being on my feet for most of the shift.

Currently is about 28 miles each way to get to an area with a fair amount of jobs beyond just the typical gas station type job.

At home I'm dealing with people who are overcontrolling to the point they have made a situation big enough I had to quit the last full time job I had, and physically violent at times. Has a birthday gift, ended up in an argument with one person who also resides here about coming to me to move my bikes instead of doing it themselves due to proof that others have damaged them before and I just wish to prevent that by stopping whatever I'm doing to move the bikes for whoever needs to, ended up this person punch me in the face and gave me a bloody nose.

I’m en route to therapy and I’ve been on depression and anxiety cocktail. If there is a better sub then please let me know. 

Story: I have a good job. The family I keep in contact with are great and I had a fiancé I love(d). I was saving for a house and paying off school debt,adopted a dog and was doing everything the way we’re pretty much taught to. Unfortunately I was alone every night. For 6 years my fiancé was not allowed to stay with me, her family is successful and decent but followed the Bible to a tee. I was trapped in my own head for years while I worked from home 9 hours a day. I felt completely isolated but tried to suck it up. I was in constant pain. A few years into my “good job” I snapped.. I started drinking heavily. One very bad night I hanged myself from my ceiling and was told I was there for about 5 minutes before my family saved me. I checked into a medical facility when I was still pretty intoxicated. It was a huge nightmare, I’m a tortured person but many of my companions situations made mine pale in comparison. I didn’t feel safe in that place, I saw a large amount of bad things happen. 

My fiancé took care of me and my family did too. I’m a member of a church and the leaders wanted to help as well. Unfortunately I decided to take a trip across the nation and I felt free enough to end my relationship on the phone. She’s a great person and did great things for me, but could not be there for my physically in the past and in my worst state because the Bible said she couldn’t. Please know, I’m not innocent in any of this. I’ve done my share of damage but I truly feel I always made right with the ones I love. That’s what makes the next part here a bit harder. 

Fast forward to today. I see myself isolating from my friends and notice I blame them for my own mistakes. I believe I’m feeling/doing these things to protect myself from hurt. I’ve had to speak to my mother and father, sisters and brothers, all blaming themselves and saying that they’re always here for me. It’s been incredibly hard apologizing for hurting so badly and just wanting to stop the pain and further explaining it’s not their fault. Ultimately I never wanted to die. I just wanted everything to stop hurting so much. I’ve got a therapist I’m seeing and again the medicine. I suppose my main question is, from the outside looking in opinion what would you do? How would you move forward and what would you suggest for making things right for your family as well as yourself? I’m still working from home like many of us, I’m still trapped inside my head and the anxiety is unreal.",13Jul2020,1
20,"TW: molestation


I’m sorry this is kind of a long post, I just really need advice and don’t know where else to ask because my sister might see. 

When I was 6 my cousin pushed me into a closet,  closed the doors, and started doing things to me. My aunt found us and told my bio father (aka KP); they of course didn’t think anything of it because we were just kids.

Flash forward to 16 and my cousin took things up a notch throughout the years. Because of him, I’m disgusted by feet and afraid of the dark. When I tried to tell KP about what was happening to me, he took my door away and said that it was experimentation and it needed to stop (again, never once giving me the benefit of the doubt or believing that I was the victim).

I’m now 27 years old and have been in and out of therapy for various reasons, one of them (obviously) being my cousin and the things he did to me. I’ve told my sister (now 20) several times throughout the years (once she was old enough to understand) what our cousin had done to me. I’ve left out major details she didn’t need to know but she knows enough to understand. 

She says she’s sorry for what’s happened but that it doesn’t affect her relationship with him and that she still wants to see him and spend time with him. She says it isn’t fair for me to ask her to end their relationship and stand in unity with me. My whole life I’ve been ignored and treated like a liar, and my own sister doesn’t even care enough to stop talking to the one person who ruined a big chunk of my childhood.

I don’t know what to do. I just need to know if there’s something I’m missing or if I’m being selfish for wanting her to be on my side.",13Jul2020,1

So I work in the meat department in a grocery store chain as a meat cutter/butcher.

Wasn’t serious but I ended having to get seven stitches (four in my index and three in my middle finger) and the doctor told me not to use my hand for anything at all, no matter what. I was pretty much told that I was gonna get put on light duty and just stuff back on the shelves all day. And whenever an employee gets put on light duty they receive a pay cut for the duration of the time that they are on light duty. So my work place automatically files worker’s compensation for any employee accidents that happen when the employee is clocked in.

Lots of complicated issues there. I can’t fathom living with them any longer. Even if my dad let me go back, I wouldn’t want to.  
I moved in with my mom, but I just can’t imagine living here very long. It’s also a rather unhealthy environment here. It’s 30 min away from my town as well. Away from my school, friends, and work. I don’t drive either. I don’t have a room nor bed here, I’ve been here about 3 months, but I hate it. It’s depressing, in a bad area, I have no family on my moms side either, so it gets lonely. 
I’ve told my boyfriend (18/m) about all this as well and he says that if we both got jobs, he would want to move in with me into a small studio if I really feel like I can’t live like this any longer. He was really serious when he was saying all that, and now that’s all I think about. It would be my escape. But I just don’t know if that’s a good idea. 
For starters where I live and go to college, I can’t find a studio under $1000. We could make it work if we really wanted to, but we’d have to work a lot to cover all of our expenses, and I don’t want us to do poorly in school. 
I don’t know what to do about it. I could stay at my moms, but I’ll be depressed and can’t see my friends or anyone often since I don’t drive and I’m so far. And I can’t work towards my license either since the dmvs aren’t taking appointments due to COVID.

My boyfriend always tells me nothing would happen and that I'm fine but I'm just always in a state of fear.

Recently, I found out I'm pregnant (18w) and apparently it got back to him. My friend said he was invited to a party that my ex was in when someone told him. The first thing my friend said to me was ""he wants to kill the baby"" and I said ""what?!""  for him to clarify ""well I dont know for sure, he just said 'it's a disease and it needs to be killed' and he sounded really upset"".

What do I do? I'm already always afraid and now I hear 3 years later that he wants to kill the baby? He very well could just be mad and ""jealous"" like some people have said and was just trying to blow off steam but I'm still not okay after what he did to me, and now I just feel like his target all over again. Realistically, maybe hes not stupid enough to actually act on it. Maybe he'll never see me, I dont know.

36,"I’m working with some dedicated staff to build a wiki and am at the very top. We have a lot of staff, many of which do nothing, and there is an overly steep workload increase going up the ranks. To get what we need done at an acceptable pace (keep in mind we do this in our free time), it would take probably two people spending a dedicated few hours per day, or five each spending an hour per day, or ten barely doing anything each. That last one is optimal, right? Having the load stretched out between hobbyists rather than me and P breaking our backs?

We get a bit of staff coming in and have a balance as follows (approximately):

3 of us as admins doing about 50-70% of the heavy lifting

A mod doing a further 10-30%

And about 15 juniors doing 5-20%

What we really want is for these plentiful juniors to rise through the ranks and/or contribute some more each to the project, but most of them are idling, wearing ‘staff’ as a badge of honour rather than a responsibility. Not bad on their part, don’t get me wrong, but it would be nice if they did more.

Right now I’m stumped as to how to get these guys motivated and helping out more. I have close to zero experience as a manager and am serving as the lead staff manager for the whole team. Given this, it would be nice to get some answers from people who know how this shit works.

1. Is it even bad that 4 of us are doing most of the work rather than the lot of us?

2. We have a ‘teams’ system, with a lot of them overlapping. I moved away from delegating specific duties to certain helpers because they are simply not reliable enough to lean on. Uhh ... what do we do with this?

3. Where are we going wrong with the helpers that they aren’t very dedicated? Should we be more selective when recruiting and going through the applications process? Or maybe have a higher staff hold their hand for the first few days?

Gonna stop doing these numbered point things because I’d rather a wall of text explaining what we’re doing wrong and how to fix it than just these.

If you need more info give me a poke.

Keep in mind that these are all hobbyists doing this in our free time. We don’t pay the helpers. We can’t expect them to divulge loads of effort into the project.

37,"Hey r/Advice,

Unsure how to go about this, so here we go.

I had (Have?) a friend called J. 
J and I get along pretty well, but there were complications to our friendship.

One: A money dynamic. I make significantly more than J, and at one point I was paying for all meals/movie tickets/entertainment. I don't mind paying, as J has extremely limited funds. But at some point, I guess I became a bit of an ass about it. J was unwilling to find a job or supplement their income, and was relying on friends for money. I resented always being the one paying for J. This went on for years, and most of J's friends have cut J out for similar reasons.

Two: J has repeatedly called me and told me they wanted to commit suicide. Each time J is confronted with this, J will say ""Oh, I feel better"" or ""Oh, I didn't really mean it."" I honestly feel like this is attention grabbing and extremely frustrating.

About 8 months ago, I ghosted J. Immature, I know, but I can't say no when J asks for things. I can't set boundaries without feeling selfish.

I still feel guilty over this, but I'm unsure just how to say ""J. I just don't want to deal with babysitting you."" Without being a dick.",13Jul2020,1

The music, the fashion, internet culture, the general vibe, sub-cultures. But the culture that I see emerging now with the adolescent seems better and I'm phasing out of it. I'm 24 and old. My bones are getting brittle. But worse of all I'm not cool.

That was meant as a shitpost. Anyways, yes, how do you cope with getting older and feeling ""less relevant"" because we live in a neotenous culture and you're not part of the generation that's in the spotlight anymore?

Don't get me wrong, my life individually speaking has only gotten better the older I got, but I sometimes get sad that I'm getting older. Mainly because I'm envious of their culture.

I went back to live with her went the pandemic started, she convinced me saying it would be safer and cheaper for me to go back and live with her. Ironically 3 months later we are both Covid-19 positive and not very happy dealing with each other. She says she slapped me because I talked back to her while I was trying to explain to her I don't have asthma right now.  She is always panicking I can feel bad or that we both will die. FYI I am asymptomatic  so I don't have any symptoms nor feel bad, while her she is getting better but she has pneumonia. 

My mother is a very emotional person and all this pandemic as made her incredible paranoid and easy to panic. While I am concerned I try to stay calm.  The doctors have told her she will get better but she needs to rest and that's almost the entire opposite of what she has done. She keeps talking, walking and getting upset for anything, and using her sickness as an excuse. She has told me before ""don't you understand I can die any moment?"" . And trust me she is sick but she is not that sick as I and all doctors have seen.  Anyways because I am asymptomatic  every day she keeps asking me if I feel ok , I always answer that I feel fine and she insists on asking me again, and says that I should't hide anything from her. Then I get upset and answer that I feel fine, I am not lying. 

So today I woke up and told her I had a symptom at 3 am but I feel fine right now and she started bombing me with questions and giving me this disdain look. I told her to calm down and that I am ok, and she screamed and slapped me. Then I left the room and haven't left my room because I don't want to talk to anyone.

Not entirely surprising because she uses it but then she then went on to state that there was ""literally no actual reason to ban it and that they are only doing it because some kids on tick-tock made fun of Trump"".

At this point I didn't really care that this conversation started because of TikTok, I was just trying to get her to understand that people getting a hold of your data is bad and there are plenty of reasons already why our two countries would go to war but she just kept calling me a bloodthirsty, racist moron. I'm honestly at a complete loss.

46,"Okay so.. my girlfriend is not all that comfortable driving to my home and usually drives short distances to and from work. When she drives over to my home get anxious and bad thoughts waiting for her to make it over and wanted to get an iphone to see her location in the case something were to ever happen because she has an iphone. I trust her and wouldnt snoop on her but I would just use it in to relieve the stress of thinking about her drives over. Usually I drive her around and I cant keep doing all of the driving as I believe she needs to gain the confidence she needs to drive where ever she would like as she is very anxious and shy. 

My main point is that I wanted to get an iphone to see her location should she ever have a car problem or worse. I care about her alot and recently I have been having this deep fear when I know shes driving over yet I am also frugal relatively speaking and have a pixel 3 (robbed on that deal) and wanted to try and get the most bang for my buck as well as have the peace and mind that she is okay.

When we drive she is okay but her lack of confidence just has me thinking the worst and I try to be cheap and hold on to my phones for as long as I can and have had my pixel since december of 2018 and think it is way to soon to be switching phone as I always get them unlocked so I can use a cheaper pre paid service and my expense sheet says I would want to switch by 2021 because there will be no more updates for the phone and security could be jeopardized at that point and most importantly I get my moneys worth out of the phone.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR

47,"I found out I was pregnant Friday night.I’m 41 and this wasn’t planned, I don’t know how I feel about it. I’m old. . My bf is 35 and always wanted a kid. I’m terrified. There are a lot of risks. I told him.He went on a camping trip with his friends. He’s super happy, yet he didn’t offer to come home even though he knew I was freaking out. Tried calling and texting him all day. No answer. Just finally got a text saying he got his phone wet. And he will be home tomorrow (Monday) I feel like it’s pretty crappy to leave me hanging dealing with these emotions myself while he goes and hangs out with his friends. I don’t want to tell any of our fam/ friends yet, so I kinda need some emotional support this weekend, at least my dog was here... Really scared if this is how it’s going to be. I already feel like I have all the responsibility and he just does whatever he wants but then makes me feel crazy when I say anything. I don’t know what to do. I have a really physical but well paying job. He’s currently unemployed. I don’t know what’s going to happen financially if I have complications and I don’t know I can rely on him for anything. We’ve been together 6 years and I let a lot slide because I just handle whatever, and overall he’s a good guy, just kind of like a man child and a little selfish. I really don’t know how to feel or what I should do. I’m scared shitless. Any advice welcome. Thanks.",13Jul2020,1

50,"I know that this isn't exactly the time to be worried about this, but lately I think about it constantly.

I'm 20f and I've never dated anyone. Still a virgin, too. During my high school years till now I never really received that much male attention at all. I'm skinny, relatively in shape, and work out, so I don't thiiink that my issue was physical appearance, but I am painfully shy and keep to myself, which I suspect might have made me unapproachable. Regardless, I have no perspective on how to handle myself in a relationship or what a partner might expect of me.

This never bothered me before as I have a very avoidant personality, but as I've gotten older I've seen my friends date and started to think about how nice it would be to be in a relationship myself. My solution for this was to make a tinder account (maybe not that smart but I don't know where else to meet people). I've tried it a few times over a year or so, and I find myself in this cycle of matching with someone and either ghosting them completely or sending a few messages and then ghosting.

My problem is, as soon as the possibility of actually getting to know a guy comes up, I start to think of myself, and who I am, and start to panic because I know that they won't like me anymore once they get to know me. I'm a nerd, my main hobby is making art in an anime art style, I still live at home and my room has a shelf full of manga and figures, I have posters up from some video games I like. I'm cringe, essentially. Don't get me wrong, I have other interests, I love hiking and fitness and traveling too, it's not like nerd stuff is the only thing I talk or think about or anything, but my nerd interests make up such a large part of my identity that its hard to ignore. I just can't imagine some normal guy getting to know me and finding out how embarrassing I am and still wanting to date me after. Therefore, I will just ghost him so I won't have to deal with the rejection later.

So, I guess what I want to know is, what can I do to get over my fear that my interests will keep me from dating? Should I try to start minimizing this aspect of myself or is it more accepted than I realize? Thank you all for reading and for any advice that you can give, it's really appreciated.",13Jul2020,1

I asked at least 10 times if she was drunk or had anything consumed and she denied all of it. Eventually I left after confiscating the mower. 5 minutes later I heard it start from my window and raced back outside. While I yelled about how this was dangerous and I felt betrayed, she rolled her eyes, laughed, and couldn’t keep a straight face through it.

53,"My boyfriends parents are strongly opinionated, we don’t agree with their opinions, we are threatened to be kicked out

I have been living with my boyfriend at his parents house for roughly two years. This year alone has been stressful for the family in many ways. Recently there has been more disagreements between myself, my boyfriend and his parents in relevance to controversial issues - primarily Black Lives Matters. They are very against the moment and respond “but what about white lives?”. Basically diminishing the problem. Both myself and my boyfriend avoid talking about these things because they only ever end up in heated arguments. However his mom tends to bring up the subject now and then.   

The other night he went to get a bowl of cereal, then she started talking about BLM once again. My boyfriend, once again, stated his opinion, but she was not satisfied that he disagreed with her. She talked about his generation being “too sensitive” and that people of this time are basically fucked for the future because they never had to deal with difficult things. So my boyfriend felt that she was indirectly telling him that his opinion isn’t good enough since she is older and has expierence and that HE is  fucked for the future. He didn’t want to continue the conversation because he knew exactly where it was going (a fight) and said “I don’t really want to talk about this right now, it’s late. Can we talk about this tomorrow?”.Nope she wants to talk about it right now. He says “Can you tell me how you think I think about these things?” And says things along the line of “You resort to social media quickly and when you see a lot of people going along with an idea, you follow them, and (once again) those people are FUCKED for the future” This is absolutely not true about him. He puts time into researching and will never agree with something until he knows the facts. He was clearly upset but held it in. He said “do you think I’m stupid?” Since she was comparing him to those in his generation. 

She got VERY angry and upset and basically told us that we need our stuff moved out. That he doesn’t appreciate anything because he doesn’t pay any bills. So he should learn the hard because because she feels that he “always wants to take shortcuts in life and find easier ways”. Small backstory:

(I have lived lower middle class my whole life. My boyfriend has first handily seen my struggle with this and respects me a lot for it. He definitely appreciates the privilege he has because he is well aware his life has been pretty easy, financial-wise)

I’ve known her for 4.5 years and have spent A LOT of time with the whole family. She angrily referred to me in the conversation as “your girlfriend” and it made me feel upset that she couldn’t even use my name. She calmed down and said things like “I care about you, I’m on your side, there’s nothing I wouldn’t do for you on this planet...”that kind of stuff. She even offered him a $25 Home Depot gift card after all of that. A GIFTCARD??? And said that we can stay. This isn’t the first time we have been threatened to be kicked out, because we have a different opinion.

The next day she asked if he wanted anything from a coffee shop and wanted to take him out to dinner. In my opinion, this feels like manipulation. She blows up from him not agreeing with her opinion, wants to kick us out, doesn’t give him a single chance to speak up, tells him that he doesn’t appreciate the money they have spent on him, reiterates repeatedly that she cares about him then is trying to offer him things of monetary value in the end. Isn’t that part of what she was arguing about? That he doesn’t appreciate the value of money??

She was EXTREMELY upset that he said “Do you think I’m stupid?” but my boyfriend never expressively got upset with her for all the things she said about him. He definitely feels that he should be much more upset with the situation than she is. The offerings feel like she’s trying to “buy” him back. 

We have been staying the past two nights at my moms house and she keeps calling him asking how he’s doing and why he’s spending so much time up with my at my moms house. We are planning to move in with my mom to help her, but we are very aware that the conversation between us and my boyfriend mom isn’t going to go well. She will likely be angry and upset that we are leaving because of the constant fighting. 

Any advice on how to approach this conversation? Help help at all is appreciated. We are both very stressed out about this.",13Jul2020,1

57,"3 weeks ago my Dad was arrested for domestic violence. He has been abusive to me(M18), as well as the rest of my siblings and mother for as long as I can remember. And I mean physically, verbally and emotionally. When the police arrived on our doorstep because my neighbour had called them after she’d heard noise of screaming kids coming from our house, I thought this would be the end. That I would no longer have to spend my life in fear that I would be beaten up for the tiniest mistake I dared to make, verbally abused and threatened and witnessing my mum being hit and crying all the time. However, this feeling only lasted a while. It turns out that even after all the evidence, proof and statement we had given to the police against my father, he has been released and no longer on bail and can now return home. When I heard the news, I almost felt like fainting. He came around today and sat us all down and started yelling about how we snitched on him and how the police showed him videos from their body cams on all the things we had said about him and how scared we were. ( I didn’t even know this was legal for the police to do??? This was the most vulnerable we’d ever been and I thought the body cams was only there for them see or some sort of protection. The fact that they showed it to him completely pisses me off because I told them not to tell him about anything we had said, only for them to do the exact opposite.) He said he was really disappointed in us all, especially me for reasons I don’t understand and I suddenly feel this heavy guilt on top of me. He walked out and said he’d be back tomorrow. Right now I don’t know how to feel about any of it and I am quite scared. I’ve been crying a lot for the past hours and it’s only now I’ve decided to write this.

61,"So a family member of mine has a big position at X workplace. Previously I was working as a cook at a small fast-food chain. While out of college and as Covid hit I was out of a job for a while. Once I was able to work I didn't get many benefits from my job. I then chose to work at place a relative of mine was also working at (I took one of the lowest positions, I really wasn't getting any benefitsvfrom having a family member running the place. Latter on I took an internship at the same place(it's been about 3 weeks now) but I just don't really like it. Not only am I not interested in the work I'm doing but I also feel that I got this job because of how I had a relative as a higher up. Now I really just want to drop the internship and move on to a different job but if I were to do it now I feel like it would harm my relatives reputation. How do I go on about this? College will be starting back up in  mid/late August so I can't quite make an excuse to cut the internship short. I've also tried to find a different job but not a lot of them pffer a lot of money ($17). Even if I were to find a good excuse to quit the internship early, I'd still have to give a 2 weeks notice. I guess what I'm really asking is, is there a way to cut a internship early, and not harm a family members reputation, while at the same time being able to leave as quick as possible?

Info: the internship is basically me helping someone organize information, there is a lot of it, and I'd basically be done once all the stuff is organized, so there is no specific end date.",13Jul2020,1
62,"So let me paint the story... I work in a manufacturing plant as a lead engineer (I over see pretty much all of the products and quality on the line, making me the go-to person for a lot of things). So, the area that I work in is smaller but we are growing, but on the production side of things at the plant, I am the only female engineer. 

That being said, there is a new production supervisor that started that I have become good friends with. I had to pull double duty for 8 months on the line being the production supervisor and lead engineer over the operators since our old one got a new job, so I am essentially his go-to person and with both of our jobs we spend a lot of time together on shift troubleshooting issues. 

Well, here is the kicker, apparently his wife has a problem with me, more so, she has a problem that the production supervisor has my cell phone number and that we talk outside of work. 

When I say that, I mean talking about the line, or things like “don’t forget to remind me to do something at work”. Every so often we have a bad shift and send a stupid meme to each other. That is all. Just friendship. He moved here alone without his wife and kids to take a better job, a better opportunity for him and his family, and since we work in the middle of nowhere, I thought I was being nice to make sure that he knew someone here. That and we go to different buildings at work and we don’t have company phones, so I have most of my coworkers personal numbers in case they have to reach me or I them. 

Anyway, so apparently he had a big fight about his wife where his wife doesn’t trust him around me even though he’s in his mid-forties and I’m in my mid-twenties and she wants him to end our friendship and evidently him to stop talking to me... even at work. He even showed her all of our text messages and IM’s at work and she is still going nuts thinking that there is something there that is not. Also, note that I have never in any shape or form, met his wife or talked to her and I have never done anything with the production supervisor that would even cause worry about there being something more there. 

So, I guess my question is, was I in the wrong for extending my hand out to a coworker, trying to train him for his job and be friendly, supporting him? I honestly thought I was just doing my job and trying to be nice... so I guess, does anyone have any advice about this situation or have gone through something similar?",13Jul2020,1

66,"Hi, new to the sub andcame here seeking advice because I honestly don't know how to feel about this. 

For context I'm a 21 year old male and a citizen of the US(though I'm sure a number of you what I figured that last one out after reading the post). As a result of the recent rising tensions in the US and some of the things that have happened within the last few months, political discussion has somewhat become center stage at family dinners and this is mainly how this conversation even happened. Surprisingly enough these conversations are fairly tame and it's kind of sad we had such a heated debate over tick-tock of all things. Considering that's the linchpin of the entire debate I won't be giving you guys a transcript but rather I'll just summarize it.

So today while my family was eating dinner the topic of the potential ban of tick tock in the US came up. Trust me when I say talking about that was perhaps one of the last things I wanted to do today. Regardless it came up and my sister voiced her disapproval of the action. Not entirely surprising because she uses it but then she then went on to state that there was ""literally no actual reason to ban it and that they are only doing it because some kids on tick-tock made fun of Trump"". When I told her the reason they were actually considering it was the potential for tick-tock users to have their data leaked and collected by the Chinese government and that this in turn could allow them access to one's email address and bank account she completely dismissed my claims. 

She said ""it doesn't matter if they collect people's data, only teenagers with no money use it"" going on to say ""what are they going to do look through my emails? They can have my data, it's not a big deal"". My dad and I both attempted to get her to understand the potential implications of a foreign and fairly hostile entity like China collecting data on US citizens could have, especially if it became the case that our country's found themselves at war but she wouldn't have it and even went on to state ""there's no reason for us to fight at all, a war will never happen"". At this point I didn't really care that this conversation started because of TikTok, I was just trying to get her to understand that people getting a hold of your data is bad and there are plenty of reasons already why our two countries would go to war but she just kept calling me a bloodthirsty, racist moron. 

I'm honestly at a complete loss. It was bad enough that I couldn't get her to understand a single hacker, no less a fucking country collecting yours and other people's data is really bad but also that her perception of the world somehow made it impossible for a scenario like a war with China to happen. I don't know what to do, is there ANYTHING I can say to get her to understand and care about her data or should I just leave it be?",13Jul2020,1

68,"So we recently found that there was at least one baby bunny living in our backyard. Unfortunately, it passed away, we believe because it left it’s patch of grass and sat out in the open heat. We live in central Missouri, where in the summer, temperatures regularly exceed 90 degrees. We found it laying on its side out in the open grass. It was pretty vocal when it was alive, but we haven’t seen any others. Is it likely that there’s more?

We’ve seen an adult rabbit around the area, possibly the mother, so as far as I know, if there’s a nest, it hasn’t been abandoned. 

For reference, we first found the baby rabbit in a very thick patch of grass we have surrounding an overgrown garden bed. It is very dense, and very possible that the nest is somewhere in there, since we haven’t seen it. 

Again, is it possible or likely that there more, despite us having not seen any? We are currently in the process of hiring someone to come and fix up our yard, the disastrous conditions of which probably prompted the rabbits to move in.

We're all pro-pot (even though we're not in a legal state) but 3 of us don't have any intentions of doing any more than that. Over the past year, the 4th friend in our group has been experimenting with more drugs with his other group of friends, mostly psychedelic stuff, but more recently cocaine.

He talks about it often, has lost an unhealthy amount of weight from it, and more recently has started showing up to hang outs (online and a few in person meet-ups) while still high. He feels more distant and aloof to us. We're all worried about his usage and think the company he keeps is only worsening the problem. Most of his other friends are still in college and are all involved in a fraternity, so drug culture is super normalized with them. We're also worried he'll start other, possibly more dangerous, drugs if he keeps up with this.

81,"tw: possible sexual assault

I had been panning to have sex with this guy for a few days. By that I mean we had talked about hooking up. One day, I went over to his house (WITH THE INTENTIONS OF HAVING SEX). I was already drunk when I arrived. At his house, we smoked a little and I drank a lot more (he drunk too but not as drunk as i was). I remember starting to make out with him, and giving him head. It's kinda fuzzy though.

I woke up and my friends were there bc he'd called them for help - I had passed out and there was vomit everywhere (from me. i also do not remember throwing up)

He told me we had sex but I don't know if I just can't remember it or if I was not awake. I don't remember having sex. I think we must have had sex while I was unconscious? But maybe I was conscious and I lost memory of it due to how intoxicated I was?

I heard it's supposed to hurt the first time you do it but I def don't remember any pain.... was I raped? This was earlier in the year. I'm confused and I'm not sure what to do, if anything. I don't really know how to feel.",13Jul2020,1

Such as talking to my crush, asking out a girl, going to college for the first time and a whole lot of stuff. They have recently broken. Growing up I didn’t have much so I got attached to my shoes and the same feeling of them. My parents told me to get new shoes because the white sneakers they got me are old, dirty and have broken. I feel so sad letting them go and just don’t want to throw them away. 

Can someone help me throw them away. I think it’s unhealthy to be attached to something. Maybe it’s the memories I have attached to them that hurt me. Not sure, feel a bit sad to throw them. This is probably really stupid.",13Jul2020,1

84,"Sounds like an easy question right? Just tell them. Heres my dilemma. 

I (18M) have been in a relationship with my girlfriend (18F) for the past 6 months. Her parents know about me and have met me because during the ongoing pandemic I have only been seeing her. My parents do not know about my girlfriend and I have been saying that I am visiting a male friend. I understand I am lying. I know this is wrong. I want to change and tell them. Not only have I really wanted to tell them about her she also wants to know them. I don't know how to do so.

1. My older sister, who is currently in med school, is in a relationship and my parents have become really involved with them. I don't want this to happen.
2. My parents are traditional South Asians. I am in an interracial relationship. I do NOT need their acceptance, but I am not sure how to approach this.
3. We are planning to go long distance. With the pandemic and different college conditions we have decided to attempt this.

Any advice on how to do so?",13Jul2020,1
85,"So currently I'm in a situation, I'll cut straight to it and just say two of my relatives are probably what u would call conspiracy theorists and they say they don't ""believe that Corona virus kills people"" for me this is hard cos I really don't know what to say back as it's so damn obvious it does kill, but they blame anything else and make dumb excuses. It's also hard cos I can't just say to them how retarded it sounds etc, and I don't want people saying how stupid they are,they are smart people but some things like this they just don't seem to be able to accept, I'd love some advice, facts or anything that could help me support the fact that it does kill. Just for example, good articles of death rates of previous years compared to this year.

Also, because they believe what they believe, they do things like say ""oh the death rates change because isolation has caused more suicide"". This sorta thing just goes round in circles and I just need something to really show them or even just slowly push and help them snap out of this idea that it's not real. I just need them to question why they believe what they do.

I'd love if people were respectful as possible as they are pretty close to me and we just generally keep this topic to the side. Obviously i know how blatantly silly it is etc and u don't have to make that aware in the comments hahah, cos yeah I do understand how stupid it is.

86,"Hey, so due to Covid-19 and the loss of my wife's job and a lot of my hours, we had to move into my mother-in-laws house. 

My wife and I have been together for 10 years, married 7 years and have a 7 year old son together, and for as long as we've been together she has HATED me. She is a hyper religious born-again evangelical christian and I come from a pagan background, although I consider myself agnostic as does my wife. She didn't mind me at first, but when she met my parents and realized they were pagan is when the hatred towards me began. It started out with small slights against me, but lately have become much worse. 

Being the parent of a 7 year old boy, I have to raise my voice at him quite often to get him to hear me or listen, especially when he's completely absorbed in his Switch. If I do so, she will be quiet around me but when my wife gets home, or she gets alone time with her she'll attempt to rat me out and make me look like I'm some big bad abuser. When my wife has to yell, or even spank his butt now and then everything is hunky dory, but when I barely raise my voice I'm an abusive asshole who she needs to leave. We kind of got used to it for a while until today. 

My mother-in-law went to church this morning and my wife, looking to see if there were any appointments coming up for her grandmother (which is a whole other story), went into her mothers room to check her calendar. What she found on the calendar though were hand written notes on every date that I did ""something wrong"". She got a little confused and annoyed at it and flipped back to the beginning of the calendar out of curiosity. She found that her mother has marked every day since we moved back in that she believes me to be abusive towards my son or my wife. This pissed my wife off. She was standing there just staring at it when she noticed a small notebook nearby and decided to have a peek in that too just to check.

The notebook dates back to her childhood and some of the stuff she found in it really freaked her out. Lines such as ""my daughter is the chosen one"" and ""my daughter deserves to be punished, and I know you'll punish her Lord"" are among a few. Now we're not sure what to do. I had to calm her down from approaching her mother with this information out of fear of being kicked out of the house. We're still trying to get back on our feet and get the heck outta here, but it's gonna take some time... But I don't think my wife will be able to keep her mouth shut forever. I'm just looking to see if someone else has been in a similar situation and how did you handle it?   


There is a ton of information I've left out because if I were to write it all down here then it would become a novel. I'll try to answer any question you have.

87,"Maybe I'm bein paranoid, but I study there and I hear some less than reputable things about the authority and I usually don't have great interactions with them either.  I don't know how to technology either.

I have a Samsung, and when I want to open a file it would ask me which app I should open it in. For example, I open a link to Reddit it would ask me whether I want to open the link in chrome or the Reddit app.

So I had a little period where I scroll through Chinese TikTok (douyin), and I want to amuse my mom so I download some of them. Sometimes it would take suspiciously long for a short video, but I'd just assume it was because of the quality of the video.  Shortly after this period, I noticed chrome was working a bit sloppy than usual, again I just assume it was because of the terabytes (I'm exaggerating) of videos I have downloaded.

But not long after my phone has gotten into the habit of asking me whether I want to open my QQ app or the ICBC app.

QQ is a Chinese social media app much like Facebook that I don't use, I only had it for convenience sake in China.

ICBC on the other hand is a bank in China.

It opens in the same manner how I described it would the Reddit link, but I see no real correlation between the two apps. I quit QQ years ago when people started using Wechat and it is not related to ICBC in any way.

88,"Okay so I need some advice about my best friend this is a pretty long story so bare with me here...So this story starts from when I was younger back when I was like in my teens I meet this girl in my neighborhood in like 2007 an I was her best friend for 4 years till 2011
When we were friends we hung out all the time every day pretty much an we always had the best time hanging out but then one day she started making up all these lies she claimed she knew Justin Bieber an dated him.
Online she pretended to be a girl who actually knew him an used to date him.
She also made up fake people as well including two guys who were into me one always wanted to meet an would always show up after I left every-time.
I later found out by mutuals that they were made up because she claimed they knew these guys an when I asked them they said they never heard of them...what kinda person messes with someone’s feelings like that?
She also pretended to be her own brother an catfished a friend of mine this girl has lied about so many things.
After Justin Bieber she claimed she was related to famous people like Ryan sheckler an josh turner..an this one haha wow she literally claimed her dad was Eminem an her mother went along with it like wtf? Her mom has claimed that she has lots of mental problems like anxiety , Asperger’s, dyslexia, and schizophrenia but I’m not sure if I can even trust it since she’s lied so much an her mom has helped like what if that’s just another lie to cover for her bad behavior? Idk...
The last famous person she pretended to know was a YouTuber named jeydon wale she claimed he was her boyfriend an she stole his ex gfs pictures an pretended to be her an claimed she edited her pics to look different an she even dyed her hair black like her to look like her...
After that she just randomly ditched me one day for no reason an she told two of our mutuals that I was pretending to be her the girl she was pretending to be like how does that make any sense they were sisters an the older one believed her an the younger one believed me but she still ended up blocking me which I never understood after that a couple months went by an the older sister unblocked me an messaged me telling me I was right about her an that she blocked them as soon as they did what she wanted and blocked me so I forgave them cause I believe in giving people second chances an we got to talking about our thoughts on her an she told me that they witnessed her talking to her self on the two fake accounts she made of Jeydon and his ex gf. 
After all that happened over the years I always thought about her because she was my first best friend an like a sis to me I always felt betrayed and like I had done something wrong an why would she just abandoned me like that when we both felt like sisters it really messed me up an I could never fully move on and it was the start to my trust issues 
I never had any closure which sucked an the fact that she lives in the same neighborhood I literally had to see her almost every time I left the house an it made it hard having to see her constantly an reminded about everything 
Sooo Five years pass an I’m now 22 an she’s 20 now. one day I’m on my social an she became a recommendation on fb so i was like is that her? Cause she never showed up before over all the 5 years she had been gone so I went and did a whole joe Goldberg lol an looked an I found her insta which was private of course which led me to her tumblr I browsed it an found that she was claiming she’s train hopped an traveled all over an that she dated some guy from Colorado who’s a traveler 
I never believed any of it tbh.
So to the day we reconnected...
I was working at McDonald’s my first job an she would come in from time to time most of the time I just avoid her at this point in my life I was more moved on from the whole past shit I did still wish I knew why but wouldn’t anyone? 
One day they came in an I was cleaning the front table where they took the orders an they came up and she started talking to me which I never thought would happen again 
She claims that our mutuals talked crap about me an that’s why she left kinda thought that was a lame excuse but yeah then later she claimed that she thought everyone hated her 🤷🏻‍♀️
I’m not sure what to believe I really don’t trust her word
At first I just started texting her cause I wasn’t sure if I wanted to be her friend again all things considered but then she started getting pissy with me because I hadn’t hung out with her yet when she ditched me for 5 fricking years an when she saw I had hung out with two people she got mad an unfollowed me an pushed me into hanging out with her before I was ready.
So we hang out an things feel like we just picked off where we left off it was weird it felt nice hanging again even tho she probably didn’t deserve a second chance...
I don’t wanna make this story to much longer so I’ll sum up what has happened since we started hanging out 
She’s lied still on multiple accounts she acted like she didn’t know what Snapchat was when I’ve seen pics of her from snap... lies about having a fb 
She’s claimed to know all these so called people she’s traveled with
The guy she’s claimed to date from Colorado I found him an he said he’s never met or dated her 
Now she’s been talking about some guy she traveled with an she’s been stealing his photos an posting them on Instagram claiming to be her own which really makes me mad 
She claimed her dog had to be put down when that dog was perfectly fine 
An the so called day it happened I saw her an she had no emotion like she wasn’t crying or anything an from experience with one of my cats I bawled my eyes out
an they gave it to some guy an claimed he took it to be put down who has someone else put down a pet? That’s usually a family matter not some stranger she claimed it had a condition that made it aggressive but that dog was never aggressive when I was around an often times her mom acted annoyed of the dog an like it was to much work an she would always say the dog was stupid 
I honestly think they couldn’t handle it so they got rid of it they did the same thing with the rabbits they had they got tired of the work an just got rid of them and then they always end up buying new pets she has a new Guinea pig now 🙄
She also makes me feel shitty a lot like she rubs in my face that she has shit I don’t like items or social media gain like she’s trying to say she’s cooler or something? But then claims she doesn’t care about being cool🤷🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
An she always acts like she’s right about everything 
Also she asks me what I want for my birthday an then doesn’t buy me anything I asked for I’m grateful for any gift but why ask me what I want an then not buy me what I want? 
This one really pisses me off 
When ever we hang out we usually just do the same things we chill at her house an tbh I usually do that at home so when I go out I wanna do something like a walk or something I also wanna be more healthy an she knows this when I have walked with them tho they were kinda rude they walked fast cause they are more in shape an wouldn’t walk my pace an I had to struggle to keep up an I was cramping 
It’s better now but it was rude of them to do that to me when I was just starting 
Kinda got off topic but that’s another thing she’s done 
So we usually just stay at her house an she always wants to talk about tea but claims she hates drama lol an she also likes trolling people an I’ve seen her lead two guys on since we started hanging out 
But besides that the thing that pisses me off is when we hang all we do usually is stay at her house an do nothing really but chill an talk about tea about the people she makes up such fun 
An if we are lucky we go to a park or the river but it’s always the same places 
She always says she wants to explore an travel with me but we never go anywhere we’ve gone to the mall once which shocked me it’s all based on how her mom feels she’s so attached to her an is afraid to go out alone? She once asked her mom if it was okay to go to the park while she wasn’t home 🧐
we are now 25 and 23 she also gets paranoid over guys an didn’t wanna walk past a group of the most non threatening looking guys I’ve ever seen an then she thinks cars turning a certain way looks suspicious an I’m always like wtf?
An she claims she train hopped lol and knows all these random guys like sure...
But when ever I’m not hanging out with her she’s always going out every where exploring hiking trails and places around where we live an posts pics an she never invites me she always goes out an has fun when I’m not there an it really makes me feel bad an she asked me to go to a pumpkin patch once an then went by her self /: 
Even now with this virus going on she’s been going out still hiking apparently my parents think she’s lying tho
And one last point the guys she makes up now none of them have social media which is strange an I can never text them I have to talk to them through her an they are always busy an one of the guys she’s claiming to talk to is josh kiszka from Greta Van fleet an he apparently wants to marry her lol like sure the only ones she bothered to make fake accounts of was josh an the Colorado guy she “dated” lol 
An I’ve never called her out I’ve always stayed silent an watched her lie to my face 
I really would like opinions on this whole story an what should I do?
I know the most obvious answer is to not be friends it’s just hard cause she lives so close an the fact that even after everything I care about her she doesn’t deserve it but I care probably cause of that close bond we made all those years ago I just wish she’d be her normal self again but I know that will never happen.
Thanks for reading my long crazy story.

Side note: my aunt passed recently an all she’s cared about is her fake moving trip but I was there for her when she had two deaths in the family.. she’s fake traveling right now an it’s so annoying I’m so close to calling her out now cause she’s pissed me off..

91,"Hi all,

Here's  what we did: we are both home at our parents' due to the pandemic. We  wanted to order an item online, but for reasons I don't need to get into  we didn't want to risk our dad finding it so we ruled out having the  item shipped to our house. For some reason I cannot now fathom, we  decided that the best course of action was to have the package sent a  few doors down to our neighbor's house. This neighbor lives part time  out of the country, and has been out of the country for months and  likely will be for more due to the pandemic. Our older brother goes over  a couple of times a week to take their mail in and check on the place.  We figured that we could track the package and just take care to pick it  up as soon as it was delivered.

What  a stupid idea that did not go according to plan. My brother went over  with my dad this afternoon to take the mail in, and they found a package  (our package! which according to the apparently useless tracker hadn't  even been sent out for delivery), which they then took inside. My  brother took a picture of the box (with the shipping label) and sent it  to the neighbor to let him know that something had arrived. The neighbor  just said ""ok."" Adding to our stupidity, my sister thought it would be  funny to address the package to our neighbor but change the first name  to a certain fruit tree he has growing in his yard.

Now  this package is sitting inside our neighbor's doorway a few houses  down, he's been informed that something has arrived, and we don't know  what to do. That our dad was with my brother and so knows about the  package too is unfortunate as well. I've no reason to think that my  sister and I are suspected of having any connection to the package yet,  but I'm sure there is billing information inside that would point  directly to my sister. That said, the neighbor isn't expected to be back  for a while.

We both want the  contents of the box (my sister spent a not inconsiderable amount of  money on it) and for this dumb thing not to get back to us. *What do you recommend we do?*

This  might sound bananas, but we have a key to the place and we know the  package was set just inside the door. Do we just go over there and take  it? But then it would be pretty weird to everyone else if it just  vanished, and could reflect poorly on my brother (Unfortunately, his  being part of the solution is off the table). So then we thought, do we  slit open the bottom of the box, remove the contents (even put something  else inside), tape it back up, and leave it as we found it?

Or does my sister fess up to our neighbor?

This feels awkward and ridiculous and stressful - any advice?",13Jul2020,1
92,"I have a life decision to make that can make or break my career and relationship. I am going to give some back story before I tell you the pickle that I am in (or just skip to the third paragraph). I appreciate ANY advice or thoughts :) your the best. 

To start off, I am a rising senior in college double majoring in fashion design and fashion merchandising with a minor in marketing. Financially I am supported by my mother, I don't have any bills and she will pay for anything that will help me in my career. She is amazing and I don't want to take advantage of her at all! For my relationship, we are fully committed to each other unless of course, we need to go our separate ways one day (we are pretty open to each other and very honest). We got to the same college and live in the same hometown. We have a lease with my friends (2 girls) in my college town starting in August, it would be our first time living with each other! For my experience in fashion, I have a lot for my age in the industry (4 different internships adding up to 2 full years). Now for the pickle.

Currently, I am in LA interning for a small brand and one remotely, while taking an online class, and starting my own upcycling side business. As you assume all my classes this upcoming fall are all online which means I don't really need to go back to school. BUT! I do have a lease there and my partner is a nursing student so he has to go for clinical.  Also, if I don't go I wouldn't have access to all the equipment that I am paying for in my tuition. I want to create my own collection by May (to hopefully sell and create my own brand) and I would need the studio to do so. The problem is that I have an opportunity to stay in LA and intern for a brand I really like and I could live with the lady I am interning with now for $800 a month (even though I am working for her for free .-.). I am not sure if this new internship will be worth my while, or it could potentially be the best decision of my life.

**So, here's the question:** Do I stay in LA and intern for the cool brand while being a full-time student which could possibly open my career to anything! Or go back to college, focus on my school work, and senior collection while interning remotely for the lady I am already working for? I am concerned that if I stay in LA I will be burnt out quickly (since I'll be moving to LA after college also). I will be taking 5 senior-level classes while interning 3 times a week, and intern for the lady I would live with in my free time. I don't know if I would have time to work on my senior collection. Staying in LA could also impact my relationship negatively. If I go to college, I would be able to work on my senior collection all the time, focus on my school work, and relax a little more before I go into the industry full time.

TL;DR: I am a senior in college with an opportunity to live and intern for a brand in LA while doing school work remotely (full time) this could open up more opportunities for me, but I could potentially overwork myself and burn out. OR, I could go back to college to focus on my school work, senior collection that could potentially be my brand I create, and relax before I graduate into the industry. But, lose the opportunity to live/ intern /make connections in LA. Thank you in advance for any advice.",13Jul2020,1
93,"I’ve been a licensed engineer now for about 6 months (meaning I have worked 4.5 years).  In my first few years of my career, I have been working about 46-50 hours a week on a large number of projects for a big firm.  I get rewarded very well financially compared to peers at other firms.  Sometimes I enjoy the work, but I go through seasons of being sick of it, lacking motivation, etc.  I probably do 1/3 calcs, 1/3 drafting and other design processes, 1/3 task and project management and client management.  I’m in a civil/structural position.

For the past several months, those feelings have been intensifying.  I can struggle through a workday with zero motivation, frequent breaks, barely meeting deadlines, and then as soon as I log off I can work out, clean the house, research investments, etc.  In other words, I still have motivation when working for myself or with my hands, but my workplace motivation is sinking.

Has anyone in the community experienced similar feelings over a long period of time and ultimately decided to move on?  Or did you feel this way long ago and wish you had acted on it? 

The weird thing here is I studied and got licensed for this specific role.  A more extreme example would be a doctor quitting shortly starting their professional career.

96,"On mobile, please forgive formatting. 

I went to highschool A for two years but had to leave due to sexual assault reasons to attend highschool B for two years. I mainly found a community of people I loved at high school A. They were kind people and they had my back when I needed it. We remained friends when I left and they started playing D&amp;D as a hobby. After we all graduated, they got me into D&amp;D as well and my closest three friends and I have been playing for over a year together now. 

Recently someone outside of my three closest friends (but still a friend from high school A) started up a new D&amp;D game and my three closest friends were invited but I was not. (I had been invited to play by this person on a previous occasion.) I didn't really care too much, although it stings a bit someone I had played D&amp;D with before thought I wasn't a good enough player to invite into the game. I was invited into the discord server that it was being played in, but a few of the chat/voice channels were locked so I couldn't enter, and this is where the game really happened. It's labeled ""rpg with the BOYS"", so I kinda guessed it was just a boys club thing, because I'm a girl. 

Except because this D&amp;D game is going, the one of my three closest friends running the game that I am in, has decided to stop running the game for the time being. So... I don't get to play D&amp;D anymore, and throughout quarantine this was the only way we were hanging out. They don't really want to do group calls solely for us to hang out, either, or at least that was the vibe I got when I brought it up to them all. 

My boyfriend sometimes has to leave calls with me to go join this game, and I understand it, it just... Hurts. I haven't called them all in a month now. I was getting so obsessed with reading the messages that I could see within the discord server that I finally left it because it made me upset. I think I would have been fine if the game I was in continued, but it isn't, and I don't know how to deal with the feelings of dejection and being forgotten. 

It's all kinda uprooted previously dealt-with feelings of not belonging (that I had to go through when I needed to leave highschool A), and I don't know how to deal with it all. What do I do?

I heard that the loan doesn't have to be paid back if that's true. What are the advantages and disadvantages of accepting this loan? Will this affect my tax return amount when I file next year?

I genuinely feel like i’ve been “too nice” for the entirety of my life, and it ends up with people just walking all over me. It’s been happening since my childhood with everything such as friends using me for money, girls using me as a fall back option or even use me as someone to do their homework, etc. and im tired of it.

I think im this way because of my personality, which is very introverted. Once im comfortable with someone though, i become too dependent on their wants and needs rather than mine if that makes sense. Then i end up bending over backwards to do whatever others want of me and in some cases, i just make a fool of myself.

I was just wondering if there is anything i could do to maybe correct this? I don’t want to become a douchebag, but im just looking to find a happy medium.",13Jul2020,1
102,"note: I say I’m spoiled bc 
-I genuinely hate myself
-I understand that I am incredibly lucky to have my schooling paid for me since there are millions with debt
-when I write stuff out I feel like a whining little brat but I w been told that I’m not...

I am 26 and I live with my parent whom has practically given me everything. My degree paid for, my truck they surprised me with, and continued by letting me live with them. The only price was that I was to look after them alongside my older sister. (Chores, pets, maintenance, and other various jobs) which ended up being a double edged sword

What I didn’t realize growing up were a couple of things...
-you should really think about what you want for the future
-think things over (do I really want to be tied to a home bc of my puppies?)
-don’t make future decisions for the purpose of making your family happy
-I deserve to have a life...

Basically I went into my bachelor of education degree right after high school. I realize now I should have done more research and made sure but at that point everyone I knew was telling me to become a teacher and I really wanted to teach art/drama (not the case unless you are extremely lucky)

So I went into it. Life seemed fine I worked alongside my sister keeping up with everything. Then she moved out and suddenly practically  everything was  shoved onto me. Not only did I have to deal with that emotional roll (LOtS of drama surrounding it) I was about halfway through when I realized that I didn’t want to be a teacher. But I stuck with it bc 
-it was already too late and I only had two more years
-if I changed it would just make my parent mad.
-at least I could get respect for finishing in my field...right?  (spoiler no)

I used to be mad at my sister for doing the things she did that would cause trouble at home. Such as deciding to not go further into law school, and going out with friends as much as she could. But now I know why

Because I have barely any friends, stuck in a house that I’m constantly trying to keep up with, basically only a miracle can give holidays from it (not cleaning for a day is unheard of by the parent who doesn’t even consider it work) and with a degree that I’m not at all proud of, or get any respect for. A career that makes me stress the hell out even thinking about when it comes to a full time position (subbing now bc it is the best!) and out of all the money I saved bc the first year I used all of my savings to secretly help parent pay for their bills, and the second year COvID happened meaning I lost half a year of work and lived off of what I had for savings.

So I’ve decided to try and do something to help better my future and I had some ideas like taking some office administration courses while subbing this year (which I’m forced to sub this year bc of covid) and that way be on my way to get an administration job or something. I just want to hear what options I might have I terms of a career I can take if I find that teaching is unbearable?",13Jul2020,1

107,"Hey, 28M here.
Diagnosed with Tourette’s syndrome at 6, lived in madness for a long time until I got mostly on top of things in later life through a few different ways (no pharmaceutical medication).

Through times of stress I find my tics can accelerate, and certain ones cause me a fair bit of pain.
One in particular is this jerking head movement, where I literally throw my chin to my chest and back up in a whipping motion and it causes my brain to squish off the front of my skull. 
It’s violent enough that during my nightshift (theatre nurse) it triggered a migraine, which isn’t really new for me in the past, but I haven’t had a migraine for years until now.

My concern is, obviously with fighters, football players (generally any person getting hit with repeated strikes to the head), can cause dementia in later life to to repeated battering of the brain against the skull, and with the amount of time’s I have to play out this compulsion over the amount of years now I’ve had this specific tic (22), I am worried I’m going to end up with some form of dementia by the time I’m hitting my 60s. 

I’m reaching out to see if anyone has any knowledge on anyone in my position or any expertise in neurological issues that could give a little insight.

Thanks, Jamie.",13Jul2020,1
109,"I know this may seem like a stupid question but nonetheless I decided to ask it. So a couple years back when I played Minecraft I found this really nice guy that I began to play with all the time. We were both the same age and he and I became friends really quick and it was one of my first friendship that didn’t feel forced or out of place. It was probably the most genuine friendships I’ve ever had. Later, he introduced me to some more friends who were also really cool and we played together constantly. Fast forward a couple years and now I’m currently an upcoming sophomore in high school. I’m still friends with that guy but we don’t play as frequently and I’ve pretty much lost touch with everybody else. On top of that I don’t think I have any other genuine friendships in my life. Yes, I would be invited sometimes to hang out (before quarantine) but I was always the outsider of the group and always felt out of place. It may not seem like a big deal, but it was one of my “friend’s” birthday on June 23. So obviously I wished him happy birthday and he said thanks. Fast forward to June 27 and it’s my birthday. Not a single one of my ""friends"" remembered my birthday except for that one guy I met in Minecraft. I suppose that kind of served as a wake up call to me that I need new friends. Seeing as it’s quarantine and I can’t exactly make new friends in real life I figured I’d try to make friends online. But none of my attempts to make friends have ever felt as genuine. Sure we’d have a chuckle or two and we’d play for a bit but I wouldn’t contact them the next day and neither would I. I guess what I’m trying to say is that it feels incredibly forced and I don’t really know what to do. So I came to this subreddit for any help on the matter.

Honestly, I don’t know where this thing is going.

Recently I’ve just been questioning everything. I (15m) started talking to this girl and she’s the only one I feel this way about. Things just all went wrong and I don’t realize the point of anything anymore. Nothing ever seems like it lasts long. I expect too much of myself and I feel like I’m the only thing holding me back from having a ton of fun. 
I’ve questioned religion a lot recently. Because I’ve questioned it, I feel like there’s no end goal in life. I don’t know what I believe in anymore. I just feel like life is pointless. 
I’m rarely happy. I feel like I’m really only happy when I’m with people I care about but I don’t really have many of those people. I was at the beach a few days ago and made some friends on the last night, but everything just went wrong. I feel like the odds are always against me in every single situation. I just have no reason to push myself to do anything. All of my goals require barely any effort. Kinda weird, but my dreams are to find a girl that’ll stick around, serve my country, and be a mechanic. That’s not really much to ask for in my opinion. I don’t know why I have such small dreams, but they just don’t seem too hard to achieve. I can’t get my mind off this one girl and it sucks. We had stopped talking for about a month (I’ve known her for years) and I thought about her every single day. I just feel like there’s no point in life.",13Jul2020,1
113,"I've been internally questioning whether I might be trans for a while now. I was born a woman, and although I don't have body dysphoria or an overwhelming need to be a man, I've still started wondering. There are a few reasons as to why I've been questioning.

1. I've never felt inherently like a woman. I'm still young (20) and still I've never felt like I wanted to me feminine, or womanly at all. I say I'm a woman because it's my sexe, but I don't feel like anything at all.
2. I dislike women's fashion. Ever since I was a teenager, I envied men's fashion. The simple plain shirt (Even the shape of the shirts), and jeans. No complex high waist, or low waist, or mid waist, just jeans. I was also never stylish enough to be tomboyish or butch either, nor did I want to be. (Just not my style.) I've never been particularly into makeup either, part of me always felt as though I wasn't worthy of it.
3. I have a thing for bracelets. I don't know if it matters, but ever since I was a kid I loved men's bracelets. The braided leather, the colored threads wrapped together, and even the bulky watches. It might sound strange, but wearing those kinds of bracelets just make me feel a way. If I could pair that with a plain green man's t-shirt and jeans, then I'd look good.
4. This may sound odd, but I've always envied men's chest/stomach. The possibility of complete flatness. I like women, so it definitely isn't attraction. Yet, I just like the way it looks. Personally, I don't hate my boobs, but I don't like them either, they're just there. Not only are they bothersome, but I just wish I could be completely flat. I feel I'd look better without them. I also kind of like the way men's chests look in general.
5. I feel so much pressure as a woman. Whenever I walk into a room, I feel like I'm unworthy, as if I'm an abomination to the earth, because women are supposed to be pretty and I'm not. As a lesbian, I've just gotten it into my head that I'd never find someone, because I have it in my head that women would go for unattractive men, but they'd never go for unattractive women. I just don't feel like I could ever be a *real* woman. I just feel like a kid, like a girl before she's hit puberty, and I feel like that's how everybody sees me. Not a real woman.
6. I hate shaving (Admittedly, I think everyone does.). I've always felt pressured to shave, since otherwise I'd be a freak among women. Yet, I've always hated shaving, both my legs and underarms. I've envied how men can just not shave and they're considered attractive for it. Most of my insecurity from body hair stems from the fact that as a woman, I'm supposed to shave, otherwise I'm less-than.
7. Contradictions: I've never really identified with men on television. It may be because I'm a lesbian, but I generally just prefer women. I also prefer playing games as a woman.
8. I thought I would point this out. I've kind of envied men's hair. I would never cut my hair short, however, I think I only keep my hair now because it's how I feel internally I should look - as a woman.
9. NSFW &gt;!Even as a lesbian, I do not enjoy lesbian porn. I don't like women genitalia or how they have sex. I actually prefer gay porn, or just heterosexual porn. Women genitalia makes me uncomfortable, even my own.  !&lt;

I've been questioning for maybe a few years now. It worries me because I feel as though being trans and transitioning would be so freeing. I wouldn't feel like an unattractive girl, an abomination to women anymore. I could get rid of these annoying boobs and dress the way I want to dress, without people judging me for buying from the men's section. Part of me is also terrified. Transitioning would mean having to go through that ""Started T but isn't passing yet"" phase, and that kind of scares me.

In conclusion, I guess, I just don't feel like a woman and I've always envied men, it hasn't been too overwhelming to cause me harm, but it still feels like I could be so much more. I feel as though being a man could be freeing. Maybe that's who I'm meant to be. 

Any thoughts or suggestions? 

TL:DR I think I might be Trans, but I don't have body dysphoria (That I know of).",13Jul2020,1
114,"I am f20, my sister is f16.

Growing up, my parents were very strict with me. My ma bought clothes for me from kohl’s and only when I needed them, and I was not allowed to wear makeup. Her reason was, *you’re not going to school to look pretty, you’re going to learn*. This made sense to me, so I sucked it up and accepted it. I was not allowed to have pets as they could be a distraction, and I wasn’t allowed to dye my hair. If I want nice things, I need to work for it and earn it myself when I turned 18. Which is what I did.

For whatever reason, my parents did a complete 180 on my sister. She got to dye her hair blue, she was allowed to get a hamster for her birthday, my ma bought her $200 worth of makeup from Sephora, and is regularly buying my sister “top” brand things. Calvin Kleins, Tommy Hilfiger, and Adidas, and they just bought her Nike Airforce 1s. So yeah, pretty spoiled. Her behavior is pretty much as bad as you’d think it is. My ma’s reason is that her friends are into those things, and she wants my sister to fit in.

I know these are really petty things to feel jealous over. I know Im too old to play the “but what about me?” card, but I still can’t help but feel kind of bitter. Also, its not her fault that our parents are spoiling her. How can I leave these unhealthy feelings behind?",13Jul2020,1

I told him to please explain to me how I made him feel this way so I could stop but he said “it’s just a feeling I get”. I just want to try to understand the term better so I can obviously work on being a better friend. I just don’t understand and right now we are in a huge argument because he said I amake him feel bad even though I personally feel like I have been very supportive. Although I don’t negate perhaps making comments that he might not have liked which I wish he would bring to my attention at the time m. I told him that whenever I make rude comments to please bring it to my attention so I can apologize and correct myself but he has told me that he only likes to communicate through text and has a hard time communicating effectively in person which I am the opposite. I communicate more effectively in person so our communication styles seem to make the situation worse. We just had a rough argument in which we were communicating in person and he claims I just want to be right all the time although he has also made rude comments to me but I don’t take them to heart. It ended in me saying maybe we do need a break from each other and went to my room. We are roommates btw. Yesterday he said we needed a break from being friends because he said I made him feel bad about himself and that he needed more supportive friends in which I told him I understood and that I apologized for making him feel bad in any way. After not replying to him he texted me that he was hanging out with a friend at the pool and if I would like to join to which I said yes and we had a good time and at the pool it was like nothing happened and when we got back home I told him maybe we should talk about what happened and thats where we had the rough argument and I was just done. I just want to understand the concept better because I do gauge that living as a gay male is harder than being a cis-gendered straight women and I never want to make my friend feel used or as an accessory in any way.

124,"Hey there Reddit, here is the tale of the worsr human being I have ever met. 

I don't know the rules on the sub about posting identities, so let's just call the bully Mady.

It all started around the time we started dating about a year and a half ago; Mady would make comments about how my girlfriend would never love me as much as she loved her as a friend, would invade whenever we were spending time together, and make comments about me behind my back to her. Not so bad right? Seems just like a jealous friend. And back then, she was. 

It was after that the emotional manipulation began. Mady would act out fake illnesses to make my girlfriend drop plans with other people, and make her feel bad relentlessly if she didn't do so immediately. She would start saying things that made my girlfriend feel that when things went wrong, they were all her fault. Mady would call my girlfriend selfish, self-centered and inconsiderate without cause because she knew it would hurt.

Flash forward to now. Mady slams every door in the flat as she walks through it when she knows my girlfriend is asleep, she sends her gross accusatory messages, plays music at max volume with her speaker pressed against the walls at the super early hours and hurls abuse at her whenever they happen to pass in the corridor. Mady went as far as to move some of my girlfriends things out of the flat next to the trash, without any mention of why - just waiting for a reaction. 

My girlfriend is a soft touch, and she believes that standing up to the problem will just make her behave worse; she doesn't understand that this has happened because she never did stand up in the first place. 

She can't just leave, as she can't stay with me on my current circumstances and lacks the funds to just hide away somewhere - but why should she have to? She isn't in the wrong here. 

What can be done about such a bully? The words I've used here don't adequately do just to the problems she caused towards my girlfriend's mental health. 

Any advice, hugely appreciated.",13Jul2020,1

127,"I think I may have repressed memories?

This is going to be a long story..I apologize in advance. I’m not sure exactly where to begin, so I’ll just start by saying that the memories I do have, aren’t good ones. I remember when I was in the 5th grade my best friend died in a house fire. I was told that I started burning myself with lighters, matches, candles, anything that had a flame because I wanted to feel what she felt. I don’t remember this detail, I just know that everyone in the family that lived in the house all have the same story on it. I have memories of being bullied, but they aren’t the same instances. It’s all mixed memories, different times and at different stages throughout middle and high school. I have few memories of family gatherings, and almost none of my mother and father. My mother tells me that my father had a raging drug/alcohol addiction. When my father came back into my life he told me that my mother is crazy. That she has some type of mental illness (he didn’t know exactly what so he just said that). He told me that she coached my sister on how to report my sisters father for rape when she was just seven. She had her sit in the floor with a babydoll and pointed out places to say he touched her, and how to have a reaction to certain things. My aunt has told me that my mom claimed to work 2-3 jobs throughout my entire childhood, but never had the money to properly care for my sister and I. She said she has cake over to the house being completely covered in trash and to my sisters bed and my own bed being covered in our own feces and urine, and us being covered in dirt with mattered hair. My sister defends my mother sometimes, but other times she tells me stories that would put my mother as abandoning us. The only story I remember clearly was when she was changing in front of me and I noticed a scare on her chest in between her breasts. I asked her about it and she said she dropped a pot of boiling water on herself. Confused as to how a grown woman had done that, I pressed her a little on the story. She said it was when she was around 5 or 6 and she was making us (herself and me) some spaghetti. The pot was too heavy and she ended up spilling it all on herself. I asked her why she was cooking and she said mom was in bed, too tired from working two jobs. The way my mother is now and the way she acts towards me, has made me start questioning why I have almost no memories with her, especially in my really young ages. Now a days, she’s very manipulative and guilt tripping. She borrows money from everyone, and never pays them back. She has taken loans out in my name when I was 16 (not sure how she got away with it) and when I went to buy my own car at 21 and was declined being told my credit was too bad, I looked into it. I asked her about it and she claimed it wasn’t her, so when I said that’d I ask the company to pull the video if they still have it she started screaming that I wanted her out into jail. Now my credit is decent, but any time I’m getting ahead she always pops up and tells me something has happened and she needs money to help. First it was her car broke down, then it was she got laid off of work, then it was her car again, and now it’s that the company she works for didn’t deposit her latest check and she’s waiting on it. Anytime I call her out on it or tell her that I can’t afford to give her more money, she starts saying things like “that’s okay. I’m going to go to sleep now, hopefully I won’t wake back up.”, “well maybe I can live in my car for a bit. Or find a bridge to live under.”, “it’s not like I didn’t bust my ass to raise you and your sister but it’s okay, you take care of you.” And other things. She even mocks my mental health issues in ways. For instance, when I was living with her she would never clean and trash would pile up on top of itself. When I would try to clean up after her, I’d go into full blown panic attacks because I’m highly OCD. She’d then start crying, claiming she’s a bad mother for letting her area get this bad. When I tell her I’ve been depressed and can’t come see her, she tries to make it sound like her depression is worse than mine. When we go out in public and it gets too crowded, resulting in me having a panic attack, she’ll start to have one and it’ll be worse than mine forcing me to basically force myself under control and take care of her. At first I tried to give her the benefit of the doubt, but now it’s starting to seem too coincidental to me. And I can’t defend myself because I have no memories to fall back on. I’ve been considering trying hypnosis or some sort of repressed memory therapy, however I have no idea where to begin on this or if I’m even in the right to do so. 

Is it wrong of me to accuse my mother of this? Should I seek out repressed memory therapy?",13Jul2020,1
128,"I (28f) just finished grad school last year, got my first job, and moved out to a new city to live on my own for the first time in my life. Before that, I went through some rough times, and I have a history of depression, so I wasn't in the best state when I moved. Unfortunately for me, it quickly became obvious that the new job wasn't at all what I thought it would be, and I hate the city where I live now. I had very few friends other than a few colleagues at work. Depression hit me hard in the first few months. I knew right away that I had to find a new job to get me out of this state. I worked hard for it, studying for interviews, applying for jobs and learning foreign languages so I could potentially move to a different country. The hope of leaving and moving on to a better life was all that kept me going.

My therapist suggested that I go out more and meet some people. I went on a lot of dates with men I met on dating apps. My newfound social life improved my mental health enormously, and I even made a few friends. In February, I met my current boyfriend (35) and we started seeing each other regularly. I was upfront with all of my dates about my intention to move away in the near future. My boyfriend is ok with having a short-term relationship. In fact he has a history of being a bit of a player, dating many women briefly without getting attached. We were so different in so many ways that I knew from the beginning it wouldn't work out in the long run, but I was attracted to him nonetheless and thought we could keep each other company until I leave.

The pandemic hit my city in March. I lost touch with most of the friends I made earlier, but kept seeing my boyfriend. He lives an hour away, so we hang out twice a week. There were times when we had doubts about continuing our relationship. He said he'd never liked a girl as much as he liked me and was afraid that we were becoming too attached. He almost took up a six-month job assignment in a different state so we could end things sooner rather than later. I cried for a whole night when I heard the news, and was relieved when I found out that he decided to stay. Throughout the last few months, as I dealt with the uncertainty, the stress and the loneliness that came with job hunting and the pandemic, I felt safe and happy having him by my side. To be honest, we don't even do much more than watching movies, play video games together and going to sleep while holding each other. At times it almost felt like a platonic friendship, but one that kept me sane during these uncertain times.

I ended up getting two job offers, one in a different state and one in a different country. Both are massive improvements over my current job. Next week is the deadline to respond to these offers. If I accept, I may be leaving in two months. It hit me hard that soon we will have to say goodbye. There's no way he'd move with me. He has his roots and family here. Besides, I really don't think we'd suit each other in the long run anyway. We have our differences, but never bothered trying to work them out because it's pointless in the short run. This morning, I cried a lot again as we sat on the couch together and talked about how grateful we were for the past few months. I asked him if he would stay in touch with me. He said yes, even though he doesn't really stay in touch with his exes. But I know that this relationship will fade with time, as we go on to pursue our own paths. I will be alone again and starting from scratch in a new city, just like I was when I first came here. I can foresee the sleepless nights when I lie in bed and think of him, the silly texts we used to send each other throughout the day, the way we fell asleep holding hands. In normal times, I would immediately get back on dating apps again and ask my mom to come stay with me for a while in my new home, but who knows what will happen with this pandemic going on.

I have tears rolling down my face as I type this. I know I can't stay here, but I'm scared of what's to come. I don't know how to cope with my emotions as we approach the day of my departure. Please help me.",13Jul2020,1

131,"About a year ago I went into a downward spiral. I was failing my classes, I was suicidal and depressed, I would cry at the tiniest thing and then I would get anxious that people would make fun of me for crying and I’d get so worked up over teachers shouting at me to the point I was making myself physically throw up from anxiety.

My mum eventually took me out of school and tried to find a new school, because my current school was too high pressure, and it was the kind of school doctors, engineers etc came from, whereas I just wanted to get my GCSE’s and a-levels without topping myself.

I’ve never been formally diagnosed with anything, because I used to believe that doctors and teachers were scheming against me, and I became a bit of a paranoid mess and despite recommendations I refused to see any therapists. I still would rather not see a therapist because when I am not in school or around people I’m completely fine. 

I’m fairly certain that if I did go to a doctor, I would be diagnosed with something. I have a long list of mental illness within my family, and I’ve been suspected of having various mental illnesses, everything from autism to ocd to depression to adhd to anxiety

I feel like it’s very possible I’m on the autism spectrum, and I most likely have some sort of anxiety or depression. And I’m wondering, if I were to get a formal diagnosis would my school accommodate me better? 

Ideally I would like to go to a different school, but that can’t happen because literally no school will take me. Apparently they are all full, and we’ve appealed majority of them so I’m stuck with my current school. However, if I made it clear that being in my current school negatively impacted my mental health then would a different school be obligated to take me? I genuinely believe that I would not be able to do another year in my current school, if I inform a doctor that remaining in my current school makes me suicidal, would that help?

My ideal scenario would either be:
•I get a diagnosis of something and my current school lets me do work at home and perhaps come in for a couple of hours a week
•I get to go to a different school

I feel like nobody is taking me seriously because it’s just ‘teen angst’ it is not teen angst, and I will kill myself if I have to go back to the way things were.

132,"Hello let me start this off with a short and simple version for those who don't want to wait. I'm 19 and my major is criminal justice I am curious if people think I should be going into this line of work in these times. I personally believe that we do have many flaws in our system and have met plenty of good cops and a few bad ones along the way. I think that we do need to remove these poorly disciplined officers mainly because when you give some one the power of a peace officer you are trusting them to use it properly. This is why it's different than getting a bad waiter at a restaurant because you can't control that and it's not really a big deal of you do no ones gonna die but with police it is a really big deal because people's lives are on the line no matter how you put it. I'm just curious because if honestly heard all the reactions before about going into law enforcement but I want to hear what people think as far as politically or just in general thoughts on it. If been told not to bother going into it but I feel that that is the line of thinking that gives evil people power, because if you can create a group that no good people will join its guaranteed to go bad. Essentially in the long haul I think that just because there are bad people in it isn't a good reason not to go into law enforcement, and you should be the change you want to see.

It was my best friends bachelorette party. Her cousin is a teacher and had gotten a DUI like a year ago, maybe less. I was told by another family member of hers about it. Anyways, it happened in a city nearby. Everyone at the party went outside and it was me, my best friend, and the cousin. We said that we should leave the house and go out to that city. Well I said oh I thought “cousin” won’t go to that city anymore? She said she would but just not drive. I wanted to say this in a “caring” “concerned” way and I said oh so did that situation effect your teaching at all? Well she literally said how did u know about that??? I said oh I heard it from “other cousin”, I didn’t realize it was a secret. She got mad and left. She sent my best friend a long paragraph about why would her cousin tell me? And of all people me. (Not sure why she would say that, maybe because I’m not family) there would be no other reason to say that, I stay out of drama, I’m sensitive, and nice. Then she said she can’t believe that I was “so brave” to ask her a question like that. I totally didn’t mean anything by it and 2 days later I’m still upset and feel so bad!!!

136,"So, my (19f) girlfriend (20f) lives in VA. She's never moved out of her parents' house and has been living there to finish up school. She also works almost full-time to pay for all of her own expenses (gas, food, etc.) She also pays them $300 a month for her car and phone payments, and $1000 for rent each month. We live 1.5 hours away from each other but she visits me for a few days each week because she works in 3-4 day blocks. She hasn't ever missed a payment and does stuff for them around the house and spends her money on stuff they ask her to buy for them. Her dad in particular is homophobic and dislikes that she's dating me and spends so much time with me (because he's borderline abusive and she never wants to be home with him).

However, now her parents are saying that she doesn't spend enough time at home and that she needs to leave as soon as possible. She has no savings because they purposely drain her bank account each month so she can't move out. Her parents routinely steal money from her account but she can't track it because they're in control of it. She makes maybe $650 a month so they've always charged her way more in rent than she could ever pay them so that's another way they've kept her from saving money. They're also saying that when she moves out, she can't take her car or her phone. (I don't exactly know how they think she's going to leave without a car.) What actions should/could she take to keep from being completely abandoned without enough money to live?

Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/gyo65a/im_having_a_threeway_tomorrow_and_im_a_little/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share

I want to start off by giving a very genuine thank you to all of the thoughtful commenters, you eased my stress greatly and made it clear that having an honest and open conversation before anything started was a must.

All three of us sat down, talked about our limits, our preferences, and even our anxieties. (It made me feel a lot better knowing that I wasn't the only person that was nervous).

Once we got all that out of the way, we began what was the longest foreplay of my life.  You guys were right, penetration truly is not the main event.

The night was filled with awkward laughs, warm hugs, and y'know.

Even with the encouragement of reddit behind me I struggled to keep it up, but thanks to our conversation we had at the beginning, I never felt less than.

All in all the experience itself was greatly helped by not holding myself to too high a standard, and taking time to make sure everyone felt as comfortable as possible.  And if they didn't, we could all laugh it off and be uncomfortable together. 

All of the tips you guys gave worked and accomplished what I was hoping they would.  The calming of my nerves.

...unfortunately not everything is good in the hood.  Shortly after the three way, M20 broke up with F21.  I know I kind of disregarded all the comments saying that the threeway could have an impact on their relationship, but I just assumed theirs was really strong based off of them inviting me mutually into their bed.

Why they broke up isn't certain, M20's reasoning was he said he didn't see their futures lining up, but F21 believes avidly that the threeway awakened something inside of him.

I've been feeling a decent amount of guilt, but I'm trying not to let it get to me.  In the end I accepted an invitation given to me by two close friends that I trusted, how was I supposed to know they didn't trust each other.  

My big take aways.  Make sure you have an in depth discussion.  And, to the best of your ability, consider the impact it may have on the other 2 people in the party.

Thanks again for all of your comments!

145,"I was convinced the right move was to move out of my parents house again, I'm 34. If I am going to get a full-time job and pay rent i was also planning to move to a different city. 

I felt inspired motivated to do it. I have several personal passions between art music and science. I may go to back to school for science or another path in the future. I have been wanting to move to a city more my style. Again. 

I live back in the suburbs now and have for 5 years. I am sexually pretty fluid and vary across the spectrum . I have been wanting to move to a gay friendly city in Florida for a while .

With my various interests that I really enjoy dabbling in each, I haven't finished the college route. I have some college done, my last major being art. 

My idea to move out, was doing something I felt I should've done 4 years ago. There's some guilt with it too, because besides feeling I needed to establish my own life again, I felt my parents need there own space again. I was across the country from 24 to 29.  And between college and locally moving out , I was out from. 18 to 22. 

Job wise I don't know. I have talents in art but no degrees. My experience is pretty light in the workforce too. But I was hoping to search around and maybe find something decent. I dunno teaching art, which I could, or maybe just finding something creative driven that pays ok and didn't require degree. 

Another factor is that Miami, was the place I have been eyeing. Of course is Covid spiking now , so thats to consider. I also know it's a hard town, and expensive. But I have a good head on my shoulder in terms of life style. I am sober of 10+ years, disciplined and driven in my personal pursuits. I like to work on myself and am trying to regain a better sociability and social life currently . Kind of why I see nothing for myself here in the suburbs . 


But I opened up to my parents about it and got critique from them . 'your not prepared' 'your gonna get stuck in low paying jobs' 'you need to finish what you started' 'you keep quitting things.'. 

I'm listening , listening was harder when I was younger and more angry at them for sure. Very dysfunctional tilted toward choas and bad relationships growing up. Dad angry absent, mom I dunno I guess mean needy egotistical no boundaries insulting. Not all bad......roof over my head , steady jobs, there is love (I think) , at least affection or pleasant to be around each otherness. It's the only family I got I guess. 

So I absorbed what they were saying.  I know when I was thinking it out before they said anything ....I came to the word 'willingness'. I really want a willingness in my life right now, nothing no matter how bad I want something else should be off the table. I want to keep that openess to make good choices . 


My plan was to take a quick trip, look around the city , maybe follow up on some job leads for a few days. Get a feel for the city. See if there is anything I can dig up in the creative field or maybe find some minor art teaching or something. But the plan to begin with being that moving to Miami for good enough job is a good move. 

But I am for sure going back and fourth. The back to school thing would be a big trust thing for me . For one I don't have a great idea what I would do, it would be a I guess a re trusting of the wisdom of get a college degree, it opens doors. Something I sort of stop living when I decided to move out west and just do art on my own . Following my heart type thing. I found a lot of motivation and alignment on that path . And still feel I am more of a chase your passion type , rather than take the tried and true stable plan.

Of course my jobs while chasing my whims weren't bragging material either. I know I probably have baggage and just general weaknesses in the college to career mindset. Maybe it's been the challenges of sexual identity , chaotic growing up,  addictive personality , or just a big ego and stubbornness. Maybe those things played a part, but really it's just undisciplined, selfish, short sightedness that's been driving. 


I dunno thinking about the college thing, not college ever .....I had college in my sights but I was thinking I would put myself through while working , IF I got to the point where I wanted that . But the college thing now....following the advice, changing my life from self lead more of less , to back to the traditional wise stable path. It started to feel like a house of cards all falling. 

If college has been the right way and is. Well maybe I gotta go to that church group my grandpa is telling me about , maybe I have to be straight and Christian to live a proper good life. And then I start to get depressed and it feels like walls are caving in .

Makes me wonder if my rebel side is just a reaction to my sexuality , that all the traditional stuff I grew up with as a kid somehow all got thrown in that same pot. Normal college career path advice...No, religion...no. etc etc. 

I dunno I like who I am , I like have musical and art ability , a strong sense of individuality. A strong drive but I guess it doesn't go down the traditional path a lot. And maybe I can see where some of that comes from but maybe that's ok. 

I am a good person I think. I am considerate , active in recovery , enjoy like helping others, and always trying to be healthier learn and grow.



So I am trying to decide what to do. On my own, as I again think it's leaning .....I want to follow my own path, learn from my experience and be the decision maker . I'm not opposed to tried and true wise pathways but I need to want that from inside me. 

The there's the other. Let go of your constant rebellion, trust a wiser advice, settle down with your aspirations ....get a degree and career going now. 

One is move out, re establish an independent life again. The other is stay home with parents , get to work at school again , for a better stable career ahead. 


------_------_---------------------

TLDR


Move out of parents house , attempt moving to new city (exciting, diverse community), look for good job (without degree) based on current talents (creative) and interests. Re establish independence . Follow my heart. Work on art music science in spare time , further develop, and keep college while working in sights if you decide it's what you want. 


Stay home , trust wiser advice and finish school to hope for a stable career w good pay. Continue to live with parents despite lack of personal life and personality differences etc. Trust in tradition , change the way you've been living life in that regard. Stop rebelling, grow up and find a career path.",13Jul2020,1

Being in a relationship is good and all, but have you ever met someone that gets butterflies the moment they see your name pop up on their phone. Yea, neither have I. That's why I'm here. 

When ever I try talking to a girl I never know how to start the conversation. I've used all the tricks in the book ranging from ""hey hows it going?"", too ""you're looking good today"" but nothing ever works. I've even tried asking my friends for advice but they all give me the same answer, ""I think you're cute, whats good."" I know girls like a good compliment here and there but I can't always be giving compliments because then they won't feel genuine anymore. Yes I can give you a nice compliment here and there but I also want to able to have a good flowing conversation were both parties enjoy talking to each other. I just want to vibe and not feel like I'm placing a burden on you when ever you see my name pop up and feel like you have to talk to me. I've also been told that I am a dry texter or I talk like a robot. I try my best to spark up good conversations but It's hard when I'm the only one who likes talking and put in an effort to talk.

Well anyways, what I'm trying to ask for is why do girls never enjoy talking to me. I try my best to be a nice guy and spark up good conversation but that never seems to work.

For example the next simpsons episode i have to watch is ""Dead Putting Society"" and the next Twilight Zone episode is ""A Short Drink from a Certain  Fountain"" so i just think these phrases constantly alternating between the two. This just happened recently. I looked it up and it's apparently an OCD symptom but it's the only one I have, and besides this just started a couple of days ago. I'm taking a break from these shows to try and stop it but it hasn't. Its really annoying.",13Jul2020,1

153,"So I’m 21 almost graduating college (Fall) and I feel super lost and lonely.  Like everybody I’m super bored in quarantine and what used to keep me busy, games, tv, friends... really hasn’t excited me anymore.  I feel super lonely even though I still talk with people. 

I live at home with my parents and they are older so I have to help out a lot basically it’s I wake up and see who’s hurt or what’s going wrong today.   I love them and appreciate everything they have done for me but I feel a need to get out once this pandemic is over.  The thing is once I start thinking about this I get freaked out and think damn I’m gonna be alone which terrifies me. The though of getting a real job also freaks me out for some reason idk why.  

Anyways so I really haven’t had a real gf either.  In hs there was some girls but the longest was an off/on year long thong which ended once I graduated.  I moved onto the dating apps which are all appearance based or scams and I hate them tbh.  

I feel like I haven’t accomplished anything and just feel lost on what to do.  I keep being told to be excited about starting off anew but the thought of it just makes me depressed.  I really have nothing to show: no gf, small group of friends, still at home, some kind of anxiety disorder thing, and just super lost.  

Has anyone else ever felt this way or had similar experiences? How did you deal with them?",13Jul2020,1
154,"Some point during Covid pandemic, I reached my lowest point in life where I just couldn't give a damn about anything. I ghosted on my close friends and a mentor who is very special and important to me. 

One of my friends even reached out to my parents since I ignored all of her texts and calls. She stopped texting me after realizing I was safe. My mentor also attempted to reach out before giving up.

I know this is very awful and selfish of me, but I was overwhelmed by the loss of a family member and the struggle to scrape by both now and after the pandemic. I also felt utterly aimless after ""graduating"" from college as all my plans are now disrupted...  

I am currently in a weird spot. On one hand, I really want to reach out and apologize for ghosting on them. I don't have many real friends other the few I ghosted on. I sincerely want to keep this friendship and mentor-ship even after parting our ways. 

YET, I am also very afraid to do so... I think I have disappointed them enough. I mean, I didn't even bothered to reply once over the last 2-3 months. Worst yet, what if I ended up ghosting on them again? I am doing a lot better in terms of coping the loss, but I still feel like I am not mature enough to handle stress and, honestly, the real real world.

What should I do? How do you or can you un-ghost someone? Should I wait until I am emotionally stable again? Should I explain everything? Should I promise to not ghost on them? What do I even talk about anymore... I don't think I am the same person anymore (as in I am not currently interested in a lot of the things we share in common). 

Any advice is sincerely appreciated. Thank you very much",13Jul2020,1
155,"So this is gonna be a long story so sit tight. 
I’m 16 years old and haven’t had that great of a time being on this earth up until now. My biggest problems are probably my low self-esteem, social anxiety and abandonment issues. As a child I was too nice to people so they soon started using that against me. I was severely bullied in primary school because I was too shy for everybody else and all my friends started dropping me when more interesting people arrived in their life (happened 4 times in total to me [3 up until that point], I’m not kidding. Could get into more details to why that was but I don’t want to make the post too long. But anyway that’s the reason for my abandonment issues). Because of that I was very suicidal at the ages of 9-10, even tough I finished primary school a year later (I’m from Europe) which made me feel a little more hopeful to finally find people who would understand me. So because I basically got a chance for a new start I decided to do a complete 180 and stopped being the nice, shy friend who would always listen and instead pretended to be tough and became the ‘funny and crazy’ friend. 2 years later I was dropped again. A new girl basically ‘stole’ my identity [she acted completely different before she saw how I made my then friends laugh] and probably played the role better than me because I slowly saw how they started ignoring me more and more. Back then I even started an experiment and didn’t hang out with them in the break to know if they would go search for me to show that they cared. Well. They didn’t. So I spent another year basically alone with a few acquaintances here and there. Fast foreword another year and I finally meet the circle of friends that I have up until this year (grade 7-10/11 after summer break). The problem is that I had so few people to socialize with as a child that I would automatically cling onto only one person. Because that’s all I ever wanted. One best friend who would not laugh at me (my history of friends has a strange habit of making me the butt of the joke) but with me. Who I could tell everything and who wouldn’t judge me but who’d be just as open and as compassionate to me as I was to people before my life got f-ed up. And at the beginning everything seemed to be looking great. 

So for the sake of the story let’s call her ‘Sarah’. Sarah and I were goofin around a lot. Made up inside jokes, talked about music, etc. Over the first year that we met we would get a lot closer. And she would soon open up about her depression. She told me that she has been depressed and wanted to die for her whole life. She also had a shitty childhood. Parents divorced early on, her dad treated her awfully, she moved away from a place where all her best friends were... just stuff that simply sucks. At that moment I was at a point were I wasn’t depressed for the first time in a long while so I tried to motivate her and talk her out of depression, which simply doesn’t work as most of you all probably know, but silly young me thought, that maybe the things that helped me would help her. We kept that up for a year but soon there was a point where I simply couldn’t take it anymore (it was a day where she only talked about wanting to kill herself and her bucketlist) so I finally stood up and told her that I was always worrying about her  and that she doesn’t consider how much it hurts and scares me to hear her constantly saying how much she wants to die. Suprinsingly she took the news well, calmed me down, told me that she would never actually kill herself and that I shouldn’t need to worry. That made me feel a lot better but she never opened up about her mental struggles ever again afterwards which really broke my heart because she used to tell me that I was the only one that she would share her worries with. And that was the first crack in our friendship. Parallel I fell in love for the first time. That’s a whole other long story that I should probably post elsewhere some day (I’m so sorry, I’m not looking for fame it just feels so good to finally be listened to and to get all of those struggles of my chest). The short version is; I didn’t knew him, fell for him anyway, had too much social anxiety to talk to him, and got back into depression after pushing myself down as being too unworthy to be with him anyway. I was a really exhausting, awful person in that period of time there is no doubt in my mind of that, but how Sarah treated me hurt none the less. First she was supportive but soon she started making fun of my then crush and didn’t want to talk about him anymore or to be exact: she forbid me from talking about him or else she’d get pissed even tough I really didn’t talk about him that often (I actually didn’t even really like discussing him with anybody). She in contrast was always a really hypersexual person and talked to me about every boy she has or had a crush on - and by that I mean constantly. Soon she would talk about nothing else and to this day the only real thing we talk about anymore are her crushes which kind of hurts considering I wasn’t allowed to talk about mine back then while also accepting the fact that I should allow her to talk about all of her love interests constantly. Another crack in our friendship. Then came a time where she would start acting colder and colder towards me without explaining why and leaving me out of things. I was again really afraid to stand up for myself because I knew that my thought process was stupid and I didn’t wanna piss her off for no reason so I kept quite for some time. But then she planned a sleepover and invited everyone of our friend group except for me and they wouldn’t even tell me about it until I repeatedly asked them kindly. She didn’t really give me an answer why she was acting like that until a few month later when she bursted out that I was simply way too clingy and that that annoyed her. I think that’s the point where I really broke because the people that always abandoned me made me feel like an awful human and like a burden and that statement was just feeding way more into my fantasy and so I gave her the space she needed. If I look back on those things today I understand her. I am clingy but the awful part is not her being upset because of that fact. No it’s that she would be mad if I followed her around at school ‚all day‘ (literally just 6 hours and we wouldn’t even meet at the weekends ever or sit next to each other in class) but she got mad in return when I wouldn’t text her (those conversations lasted up to 10 hours and at that time period we would mostly fight). I didn’t even stop texting her because I was angry but because I was anxious. All my alarm bells were just going off when I thought about answering her messages because every time I did in the past she was mean spirited to me or treated me unfairly. It was not a matter of wanting it. I simply couldn’t do it. So that also became a fighting point. Our relationship kind of got better when I stopped taking it personal that she wanted space and realized that I was probably suffocating her with my neediness. So I tried working on it and things were better for a while. Than Corona happened and everything got worse than ever. I (and I know this is awful) ignored her for over a month. I still had this extrem anxiety when it goes to texting her so I simply couldn’t put myself through answering her and felt worse and worse everyday for doing so. I stopped eating, got lonelier and lonelier, cried almost everyday and felt so awful about everything about myself. When I came back she was of course absolutely hurt and I understand that but she just didn’t understand my feelings when I told her I had too much social anxiety to talk to anyone. I also told her that what I had done can’t be excused and that I 100% owe up to that. But she told me that I just said that as a manipulative technique so that she could not say anything against me, even tough I was just being honest with her. Ever since than things have been really rocky. 

She turns way more to two other friends now when it comes to basically anything and I know this sounds awful to say but... I feel... jealous? I know it’s all my fault and I shouldn’t feel the right to feel jealous and hurt but I still do. She doesn’t even talk deeply about boys with me anymore and the last thing she told me was that it doesn’t matter anymore to her if I go offline for a longer time or not (not in a positive way). I feel so absolutely awful about myself and I don’t know what to do because I know that it’s my fault but also... I don’t know. I really don’t want to be mean because I like her a lot... but I feel like she also treated me really poorly. Another friend of ours threw a party about a week ago and Sarah talked to me and in one conversation she told me that she made this music video for the friend that she now confides into and asked me if I wanted to see it. Of course I said yes because I thought nothing of it but when she showed it to me I almost cried. There were so many personal pictures and videos and it felt so very intimate between the two. Her final words were “I don’t know I just made it for her when she was sad”. And that really made me realize that in all the 4 years of our friendship when I was sad she never made something like that for me. She didn’t even say “I’m sorry that you’re feeling down”. She rather acted cold towards me or was really insensitive about my feelings. 

I really want to be a better person and I basically blame myself for everything in my life. But the way she treats me really makes me think if maybe I do have the right to feel hurt by the way she treated me even tough I also was a piece of shit?

How can I stop giving myself up for her and how can I stop being jealous that she doesn’t let me take a big part in her life anymore?
How can I avoid making her feel guilty for the fact that I feel hurt by her actions?
I also don’t want to cut ties with her! I still like her very much and all my other friends would probably stop being friends with me or hate me if I openly ended my friendship with her so that doesn’t work. And (for my conscience) most importantly of all: 

Am I a bad person for feeling mistreated?

TL;DR: Made a lot of shitty things, so did my friend. Am I awful for acting and feeling that way towards her because she hurt me so much? Please help me I hate being a Teenager.

157," 

This took place during the 2nd half of my senior year in highschool. I guess I should say for starters I never really had any friends up until that point. I had a few friends I hung out with only at school, however, never really hung out with people outside school. (Besides 3 work friends, but one of them stopped talking to me for unknown reasons, and the other moved to Missouri a few months before all this happened.) I hung out with the other dude, but not too often. I was a loner, everyone at school was mean to me. Besides the few ""Friends"" I did have, said girl, and this one dude who would come up to me and say weird shit (Keep this person in mind, they will be important later.) Anyway, I guess that's what made me fall for her in the first place, her being the first girl to be nice to me and all. After I realized I liked her, I had no idea what to do. Initially, I tried to bottle it up and not act. I later realized that wasn't going to get me anywhere, so I tried asking her out. Keyword, tried. For some reason, the words just couldn't leave my mouth.

So this is where the dude who said weird shit to me comes into the story. Turns out, he's her brother. So then I decided to form a friendship with him. (Yeah, I know, retarded move if you have a crush.) But as it turns out, him and I clicked, told him I liked her, fast forward a little bit I ask her to prom, she says yes.

After prom, I finally got the balls to ask her on a date. I asked her straight up ""Will you go out with me?"" and she said yes. Awesome, right? Well, not really, because she ended up ghosting me after graduation. Why? POSSIBLY because me and her brother got into a fight after and stopped being friends again (Tho we did make up a couple weeks ago.)

First off, don't tell me to ""Try again."" I don't want to date her anymore. My feelings have most definitely shrunk significantly since this happened, but theyre not 100% gone. (Though she was the first girl I ever loved, and as far as I've heard, that doesn't go away completely.) Second, I also think it should be important to mention I was diagnosed with Asperger's and ADHD at a young age. (I have a lot of symptoms of BPD as well but I've never actually been diagnosed for that.)

Usually, I'd try to meet people, but that's hard right now do to the coronavirus. However, I'm meeting my dad's friend's daughter (Who's my age) pretty soon. Maybe that will seal the deal and I can finally get over all this? idk, I just need some advice.

I'm nice and say hi to her and actually hang out with her toddler by taking them outside on the swing.

this paragraph is a bit of a rant in regards to the things he did so you don’t NEED to read. 
we would do ab*se and r*pe play, but he wouldn’t let me have a safe word so everything was “more real”. he refused to have sex if i smoked weed to numb the pain of anal, but encouraged me to do hard drugs because sometimes i would pass out. he would often tell me to “turn around and go home” as i was in the middle of an 8+ hour bus ride to see him. if we were arguing he would just tell me “this is making me care about you less” and ignore me for a long time. he heavily fetishized me. he told me the chinese were horrible (im chinese) but korean girls were perfect and pretty. the last time i spoke to him was when he kicked me out to the streets of NYC at 3am with no money, mask, or ride home. i live two hours away. i am unfamiliar with the city and many men talked to me that night. that morning he had the nerve to ask if i got home safe. there was a lot of other things he did over the years which completely exhausted me.

yet i still want nothing more but to message him again. i want him to hold me. i want to be in his arms again and hold his hand walking around. i want to text him and feel smiley when he texts me back. i want to fall asleep on facetime again. i want to cook and serve him dinner while he plays his video games. i crave a relationship so bad but starting over is so annoying. no one fills how he made me feel.",13Jul2020,1
168,"Hey Reddit,

The last couple months my family has been following quarantine guidelines and social distancing from everyone we can. We did this out of courtesy and concern for the vulnerable people around us, and for the fact that my dad is a type one diabetic with health issues and other members of my family have asthma, heart issues etc. I live in Canada, and recently things have been beginning to open up. I’m beginning to get worried because the cases aren’t necessarily going down, but everyone seems to be letting loose. Both my parents have returned back to their work where they come into very close contact with people, and my siblings have been hanging out with multiple friends in very close proximity. This not only worries me because of my dad’s health issues, but also because we have recently begun seeing my grandparents again who have health issues I mentioned previously. All of this has given me loads of anxiety and often keeps me up at night as I am terrified of anyone I love getting the virus and potentially dying. I would never be able to forgive myself if I could’ve done something to prevent that. I’ve tried warning my family but at this point they’re “done” with the quarantine and have basically given up. Should I be worried? What can I do at this point? Sincerely, a teenager who worries wayyy too much and wants to stop stressing :)",13Jul2020,1

She doesn't have a job, she doesn't have unemployment money or any income whatsoever.

This said person has a three year old daughter and Ive been following her facebook posts now for the last year or more. At the age of two (literally right after her second birthday) they were posting photos of the little girl eating a full microwave Hungryman dinner, and other things like entire plates of pasta, and generally overfeeding. At the age of 2 and a half, this kid was eating an entire loaf of local homemade bread as a snack. I am not over exaggerating at all, she was eating FULL loaves of bread without slicing, just chomping into it as one big piece. At Easter, they posted a series of photos of her eating an ENTIRE CHOCOLATE BUNNY and they just think its cute. She has just turned three years old in May, and for the last 2-3 months theyve been posting alot of photos on daily roadtrips out of town and the girl barely fits in her booster seat, her sides are pouring over it. In the photos you can see her one day eating mcdonald’s with pop, the next hour she has a box of timbits and an iced capp, then a bag of chips. All of this is in the backseat with her and her mother has no shame posting pics either and i cannot be the only one worried about this. I have seen photos one day apart of her eating chips, timbits, iced capps, iced coffee, pop, mcdonalds and even her own can of sprite , day after day!! She is severly overweight, her mother has no shame and even posted that she fits into a size TEN !! in girls. A three year old fitting into a size ten is RIDICULOUS, and she posted saying shes selling some of the size ten due to the girl finding it “too tight”. When she wears a little bathing suit her rolls pour over it, and her face is so overweight you cant even see her features. What concerns me is this girl is  already so RED in the face you cant even pick out her skin tone when she smiles it just all turns red, and shes going to be bullied when she starts school and shes only THREE YEARS OLD and has already developed severe overeating habits and her parents are solely the blame. They post these photos and it makes me wonder if the public health nurse or anyone else for that matter has ever voiced their concern for the child as they MUST HAVE but the parents dont seem to take action. I dont know if theres anything I can do personally but something needs to be done this is pure child abuse and until youve seen the photos you wont truly understand how bad it is and how overfed and overweight she is for just turning three years old. Any advice or things i can do to address this concern without my name or identity being tangled in it??",13Jul2020,1
176,"Little sister found out my secret that I like Kpop and now is constantly blackmailing me over it, what should I do about it?

Tl;DR: Read the last paragraph if you’re lazy

Disclaimer- I’m seriously going to sound like I’m antagonizing my little sister- I’m sorry in advance, she’s actually a pretty nice, funny, and stable person for the most part besides exposing people and her overly bossy behavior. To make up for it I’m going to admit that I’m not exactly perfect either- I’m pretty much emotionally unstable and a lowkey mild “smart” narcissist with adhd and may or may not have what people tell me is Histrionic personality like. Whatever, at least I don’t snitch on people which is a good thing I guess. Snitches get stitches.

...

I just turned 17 in June and have liked Kpop for only half a year now, specifically NCT, EXO and Red Velvet although I am also open to learning about new groups as well.

Recently two months ago my little sister who is 3 years younger than me (14) said she needed to use my phone for something, so I let her (she knows my password but I don know hers). She said it was “serious”, I agreed because I’m chill- but it turns out she only needed my phone to go on my Instagram and like her pictures. 

I get extremely embarrassed whenever she scrolls through my social media because I always get caught doing bad things like making friends with strangers or dming strangers for advice. Thankfully I’ve learned from past mistakes and I always log out of Reddit when I am not on it. 

She basically found out I had a secret Instagram account that my stupid self forgot to log off of. I was reluctant to tell but she kept pushing and said if I didn’t tell her she would tell on me. I eventually spilled the beans and told her that it was for liking Kpop content, mainly NCT and Red Velvet since I didn’t like Exo at the time. 

She was like, “That’s nothing to be embarrassed about! I promise I won’t say anything.” Yeah, I didn’t exactly believe her considering whenever my lil sister gets mad at me she calls me this horrible sensitive word that gives me ptsd every time because she knows I’ve gone through it and that if she told other law people would look at me differently. I have ptsd from that experience so I won’t go into details, but you can see as to why I’m not very trusting and skittish around my sister. She is ALWAYS telling on me and getting away with things, also she is pretty bossy and demanding as well so she is able to get anything out of me since I wear my heart on my sleeves so much.

Anywho, after a few days I began to trust her and started introducing her to all the members in Nct and Red Velvet, along with some of their musics as well. Embarrassingly enough, when I showed her the girls in Red Velvet she acted chill but had this look on her face like “This is what you like to look at in your free time???” 

When I showed her the boys she was more judgmental about it. She started having these silly illusions that was in love with the boys. 

She also questioned if I was in love with bts as well. I’m not an army (sorry guys), but I’m an easy blusher and easily embarrassed so whenever she brought up nct and bts I immediate start blushing for no reason. I told her multiple times that I didn’t like BTS, but she didn’t seem to believe me because I was blushing. I keep telling her it’s because bts is popular so everyone thinks Kpop lovers automatically like bts, and that BTS is Kpop but that Kpop isn’t bts.

Eventually, one day we got in a fight and she told my secret to our parents. Thankfully they didn’t think it was a big deal and told my sister that she’s too bossy and too much of a tattletale, but on the inside I’m dying inside.

Honestly, I used to find Kpop strange as well, until my friends kept mentioning how much they liked stray kids and bts and stuff like that. I’m a very open minded person so I tried it out and I feel as if Kpop has really helped me cope with my Ptsd and other mental issues, as well as boost my confidence a lot more. Her finding out and blackmailing me and telling others about it is really hurting my self esteem even worse than it already is, and now I feel as if I’m unable to enjoy any hobby/fandom anymore without her exposing me and then people seeing me differently as a crazy Kpop fan girl or anything she exposes me as.

Even though she hasn’t “told” anyone yet, I have this constant fear that she will. She’s already told most of her close friends about my mental issues and that secret trauma I didn’t want anyone knowing about. Usually I can tell who she’s told it to because they will start acting more fake around me than usual. I’m pretty sure at this point that at least one of her friends know that I like Kpop now.

Unfortunately my sister is not an open minded person so she bullies me about Kpop all the time now along with my childhood ptsd. It’s because my mom used to bring up my ptsd a lot so my little sister caught on. 

I’ve liked a lot more Kpop bands now but not telling her about them in case she continues trying to expose me, haha 😂😬

Again- I know this isn’t a huge deal if people know that I like Kpop, but it’s a huge deal to my low self esteem.

...

Yeah, so basically she found out that I like Kpop and is always telling me how I’m in love with 21 boys and how she’ll threaten in a harmless way to tell everyone I knew that I love nct and Kpop. I can’t fight her, she’ll win, can’t tell parents because of my embarrassment over Kpop (besides I prefer to solve problems myself rather than ask others irl), and basically need help on how to handle this situation and accept the fact that I like Kpop. Thanks 😊",13Jul2020,1
177,"I have a group of college friends from a few years ago. I met a majority of them well after the group was already established so there are members from before I came around who I never got to spend much time with before I (and others) graduated/moved away.

Unfortunately, one of those people died recently. In a group chat, a link was posted for a virtual memorial for this person which includes about 10 other people who were close with him. I though he was cool, but I’d say out of everyone I probably know him the least and I haven’t spoken with him in a few years (not for any reason aside from the fact that we just didn’t know each other very well and drifted apart I guess). 

I really only talked to him a handful of times, and while I’m obviously sad that he died, other people in this group are pretty devastated. Would it be disrespectful for me to join this virtual memorial if I don’t have much to say aside from generic condolences? Should I sit this one out or would that be even more disrespectful?

To be fair, if this was a normal time in history where we could get together at a public funeral in person I would go without hesitation, but the virtual environment makes it feel a lot more intimate and I’m not sure I fit in as such a casual acquaintance.",13Jul2020,1
178,"(Sorry for the long post it’s on phone)
I wasn’t even in school at the time, so around 3-4 and me and my brother were playing and he asked me to do something I felt very uncomfortable with ( I don’t really want to go into details), he was around 7-8 and I suddenly remembered it like 2 years ago and remember it very vividly, I think I tried to block it out my mind. Something similar happened twice in 1st grade but the one that keeps bothering me is the one with my brother. 

I was never raped or anything too intense, but it still nags me. The other two kids from first grade I don’t see so I’ve practically gotten over that, but with my brother, he lives with me so it bothers me a lot more often. I’ve had these dreams about 5-6 times over the past 3 years where he assaults me in more expensive explicit means, same topic just different dreams. I don’t even know if he remembers, he hasn’t done anything like this ever since, in fact we are actually pretty close. But I assure you he never will do anything like that again, yet at the back of my mind every time he gets close or hugs me my body hates it and just reacts negatively to it and I get a little flustered. 

It’s been fucking me up honestly, I hate these damn dreams and I’m starting to hate him for it too and I don’t want that. I won’t ask my parents for therapy because I’ve been in it before and they believed I used it as a crutch (which I did) and if I tell them i need therapy but won’t tell them why, that will just make the whole situation worse.

So is there something wrong with me? I just need a way to quietly deal with this. Maybe it’s just the dreams because the dreams I keep having are honestly fucking horrifying, most don’t even have anything to do with my brother. most are where I’m assaulted by men, or kidnapped, beat up by my peers, even being yelled at my parents for dumb shit like breaking my glasses.

I just need some help. I also learned I have a mania disorder where I pull my hair, is this all connected? Do I just have more psychological issues than others? Any advice would’ve be very much appreciated.",13Jul2020,1
179,"A little bit of introduction about myself. I have graduated from college with a high paying job which has been going perfectly well. Career life is great.

However, I do not share a good relationship with my mother. Growing up, my mom has been the kind of person who wants to control every single decision of mine. Even while ordering food at a restaurant I would want something and she would order something else(Ever since I can remember). I grew up incapable to make my own decisions and not knowing what I want in life. My mom always keeps gossiping about me to my dad. I love my dad. She keeps telling god knows what about me to my dad that he ends up screaming at me. I have 3 other siblings(Step siblings), my dad is the kind of person who never raises voice against kids. My siblings never got any scoldings from dad. But every single time my dad raises voice against me it is always in context with something about my mom. As I grew up I have started to not like my mom. I don't love her, I don't hate her. I just don't care. I have stopped calling her ""mom"". After being controlled for 19 years and after being snitched on for 19 years for doing nothing, I finally move out to a different country and the scoldings continue through phone calls and video calls. 

Dad demands to know why I do not address her as ""mom"". I tell him I don't share a mother bonding hence I don't address her as such but I do respect her. 

The reason why I lost the bond with my mother

1. She does not have any respect for people who are financially poor and she thinks it is ok to speak derogatorily to them and does not even realize it is wrong.
2. She keeps gossiping about me to my father and constantly has him raise his voice against me.
3. She wants to control every single aspect of my life.
4. She has no respect for my father when he is not around.
5. When I say everything she did and confront her she blatantly denies doing anything and acts innocent.
6. She uses bad language and screams at people(I am ashamed because of this and scared to invite anyone home)

And now, Dad screams at me and says I am dead to him(though I love my dad very much) and later on comes and talks as if he has said nothing. And my mother is demanding that I address her as ""mom"". 

I don't know what to do anymore. I can't just cut contact with my parents as a child it is my responsibility to ensure they are well taken care of irrespective of if I like them or not. In my culture, it is important to maintain good relationships with parents. 

I am just not able to bring myself to act like I love my mother. Everyone around me is asking me to give in and do what my parents want me to do. 

Some relationships don't just happen because of blood relations or because of demand. It has to come by itself, it has to grow. The relationship between a mother and a child is also like that. It has to come out of love and not force.

These are the key aspects where my mom and I are different:

1. she respects only those with money. No money = deserves no respect. I am the complete opposite. I am nice to everyone irrespective of their financial status. Just because someone is poor that does not make them any less of a person.
2. She wants me to be crazy after money/jewels. I am not.
3. She does not care about career, ambitions, or anything. I am ambitious.

I don't know if my mother is actually a sadist or she is obsessed with me, obsessed so much that it is suffocating for me. 

AHHHHHHH I just wanted to get that out of my chest!!! I am confused and suffocated. I don't know what to do. 

Every parent would be happy to see their kid grow and achieve great heights in their career. Mine wish I would just throw everything away and keep doing what they want me to do.",13Jul2020,1

181,"My mental health is in the dumpster. It doesn’t feel like there’s a point to anything anymore. I wake up, I eat, I apply to a couple dozen jobs I’ll never hear back from, I play video games, I sleep. Rinse and repeat. That’s all I’ve been doing since quarantine started, and for me that was March 13.

I was gonna go to my dream college in the fall with a $2,000 scholarship. But with the pandemic and economic uncertainty, living on my own 7 hours away didn’t feel like the best plan. Now I don’t know what I want to do with my future. I’m living with my parents right now and it’s taking a toll.

Everything just takes so much work now. Everything is draining. Walking upstairs at the end of the day takes ages. Laying down in my bed is exhausting. Making food is impossible, and eating it is harder. I go days, sometimes weeks between showering unless I absolutely have to because it’s just so impossibly tiring to clean myself. My room is a mess and my diet is absolute shit. When I think about my future I am not hopeful. I dread it. I hate the present and I hate the thought of the future. 

My past few romantic interests have either been manipulative, abusive, a mix of the two, or have just used me to “pass the time” until someone better came along. I’ve never had many friends and I’m realizing now that the only way I ever had friends was because of school. Now that I’m graduated, and now after 4 months of quarantine, the only people I talk to are my parents. Maybe my brother. I wish I was exaggerating. 

Just to clarify, I don’t want to kill myself. I do not intend on doing that. I just can’t live like this anymore. I want to go out and meet people, but I can’t because of coronavirus. I want to eat well. I want to have a job and a plan. I want to be hygienic. I want my room to be clean.

He couldn't care less about my eyes, on my way back from school he invited me to go on a motorcycle ride. I was about 9 years old and I said yes, we went in a closed area and he stared caressing my thighs and smiling, asking me if I wanted to go play in the pool at his house and telling me to hold myself very close to him while motorcycling because it's dangerous. My parents weren't aware and we weren't riding in public areas. We went to his house and he asked me if I wanted a bathing suit, which I said yes to go in the pool. His wife and kids weren't there. He gave me a swimsuit and watched me changing and we went in the pool. He said to old myself close to him my legs around his waist because the pool was deep and dangerous. He walked around the pool with me in his arms, legs around his waist, very close, rubbing on me. He then said it was enough, got me changing again and I walked back home because he was too busy to walk me back. The day I moved away, he came to see me when my parents were in the house and did caress my butt. I never saw him again because I moved away.... I never talked about it... I found him on social media today, that thought still haunt me and I have a serious problem with my eyes because he didn't see it when I was a kid. He have kids, wife, still live at the same spot. What should I do... Stay quiet forever? Nobody will ever believe me... I need advice... Was it really pedophilia if he didn't try to have sex with me?",13Jul2020,1
195,"Throwaway because ya never know. And yes, I’m on mobile. I was tempted to put this in AITA but I wasn’t really sure. 

So something my mom said today has been sort of sticking with me and I (19f) wanted to get it off of my chest. 
I was driving home with my mom after being picked up from work. She made a comment about how my sister is always buying lunch for us. 

For context: my mom usually asks for us to buy lunch since she hasn’t been able to work during the coronavirus. We both work in grocery stores, about 4-6 hours, 5 days a week. I have been with my store a bit longer so I do make a bit more money than she does. When I buy, I usually pick up food from the store I work at. Cold-cuts, a bag of chips, and a bottle of soda or two (we have bread at home). When my sister buys, it’s usually fast-food which does cost more. I have no problem buying fast food every now and then. But I just like to save my money for bigger things like buying textbooks, food at school, Christmas, birthdays, etc. I’m not sure who’s exactly recommending that it be fast-food, either my sister or my mom. 

She was saying that since my sister always spends so much money on lunch that she is a little low on funds. She’s going away to college in two months for the first time and my mom is worried that she won’t have enough money. But the way she was talking, it sounded like she was guilt-tripping me for not spending as much money on lunch as my sister does. She kept repeating about how she *always* buys lunch, as if I don’t buy anything for them. And it *is* my sister’s money, she can choose what she wants to do with it. Plus like I said, I’m not exactly sure who’s suggesting it be fast food. 

I will admit that sometimes I like to buy a snack or a drink for myself and when I do, my mom has a breakdown. She says I only think about myself and how I don’t care about this family. It’s to the point of where I really want to buy a switch lite to play games with my friends but I’m afraid of a breakdown from my mom. 

So what should I do? If you need any more context, I’d be happy to oblige in the comments.",13Jul2020,1

Sorry that this is long. (((Warning: abuse)))

Backstory: I (f25) was in an emotionally, physically, and verbally abusive relationship for about 4 years. We met through his sister, my former best friend (f25) while at college. He and I instantly connected. I started hanging out with him on a daily basis and would only see my friends occasionally. That was the start of the isolation. While living at college he got me fired from two jobs, because he would call my job excessively if I didn’t answer or text him back, caused me a miscarriage from beating me up because I was talking to one of my guy friends at a party, and many explosions on my friends, causing them to stay away from me. I tried to stick up for myself against him once and that resolved in me having to go to the ER. He gave me a concussion. I made excuses for him for a long time. I was stuck, no matter what he did, I couldn’t leave him alone. After college, we moved in together and I found out that I was pregnant with my daughter shortly after. The abuse continued throughout my pregnancy, once my daughter was born and I saw her precious face, I knew I had to leave him and I did. I moved away with my daughter. 

My former best friend, his sister, knew about the abuse her brother was causing me but she’d help me make excuses for him. Her and I recently just had a falling out over something irrelevant that I don’t care to share. She ended up telling my abusive ex where I am with my daughter and where I work. My ex came to my job while I was working and demanded that I let him see our daughter. I left out of my job to talk to him so that he would go away. I ended up getting sexually assaulted (not raped) and thrown to the ground. After that he left. 

Today, I found out that my former best friend is helping him take me to court to fight for custody of our daughter. I am heartbroken at the chance of him taking her away from me. I don’t have any evidence of the abuse, being that I did not want him in trouble when I first left him. My restraining order request was denied. I don’t want him around her, he doesn’t deserve her. I just wish I knew what to do. I’m feeling really defeated.",13Jul2020,2
197,"TLDR; bf is suspicious as hell and gets angry when I ask about it unassumingly, the gaslights me. He hates when I touch his phone, gets weird when I touch his computer mouse etc. no sex, no intimacy, no interest in me—- Hiding something? Cheating? No idea. I don’t know what to think anymore— I quickly typed up a brief story of our relationship below so there may be typos etc: 




Deh fuck? Okay. So... my bf(25) has been really suspicious throughout the relationship (2yrs now) and anytime I’ve (me, 24) confronted him in a calm, UNASSUMING way he gets PISSED. Then minimizes his anger when he realizes he is wrong. So today, he told me he was at dinner. He got on his parents really fast (10 mins when it should take 20-30 depending on traffic however, he drives like a psycho so it’s somewhat believable that he drove and got there so fast)... then, while watching a show on his computer which we do 24/7 since it’s like our TV and we both watch shows on it, a notification slides and makes that text sound, so naturally I look up (I’m observant and it’s a natural reaction to look at an unexpected noise) and see that it’s his mom... I thought it was a little weird that his mom was texting him while he was currently eating dinner with them and not only that but I saw the text saying “don’t forget to call me about bday stuff”... I asked him why his mom was texting him at dinner and he said after awhile of the text bubble showing  “uhhh why are you freaking out??? I KNEW you were reading my texts?!? WTF!???... she texted me from across the room bc my dad mentioned my bday and she didn’t want to get yelled at... make sense??????” .... so I asked him 1.) why are you so mad? And 2.) why wouldnt she just tell you when you’re near her or when you two are closer? So, first he said his dad was talking about this over dinner and THEN she texted him, THEN he said he was in a different room w his dad and she overheard them talking so she texted him.... he’s been caught having nudes, LOADS of porn which I don’t care too much about unless it gets in the way of our Sexlife which hello, it has. No sex for weeks and when it does happen I have to initiate you asking him or having a talk about it in which he does it out of guilt (but says it’s bc of a different reason! I don’t want to sleep w someone bc they feel guilty, it’s feels like I’m taking advantage!!) not only that but some bitch sent him a link to her “only fans” account and he gets texts from so many weird verification things and when I ask about anything he just gets pissed and gaslights me till the subject changes. I’m not free of arguing and I am not perfect. I have definitely done a few things that warrant some frustration but I really only ask/talk about that stuff if I see red flags. He would stay in the bathroom for hours in the beginning and claim it was an addiction but then I found okcupid and bumble on his phone when he was showing me stuff on his phone. I’d tell him to delete, months later he’d still have it then claim to have forgotten. I saw our Vday picture cropped, me taken out.He saved the pic and said it was for linkedin or instagram but never ended up using it (supposedly) first he said it was to verify something then changed the story. I don’t know what to say, think, believe, or trust. I’ve told him that and he acts like I’m overreacting. Idk what to do. He said “I’ll take a polygraph to prove I’ve never cheated!” And that was sort of a red flag to me because cheaters typically offer that BS to ease the anxiety or try and develop trust. Oh! And he calls me names all the time now, and raises his voice louder than ever before. He was not like this at all before. He has an addiction (not anything life threatening or crazy) but he’s open with that so I do what to make of this. I know he’s doing something bc these are too many things to be a coincidence, but I can’t stay or know what it is... we’re together 24/7 bc we live together but “he goes to his parents” sometimes Wed, usually Sat, Sun. He turned his location on thru snap without me asking but honestly I have a feeling it’s fake or being shown through a fake phone tbh bc he got a verification from something like a fake phone or fake number. A woman answered one day when I was at work months ago, and then I called back and he said it was him playing around with a quiet/high pitch voice).... when I came over to see what that was about I started crying  and he was genuinely concerned and hugged me saying he was just doing that and said he was sort and that he would never ever cheat. UGH. We don’t talk about our future, what he wants etc...
I think he could just be extremely weird and private, but idk. I don’t know what to do! Please don’t say “you’re dumb he’s cheating” because he is really really weird and has always been, as well as always been verrryyyy private due to a traumatic incident when he was younger (BUT he was in the wrong at that time - his parents suspected addiction). I feel stupid already so please be kind and say nothing unless you’re experienced and genuinely want to help.",13Jul2020,1
198,"This is an incredibly long story and I'm going to shorten it significantly so please ask if you need more details. 

I started dating my first girlfriend 12 years ago and we dated for 6 and a half years (a few small breakups) and culminated in an engagement. Obviously it didn't work out, and we went our separate ways about 5ish years ago. I did everything I could to make her hate me and block me in every communicative area because I couldn't leave her alone even though we were best friends. I know how terrible that is but I was so in love (maybe obsessed) with her that I didn't know another way to try to move on from her and it seemed like the lesser of two evils between that an harassing her with unrequited love. Nowadays I'm still great friends with her brother and I see her occasionally. Every time I see her she's sweet and nice and goes out of her way to speak to me even though we never communicate in any other way and its probably the happiest moments of my life. But when I leave, I'm devastated knowing that I can't truly have her as a part of my life especially in the way I want her in my life. 

I guess the thing I need advise on is what should I do to move on? I've dated other people (even had a four year relationship), I've tried just being her friend, I go to counseling once a month, I even tried getting her back. Im scared that I am a monster and that I am obsessed with her. I don't want to be a bad person, and I don't want her to suffer at my hands ever, but I have a tremendous amount of pain associated with her and I don't know what to do.",13Jul2020,1

200,"So start it off, there might be grammar mistakes as I am writing this in hurry and on phone.
  
So I have a friend which has been at home for 6months straight due to Covid-19. His parents are paranoid or rather want to make sure she is safe. So while their parents work from home, they only go out once a week to get some necessities. 
  
I am well aware that he is a social person , a total extrovert and a boy who loves to party. So, I know staying home for a long time  is taking its toll on him. 
  
We do message daily and try to call each other occasionally. But at this point I already know what he does everday
  
Watches 3 movies a day.
Works outs
Eats regularly
Watches Tv series

This is basically how his day passes. We do sometimes hope on and play games.

So i need advice on things we can do , talk about, games? Basically anything . At this point I don't even feel like calling him since I already know what he is doing but I also do want to help him as he gets depressed.

Also to clarify, It effects him more than I do as I actually enjoy staying indoors.",13Jul2020,1
201,"This is a really long story but it’s interesting and I hope you guys can give me some good advice on what the heck to do. 

My husband got in a car accident and the other guy was at fault. The police were called and they both got an FR-10 form which is basically a police report of the accident with both drivers info and their insurance and other info about the officer and the accident. 

The guy who hit my husband did not have his license with him, no proof of insurance, AND he was driving a rental car. The officer let him give his name (let’s say he gave the name Michael Scott Murphy) and looked him up in the system to fill in the info for his driver’s license number and the insurance he gave was the car rental company’s info. Also, he had open containers of beer inside of his car which the officer saw and poured out. This will be important later.

My Husband gets home and we call the insurance company listed for Michael Scott Murphy which end up being the claims department for the rental car company. They tell us that we need to call the local place where he rented the car and give us the number. The manager at the local place gives us the number to the claims department and tells us we need to call them. Finally, the manager tells us that Michael Scott Murphy has Geico which is the same insurance we have so we give up and just call Geico.

While filing our claim with Geico they were able to look him up and started the claim on his insurance using his name/license etc. 

Fast forwards to today. “Michael Scott Murphy” shows up at our house and knocks on the door. Him and his wife/some lady begged us not to go through insurance and said that they would pay for us to take our car to the dealership or whatever we wanted. My husband basically freaked out that they dare come to our house (mainly because he knew the guy was drunk when the accident happened and he was pissed about that). We said we would consider it so they would leave and my husband went to shake the guys hand and asked his name. He says my name is Brad and my husband immediately got mad again  and said “why the hell would you lie about your name, we know your name” and told him to leave. The guy looked super freaked out and claimed that he lied about his name just now because my husband was scaring him and he apologized and said it was dumb. It was super awkward. 

We get inside. We start thinking. Maybe his name is actually Brad. So we look up Brad Murphy and there he is on Facebook. We lurk and we find the lady he came to our house with. We find the whole damn Murphy family and we find Michael Scott Murphy who is not the guy who hit by husband/the guy who came to our house. The guy who hit us is actually named Brad Alan Murphy. He has a police record three pages long (we printed it). He’s got DUI’s, hit and runs, driving without a license, and a million other things. 

The craziest part of all of this is that we looked up Michael Scott Murphy’s criminal record and we saw that he was arrested after the accident that day for the open containers in his car. Which means that Brad got freaking arrested as Michael and no one noticed and now Michael has a criminal record he probably doesn’t even know about. (We think they’re brothers) 

So basically this career POS hit my husband drunk with no identification and gave his brothers name and the cops just wrote it up and believed him. Now I’ve used Geico to find his innocent brothers insurance and made a claim against it which explains why this guy is so desperate to stop us from using the insurance. 

We called the officer who was at the accident and he didn’t sound like he believed us. Also, my address was supposed to be blacked out on the police report but it wasnt. So now Brad Alan Murphy, the desperate drunk criminal knows where I live and is going to be pissed that we figured this all out.

We’re planning on going to the police station in the morning to try to explain all of this to them but we’re worried that they’re just going to try to brush it under the rug. What would you guys do? 

TLDR: My husband got in a car accident and the guy who hit him gave the police the wrong name. Turns out to be his brothers name and he lied about it because he has a criminal record a mile long.",13Jul2020,1

I've been at my job a little over a year now and I've been in my career since the end of 2012. I'm a computer drafter. I feel competent using the programs and the only issues I usually have are due to security permissions in my computer. But I keep making mistakes. I thought I'd be doing better than I am by now. I don't know how to properly explain the mistakes I make, but I feel like it's a mix of carelessness and lack of knowledge. The careless mistakes aren't usually the same one over and over, just random. Ill go a while without making any, but then 2 or 3 will come up all at once. It really eats at me when I make mistakes.

I'm starting to wonder if there is something wrong with my head and if I'm a slow learner or if I need to change careers. I feel like all my coworkers from all the different places I've worked seem to live to work, while I'm working to live. I don't understand how someone can work 45+ hours a week without burning out.

203,So basically I have had this insecurity since middle school. I grew up having red hair and really pasty skin that almost makes me look sickly. Even though I love my red hair I got bullied so much in school for my skin color and those comments have stuck with me ever since. I have since been really insecure about my skin because it makes me feel different and ugly. I have tried to make it darker by using tanning sunscreen but I tan only very slightly and its barely noticeable. I really don't understand why people need to go out of their way to comment on something like that. I have gotten to really dislike my skin color because of those comments and I need to know how to just hide my paleness or just accept it how it is.,13Jul2020,1
205,"Maybe its the depression and anxiety, maybe its quarantine, who knows? Bottomline I[18M] have an amazing memory and lately its felt like its starting to drift and suddenly i’m forgetting things more often and i’m getting worried. Ontop of that yesterday i spent 2 years building up this giant photo collection in google photos and randomly it just crashed on me and I can’t get it to work and now i’ve been more bummed out than usual and couldnt get anything done.

My house has been having a roach problem recently and while i’m afraid of them, i’m pretty good at killing them, my fear comes from the idea that when I accidentally let one get away they’ll multiply and inevitably spread through my entire house. (this happened when i was little and used to live in an apartment and a giant one crawled on my mout and lips while i was sleeping) and basically seeing these roaches again is starting to kick my anxiety up to a 10 everyone room i go into at night i have a flash light and start desperately looking for a new one to kill, and since i find one each time it just makes the phobia worse. It’s gotten to the point where i’m scared and on edge at the slightest sounds that even IMPLY a roach is crawling somewhere. 

The roaches here in texas can get big and make noises when they walk on things so with a roach problem in my house even the tiniest of noises are setting off my anxiety and alarms. I heard squeaking coming from my closet just now and obviously theres a chance its nothing but it could be a legit rat from the way it sounded. Tbh i have a phobia of pests and rodents like rats and roaches so this isn’t good at all. We’ve never had rats before and unlike roaches I don’t have anything to kill them with and I don’t know how to track or catch them, and I don’t even want to do that. I’m smart enough this could either me a rats somewhere in the house and I need to catch it or my anxiety is just reaching new heights and is driving me crazy.

Tbh if i see even one rat, I don’t think i even have the mental strength or comprehension left to deal with it.

Its not the apparent, probable memory loss, or my google photos album, or the roaches and rats thats the problem specifically, its just all these things colliding and bubbling over all at once that is genuinely driving me mad.

What do i do? Cause I don’t even know which or what or even how to solve any of these things, and shit doing so, might just make the problem worse",13Jul2020,1
206,"Is this worth my time?

I’ve been dating a guy for several months now - he’s kind and funny. We have chemistry and the sex has been really great. We have a lot of common interests outside of the bedroom, too, so we always have fun when we are together. 

When we first met I could see him making an effort to spend time with me even though we have opposite work schedules (he works nights and I work days) AND he has a daughter that he has half of the time. Lately our communication has been really sparse and it has taken him several days to respond, if at all. I’ll admit that he’s never been much of a texter. In the beginning it was normal for us to check in once or twice a day, mainly to make plans about the next time we were going to see each other. 

The last time that we got together I texted him the day before to confirm our plans. I hadn’t heard from him in a couple of days so it made sense to check in with him. Instead of just confirming or cancelling he responded with a book of texts with reasons why I am “marriage material” but he isn’t looking to commit or build a life with anyone. We’ve never had a conversation about doing anything more than casual dating, so these texts came as a surprise. 

Each time we are together he does things like open the car door and insists on paying at our dates even though I’ve expressed the desire to take turns. He talks about things he wants to do together and places we need to go. Comments like that made me feel like he was pretty into me. He knows that I dealt with some physical abuse in my last relationship and I wasn’t looking for much beyond casual dating/companionship.

He texted me today after not talking to me for a week saying he’s had “baby mama drama and that he’s been in a ‘mood’”. Seems like such a weak excuse. 

Is he just not really into me? Why do dudes send mixed signals like this? Can I get some advice on how to respond/what to do with this?",13Jul2020,1

I’m (15f) a pretty quiet and shy kid, but I can match a name to a face and am able to recognize most of my classmates when walking down the hallways, etc. That being said, I wouldn’t ask for their phone numbers, and I wouldn’t give them mine. 

About a month ago a girl who I’ve never met before (literally NEVER even seen before, not even out of the corner of my eye in the hallway) requested to follow/friend my social medias. I was fine with it - in her bio, it said that she goes to the same school as I do, and that she’s set to graduate the same year I do. 

The problem arose when she dm’d both of my social medias asking for my phone number. I’m kind of weird with my phone number - it’s mostly reserved for family, coaches, etc., since most of my friends talk over our social media platforms.

Not only do I feel awkward about giving out my phone number anyway (and I realize that’s probably extremely snobby, I should be thankful to even have a phone and people to give my phone number to), but I don’t even know this girl.

I wore a regular tank top (not revealing because I don’t *like* to show off cleavage) that had a drop of paint on it and normal black cotton shorts. Today, he tells my mom she needs to take me somewhere to be taught how to dress. He would NEVER say that about my sisters. My little sister literally wears super revealing clothing, he doesn’t say anything. I wear normal clothes on a day that’s 118 degrees and apparently I don’t know how to dress.

First, she reconnected with an old friend from middle school whom we both cut out of our lives because she was toxic. I still believe she's toxic and am not friends with her, but I can easily tolerate people so I've been nice. Under normal circumstances, I'm fine with my roommate having friends over.

My mom has an autoimmune disease, my grandma is old and her medication makes her immune system weak, my grandpa is old and has cancer, and while my aunt is healthy, she works in a hospital with people who aren't. As you can see, there could be serious consequences if any of them got the virus, which my roommate is fully aware of. My friend has a job at our apartment complex, and since our manager is amazing, she's had the office closed to the public for months. I work at my college, and since that's closed, I won't have a job until we go back to school. The only contact with the outside world that we have is when we get groceries once a month. I've talked with my mom and decided that once school starts and I have to go back to classes, I likely won't be visiting anyone for a long time since it's too risky. This is basically my last month to see my family until the virus is under control. So, her having friends over now is making me nervous, especially since cases in our state are rising.

Outside of the virus situation, I honestly just really don't like having this friend over. She's rude and inconsiderate, and is loud at all hours of the day. What makes this worse is that my roommate told her friend that she could stay with us ""until coronavirus is over"" which could be months, without asking me! She said the friend would just be doing dishes to ""pay rent,"" which I find absolutely ridiculous. Not only did she not ask me, but if someone is going to be staying with us for months, they need help pay for rent, utilities, and groceries. 

The friend also smokes weed all the time. My roommate and her friend have actual medical uses for it, but my roommate has said to me that neither of them actually need to smoke that much and that they're just doing it for fun and to get high. I wouldn't have an issue with this, except our apartment has a no smoking policy, and since the smell is strong, we could easily get reprimanded by our apartment complex. This also means that I can never have my boyfriend over, as weed severely irritates his allergies and makes it to where he can't break correctly. 

My roommate also had more friends over tonight, who have jobs where they are in close contact with the public. So not only has she let someone stay at our apartment for months, she's bringing other people here who could very well get us sick. I understand that having friends and socializing is important, but this isn't the time to be hanging out with anyone and everyone. I haven't had a single person over in months, but it seems like my roommate isn't even trying.

I'm also worried that if this friend is still here when I start school, I won't get any sleep. I'll have an 8:30am class MWF, but my Tuesdays and Thursdays start later. Her and her friend routinely stay awake until at least midnight and are loud in the living room. Then, after keeping me up until past midnight (usually until 1am), the friend wakes up at 8am and is loud in the kitchen and living room.  I can't fall asleep if there's any noise at all, and my roommate knows this. She has her own room with a TV and attached bathroom, so I truly don't understand why they can't spend more time in there during the hours that they know I'm sleeping. This could be a real problem during school. If I'm awake until midnight, I'd only be getting around 6 hours of sleep ( assuming I fall asleep almost immediately). 

I do love my roommate and genuinely think she's a nice person, but it feels like she's just stopped considering the fact that she's not the only one who lives here. I really don't know how to start going about this and how to talk to her. I have no problem hurting her friend's feelings, but I don't want to hurt my roommate too. I feel so angry and annoyed all the time now, and my mental health hasn't been nearly as good as it was before her friend started staying here. What should I do and how should I go about this?",13Jul2020,1
218,"Backstory: My friend has a crush on a classmate of mine so I invited him over to my friend’s house. Without telling me my friend brought another girl over but I thought nothing of it.

So later that night we’re watching Star Wars and the other girl starts getting very touchy-feely with me. I was into it at first until she started staring at me. (By the way, I’m a very anxious guy and really self-conscious) she then puts my hand in her “area”. I started doing what you guys probably assume all while Star Wars is on. Later I went home early and felt nothing but guilt. I started to realize that I just really enjoy laughing with friends playing video games,  but I really want the other stuff too.

221,"Hey everyone. First time posting here! I need some advice about my first move out of my parents’ house. Today I viewed an apartment at such a perfect location (I can walk to so many essential places, including work). The potential roommate who currently lives there is awesome and we clicked literally right away! We got along so well and my mom, who came with me, trusts her too. 

I have a new puppy (16 weeks) that would come with me and the roomie was under the impression that pets were allowed in the unit. But later today, she asked just to make sure, and the landlord said no pets are allowed. 

The thing is, where I’m from, they can’t technically enforce this “rule.” There are work-arounds to this because it’s not actually a policy or law, it’s simply a landlord’s preference (they haven’t said that they are specifically allergic). And also, my new pup is licensed and is in the process of going through crate and obedience training! She’s shaping up to be a good dog. She’s a puppy though, and sometimes things are unpredictable. I have about a month and a half before moving out. So my options are:
- Take the risk with this amazing roommate and go the don’t-ask-but-beg-for-forgiveness route, where we wouldn’t mention the pup when I sign the lease 
- Don’t take the risk and try to find a different option 

The roomie is incredible and makes me feel so welcomed—this is super important to me because it’s my first time moving out and I want to be comfortable with the new space I’m in! I also want a good relationship with my housemate, which I think I’ll have. She also loves my pup. The location is perfect and the rent is perfectly within my budget.

What hurts is that they didn't even consider me in their plans or invite me to go with them. I privately messaged them saying that I was glad that they got to spend time with each other,  but I was hurt because they excluded me and asked why that happened and if I did something that made them exclude me. I am doubly hurt because I know that 2/3 saw the message and neither one had the balls to respond.  For a long time now I've had the feeling that I was a spare tire in this friendship,  this confirms it.  I've since deleted the group chat to try to help get rid of some of the negative feelings,  yet I'm tempted to find a way to snooze them, if not completely block them.

226,"Disclaimer: I know reddit isn't a doctor and can't formally diagnose me, but I wanted to see what you guys thought/ if anyone has similar experiences.

A little background, I'm 22f and just graduated (yay). When it comes to mental health, I've been previously diagnosed with generalized anxiety &amp; depression. Maybe it's just quarantine so I have some time to actually reflect, but I've been wondering if maybe I've had ADD or ADHD this whole time and it was either misdiagnosed or just missed altogether. 

I never felt like I fit the stereotypical symptoms of this disorder (bouncing off the walls as a kid and stuff), but after doing some reading I've been seeing that ADD symptoms can manifest differently in women than men &amp; that women are often misdiagnosed with anxiety as opposed to ADD. For me, I've always had a hard time concentrating when studying. I'll try and focus then either lose motivation or get bored/easily distracted then get hyper focused on something else that's not what I should be doing. And that's what confuses me- I can focus on things I'm interested in, but not on menial day to day stuff or studying in particular. It's also difficult for me to put things in order of what I need to do first, second, etc. I also forget things a decent amount, like where I JUST put something or stupid stuff like that. It can also be difficult for me to pay attention to what someones saying and I tend to interrupt, although I've tried my best to curb the latter after my friend pointed it out hahaha

The part about this that I'm a bit ashamed to admit is that in college, I tried Adderall without a prescription quite a few times. It doesn't feel like im ""high"" when I take it, more just able to do things in the right order and for a longer period of time because I'm not getting distracted or off task. But I know Adderall is a stimulant so it can help almost anyone so I'm conflicted. This illicit use is embarrassing for me because I feel like a doctor would judge me for this or not believe me and think I'm just another kid trying to get a prescription without actually having a mental health disorder.

what do you guys think/think I should do? this whole thing is causing me a lot of conflict internally, so any advice would be appreciated",13Jul2020,1
227,"As a background, I am a divorced male in my early thirties and I now stay with my mom to help take care of her. She's mostly self-sufficient but barely, having dealt with cancer and the like already.

As it is, she's financially capable of staying in the house I grew up in for maybe 10 years until her money runs out. I hope she lives longer than that but she is betting that she doesn't. Either way, she still worries about her finances.

As for me, I have very little aspirations for a family. That can change but I am fine taking the role of a dutiful son for a decade or so. This means me living with her is no issue.

My parents were not always wise with their money and this house she has lived in for decades still has 80% of its mortgage left. 

Today I had the random thought, what if I bought her house? I mentioned the idea to her 10 seconds after I thought of it. Therefore, I obviously had put no thought into it.

She then gave me a list of all of the reasons why it would be wonderful. I also added to her list that I would feel much better about me saying my mom lives with me than me saying I live with my mom (ha!).

But the idea also stresses me out a bit. I have only ever rented and have never taken the responsibility of homeownership. 

I don't make a great deal of money and my future plans are in flux due to the nature of my job not being my planned career choice. However, looking at the numbers, a 15-year mortgage would still be less than 1/4 of my income. A 30-year would obviously be doable.

I don't know. I won't decide anything for some months as I'd like a better down payment first. I plan to pay off my car within a month or so making me debt free too.

Other relevant notes: 

I do not have the desire to keep her house long term. 

I have a brother who is awesome and I expect no significant pushback. At worst, he will feel like he now needs to do something remarkably generous out of guilt.

If I do finally get the job in my chosen career it may require a move and therefore I would need a second place for me to live (ew).

239,"I know, the title sounds horrible and it probably is. 

For context, my friend and I are both women and have been very close friends since forever. We’ve been through almost the same things, we grew up together and all that stuff. About a year ago, we had a conversation were she admitted that she thought she was bisexual cause she had always been attracted to women, but never slept with one cause she was in a relationship at the time. Turns out I felt exactly the same way, but I was also in a relationship with a guy. We kinda hinted that we were attracted to each other but didn’t do anything about it. 
Fast forward to when quarantine started, I was in very bad terms with my bf and she was already single, so I texted her insinuating that something may happen between the two of us, but she told me that she was already dating one of my guy friends. I thought nothing of it and was happy for them, I ended up breaking up with my bf and everything was good for about three months. 

A few weeks ago, my friend texted me saying that she couldn’t resist the urge of being with a women, but her boyfriend didn’t agree on having a threesome or anything like that, and she didn’t want to break up with him. The thing is that I completely understand her, she’s not able to experience her own sexuality and that’s driving her crazy, but she’s very very in love with her boyfriend. 
She talked to her boyfriend about the situation and he was very very upset, and told her to never bring the subject up again.
We talked about it and ended up concluding that she would “kiss” (I’m pretty sure she meant sleep with) another girl for the first time, not tell him, but if she feels like she likes women more, to actually talk to him about the issue. The thing is that for that she would need someone that:
A. She’s attracted to and also likes women. 
B. She trusts a lot, so nobody knows about the situation
C. Someone she knows very well

I’m the perfect candidate for the job, and I will also benefit from this because I want to be sure about my sexuality and sleep with a woman for the first time.

245,"

This fall I was supposed to be student teaching. After five years of switching my majors multiple times, going between graphic design, English education, I finally fell in love with art education. And now I’m completely drained of any desire to become a teacher.

Last fall I had the privilege to work with a local art teacher. Seeing how a diverse classroom all looked up to her, saw her as a safe space to go to, I knew that this was my dream job. Growing up gay in small town Iowa, I always felt alone in this world. If I could make someone feel safe in this world, be someone I needed when I was younger, then it would all be worth it. Now I’m drained of any passion I once had. I will forever love art and helping youth, but it has become apparent teachers are disposable sacks of meat that just need to babysit children while their parents are off working.

My heart is so broken.

In the last two days, three of my friends have test positive. I turn 25 in a couple of weeks. In January, I was so excited to student teach. It felt like my life was truly starting. I’m the first person to go through college. My Dad dropped out of high school to work on his parents farm. My Mom suffers from severe depression and doesn’t leave the house anymore. I haven’t left this county ever since March; I only go to work and always wear my mask. I do this because I care about those around me. I don’t want my parents or older coworkers to get sick, or die.

Many people where I live see masks as an infringement on their rights. I hardly see people wear them here now. My friend, who just started teaching, told me to just wear my mask and wash my hands and I’ll be okay. But now I keep seeing news stories of teachers dying even though they did just that! On top of this, I saw my student teaching advisor shopping for groceries where I work, no mask, acting as if everything was fine. 

That’s when it dawned on me. If people don’t want to treat it seriously, be my guest. My state won’t require schools or public to wear masks. I’m so, so tired. I don’t know what to do. I was so close to graduating, but now I don’t even want to teach anymore. What should I do?

Should I ask if I can postpone student teaching until the spring of 2021? I DONT want to leave college empty handed. Even if I end up working in a grocery store my whole life, I want my degree. I’ll be the first one in my family to get one. Should I switch my major again? I already have a art history minor. Maybe I should just turn that into a major, and try to find a job at a museum or something.

This might sound stupid, but.. I haven’t spoken to another gay man in almost six months. I feel so utterly alone right now. It just feels like no matter what choice I make, it’s not going to be the right one. I wish my parents or brothers knew what this felt like, but they don’t. Please. Someone help me. I don’t know what to do.",13Jul2020,1

248,So.. I always knew this was a problem. I’d feel strongly about a situation but put my feelings and emotions aside because I fear conflict. My life has been a roller coaster of events. I was molested (which I’ve never said or even typed out fully before) when I was really young. Perhaps 5-6 years old and it lasted for God knows how long. I’m 19 now and I’ve never told my family. My parents got a divorce so I moved out the country I was born in when I was 8. I can’t vividly remember but I’m sure they fought as my dad was a very loud and expensive person. The only thing I can remember is crying asking my mom why doesn’t love my dad anymore. Moving to the US we were very poor. I felt bad asking for things for school or just things in general. My mom was dealing with so much that I tried to be small in a way? I was getting bullied heavily for my accent and had a great relationship with my mom prior to the move but that just stopped.. I was too scared to tell her or ask for help.  Every since then my relationship with conflict has been terrifying. I’m in college now and I want to go in a feild where I would have to be a boss of many people.. I also want a relationship. The guy that I’m currently talking to made a joke and for a split second I thought he was angry and I didn’t know what to do.. so yes. My question is how do I get rid of my fear of conflict?,13Jul2020,1
249,"Hi r/advice. I think I’ve got a pretty entertaining one for ya!

My father has always been a pretty commanding presence in my life. It doesn’t ever seem like he really cares what I have to say at all. Anyways, I’m a 19 year old college student and my father has never been too happy with my shitty work ethic. I’ve always understood that one day I’d have to get off my lazy ass and make something of myself, but I’ve been trying to enjoy my ability to be lazy while it lasts. I was denied a childhood due to some family issues, so I’m just trying to enjoy the time I have left as someone without many responsibilities. I really have no problems with working, as I’ve worked jobs before this one, but in this situation I think my dad took it a bit too far. My dad was able to hook me up with a job at the hospital where he works. I never really wanted this job, but my father signed me up anyways. He basically forfeited my summer of freedom without my consent in exchange for a full time summer-job. I never really thought a job was something you sign someone else up for, but that’s not really the point. We have an hour long commute and I wake up at 5AM everyday. I’m okay at the job and I’m actually learning a lot, but the fact that my dad disregarded my feelings really pisses me off. I wake up ticked off everyday. I yell at him during a lot of our car rides together. He doesn’t really listen to what I have to say, even when I’m civil. He just says I’m a loser or I’m lazy and doesn’t seem to want to validate my feelings...I feel pretty betrayed and I feel like he just doesn’t give a fuck about how I feel. I’m making alright money, but I don’t care or need it. I really have no motivation or need for this job right now. How can I not be so pissed off every morning when the person who is causing me this anger is right in front of me? How can I make tolerating work easier for me? I can’t even tell if I have the right to feel this way or if I’m just acting spoiled?

251,"My mother is a social worker, and I believe I have evidence of HIPAA violations, but I am not convinced on whether I should report it or not, partially because of bias from a complicated relationship with her.
The info I have is varied, but the biggest thing is the address and number of one of her clients as well as info on what said client struggles with/why they are a client. My mother will sometimes leave notes out, does not close the door for a work call if she even bothers to go to another room, and her work computer has a home on the couch or endtable of the living room.
My mother also has allegations about stealing money from someone she used to take care of in a less professional setting, but the allegations might just be because of a bad history with all the people involved.
The main thing causing a holdup about whether or not I should is the primary reason I'm thinking about it might be her mistreatment of me. I am expected to loan money to her constantly despite often not being repayed and having to pay for my own expenses, including college. If I try to refuse she threatens to kick me out and take everything I did not directly pay for myself (including things like gifts). Additionally my mother doesn't watch the dog during the day (she's working from home due to covid) and I often have to clean up a mess from the dog in my room.

256,"I am 25 years old, and live with my significant other. Recently, I made the decision to change career paths. When I floated the possibility of quitting my current job to my parents, they freaked out, thinking something was mentally wrong or that I was abusing drugs. My job pays well and is in my field of study, what more could I want? Well, the job sucked and I had zero passion for what I did; I was burnt out after only three months. I have been very depressed and when I confided in my mother about it, she told me to have my doctor increase my meds. 

I had an opportunity arise at what seemed like the perfect time: a lesser paying job but at a company I believed in doing something related to my personal interests. I mentioned to my mother that I had applied for this job and was immediately berated; “wow, really? can’t believe you would even consider that.” So, I had the interview and was offered the job on the spot, and really hit it off with the managers during the interview. I had already quit my current job, having quit at the beginning of the week and not told my parents any of this.

I share my location on my iPhone with my mom (I know, it was my own fault, thanks) and she will see tomorrow that I am not at work, as I have a two week window between jobs. She will then call and text me incessantly about it, and I am afraid she will go so far as come to my place of residence or call the cops. This may also happen if I switch my location sharing to “off,” because she will get the notification that this happened and will react in a similar paranoid manner.

263,"So for reference I had a pretty abusive childhood, and then was horrifically bullied (sexually assaulted/physical attacks) in high school, and then when I made it to college I fell into a ""relationship"" with a guy that abused me in every way possible as well as his two friends.

I got pregnant at 18, lost the baby around christmas because I was stupid and told my ex I was pregnant hoping it would change him.

I was raised to hate middle eastern people (my parents would tell us kids all the terrorist things they did and never anything good). I hated asian people because both of my older brothers did and I was desperate for their approval/to be like them. My parents were (and still are) phobic to anything lgbtq.

Thankfully I grew out of that, recognized it for what it was and took action.

I am non-binary, currently 21 (half a year free of my relationship ayy :)) and scheduled for top surgery etc.

I've seen a psychiatrist and psychotherapist and have been diagnosed with BPD, possible psychotic tendencies, anxiety, and depression.

I play a lot of violent video games. My psychiatrist says it's how I 'funnel' my 'sadistic desires'.

However I used to be able to play for fun. I used to be chill and laugh and it was an escape from reality. However lately it's just been stress. Because I am always concerned about my kill death ratio etc.

Of course it's the video game world so there will always be those douchebags. I tend to need provoking to lash out, at least online. Some messages are tame just saying ""trash"" or something, but others say stuff I do not wish to repeat and it resonates deeper with me because it reminds me of my past and stuff.

However I've begun saying things I swore I would never say. I would target a person for their race to try and 'hurt them back' which is unacceptable. No reason for that behaviour at all. Problem is I tend to say something unkind and then not care... Like I really struggle with empathy and compassion and so I don't usually feel bad for things even if I know I should feel bad.

How do I curb this behaviour? It's getting out of hand. My psychiatrist isn't very helpful because he makes excuses saying that my resentment/bitterness towards humanity and humans as a whole is ""justified"" and shit. Like yeah, maybe I have a reason but that doesn't mean I get a free pass for some of the stuff I do or say. There are people out there who have suffered like me and they can still manage to be decent people.

I just feel like I'm becomming crueler with passing time. And I want to not be like my parents or brothers and hurt someone because of their race, or even just in general. Age, race, gender, it can all be used to hurt. I feel really hypocritical because I go through all these horrible things and then I turn around and start acting the same way in some ways.

I really want to stop this but like I write something and then it'll take me a full few hours to realize it. I've tried to cut communications but then I'm cutting myself out of the times when I'm kind and stuff.. I just don't know what to do.

I do not want to be ""allowed"" to act this way. I wanna be a good person. Problem is I haven't had a role model that's good. 

I just can't believe myself sometimes when I think about things I say and do. And I am afraid I'm becoming my ex in some ways and I want to do everything I can to stop and like act like a good person and treat others with respect and stuff.

271,"Tl;dr - this guy (17M) manipulated me into a relationship while I was 14, touched me without consent on multiple occasions, and is now coming back into my life. I don’t know what to do.



I honestly don’t know why I’m writing this, because I’ll probably never post it. I guess I just need to get this off my chest.

From Grades 6-9, I went to an international school in China. The population was mainly American, Cantonese, and various Asian countries. When I was in Grade 6, I befriended a guy who was Grade 8. We met at a sleepover party hosted by a mutual friend. At the time, he was into another girl, who was also a friend of mine. At the party, a group of us were playing truth or dare, and he ended up confessing that he liked the girl. 

She rejected him but they stayed friends, and he remained into her. At the end of my Grade 7, the girl ended up moving to a different school. The guy was devastated, and I became closer with him as I tried to offer comfort so he could move on. 

It turns out that he began developing feelings for me, as a “rebound.” I remember one time in Grade 8, we were walking somewhere together and out of nowhere, he took my hand. I was caught off guard and felt incredibly uncomfortable holding his hand, yet I didn’t say anything. I didn’t know what he was doing, and I let it happen.

There was another instance where he was feeling sad, so I snuck outside to meet him and be supportive. We were sitting together on a bench, and he again took my hand. This time, he went further by asking: “can I be selfish?” 

Like last time, I didn’t understand what was going on, or what his intentions were. I instinctively felt that it wouldn’t end well, yet I didn’t say anything. I guess he took it as a yes, because he leaned over and hugged me tightly. I didn’t move, I didn’t protest or shake him off despite how uncomfortable it was for me. Instead, I tried to justify it as “him feeling sad and needing comfort.”

We remained friends and kept talking. He confessed that he liked me, but I turned him down. This happened twice over the course of 8th Grade.

In 9th Grade, some of the people around me had started experimenting with alcohol. They’d go drinking at clubs, which nobody objected to because it was okay in China. I never went with them.

A new girl who became a friend of mine went, and got drunk. He was also there. According to both their recounts of what happened, after the night of drinking, they met at the field and she kissed him while drunk. I don’t know if this was what he wanted from her, and at the time I didn’t know enough about consent and drinking to say anything. Looking back, however, I realize how fucked up the situation is. She was drunk. She was 14, and he was 17. The day after it happened, there was tension between them, and she confessed to me how scared she felt.

A few weeks later, he and his friend group managed to convince me to try drinking alcohol, so I could “test my limit.” They bought the drinks and I went to his house, where they were all gathered. I felt suspicious and unsafe, even though I thought they were my friends. I told myself that I wouldn’t let myself get drunk. Although I did drink alcohol, I only felt tipsy. Yet, I pretended to be extremely drunk, saying stuff about how I would remember none of this the next day. 

Yes, I was stupid to stay in that situation. Hindsight is truly 20/20 and I see how badly it may have gone for me. My reasoning at the time was that I wanted to see if I could truly trust them, if they would actually take care of me or not. 

At one point, two of them carried me onto the bed, where I saw the guy was lying. They put me down next to him and for a while we lay on the bed together, me feeling miserable and extremely uncomfortable. He turned around and asked me: “can I be selfish?” 

Practically every alarm bell rang. I felt disgusted by him, and I said “no.” I got up and left the room. Shortly afterwards, I left the house and went home with a headache from the alcohol. That was the end of this experience. We never talked about after, and I never brought it up because I thought that maybe I was just over-exaggerating. We remained friends.

A few months later, I found out that I would be moving to a different country. I told him, as well as a couple other close friends. During one of our conversations, the topic of dating came up. I mentioned that since this was my last year here, I might be willing to experiment with dating, because I had never been in a relationship before. “What better time than now,” I thought. 

In March of 2019, he asked me to be his girlfriend. I still have the exact texts saved.  I said yes, not because I wanted to, but because I felt like I owed it to him or something. Once again, looking back, I see how flawed this mindset is.

We dated. Once, we watched a movie together, at his house, in his room, home alone. Yeah, fucking foolish of me, I know. At one point I was scared (it was a horror movie), and I turned my body away. He saw this, wrapped his arms around me, and kind of forced me to look at the screen. I felt absolutely disgusted by his touch, but I passed it off as him playing around and didn’t say anything. He was gripping me tightly and I felt so, so uncomfortable. 

The relationship lasted only three weeks or so before I broke it off. We remained friends until the end of the school year. I moved across the world to Canada, yet sometimes the memories of my experiences still cross my mind. I was 14, and he was 17. It’s only now that I realize the power dynamic, and that he took advantage of me. I’ve only just realized that never asked for consent to anything he did to me. He simply did it, and I just let him because I didn’t know what else to do.  Looking back, it was a manipulative relationship with a staggering power dynamic, and copious red flags were present. 

I learned a lot from my experience. I learned to set boundaries, to identify red flags, to be assertive when something a guy does makes me feel unsafe. I just wish I’d known this a year ago. 

Again, I’m writing this for myself. I guess I needed to let this out. I want to share my experience but I’m scared to speak up. I’m scared because this guy is enrolling at [university] in Fall 2020. I’m scared because I live on campus and use the university facilities often. I can’t stand the idea of him being near me again. I’m so fucking scared, and so I guess this is my silent cry for help.

Part of me wants to send him this. I want him to know, and I want to confront him. But I’m still so inexperienced, and my judgement is very clouded. I honestly just need advice - what should I do?",13Jul2020,1
272,"I got a response to a comment on a site and the person then seemed to take a liking to me and sent me a private message asking how I got so many followers and such.

I said 17 and they said that they are 13 but asked if it was ok if we could be friends. I said yes and (because it's a writing site) offered to help them with writing if they wanted and even offered to write a story with them. I usually only log on at night and because of that, they asked if I could log on in the day because they have no one to talk to ever.

273,"Sooo I'm 14f and I have been dealing with this weird feeling of loneliness for about two years. I constantly feel unimportant and like an extra in a movie about my family. My mom has walked in on me crying in my room but every time she does, she asks me what's wrong, I tell her honestly how I feel, and then she yells at me because not everything is about me and I'm not the victim. Not being a victim is a constant thing my parents tell me and now it's my mindset. When I get my feelings hurt: *chill out you're not the victim here,* when I get punched in the face: *it's okay maybe they're just having a bad day,* when I'm getting bullied for a straight 3 years and don't do anything about it: *calm down it's okay you'll be fine you're not the victim.* And I don't know why my parents can't just treat me like a normal kid. I know most teenagers wish to be treated like adults, but I hate it. Having to take care of 4 little girls and being treated like a nanny and not a daughter kinda SUCKS. And Quarantine hasn't been so kind to me with this matter.

I'm also having problems with being able to talk to my best friend about stuff. She's the same age as I am and she has issues understanding other people's emotions and her own. I've tried asking her how I can help but she tends to ignore my questions and say she's fine. I love her with all my heart but I hate to see her not being able to comprehend how she feels all the time.

I also just have had a crazy week. On Tuesday a friend of mine came over and spent the night two nights in a row. The first night she slept over, we were watching a movie and my ex texted me. I kinda had a mini panic attack because we were a really toxic relationship. I ignored the text and replied about 20 minutes later. He didn't reply until the next day but when he did we had a nice conversation beginning with him claiming he just ""wanted to catch up"". That day we dyed our hair blue (which was really fun btw) and he told me I would look pretty with blue hair. It kinda caught me off guard and just said thanks. He hasn't replied and now I can't get him out of my head. 

Then the second night this guy (who I have been his wingman forever to help him tell my best friend he likes her) texted me and said ""We're a couple now no questions asked"". So I was kinda confused because it was kinda out of nowhere and a little suspicious. I just replied with a question mark and he continued the conversation as if nothing happened. A little later my friend and I snuck out with our skateboards and we went to meet up with her boyfriend and his cousin. (I only skated. Don't worry I said no to drugs.) And he texted me saying that was his way of telling me he liked me. 

So her boyfriend's cousin was highkey really cute. He asked for my snap but I don't have social media so I gave him my number. Turns out he's from Pennsylvania and was only visiting :( (I'm from the south btw) We've been talking for a couple of days now and we've joked around talking about our first date and all the movie theaters we'd cuddle in but I don't know if I'm just fooling myself and trying to fill my loneliness with something that'll never happen or if we could genuinely work out. I asked him that question this morning because it has been bugging me forever and he didn't respond all day. I'm scared I screwed everything up.

So in conclusion... I don't know how to deal with my family life right now, My best friend needs me but she won't admit it, my ex texted me and now I miss him again, A guy I most definitely don't like the same way he likes me is nonstop texting me and I want to cut him off but don't want to be mean because I'm his only friend, and I'm falling in love with a guy who won't even text me back after a serious question and I'm going insane over it :/ I need help :(",13Jul2020,1

275,"Do I have narcissistic traits? I have some attachment issues, and I've been identifying these issues with narcissism. As someone who have narcissistic parents, just now I realize that I may have (or not) narcissistic behaviour. 

Disclaimer: I am not looking for medical advice, by all means I'm sure I must seek a therapist xD.

Last year, my ex gf dumped me, and I went to an episode of paranoia, and then shit just hit the fan from that moment....In sum, I was ''expecting to my gf define my self'' (what my therapist said back then) in other words, I was the type of guy who did everything to please her in order to get \[a feeling which I can't describe\], just reenacting some situations. As I couldn't change or commit to the relationship, I wasn't living my life for myself. I kept my vicious cicles of trying to please her, fearing failing her, rejecting her, feeling guilty untill I hit the bottom, when our break up triggered me that paranoid episode.

  
now I realize that I **really** need therapy to my attachment issues

I  always felt like I'm just like any other dude, and if I have any  problem, the problem it's just myself and I need to fix it. but turns  out that i'm constantly worried, trying to keep my mind busy, so I don't  have to face anxiety. And most things that I get excited it's ultimaly  just things that will sort of define me. Like do something in order to get good at, drawing for example,  bt this feeling drains my energy and excitement. I've been seeking for awareness  since my 13y and the most empty and recurrent advice given to me is ''just be  yourself''. 

Because of this pandemic, i came back to my mother's house, and more than never i feel so empty and confused, as if I deleted 3 years of my life and started again. 8 months passed to me realize the many flags of narcissistic traits that they were pointing out. Here, i just highlighted this definition issue, bc seems more visible and easy too explain

276,"Back in December, I met a man online out of despiration. He never met me IRL. He treated me, a trans woman (20 F) like his Queen at first. We both talked about the possibility of Marrying each other. He then got mad at me if I wanted to watch TV, or have alone time. We sent each other pics of ourselves. He then asked me for money to fix is iPhone 10 Max. He sent me flowers on Valentine's day. One day in late February, I dumped him. It was one ugly breakup. He blamed me for everything and told me that upon us breaking up at that point, he kept me as a secret, which solidified everything for me. I thought at that point, he was ashamed of dating me for me. Covid 19 hit the US shortly afterwards. I see one of my best friends sharing the news that she's having a child.

I then tried to look for another suitable partner to no avail Then, tonight, I find out that one of my soon to be former coworkers is engaged. I'm starting to think that nobody wants to date me. I've lost my faith in humanity, single and alone. I've lost my own belief in romance. Why does nobody want to date me? Why am I still Single? Is there anything I can do to find a suitable partner?

I (19F) noticed my apartment has had bed bugs for about two months now. I reported them right away, the complex did nothing and blamed it on me. The second time I found them, I reported it to my complex again, and nothing. I called the Health Department of my county and they told me they would put someone on my case, but no one ever called me back. Finally after emailing my complex continuously they finally had someone come and spray. Problem is they only sprayed my apartment and one other persons apartment upstairs. 

I’ve talked to a few of my neighbors and asked them if they’ve seen  anything, and they said the bed bugs have been here for years. They won’t fumigate the whole building, and they continue to put the blame on me that I’ve brought in the bed bugs. I’ve only lived here since February. They’ve billed me twice, once for inspection and once for the spraying. I’m very young and not sure where to go from here.

279,"Hi everyone! (I’m a F 19, my partner is a M 20)

So, I’m having a bit of a hard time with my relationship right now. I have some trust issues for sure, and it makes it hard for me to be with someone, especially in a long distance relationship. My partner and I have been together for 4 months now, and we’ve known each other for a year. We met in college and we clicked super well and hung out a lot, became best friends, and ended up falling for each other.

To sum up this long story, I have a lot of image issues. It’s super hard for me to ever consider myself as good enough. What makes things more difficult for me is that my partner has some insanely good looking female friends. They’re all literal models for small agencies, super gorgeous and slim girls. His wallpaper for example is a picture of him with a bunch of them (with one other guy), including one girl he’d made out with in the past. Every time I think about the fact that he hangs out with these girls I just think that I have no chance. How can I compete??? I just feel like drifting away from this. It gives me anxiety and makes me think about him potentially cheating on me all the time. At the same time though I love the guy! Truly. He means the world to me but I honestly just don’t feel secure enough. 

We haven’t seen each other in 3 months, aka 3/4 of the relationship. What do I do? Do I stay or do I leave or I don’t know honestly I feel very confused. This probably makes no sense as a post but if you can read and decipher it that would be lovely. I should also mention that I’ve been cheated on twice in the past. Anyways... I guess that’s that.

280,"Recently I had to end an internet friendship. 

For context: I stay in Singapore where the corona virus is being handled rather ok, these 2 people stay in USA and have been severely impacted by the virus. 

Long story short, I mentioned going out with my friends to them in passing as a response to not responding for a while. They lost their shit at me, with one being very passive aggressive and the other being more calm. I said I was sorry and went on to explain why it was safe in my country. Later on without a response I approached the more calm one who said that they were tired but unhappy with what I did such as using statistics to defend myself. The calm one thought I was being insensitive. I took some time off to respond, logging off the internet. 5 days later I responded to them, only to find out they’ve been waiting for my response and they were unhappy at my lack of response and thought I was ghosting them. I made 2 apologies and a very assertive statement when one of them came online and didn’t respond. They then shoved everything they were unhappy about onto me, even things unrelated to the situation. It came to the conclusion that I was to be acquaintances with them until I could resolve my own issues as they thought I was in the wrong. A couple of days later I felt uncomfortable and wanted to tell them what I felt and why I didn’t want to be in contact with them anymore. The passive aggressive one didn’t agree and thought I was still entirely in the wrong due to my assertive tone they read as vitriolic which negated my apology. In the end they never knew they were wrong even though I told them they were passive aggressive and I was hurt by their response which they denied and said that they did nothing wrong. Am I an asshole? Should I have just apologised? I have a lot of thoughts but I’m really just looking for opinions on this right now. Thank you for reading this.

This made my boyfriend very upset and angry and he often vented to me about how angry he was that he was being treated this way by him. 
Anyway now to the point, now that they have broken up he is asking my boyfriend to hang every single day; and my boyfriend agrees nearly every time he asks. My boyfriend and I hang out a lot and I don’t mind him seeing his friends regularly at all; but as I said the whole time his best friend was with his girlfriend my boyfriend vented to me angrily about how his friend is treating him and has even got to the point of shedding a few tears about it; and now he refuses to talk to him about it and thinks everything is okay, I said to him the other day “you were so upset about him treating you the way you did and you just aren’t going to talk to him about it?” And he told me basically to mind my own business and it’s not my problem, to a degree I get that but I was the one who had my hand on his shoulder while he was upset and angry and dealt with his bad moods due to this.

She's a mother herself now and she has mentioned wanting to be good like her own mother was but that was the only mention in about 4 years?

 I feel so bad about it sometimes like she might think I don't want to hear her talk about her dead mother? I want her to know so badly that I constantly think about her mother, I miss her too and I visit her grave.
But at the same time I don't want to say that because OBVIOUSLY it does not compare to how much she must miss her/her pain on the matter.

One co-worker ('S' - 27M) already got on a few of our nerves during the training period because he would constantly talk over our trainers and be disrespectful. Nevertheless, he was still invited. A number of us were planning to drive home after and responsibly opted out of drinks. S was also driving home, but shrugged off our warnings not to drink with the typical 'I don't get drunk, I'll be fine' excuse. 

One glass in, and he was already swearing at all of us, telling us that if we were younger than him, we were stupid. Another glass in and he was making r\*pe 'jokes' about different co-workers, and saying other things of the same nature. 

At this point, we were all just ready to leave and congregate at another time without S. S had convinced one of my tipsy co-workers that he'd give him a ride home. When we (the sober ones) found this out, we said hell no, and managed to get all my tipsy co-workers SAFE rides home. S was furious,  calling us names because some of us were younger than him and had the 'audacity' to make decisions for him. He started to physically shove us and call us babies. 

One of the trainers had taken his car keys in an attempt to stop him from driving home, and told him that he can take an Uber/ride with one of us, and then pick up his car when he was sober. S practically ripped the keys out of the trainer's hand, swore, and left the parking lot in the most erratic driving I've ever seen. 

We tried to contact the non-emergency police line to tip them about the drunk driver, but didn't have too many details about the car. Only gave the location and where he was headed. 

Since that day, us co-workers have communicated (without S) about what to do. That behaviour was inappropriate, regardless of how drunk he was. It was unsafe, irresponsible, and downright disrespectful. It left us feeling very uneasy to work with him, and just doesn't resonate well with us to know that such a person works at an otherwise amazing company. 

The issue is that one of S's closer co-worker friends gave us a little insight about how big this job is to him, and the massive impact it would have on his overall livelihood/mental health if he was let go. The majority of us still want to go ahead and alert one of the managers about this behaviour. However, we can't decide if it's worth practically ruining his life, or how to go about wording it.

303,"Hiya guys. If you've got time to read a wall of text, please give me some advice =) 



Last year, I had a breakup with my ex partner, and within a month I was dating a new partner (current partner). My ex best friend (female, have known her since I was 10 or so), immediately didn't like him because he knew how to hold his ground during her 'if you hurt her, I'll find you and kill you' speech. 

I thought not much of it, as she's a strong minded person.... Much like my mother but that's another story... But then a few weeks later, my new boyfriend came to town (he lived 500kms away, but originally from my town), and stayed a few nights with me. We went out to a shopping centre and saw my ex best friend.

I introduced them briefly, he decided to wait by the car while I found out why her foot was in a cast. We spoke, briefly, nothing was mentioned about him, and we parted ways fine.
Important to note, I saw no one else at the carpark of about 100 cars, I know what my family's cars look like and I am pretty attentive when it comes to my surroundings.

I got back home, boyfriend and I watched something.. And my mother called. My mother already didn't like my new partner (something about a long-standing issue with his mother. We used to be neighbours as toddlers. Small town, hey?) and she asked who the tall guy was that was with me at X shopping centre carpark. I said his name, and she went ballistic.

Long story short (and a few threats later), I hung up on her, put two and two together that ex bestie told my mother about him, knowing full well my mother didn't like him.. And locked everything up. I guessed correctly that she would come knocking on my doorstep. I asked him to stay quiet, and she screamed, tried to break in, threatened to call the cops.... It was a bad night.

I've been since working on my relationship with my mother, and that's going alright now. It's damaged, but she has apologised, which is a first. However, after that night, I heard hide nor tail of my old best friend. I didn't want to talk to her, and apparently she didnt want to talk to me either.

Last week, I removed her as a Facebook friend, wanting to be done with that chapter of my life. It has relieved me immensely as it has been on my mind. I mean.. Why wouldn't it be? An ex best friend stabbing me in the back like that. 

Last night, I was out to dinner with my family. My partner calls me and says my ex bestie rocked up at my flat, looking for me. He said he believed I was at my mother's place, so she left in a huff. He gave me a heads up, and when I left dinner, she ambushed me outside of my car.

She let me know she has x y and z medical issues and that she's dying. She explained that she had some tests done, and she's dying.
She then said that, whatever THIS was between us, she needed it to be resolved.
And then she paused, and I told her that she picked my mother over me. And i shrugged. I didn't know what to do with what she gave me. My mind kinda fogged up as soon as I saw her car across from mine, to be honest.
She reiterated that she needed the things between us fixed, and I told her I'd reach out to her this week. That I couldn't do anything else right now.
She kinda.. Walked away? I don't know how to describe how she was when she walked away, but I know the conversation didn't go the way she wanted.

I told my sister that night that something had gone on with my ex bestie, and she said that my mother was on the phone to ex bestie. So.. Not a clue what'll come of that.


I guess what I'm asking for advice for is... How should I handle this situation? Did I do the right thing by telling her I would get back to her? Part of me believes that she may be realising that I am not in her pocket anymore, and that she's jumping to try to regain control over me, as she is a very controlling person, especially since she's had kids of her own.

I don't particularly want to be her friend, due to what happened, and I understand that I don't owe her a thing. However, it's hard to battle the little voice that's trying to convince me that I owe her... My time? Friendship? I'm not quite sure what. But I feel like I at least need to send her a message and tell her that I don't want to talk to her anymore, I guess.

Thanks for getting this dark, folks, I really appreciate it.",13Jul2020,1
304,"Hi there, Singaporean here.

So I have this friend who has blatantly said racist things.

She has said things like “Covid-19 is a Chinese virus and that us Malays can never get it because Chinese people are dirty and unhygienic” I didn’t call her out because I was shocked it came out of her own mouth and also that I didn’t want to “ruin” our friendship? (I regret it now)

Recently a few days back we had a heated discussion via WhatsApp. She was defending someone who was racist and have tweeted racist things before, saying “he was set up” and that somehow the leading political party (Singapore had our General Election during this time) was setting him up so they could win. Singapore is one of the least corrupt countries in the world so i don’t know where this was coming from?! 

Anyways, not to digress any further, I sought help from my best friend on how to cut her off. And she told me to basically not acknowledge or reply to any of her messages since I’ve told her off that defending a racist is not right and why his tweets were wrong. Racist friend was “sorry” for being a bitch by blaming it on other things but didn’t apologise about her racist remarks. 

I need advice if this method is right? Or should I continue to befriend her and try to educate her?",13Jul2020,1

307,"TL;DR: My life is really boring. I've never had a girlfriend and most of my friends have left or hardly talk to me. I'm afraid of missing out on life and just dying without having had any meaningful experiences. How can I get out of this hole I'm in?

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm 19, going to university soon, and I feel like I'm not really taking advantage of my youth. I go through the motions, moving upwards in education, getting some money here and there but, I'm not getting any of the experiences that make up the memories people cherish. My life just seems like the skeleton of a full life and, I'm afraid one day I'll die and won't have actually ""lived"" my life.

I know it's important to get a good education, find a job, and be healthy. But, my life is just especially boring. I've never had a girlfriend, almost all my friends have left and went on with their own lives, I don't get invited to do anything with anyone, I don't go to parties, spent most of my time at home doing nothing. I want to have a family one day but, I'm afraid nobody will ever like me enough. People don't hate me, I'm just not that memorable. The only noticeable thing about me is that I'm fat and I hope to change that some day.

I'm not looking for tons of attention but, I don't think I'm getting the experiences that most people do as they get older. I'm lucky that I'm growing up without any major issues, I'm in a safe area and don't get into trouble. Never took any drugs, nothing. I would never want to take away from the people that have to live in such difficult situations. This is nothing compared to that. I just want to know how to get out of this hole.

I'm sure many people are in a situation like me. I'm sorry if I come off spoiled or anything like that, I'm not saying that my life is so hard because it's not. I've had it easy. It just almost feels too easy, or maybe I feel guilty I don't know.",13Jul2020,1

My friend has a rep for being boy crazy, etc. She tends to move relationship to relationship by getting bored, being interested in someone else for a bit, then moving on. I’ve never thought this is the best, but it’s her relationships. 

Recently she’s been in a more long standing relationship. However during this she’s talking to 2 guys also. 1 and 2, while still dating BF. Guy 1 came first, fell for her etc etc then she rejected and they stopped talking. Recently picked back up. Guy 2 is where I get pulled in. 

2 confronts me about it, found out she was talking to another guy romantically (BF, 1, or someone else???) and I’m a bit shocked. I never text him. I message her something nondescript “...” and she starts calling him crazy and says several times to block him. 

I’m at a cross roads. I feel if I confront her she’ll get defensive, but I wasn’t surprised to see the text saying she lead 2 on and said she loves him etc cause I accidentally read something similar with her and 1.

313,"Ello all. 

I have worked at this company for about 6 months now. They constantly disrespect me. A simple mistake and my manager is blowing up in the group chat where all employees can see, telling me that I have “pissed her the fuck off” and saying things along the line of “I don’t get why you don’t undertand this, it is not that hard” 
Generally, very unprofessional, hurtful, and belittling language that she uses on me in the group chat where everyone can see. It is mortifying to say the least. 

During the 6 months I have been here, I have never made not even one mistake that has cost the company money. 
Until 2 weeks ago, I made a mistake ( not gonna get into details) and I ended up costing the company $84.00. 
Because of this, they put me on overnight (12am-8am, I was originally working 7am-3pm for the past 6 months). 
For backstory: upon being hired I stated specifically that night audit affected my mental health terribly, and made me depressed. And that I did not want to work it continuously. The manager at the time, said that was fine. 
Upon making this mistake that cost the company $84.00, my management decided to put me EXCLUSIVELY on night audit (knowing how it affects my mental health). 
I bit my tongue and agreed to work it. Frankly, because if I quit this job I will not be able to receive unemployment. I can only receive unemployment if I am laid off due to covid-19, or if I am fired due to incompetence. 
Now, on overnight shift I am not exaggerating when I say no emails come in. Absolutely none. I have gone over the checklist with my managers more than once to make sure I am not missing anything and that I am doing all that I can during my shift. I have even taken to doing small things that the 7am-3pm shift would normally do. 
Despite this, 
I received an email today that all employees could see. A group email. It said the following “due to slow productivity, we have reduced hours”. Now, keep in mind business is going great. My managers have customers and clients (AKA money) flowing in left and right. 
Upon looking at the email I see something that made my blood boil. 
They have cut me down to 20 hours a week. 
I am the only employee that has had my hours cut. 
So not only have they punished me by taking away money that I literally need to pay my rent and eat, they have also publicily embarrassed me in front of all of my employees. 
They did not even once address this issue with me first. If they felt I wasn’t being productive enough, why wouldn’t they make me aware and try to fix it with me? 

And it makes me even angrier because they 100% have the money to give me full time. They are doing great - business wise. 
I am unsure how to bring this up to them. 
I hate this job, it makes me feel so inadequate and small. Is there nothing I can do? 

If I quit, I won’t get unemployment. 
Due to corona, I’m sure it would be very hard to find another job that allows me to work from home and avoid exposure to the public. 

Is there any loophole regarding unemployment? 
Any advice would be very appreciated. This job is affecting my mental health so badly to the point where I’ve had to actually start seeing a counselor for the first time in my life. 

Punishing an employee by taking the hours they need to pay for food and a place to live just feels like it has to somehow be workers rights violations.",13Jul2020,1
314,"I made a new friend recently.. We're into the same stuff, and play games together a lot.. So, I was talking to then over text chat the other day and had a misunderstanding. We were chatting, and I asked him ""Want to continue?"" Since we'd started playing a game the other night. He responded ""I guess?"" Since I'm assuming he didn't realize I was talking about the game, and we kept up a kind of awkward convo until he admitted that he had no idea what I was talking about. I apologized and clarified that I was talking about the game. After I explained, he went totally silent. I thought that maybe he just got pulled away, cause it happens sometimes. But after a few hours, I knew something was up, so I messaged asking if he was okay.

Silence. Never talked to me again the entire day.

Then, the next day, starts talking to me like that never even happened. I expected him to at least apologize for leaving without saying anything. I got a little peeved, and said: ""So we're just going to ignore the fact that you disappeared yesterday?""

He went OFF. Calling me childish for giving him that tone. I was kind of taken aback. So I told him that I was just annoyed cause I felt like he was ignoring/avoiding me the entire day.

He admitted that yeah, he did because of that ""mess of a conversation."" (His words). So... he ignored me because he felt awkward?? Because he misinterpreted what I said? And I told him that I didn't think that was worth ignoring me over, and he just said: ""You're entitled to your own opinion.""

WHAT. So I start arguing with him, and he starts going off on how he didn't want this drama, and this is exactly why he didn't say anything, blah blah blah. I've known you for like a week and there has literally been none of this drama until now??

It got to the point where he said something like ""Look at this narrative you're creating!"" And I couldn't take it anymore. Like now you're going to start gaslighting me on top of everything else? I blocked him, and I've been pissed all day.

This is such a stupid thing to get into a fight over. Now, after thinking about it, I'm wondering if I should try to salvage it tomorrow. Try to talk it out, apologize for being snippy with him if he'll apologize for ignoring me. I really had fun with him before, and we got along so well until this happened. Should I even try? I'm afraid that he'll just stonewall me. Or that something like this will happen in the future again...",13Jul2020,1

What happened was 4 years ago i met my bestfriend her names angelina shes one of the nicest people i've met and gotten to know i was 10 at the time and she was 13 we didn't meet at school or anything it was just over xbox because i got my xbox that year and she was one of the first people i met on there we immediately became pretty good friends but nothing too serious and then it just clicked that we were best friends and that we wanted each other in our lives forever. We've been through a lot like when she was in an abusive relationship with her ex i tried to help her as much as i could but it was still bad she moved and so did her girlfriend but her girlfriend moved to korea and different time zones and she would get mad at her for not texting her even though my friend was asleep. But i can't be entirely mad at her because she learned it from her mother who was also the same way. fast forward a couple years present day and she meets another girl who is also her bestfriend now and shes really nice and i love her too we were really good friends. and as a joke she would send pics of her boobs just because she felt that comfortable with us then i broke that. I gave her a vrv account so she could watch anime all she wants for free no ads but i said in exchange she had to send  boob and coochie vids, and she didn't send them and now im glad she didn't but i kept pestering her about it until she couldn't handle it anymore and told angelina, and she confronted me about it rightfully so and snapped on me which i deserved and thats when i had realized what i had done. for the next few days we didn't talk but the girl i kept pestering for nudes about finally looked at my apologies and she said she forgave me and that she still loved me. And i also apologized to Angelina because it was so fucked up what i did. and everyone was telling her to drop me even her mom. but nonetheless she didn't cave in and gave me a second chance which i dont deserve at all but shes such an amazing person and i love her for it and always will. But she gave me a second chance but nothing will ever be the same shes been thinking i've been talking shit about the 2 of them to my other friends which i don't blame her for thinking that persay because i broke eveything we built up. But i haven't been talking shit about them because i still love them and thank them for everything they've done for me. I dont want to lose them and i dont know what to do. Now the girl that forgave and said she still loved me has left me on delivered and angelina just reads my messages pretty much and doesn't say anything. i dont think theres a way to fix this because i fucked up the one good thing in my life the thing that kept me going because everything else in my life isnt good my mom makes 13 dollars and hour and barely making it past and my dad last his job a couple years ago and is disabled and can't work but he hasn't been able to get disability just because hes fat and judges judge him and say he can work if he just loses weight but thats not it he has so many problems with his body that that wont just fix it. but im getting off topic.

I’ve just been lonely not having people to hang out with or talk to much so I figured that if I’m wishing for this, probably someone else is too. So I decided to make up a list of people to reach out to who I haven’t spoken to in awhile due to many various reasons. (I made a list because for the last couple weeks I’ve thought I’m gonna reach out to so and so but then didn’t follow through so the list is to hold me accountable mainly) 

Some of them I know exactly what I want to say, but some of the people on my list I just put there because I thought hmm yeah that’s a good person to message. I honestly just went through my Snapchat friends list and picked people I felt like I had pretty good relationships with at some point or another and who I felt wouldn’t really give major superficial responses, also some of them are people I know were struggling earlier in the summer so I just want to follow up with that. 

So what would you want someone to say to you if they randomly messaged you after not talking for months-years?

She was an amazing influence on me and actually was my reason to graduate (before her I was on track to dropout but I felt she deserved a partner who at least graduated). She told me she wanted more and that I wasn’t enough, said she didn’t know if she could spend her life with only one person and that she wanted to know what the rest of life had to offer. Ever since the moment she broke up with me I’ve been run down, things I enjoyed doing (gaming, drawing, talking with friends) now feels mundane and eating and sleeping feel like a chore and I’ve been struggling with both.

3 days after I messaged my mum (she left my home family 5ish years ago and now lives in another country) to shorten this part up she did some terrible things to us but I still love her she did raise me after all. She said that if life is all too much where I am currently she would pay for me to be flown out over to her and she’d get me a job and a place to stay. The only thing stopping me is I don’t know if I have the strength to leave my Dad (42M) and my Brother (11M) alone. I also don’t know if I have the strength to go through with staying here where I’m in the same routine that’s hurts day in day out. 

My 3 closest friends (20M,30M&amp;32M) have all told me that I should go to where my mum is and that the change is good for me but life in harder than I thought and this is probably the biggest decision I’ve ever been faced with. I thought about trying to get in contact with people from my high school, Particularly my old counsellor and my best friend at the time, but she I think she is in a relationship and I don’t wanna interfere with her life at all, I want her to be happy. (Just for a bit more info the reason I wanted to talk to this girl is because she is the only person I talked to about my problems back in school and even talked me out of self harm and other things, she always had my best feelings in interest and I am comfortable talking to her)

If there is any Advice anyone can give me based on what I’ve said? Apologies if it’s too long or I’m shit at explaining things but this my first time ever posting let alone posting something like this. 😕",13Jul2020,1

I didn't really look into their backgrounds, but before I handwrote to any of them, I decided to email a letter to writeaprisoner.com and they printed it and sent it to him. 
I got a letter back today, and I was BEYOND excited. I read it and he seemed so excited and happy to write to me, and I was on the edge of my seat to write back!! I looked up his name to find his profile again, but all I got were new articles....
It turns out he murdered a 10 year old girl when he was 15, and is in prison for life. I feel bad not writing back because I could tell he was super excited, but I'm spooked. My friend told me to write and say i'm not comfortable with continuing writing to him, but another friend said just dont reply at all... Thoughts?

334,"Accept your feelings first. Feel them. Laughing at a joke is just as normal as crying when u experience pain. We express ourselves.

This is what happens when you fall in love:

You meet someone, you learn about them. They look pretty to you and that already turns on your animal instinct. You learn about their interests and learn that they share a similar thought process as you and suddenly you feel like you found yourself in a way or someone that completes you.

So basically whatever you love in that person, you love in yourself because that person reflects aspects of you. 

Sometimes that person might leave for any reason and everything you planned for or expected goes to waste. You will feel loss. 

Here’s why you shouldn’t worry too much.

Relationships aren’t to be possessive, they are meant for growth. Love is letting a flower grow and admiring it, not cutting it.

You should know that you don’t actually love that person, you love the aspects inside of that person. The aspects that that person has shown you. You do everything you can to experience those very aspects that you need. It becomes a source of energy.

Disaster hits and your lover leaves... What do you do?

Well, simple... Move on. Find another person with those same aspects that you loved in that previous person. There are so many people in the world who can give you the same thing that your previous lover gave you.

Once they leave, don’t cry that they left... Thank yourself for allowing yourself the courage to experience this relationship.",13Jul2020,1
335,"I got fired after a week from my new job at a roof cleaning company during training. I really tried to give it my all. I was confident and stayed positive the whole time, I told them I'd do anything to succeed at my new job but it didn't work out. I got along with all the employees well, had similar interests ect. I was told to ""take it slow during training"" and that'd it be chill.

&amp;#x200B;

On the second day they put me on a very hard job that took 2 days to complete. It was a 6 story apartment complex with roofs that where about 75 degrees steep. I was taught how to put on the harness and immediately was thrown onto the roof of this tall ass building even though I had 0 experience and knowledge on how to use it and the rope. (was very dangerous) I was a bit slow because it was my first time cleaning a roof and it was quite large but I got it all done in 2 shifts. After I finished my boss told me ""this was the tallest building and possibly one of the hardest jobs I've ever worked on"" and that they only get jobs like this once a year and that he's sorry for putting me on such a rough job my second day. I then learnt how to clean gutters and ended up cleaning about 20 balconies on the same building which took around 2 days. On my last day at the end of the day he told me he'd like to talk to me about my week. He told me (his exact words) that although I have great work ethic, I'm hardworking, have strong interpersonal skills and a willing to learn that I just wasn't the ""right fit"" for the business. He told me he swore it was nothing personal and that he genuinely liked me as a person but that he didn't think I was physically fit enough for the role. I'm a short male (5'7) and skinny (130 IBS) so I could kind of understand but I didn't even get the chance to redeem myself as ""strong"" or ""weak"" enough for the position. He then told me that I could use him as a reference and that he'd only say nice things about me because he knows that I tried my best.

&amp;#x200B;

I've never been fired before so I'm depressed af because of it. It's annoying because I don't even know if he was telling the truth or if he was just letting me down easy. He literally told me after cleaning the roofs that he wouldn't have been able to do it that well his first day?? I'm not sure where I went wrong and now I'm overthinking every little thing I did. It couldn't have been because I was slow since he made it clear to go at my own pace and that theres a learning curve of 2-3 months. I'm just so confused by this maybe I'm just overanalyzing this wether or not he WAS telling the truth to me when firing me. I'm just sad that I got fired after only a week and literally gave this job my all and screwed it up somehow. :(",13Jul2020,1

337,"This lady is super attractive but she smokes like a chimney. My street is all pretty small houses. Mine and my neighbor are about 6’ apart. She smokes a lot in her back yard and since it’s the summer I have my window a/c unit on a lot (it’s in the front window). The smoke just gets ram aired into my house and I really hate the smell. 

On one hand I get it, it’s like where else is she supposed to smoke and she’s on her property but on the other hand it’s like why do I have to be subjected to this gross smell and carcinogens in my own house. 

I’m really bad at confronting people and she has never even smiled at me or said hi to me and she’s been living here for about a year now. (It wasn’t so annoying in the winter cuz no window a/c was needed). And she probably thinks I’m annoying or dumb or whatever cuz she’s like 45 ish and I’m just a 23 y/o

Finally, she’s got a daughter who I’m guessing is like 13 and it’s like fuckin a you’re gonna smoke infront of her and probably bring that gross smell into your house and expose your daughter to carcinogens? In 2020?? With all of the info we know about smoking?? 

Oh also she’s got a window a/c unit that’s between her house and mine on her second floor so I can only assume that the smell is getting injected into her house too. 

Idk what to do. I probably sound like a whiney baby but it’s really annoying. It felt good to write this out tho. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",13Jul2020,1
338,"I always wanted to go to this specific school, even when I was little I wanted to go there. It’s a really good school and basically everyone wanted to go there, and when I found out my best friend wanted to go there too my love for it grew more and more. I would be on their website all night until 4 in the morning, I knew what classes they taught, what clubs and programs they had, I know almost everything about the school. It’s a hour away, but I still love it. But then my father wants to put me in this private school, everything about it seems perfect, but I always wanted to go to the other school. I know with this whole Corona thing going on, I don’t really have to worry about this too much and I really shouldn’t even be thinking about this, but it just has been on my mind for a while. My father doesn’t give up easily and my mother always agrees with him, the only one who really listens and stands up for me is my older sister.

339,"Lately since we’ve come back from quarantine I feel myself withdrawing in social situations, and like just tuning out and not wanting to say anything for fear of acting dumb, and just being overall in my head about things. 

Even at family parties I’ve noticed that I’ll just want to be in the other room sometimes and I just find it hard to connect in a group settings sometimes, and like without alcohol im even worse about that shit. Today for example even though nobody really noticed, I was anxious the whole time I was at the beach with friends, and the vibe didn’t seem right compared to other times.

It could also be bc my friend has been bringing around these two girls he likes, and sometimes it’s literally like 3-4 guys tryna jockey for their attention. I just feel like I kinda watch from the sidelines sometimes, and it’s fine since my friend brings his girl cousins who are only a couple years younger, so I’ve been kind of talking to them more often.

341,"Whenever my family members, especially my mom, touches me I end up tensing up immediately and hit the spot she/they touch. I really don’t know when it started but since 2nd to 4th grade for sure. I’m 13 right now (I know, young, please don't disregard me though.) and the feeling got worse. My mom constantly wants to “fix” me and we get in really bad fights about it all the time. I do tell my mom that I love her and try my best to express my feelings to other family members too but I’m really awkward with it. My parents and I have a kind of bad relationship I guess- even though my dad stays at home we don’t talk much and my mom and I get in constant fights about literally anything. 

Just now my mom told me that she and my dad are both sick (not with covid by the way) because she said about how I don’t care that they are both sick, the thing is is that she never told me that they were sick. Apparently my dad is going into surgery for his gallbladder this week and she and him never told me, she also said he had this problem for a month now- but neither of them told me? And then I just learned that my mom was coughing up blood? I ended up lashing out at my mom because the both of them seriously never tell me anything, but she still doesn’t understand me. She seriously fucking told me that the reason why I never knew was because my door is never open, because the reason why I never knew my dad was fucking ill all this time was because I close my door. I told her it's because neither of them directly tell me anything but then she started threatening me that I'll have to always keep my door open all the time and ranting on about how I'm so extremely selfish.

My mom also keeps telling me that she'll kick me out of the house or send me to a relative's house because I don't hug her or because I close the door. I can't help to be worried about my mom's mentality though- she has attempted suicide in 2 occasions before and threatens to kill herself many times, one time I wouldn't show a drawing I drew to her and she suddenly started saying that she'll kill herself, I'm seriously not exaggerating that. I have told her that she needs help from a therapist because she is not okay but then she accused me of calling her a crazy person, using reasons like ""I gave birth to you and you think I'm mentally ill??"" I don't really have much power since I'm just 13 after all and my relatives won't listen to me at all (I told everything to my grandma and aunt and they just said that ""she's just not normal, so just deal with it."") but I seriously don't know what to do. 

This became a whole rant about my mom and I'm sorry about that. Back to my touching thing- I know it would help my mom if I can actually hug her but I'm genuinely repulsed of the thought of it. I know this sounds like I hate my mother, but I physically can't; it's hard to explain but whenever I touch a family member I feel something in my chest and stomach clench and the only way to make it feel better is to hit myself. I 100% have told my mom every single time we fight about my touching thing but then she starts saying the only way to ""fix"" me is for me to be sent to the cops, no joke. She always has this thing about fixing me. I had to go to a child therapist because I didn't smile often and my mom wanted to fix me, I was in 5th grade. It would be great if my touching thing was fixed in all honesty, but i genuinely do not know why it happened in the first place. 
And if you're reading this please don't say it's because I'm growing up and I'm becoming more of a teenager and I just feel ""embarrassed"" to hug my mom or any other family member, I really do try my best to hug my family members, especially my mom, but I can't help but to feel nauseated. I really do want to communicated this to her but she doesn't understand. 

tl;dr: I get nauseated when my family members, esp my mom, touch me. Mom doesn't understand me and constantly wants to fix me by kicking me out or etc. Mom also doesn't communicate with me about her and my dad's health even though I worry- blames it on me having my door closed. I need advice to communicate with my mom or at least ""fix"" myself.",13Jul2020,1
342,"I (19F) took some survey off a link from a Facebook friend. It was to be a clothing tester for a popular brand. I filled the form out, the only personal information I gave was my name, phone number, and email. While this is still important info, I didn’t want to freak out if it wasn’t enough to do anything with. I then sent a picture of my body, with my face NOT in the picture. I just figured this probably wasn’t a good idea so I deleted the app. The email responded back to my email by saying I was to download an app to “try tester clothes.” I never downloaded anything, instead deleted the messaging app and blocked the email I was responding with. Later I saw a lady saying that the post and link were a scam. I then went back and reported abuse to google on the link. This was a new document of the same link though, not the one I filled out. I am unsure of what to do now since these people have my phone number. The lady who said it was a probably scam said if could potentially be people who are looking for girls, if you know what I mean. This doesn’t mean the link was for that but it is a possibility. I messaged the same lady who informed people it was a scam and asked if she had any advice on what to do. I am also asking here on what I should do. Again the most I gave was my name, email, and phone number. I don’t want to go change my phone number or email if I don’t have to.

343,"I stay at my boyfriend’s place 4 nights in a week. When I say boyfriend’s place, I mean his parent’s house. We’re currently saving up to buy a place (we’re nearly there! Just a few more months). We used to rent but it inhibited us from saving for a future home. His parents were nice enough to let him stay home for the time being while we save up enough to be able to get on the property ladder.

The issue is, sex has been happening less while we’re both back in our parents house. I am the one who goes over as it’s always just been our dynamic and it works best for us. His parents live in a 3 bed house and mine is only in an apartment. Thing is, I understand that the idea of having sex at your parents house can dampen the mood. I also could be loud, but I try to be quiet when his parents are around. However, it’s now getting to me because while we’re having less sex, he’s been wanting bjs all the time. I’m more than happy to comply as I like pleasing him, it turns me on. But I feel like ever since we’ve gone back to our parents, it’s been more one sided. He get’s blowjobs all the time when I’m at his, and I’ll be lucky if we have sex more than once a week, sometimes in two weeks. I’ve explained to him that I’ve got needs to. I’ve got a high sex drive and this has been putting me down, but he always just says once we get our own place, it’ll be much different, and that it just really doesn’t get him in the mood being at his parent’s house. 

To be fair, we did have regular sex when we were renting so I know how different it could be. I guess I’m just really frustrated and I feel like I’m always the one pleasing him. It also doesn’t help that there’s been time’s I’ve initiated sex at night, and he rejects it as he says it’s embarrassing if they hear us. But if it comes to bjs, he’s down for it straight away. I don’t know what to do? I get men make less noise when being pleasured so it’s not as much of a problem while we’re at his parents house, but this is starting to really get to me. It’s been more than a year now. It’s been more than a year of limited sex and unlimited bjs and it’s starting to make me feel unwanted. 

I feel like I’m being unreasonable everytime I ask for sex and it sucks. I feel like I can’t voice out my frustration without me sounding whiny and unaccommodating.

We should be able to buy somewhere by the end of this year, but how do I get over this for the time being? Or how can I make him understand? He does give me oral etc at times, but I’d say majority of the time, it’s just me pleasuring him.",13Jul2020,1

349,"I work as a high school teacher and have a serious lung issue, my school is not doing masks or social distancing in their plan so far. I live in an area of the US with a lot of cases that is very republican and anti-mask. 

I am married and my husband is very supportive of distancing, he was a homebody before and works from home (and loves it). I am lucky to have him. 

I  have left the house two times since March and I was totally anxious and panicky because people without masks were close to me. One of those was the death of a close family member (a parent) and was really traumatic for me. When school ended my routine went away and I started sleeping more. I feel like I’m going crazy. I can barely get out of bed in the morning and I’m not sure what to do with my life. My husband has taken over all cleaning, cooking, pet care etc even though I know it isn’t fair. I apologize to him and he has never seen me like this before so he said he doesn’t mind doing any of it. 

We are lucky that we can get by without me working for a bit (my teacher salary didn’t pay much anyway). I’m trying to find something online but honestly I’ve only put in a couple applications and I know I will need several hundred to land a job again. 

I don’t have many close friends and even so I’m the one people come to for help prior to this year. I’ve never been in a situation like this before and I used to be such a leader. My health condition is not very visible and you’d think I was a normal healthy adult except that I can’t run and hike as well as some. 

The biggest thing is I just think I’ve lost hope since my goals for my career and kids have been put on hold. I lost two parents in the last two years to cancer and I’m just really feeling sad because the most social interaction I’ve gotten is around condolences which was so nice of people but also very hard. I am the main person in the family responsible for handling funeral arrangements etc and the decision to wait until it is safe to do a memorial (and then having to explain that over and over) was rough. I have handled things in blocks when I have the motivation to spend an hour making calls, canceling accounts, or whatever and then just needing to cry for the rest of the day.

How do I find something to care about that will get me out of this funk? 

Is anyone else in this situation? 

Also I feel like focusing on my problems is what got me into this because I just sit around all day in bed. Does anyone know how I could help others without having to leave the house? Advice for a schedule or motivation? I know people will probably say “just get out of the fucking bed” but idk why it is so, so difficult right now.

350,"Hey everyone,

I’m moving from Florida to San Antonio to get my masters tomorrow and I am genuinely on the verge of a panic attack which I never get. Im freaking the fuck out. 

I’ve never lived alone before and it’s been something I’m afraid of for a long time but I feel more capable now than ever before and the opportunity is once I’m a lifetime.

Problem is, covid. I knew I was going to be nervous for the move in general and independence, but the drive is freaking me out. We will wear masks during every gas station stop and use hand sanitizer and only be there for a few minutes at a time. 

I’m not so much worried about our cleanliness, I’m worried about everyone else’s. To be honest, I feel like my biggest fear truly is the aging of my parents. They’re getting older and now I’m going to be away away from them. I’m actually excited to live alone. I like being alone. I have a job I love. The program is amazing. I’m really safe and sanitary. My only fear is that I’ll be working on campus 20 hours a week but I believe I will be in the library and any work I do will be by appointment only. Plus everyone on campus has masks required.

Now after I move to San Antonio Wednesday, we are going up to my sister’s apartment in another part of the state for a day and then my parents are leaving to stop by a casino on the way home and I’m going back to San Antonio which freaks me out because 1, my home won’t be with them anymore, and 2 they’re putting themselves at risk but they firmly feel that they want to live their life and will only be there a few hours. But I’m so paranoid. 

Then when they get home they’re gonna go to Disney (which in all honesty I prefer at a casino. I know a lot of doom and gloomers are like omg Disney is a death sentence— it’s an open outside area that requires masks and holds 50,000+ people and they’re only putting in 8,000, like there are worse places to be, the grocery store is less safe) but still the doom and gloomers like freaking me the fuck out because they could die there.

I guess the biggest thing behind his all is breaking my connection from my parents. Of course I’ll keep in touch with them, but this pandemic is fucked man. I just don’t want this to be the last time I tase them but they don’t seem concerned at all. Maybe because I’m moving out on my own for the first time that I feel this way. 

I know this is a super loaded post but since the pandemic hit, I can’t gauge how much I need to “live” if that makes sense. Like how much going out is too dangerous (I’m talking Grocery store, working at the school, no way in fuck going to a bar or anything, but like going to an outdoor space like a park or the grocery store). 

With the media I can’t gauge what is safe and I’ll be a hermit if it was up to me but fuck I need to live. I was so scared of moving out before, now navigating a pandemic away from my growing old parents seems like something too big for me to handle. I’m hoping that when I get out there it’s easier. 

Anyway, thanks for reading to the end if you did. Sending hugs your way.",13Jul2020,1

357,"Hello,

I'm also going to post this in r/socialskills and r/askwomen to get as many response as possible. Feel free to read them there if y'all are curious to the answers that come in.

Necessary pretext:
I am a guy, my friend is a girl and currently has a bf. I have been texting this friend for a little while now, we were close in childhood but fell out of contact in high school and have recently reconnected.

My dilemma:
I think my friend is genuinely really pretty and I really want to make her day or make her smile cause she's a great person and I'm nice like that. I have complimented her photography skills and some other stuff but I would also love to say I think she looks pretty. However, there are two problems. #1, cause covid I haven't actually seen her face to face in a while, just her social media posts so I worry saying such a thing could come across creepy which is about polar opposite of what I want here. #2 she has a bf. I am not trying to hit on her or flirt or date her or anything, I just want to make her a little bit happier for that day, put a little bounce in her step (I really hope that didn't come off creepy, just trying to be nice for my friend). Anyways, I don't want such a compliment to take on the whole ""I'm hitting on you"" connotation, I just want it to be sincere.

My question:
How do I go about complimenting my friend's looks without coming across as hitting on her or creepy?

Thanks for the feedback!",13Jul2020,1

359,"Hello fellow redditors. This is going to be a long story but at the very end of this I do have some specific questions about immigration law specifically in the state of California in the U.S. I would very much appreciate legal advice on this matter.

First and foremost I want to start off by saying that I am the daughter of two immigrants. My parents came to the U.S. illegally decades ago but have both been granted citizenship. I have a boyfriend and his parents are immigrants too. His father from Guatemala and his mother from a different latin country. A few years ago I had moved in with my BF and his family because during the time I was 18 and a victim of abuse from my father and mother. I would regularly get kicked out by my parents for fighting back if my dad was aggressive towards me. At times he would even choke me. I put up with the abuse for some time because I was a broke college student and because I wanted to be there for my siblings. As the oldest sister I felt the need to protect them from my parents. 

During this period of instability I moved in with an old high school friend (who I had always had a crush on) and his family. I had been paying rent and sleeping on their couch but after some time he asked me to be his girlfriend. We have been together for 3 years now. My BF lives in a bedroom that is part of a house but has its own separate entrance. It just didn’t have a restroom so he has to go outside and into a different entrance of the house to use the restroom or kitchen etc. When we started dating he also asked me to move into his room. I remember thinking that our relationship was moving really fast and so did his parents but they accepted it. I didn’t mind because I liked him a lot and it was better than moving back in with my parents or going to my abusive ex who I suspect might have drugged me on many occasions as every time I went to his place I would black out after only having 2 or 3 beers. 

At 18 years old I had already experienced more emotional, physical, and sexual abuse than anyone should have to ever go through. I remember at age 9 I was already fed up with my home life to the point where I wanted to kill myself and I felt trmpted to drink rat poison. I didn’t even know the word “suicide” at that age. This history of abuse and trauma made me vulnerable to sexual harassment or assault because people that commit sexual assault or harrassment usually look for victims like me- insecure, defeated, and generally emotionally weak. Shortly after moving into my bf’s house my boyfriend’s father started sexually harassing me whenever he had the chance. He would randomly hug me, touch me in inappropriate places, and make comments about the way I dressed. After the first occasion, I avoided being alone with him. However, this didn’t work because if I was around his nephew and niece he would still touch me. He would come up behind me and start massaging my shoulders. Everytime I would tell him to stop and every time I was absolutely terrified. He would press his body behind me and pretend he was just trying to “get by” me in places of the house where he had space and no reason to touch me. It got so bad that I started locking myself in my bf’s room and holding it in even if I had to use the restroom because I didn’t want to come into contact with him. Every time he harassed me I would tell my bf. On each occasion he would ask me how he could support me. I told him to not do anything because I was afraid that no one would believe me. I was afraid that other than his niece or nephew, no one would have my back. My boyfriend is spineless and so was I. So we let it go and I just did my best to avoid him and eventually he stopped but only because I wouldn’t give him the chance to. 

Then came other problems with his sister who also lived there. I guess the fruit doesn’t fall far from the tree afterall. Somehow my BF was unscathed in the sense that he didn’t become a bad person even though his father had also been abusive and done some fucked up shit to him as well. My BF is more like his mother who is a really compassionate person. I assume people with bad parents either become the total opposite of their parents or they become bad people as well. My BF’s sister is the latter. She is extremely selfish. I couldn’t leave anything outside of my bedroom because if I did she would steal it. And I would ask my BF’s mother to go into her room to look for my missing things and every time something of mine was missing, it was in her room. On top of that she had various pets that would always die shortly after adopting them including 1 dog, a rabbit (lasted a record of 4 days), and a fish. After seeing this pattern of neglect of her pets I would offer to adopt them and she would get mad I even asked. Eventually I got mad and told her that she is killing all her pets and that she shouldn’t adopt them if she doesn’t want to take care of them. I care so much about animals so much so that I am in the process of completing an Associate of Science in veterinary medicine to become a veterinary technician. She was in highschool when all these pets of hers died. On top of that she would also take her mom’s mercedes as she didn’t like her old car and wanted to show off a new mercedes at school. However, the Mercedes wasn’t paid off and she didn’t have a license. Because of this I would advise her to not do that she could get pulled over and get her mother’s car taken away and receive a ticket, none of which she could afford to pay off on her part time cashier income. Additionally, if I would stop talking to my BF to get space from him because he said something insensitive or did something selfish, she would butt in and call me unsupportive or a bad GF even if my BF was in the wrong.

I care deeply about my BF’s mother so I am not going to stay quiet if I see her daughter taking advantage of her. On top of that by bf’s sister would steal her mother’s debit card to buy things like makeup and clothes she didn’t need. On top of that, she would even get mad and jealous because I would spend more time with her own mother than she did. But I would actually help her out in many ways instead of taking advantage of her. When she needed a new fridge and didn’t have the money we’d split 50/50. I would read her mail to her (she’s illiterate) and take her to the doctor when she had to go. I would go grocery shopping with her. When she needed to go to the social security office I took her. I would make calls on her behalf if she necessary as she didn’t speak english. Anything she needed, I was there. My bf’s family even started joking that she loved me more than my BF and her daughter. 

Anyway, the reason why I brought up those issues with my BF’s sister is because after confronting her for stealing and killing her animals or for mistreating her mother, he started being really passive aggressive towards me. He didn’t like that I said anything to his daughter. There was one day I confronted her about the animal abuse that she got extremely angry and started yelling at me to stay out of her life. She wanted me to stay out of her life but she couldn’t stay out of mine. She couldn’t stop stealing and would get involved if me and my BF had a minor disagreement (which is normal in every relationship). At that point I had already been planning to move out as I couldn’t tolerate watching his sister kill her pets and I couldn’t tolerate seeing her mistreat her mother who I love very much (even more than my own mom). During that last weeks I was there before moving out his father started not allowing me to park in the driveway and he would start cursing for having it there. He would not give a reason as to why I couldn’t park in the driveway. Even if I left plenty of space for him to park and there were no other cars there. The driveway fits 4 cars. If there was something on the kitchen table that he thought was mine, he would come knocking on the door and would yell “who left this mess!?!?!” and most of the time it was something that belonged to his daughter. He was constantly asking if \[insert random object\] was mine because he just wanted something to argue about, something he didn’t do before I confronted his daughter. He also punched the rearview mirror of my car most likely. We have neighbors who saw someone approach my car one morning and break my rearview mirror and the description they gave us matched him and his work uniform. He also sold my bike and when I confronted him about it he said that I owed him money for a washer that his wife had replaced a long time ago. I had promised her we would go 50/50 on the washer but she ended up purchasing one without me and told me not to worry about paying her. He basically just changed the subject to try to make me look bad. However, he is the only one that looked bad because he lives there and so does my bf, and his daughter and yet it is always me and my bf’s mother that would replace old appliances that didn’t work or old furniture. He would use those same appliances but would not help replace them if necessary. He would claim furniture as his own that no one else could use even if he didn’t buy it. So instead of apologizing to me for selling my bike he tried to make me look bad because he won’t admit he is in the wrong. He started insulting me and  calling me trash in front of his wife and his niece and nephew and so I yelled at him “at least I don’t touch people without their consent! At least I don’t treat my significant other like crap!” and left. 

I left and stayed at my friend’s house. This is the same friend that I had planned on moving in with anyway and we are now roommates and split the bills. I had wanted to save money for furniture before moving in but I just moved in early and she was okay with it. Now it has been a while since I have moved out. But everytime I go pick up my BF from his house to spend time with him he threatens to call the cops on me even if I am parked on the street while waiting for him. And I want to get back at him by getting him deported. Originally my BF suggested this to me and I don’t know how to go about this so I need advice on how to get him deported. He has been deported back to Guatemala before. A decade ago he was deported for a DUI. He came back to the US and works for a company and fills out a w-2 with a fake name, fake ID, and fake ssn. But he files his taxes with his ITIN. He also has two unpaid speeding tickets. Basically we want him to suffer some consequences as there is also a lot of abuse he experienced as a child at the hands of his father. We feel that if we sue for sexual harassment, the best outcome will be either a restraining order. I doubt he will get jail time because even rape victims don’t get justice. Brock Turner is an example of this. However, we know where he works and I was wondering if there was a way to go straight to his employer. I am wondering if there is any way to get him deported if I go through his employer who should have figured out by now that he is working illegally. He has been there for many years. I believe he has been there 5 years which makes me believe that maybe they know he is using a fake identity to work. He works at a call center full time as a handyman I believe as well as cleaning person. We feel getting him deported is the adequate punishment for the things he has done. He says he plans on going back to Guatemala soon anyway. He has built a house there and sends his money for his family in Guatemala to save. He doesn’t help his wife replace any old appliances for this reason. He won’t help her financially in any way because he plans on leaving for good. Due to COVID 19 she lost a lot of hours at work and when he found out he selfishly and rudely told her to save her money because she is not getting a penny from him. He has two unpaid traffic tickets (allegedly) because he says plans on leaving before he gets his driver’s license suspended or gets in any legal trouble. However, he says that he is going to leave Guatemala soon all the time and he is still here. He may also be saying this so I won’t bother pressing charges because it can be a long process. Maybe he thinks me and my BF won’t do anything if we think it is pointless. Either way I want some legal advice. Where do I go from here?",13Jul2020,1

364,"Hey everyone,

I’m moving from Florida to San Antonio to get my masters tomorrow and I am genuinely on the verge of a panic attack which I never get. Im freaking the fuck out. 

I’ve never lived alone before and it’s been something I’m afraid of for a long time but I feel more capable now than ever before and the opportunity is once I’m a lifetime.

Problem is, covid. I knew I was going to be nervous for the move in general and independence, but the drive is freaking me out. We will wear masks during every gas station stop and use hand sanitizer and only be there for a few minutes at a time. 

I’m not so much worried about our cleanliness, I’m worried about everyone else’s. To be honest, I feel like my biggest fear truly is the aging of my parents. They’re getting older and now I’m going to be away away from them. I’m actually excited to live alone. I like being alone. I have a job I love. The program is amazing. I’m really safe and sanitary. My only fear is that I’ll be working on campus 20 hours a week but I believe I will be in the library and any work I do will be by appointment only. Plus everyone on campus has masks required.

Now after I move to San Antonio Wednesday, we are going up to my sister’s apartment in another part of the state for a day and then my parents are leaving to stop by a casino on the way home and I’m going back to San Antonio which freaks me out because 1, my home won’t be with them anymore, and 2 they’re putting themselves at risk but they firmly feel that they want to live their life and will only be there a few hours. But I’m so paranoid. 

Then when they get home they’re gonna go to Disney (which in all honesty I prefer at a casino. I know a lot of doom and gloomers are like omg Disney is a death sentence— it’s an open outside area that requires masks and holds 50,000+ people and they’re only putting in 8,000, like there are worse places to be, the grocery store is less safe) but still the doom and gloomers like freaking me the fuck out because they could die there.

I guess the biggest thing behind his all is breaking my connection from my parents. Of course I’ll keep in touch with them, but this pandemic is fucked man. I just don’t want this to be the last time I tase them but they don’t seem concerned at all. Maybe because I’m moving out on my own for the first time that I feel this way. 

I know this is a super loaded post but since the pandemic hit, I can’t gauge how much I need to “live” if that makes sense. Like how much going out is too dangerous (I’m talking Grocery store, working at the school, no way in fuck going to a bar or anything, but like going to an outdoor space like a park or the grocery store). 

With the media I can’t gauge what is safe and I’ll be a hermit if it was up to me but fuck I need to live. I was so scared of moving out before, now navigating a pandemic away from my growing old parents seems like something too big for me to handle. I’m hoping that when I get out there it’s easier. 

Anyway, thanks for reading to the end if you did. Sending hugs your way.",13Jul2020,1

368,"Hello Reddit. Ever since my dad lost his job three years ago, his mental health has been declining and he’s becoming more toxic and insufferable. Not that he wasn’t already, it just got worse.

Recently he’s been judging every single thing I do, and making insane assumptions about me and my friends despite not knowing any of them personally. He also bullies me, and keeps on claiming I never gave him any satisfactions and/or made him proud. Ever. Meanwhile mom has many things to be proud of, and supports all of my choices. He also bullies mom.

He often drives me to tears and acts extremely aggressive when I disagree with his advice, even when it’s ridiculous or impossible. I cannot take it anymore, I am trying my darn best to have a stable relationship, but every time he sets walls and then blames it on me for being ‘difficult’.

He’s also refusing to find a new job, and mom is starting to get anxious because we’re pretty much gaining no money at all. We’re soon getting a cat, so that makes matters worse.",13Jul2020,1
369,"This is an internet friendship btw, we live thousands of miles away.

So, I have a lot of anxiety, and I also have ocd and I’m on the autism spectrum and that causes me to have trouble understanding things, so all that mixed together is one huge jumbled mess. 

Because of the anxiety I constantly have to ask her if she’s mad at me, sometimes the way people type things makes me thinks she’s mad (I’m like this with everyone). And because of the OCD and I guess a bit of the autism I have to ask “are you mad” Again to make sure she’s not because the way she answers may not seem clear enough to me. 

Sometimes she’ll get super pissed and add a “jeez” at the end because she’s annoyed I keep asking even though she knows I have these issues. I don’t think I’m asking for a lot, I don’t ask it 24/7; it probably only happens once a day, maybe every few days. 

A few months ago, I told her something that upset me at the time it happened and she got mad and said “why do you always have to talk about things I do wrong?” So it seems she hates being wrong. I try to be open when she hurts my feelings, I think that was A situation where she hurt me by accident, but I could be wrong. 

Just today, I asked “you’re not mad right?” 

And she replied “yea” and idk if that meant “yeah I’m mad” or “yeah I’m not mad” so I asked again in a yee or no question form and she said “oh my god, I’m going to bed.” 

And it just hurt me, almost to tears, And I’m terrified to tell her because what if she gets mad at me for trying to be open about my feelings again? I kinda feel like a selfish person too because I know she’s not obligated to help with my conditions but i only ask one thing of her (asking if she’s mad and for her to respond) and it only happens once a day, if not less.",13Jul2020,1
370,"I'm 16 at high school and I'm trying to build up my savings as much as possible as I'll be moving out at 18 to go to another city for university.


I've been in my current job (dining assistant) for nearly 5 months and when it was advertised it was advertised as filling both Saturday and Sunday lunch shifts - totalling 6 hours a week. However in the end they decided to employ 2 people and give us 1 day each. So I then got 3 hours per week. 2 extra shifts then became available each week and we both got 1 each so we're both now on 5 hours a week.


At the time of me applying, I was quite desperate for finding a job and some job was better than no job so I took it despite being fully aware I wouldn't be getting as many hours as I originally wanted when looking for jobs. While I'm greatful for my job, I'm not fully satisfied in it as 5 hours a week just isn't enough money anymore. On top of that, my 5 hours is in the form of a double shift - so I work the lunch shift then have a big 2hr gap until the dinner shift. I usually end up staying there as it would take me 20 mins to walk home and another 20 to home back - this big gap always feels like a waste of time. Usually I sit there having lunch and then just go on my phone or take some school work that needs finishing.


When my country went into lockdown for covid-19 I got 20ish hours a week because immune compromised staff couldnt come in and that was good. I've recently just had school holidays/a 2 week break and was hoping that I'd be offered some extra hours over this time but I never was (work obviously wasn't there as they already have staff filling the shifts).


I've decided I've got a few choices:


1. Leave this current job off my CV (have only been here 5 months so I don't feel comfortable putting it there or asking for a reference yet), and start looking for a second job with an average CV (I've done some work for my schools enviro group - emptying of recycling bins, but left that job at the end of last year so that's kinda old now, I also did a 1 day volunteering gig at a soup kitchen for Christmas day for people in poverty and I've recently completed a 3 day ""intro to being a barista"" course).




2. Wait until I've been at my current job for a year, then I can list it on my CV + ask for a reference from them and then start looking for a second job.




3. Stay here, don't look for a second job (at least not yet) and hope some more shifts open up eventually. This is kinda like option 2.



Option 1 seems like my best option right now except that I can't really use the teacher that was in charge of the enviro group that I worked for because I used him for my current job now and I don't want to have the awkward conversation of ""why are you changing jobs so soon"" or having to explain why I want 2 jobs as I want more hours with him. Subsequently I then wouldn't be able to have someone backup the achievements of that job that I've got on my CV and that may be suspicious to a potential employer? Instead I'd be using 2 current teachers as references. It's also been nearly 9 months since I left that job so it's kind of old now and I'd need to think back for examples I could use for interview questions. The other downside I see to this option is that if the places I apply to reject my application with my CV that doesn't mention my current job and then if I reapply there in 7 months time and my CV then suddenly has my current job on it - that may ring alarm bells if they backtrack and look at my previous application. I might as well give applying for a 2nd job a go as the worst that can happen is I don't get anything but at least I tried.


Option 2 seems like wasting time as that's 7 months of missed potential wages. I really don't want to only be getting 5 hours a week in the big summer break (3 months long) as I'll just be sitting at home unproductively. 


Option 3 also doesn't seem very good for me as the shifts that may become available revolve around meal times. Lunch is a 3 hour shift and dinner is a 2 hour shift and I doubt I'll get 20+ hours a week which is what I want. I might reach 10-13 if I'm lucky. 


What sounds like the best option and why?",13Jul2020,1
371,"Hi guys,

Just for context, my girlfriend [22] and I [22] have been dating for just over 8 months and we are planning to move together to the UK in September. My parents met her for the second time a couple of days ago and absolutely loved her, but my dad got quiet after I showed him the apartment we were looking at. 

My dad called me yesterday and started telling me that I should consider the long term if this is happening, that I should be worried if we have a child who isn't brought up Jewish and that if I go ahead and don't marry Jewish, he will most likely never speak to me again.

374,"Background: I used to work for a trampoline park as a supervisor. Worked there for a year and a half. In the middle of my time there, management and owners changed. I thought I was rocking it as the senior employee (as I knew the ropes better than literally every other worker including management) and I kept getting us awesome reviews and compliments from patrons for my great customer service. I was especially on good terms with the regulars that came in.

Immediately after quarantine reopening we had to limit the amount of time people could spend at the gym. The regulars weren't too happy about this as they were used to spending an entire day training on our g trampolines. On a particularly slow day, two regulars were begging me to allow them to stay an extra session (after I had already given them some generous extra time). They ended up bringing me to let them stay another session with $20 that they said they would bring next time and so I let them jump and I just took off some of my points that I earned by cleaning pits and extra chores to let my friends jump for free and I forgot about it.

Fast forward a few weeks, the regulars ended up tossing a $20 bill at me in the middle of a busy shift and I was surprised and caught off guard so I put it in my pocket and forgot about it as I carried on with my duties. One of the other supervisors was getting ready to take over for me and saw me out the money in my pocket. Thinking that I was stealing from the register, he told my manager after I had left.

I got a call asking me to come back in a few hours later. My manager showed me the footage of me pocketing the money and said after talking to the regular who gave it to me found out that I also let them stay an extra session. She said that this is stealing and fired me right there. No amount of explaining could fix it and I even returned the $20. 

I accepted my fate and tried my best to leave on a good note by writing thank you notes to all the managers for the good experience I had working there.

Fast forward a couple of months, those same regulars asked if they could use some of my points to jump (1 point = 1 hour and I had almost 70 points) and I said sure. I got a call from the manager that fired me and told me that because I was fired because I stole from the gym, I can no longer use the points that I earned from hours and hours of extra work because I am now untrustworthy, and since I earned most of them from the previous owner then they didn't have to honour it. She also told me that I didn't take accountability for what I did just because I didn't think it was a big deal, and said I was manipulative because I wrote them nice letters after I was fired. 

I just want to know if I really deserved to be fired for this and treated as a criminal afterwards? It was my first offense ever and seemed pretty minor to me...



TLDR: I got fired for letting some kids jump on trampolines for too long after the shut down and labeled as a manipulative thief by ex-manager.",13Jul2020,1

377,"(We have been dating for about 2.5 yrs for reference) 

A couple weeks ago, my bf received an anonymous STD check text message on his birthday.  The message read along the lines of “A sexual partner tested positive for an STD &amp; recommends that you also get tested.” We both happened to be next to each other when he read the text and he appeared confused as he thought it was a spam message but realized it was real after a quick google search. 

A few thoughts crossed my mind in this moment. I was immediately concerned as I thought it might have been a prank or that someone has mistyped a phone number in the system before sending the message. However, when I asked him why he thought he had received the message, he became defensive and said that he had previous gfs before me. This reaction upset me and I asked for clarification as to what he meant and he said,” I don’t know, unless it was like a latent thing I don’t know why I would have gotten this. I didn’t cheat on you or anything. I’ve only been with you.” Knowing that it was his birthday, I did my best not to argue but I let him know that his defensive reaction did little to reassure me and instead raised flags for alarm. He apologized and we left it as that. I told myself that I would move past it and forget it as I needed to trust him. 

However, I think this has unfortunately planted a seed in my head that has snowballed although I know I should trust him. Most recently I’ve found that he had looked up his ex gf on social media (a very particular that has caused a few problems in the past) and although I have no actual proof of correlation, it has reignited my concern for the previous STD message. I hate that I feel concerned about it and want to trust that nothing fishy is happening but I can’t shake the feeling now. We have not been intimate for a while due to the pandemic as we don’t live together but I’m wondering if I should still get checked. 

How can I shake this concern and/or voice it to my bf without coming off as accusatory. I don’t want this concern to snowball and think it might be better to squash it now before it causes bigger problems.",13Jul2020,1

In the meantime I went on long walks with my son and tried to keep as active as possible. Think my son turned 8 months when he started sleeping through when I officially started exercising again. 

Anyway I do a full workout dvd and have a rowing machine that I use and some yoga. In the workout dvd you do squats, use dungbells for the arms and scrunches, cardio and all that jazz. I kind of swip and swap what I do for the day or do one in the morning and one in the evening. The problem is? My body is in a lot of pain when I work out. The bottom of my legs ache when I try to do the cardio again, my lower back hurts and since then my left leg has ached constantly and still does. 

Now I used to exercise before I was pregnant and I never had problems like this. My boyfriend is saying that it because I’m not taking enough breaks to let my body heal but I used to work out every day, I don’t want to take days at a time to rest otherwise what’s the point? I do take breaks but even when I go back my legs are still in pain. It’s so frustrating. I just don’t feel as fit anymore. I do see some improvements in my legs and butt. Even my arms but I can’t shake the belly.

382,"So I’m (24M) and an English language major studying to teach English as a foreign language. Since I go to school full time during the larger part of the year, I dedicate myself to working a full time job (50-100 hours a week) to help pay for university out of pocket as much as I can. I started writing a story about a continuous dream I’ve been having for about the last year or so. I had a weekend off a few months ago and really sat down to write. I got through about 100 or so pages and dropped it into a few communities I frequent online and I had gotten a lot of positive feedback and was asked to continue writing. I’d love to do it, as I found it really fun and enjoyed being able to write down the story my dream tells. However with how much I work, I don’t ever have any time to write. My question lies in, how should I go about setting aside time to write? I was thinking of taking a week off work to really buckle down and just let everything flow, but I’ve been a workaholic ever since I started working when I was 15.

387,"So my ex and I are friends. we were hanging out at my house and she fell asleep, so naturally like the snoopy fuck I am I took her phone and well, snooped around. I found some dms to another guy (note she has a BF, these dms were not from her BF) first message was “so nobody finds out about last night, right?” And then he replied with some shit like “what happened last night ;)?” So naturally my assumption is she’s cheating on her bf. Now, I’ve been cheated on before when I was younger, and that shit absolutely ruined me, sent me into the worst depression in my life.I ask her what she did they other night, said she was at a party, and I asked her if she knew this guy that she was dm’ing. She said she’s heard of him. I asked her if he was at the party, she said she didn’t think so. So I was like okay, enough bullshit. I told her that I heard from a friend at the party that they had gotten together. She denied it. I then told her that she needed to be straight up with me and then she said “he tried to kiss her.” Then it went from that to “he did kiss me.” and “But it wasn’t my fault, he was drunk and kissed me.” And said she already told her bf, so I asked her to put her bf on the phone and she starts going off on me telling me to stay out of her shit and that it doesn’t concern me. She got pissed and basically told me to fuck off if I didn’t believe her. 

then she called me later in the middle of the night. So I was thinking of asking her again to try to get her to fess up. Almost everytime I asked her if she cheated on her bf she stuttered or didn’t even answer my question. She then kept asking “why don’t you believe me?” And I said “because I think you cheated” and she would say “I said no!” Well this went on for about 20 minutes then I stopped cuz it was gettin nowhere. Asked her again and she basically hung up and said she didn’t want to talk to me if I can’t trust her.I don’t believe her, also I know that she cheated on a bf she had years ago, and never told her then bf until a few weeks later when her friend ratted her out. I’ve told her if she doesn’t want to confide in me she doesn’t have to but she needs to get her shit

Anyways between all the stuttering she was giving me and changing the story, telling me to F off, I have a very strong feeling she was cheating on her bf.

Feel bad for her bf, never really talked to the guy, seems like a good enough guy who doesn’t know what he’s gotten himself into. If I can’t get her to tell the whole story then I think my next step is to give him a call.

Or maybe I’m just fucking crazy. I was snooping on her phone mind you. Not saying I’m perfect but fuck cheaters.

388,"Hey everyone! This is done on mobile so please ignore the block of text. 

I am currently in a great relationship with someone of many years and we are considering moving in together, possibly looking at getting engaged and buying a house in the next few years. I have committed 6+ years to this person and dated them right out of high school. I have never been with anyone else and haven’t really had a chance to find myself. 

I am a very weird kind of person (according to my partner) in that I don’t like where I live, I want to live all around the world (for example spend three months in Thailand then move to Italy and just work wherever I can), and I am desperately in love with New York. This is all fairly new to me aside for my love of travel which I have always had. I absolutely won’t to find someone who can go with me on these amazing trips and then come back to our cute apartment in New York and work to pay for the next trip. Right now the person I’m with and am setting up my life with is not at all that but he is amazing! 

He is kind, funny, smart, my best friend, someone I can genuinely talk to. He also is very stubborn, doesn’t like new things, and I frequently have to beg or force him to do the things I love to do (even things like once in a while seeing a movie that I pick out or trying a new coffee shop). I feel very deflated when I have to argue with him over these stupid things and he has no big desire to travel anywhere. In fact, he said my idea of living somewhere for a few months or doing those types of trips was stupid and he can’t see why you would want to stay somewhere longer than a week. 

He is very handsome however he is not what I think of if I were to pick out specific features and qualities for a guy I would look for. My problem is, is that I didn’t really give it much of a thought when we started dating and I’m now realizing that I’ve grown to like him but I’m not feeling that crazy passion that everyone describes. 

We live in a small town which he loves and I would love to live in a big city like New York where you can get lost and your neighbors don’t know your every detail. 

My question is: should I stay with him because about 85% of the time he makes me happy and I think I would fine with a life with him or should I try to start over and do what I dreamed of? Am I being ridiculous and maybe giving up something really good for something that might not even be a possibility?

That was the point in time where I had pretty much no money for food, I was also at the lowest my depression has ever gotten, and really just not having a good time.

The last thing that I texted my ex-wife was a long and very angry (super duper fucking asshillole shitty) message about child support.  It was set much higher then it should have been, and it is 100% my fault. I didn't take part in the rulings with the judge. I still haven't got the courage to look at her texts from that convo, or fully read the court documents.

 I thought I would have a job in a week or two (that was also more than two months ago) I have since seen the hardships of employment searching right now.

I really don't know what to do anymore.
 
Being an older sibling, I don't want to see my sisters fail, or suffer from the same mistakes that I made when I was younger. I want to see them do better than ne and suceed, because that's what truly makes me happy about my sisters. Growing up in an Asian household, I've faced plenty of punishments, especially me being the eldest. 

I've made so many sacrifices for my sisters and yet as time goes on I feel as if they ignore my existence more and more. (Ik this sounds corny but) I love them more than they could ever think. But I really don't think it's the same for them.

I've always wanted to be a good role model for my sisters so they could do what they wanted without having the burden and pressure I've experienced as the eldest, especially since we're talking about an asian household here. Infront of them I would always clean up after them and for myself, I would practice instrument without having to be asked, make my bed and everything, just so that maybe I'd have a slight influence on them.

But no, they don't even listen to what I have to say anymore. When they do something wrong, I try to tell them and help but no, they either just ignore me or simply respond with ""i dont care"". Then they just walk away and leave me to deal with the problem.

One of my sisters recently picked up the piano, and me, having played piano for 10+years, I thought I could help her and fix her mistakes.

But no, I was wrong any suggestions or advice I gave she just gives the usual idc, and does the complete opposite, and when I tell her to practice properly, she just nags and complains to our mother, who then tells me to either tell her nicely (which I do) or just don't interfere. How the fuck am i not meant to interfere when I obviously dont want to see her making the same fucking mistakes over again and completely disregarding my advice? Its not like i use a negative tone or anything, I simply give my advice.

Well today i finally snapped.

She was practicing once again and once again I offered my advice, this time she should maybe control her dynamics (how loud/soft one plays a piece) a little bit. She replied with I don't care and just continued playing. I couldn't take it anymore, so for the first time in my life I swore at her. I screamed ""what the fuck is your problem"" infront of her face. My mum also heard me and got mad at me.

 Now I'm in my room, crying, writing this post.

I don't even know what to do anymore. I hate this. I hate being the oldest and having to live like this. I just want to ve an older brother who cares for their sisters. But now I feel like even that is impossible.

What do I do? I've let down my sisters once already, and I hate myself for it. I dont think I can live with my sisters just ignoring me like this.

I don’t have bad grades and I am completely capable of myself. But everytime he talks to me or has an interaction with me he expresses his doubt and is generally negative about it, e.g when my little sister spilt water colour on my room carpet I told him I was able to clean up the mess but he came into my room and started to do unnecessary labour that I told him I’d do, he then questioned my method of cleaning up and when he got fed up with wiping with a paper towel he stood up and said “if your so confident that you can clean it up do it yourself then” and walked off this put a pretty big dent in my confidence and I felt no motivation in cleaning it up after because it feels that my dad didn’t believe I could clean a simple stain. A big one is that I told my dad that I’m aiming for a fairly prestigious uni in my area, he asked why and I responded by saying that I wanted a job that requires that field and the better education would help me. He then said that I’m not sure of myself and said again “if I’m so confident then I have to get that degree and nothing else” he then told me that’s a promise and that I have to keep it. I know this doesn’t sound like much but this for all my life had built up quite the anxiety and doubt in all my actions.

I want to see a therapist about my dad but I’m scared that my dad is going to shut it down because he doesn’t “believe” in professional help. I also want to leave my house after I turn 18/19 but considering the Estate prices around my area I think it’s going to be quite hard.

402,"Hi everyone,
I’ve been struggling with this for over a year now and it’s just getting worse, I go to therapy but it hasn’t been helping so I thought the sensible thing would be to ask a bunch of strangers on the internet. I’ve had depression and the whole “I want to isolate myself” before, but this feels way different- it’s more annoyance and apathy. 
I feel like I’m becoming a robot. It started with some family problems, feeling like my little sisters are getting on my nerves, and then starting to snap at them heaps and heaps and becoming really uptight and grumpy around them- I live with my mum and I only see them on the weekends, they’re small and cute and love me and aren’t too demanding and are very generous and sweet but I noticed I wanted to see them less and less- even when I miss them terribly, as soon as I see them I am ready to go home again.
Then it started happening with friends, and my partner, I get annoyed by their presence about five minutes after I see them. At the beginning it was annoyance of them asking me to help with their problems but it then turned into annoyance at them in general, but especially low tolerance when I feel like they’re making a bad decision in their life even though I know it’s their life and their decisions not mine. I’m good at hiding it so it barely ever shows, but it’s been so long now they know I haven’t been keeping in contact as much.

I am 23, I just graduated uni two years ago, and am 6 months into my first big-contract-full-time job. I am a teacher so there’s a lot of planning/marking after work, And I’d say I’m working 50-60 hours a week, but when I do have free time I resent any time I spend with other people and would much rather be alone sitting in silence being a blank sheet of paper.

My therapist says it’s because I’m just in survival mode with my job, but it’s been two years and nothing is getting better even when I put boundaries in place with work or “me time” or anything.

It’s getting to the point now that I wake up, get ready for work, go to work, come home, do an hour of work, sit on my bed and stare into space for an hour, cook dinner, eat dinner, and go to bed by 8pm. If my partner or a friend comes over for dinner or anything I just want them to leave, I’ve tried taking up a hobby that I enjoy but I just get tired out and then want to go home and rest by myself again. I am nearly shouting when someone asks me to do them a favour or swing by the shops etc.
I am losing my friends, my little sisters who mean the world to me, and while I love my job I just struggle to face it every day.
What is happening to me? Am I burning out after being full time for only 6 months? Do I just hate everyone now? Am I turning into a hermit? I just feel like I want to run away and hide in a cave.",13Jul2020,1
403,"I went from fast pace SD Cali to a gated community in Macon Georgia. I got sent here because my father couldn’t “control” me. And now he’s moving because of how fucking expensive it is in Cali:(. Since I got sent here like two day after me and my dad got into a fight, I have none of my shit and I’m hurt/bored/pissed.

404,"During a session with my therapist we were talking about current events and they stated that what was going on in the world was ""retarded"".

This person has never spoken like this before so it came as a surprise and I was stunned into silence and did not say anything at the time. However I would like to bring it up in my next session and explain to this person that I do not appreciate that word being used as a replacement for ""stupid"", ""bad"", ""wrong"", or whatever word they meant it to be.

 I do not believe that they are someone who condones using this word this way. It may very well have been a slip of the tongue from someone who didn't understand the use of the word when they were younger. This person is somewhere between 40 and 55 years old and I want to give them the benefit of the doubt until proven otherwise.

How should I address this issue?
I already know what I'm going to do if they brush it off, or find a way to make an excuse for why they use the word or why it's okay to use the word. I will no longer see them as a therapist. However if they understand what they said was inappropriate and show me that they are not going to do it again I am okay with giving them a second chance.

I have an appointment on Thursday, so any advice will be welcomed and helpful. thank you for reading this, thank you for your time and I hope you all have a good day.",13Jul2020,1
405,"Today, my mom told me that a house inspector is coming to check every room (including mine.) I'm a very private person and don't feel comfortable with this at all. I don't even allow my friends/family in my room because I'm embarrassed about it.  She didn't even ask me first or give a specific date, she just told me that ""they're coming 'sometime this week' and I need to be ready."" 

I'm really upset about this. I got mad and yelled, which I shouldn't have done because that just started an argument and pissed her off even more.  Although, It's hard not to yell because she has a habit of interrupting me mid-sentence.   
Later today, I need to calmly explain to her why I don't like people (especially strangers) in my room.

406,"First off i’m sorry if this isn’t the best place to type this, if it should be somewhere else please let me know. Second, i’m going to try to keep this as simple as can be, but no promises. I’m writing this on my phone and in a tough time so i’m sorry for any mistakes.

I am 21 years old, living with my beautiful and amazing girlfriend and our roommate. I had a stable job I enjoyed doing (basically didn’t hate waking up to work like I have with all my other jobs), and looked forward to seeing my coworkers every day. I say had because I work at a school and COVID has since shut that down until supposedly September. I make decent money, have good savings, amazing family, amazing girlfriend, but for some reason I am never happy.

I feel like I have everything I want in life, besides my own family which is the biggest reason i’m still alive. I have never talked to a professional or doctor but I believe I have pretty bad depression as some days (like today) I find myself entirely numb and don’t reply to anyone around me. My girlfriend has become used to it as I tell her (when i’m feeling normal) that when I do this to just leave me alone and don’t stress. So she will ask if i’m hungry and if I want to watch stuff with her and I just lay there frozen, no responses. I later work up courage to at least show i’m alive and then went for a drive alone to go get us some food and get me outside. On the drive I feel entirely numb, out of my body, and seem to totally accept death if it were to happen. Thoughts of texting my girlfriend “I love you” just in case, but then not because it’ll likely freak her out.

I believe a lot of this stems from me having no passion. All I do is play video games and occasionally hike/surf when my lady wants to go outside. We also visit my family every week or two. During these times i’m as happy as can be with no bad thoughts at all. Then as soon as i’m back alone everything switches back.

I feel entirely off track and might end up putting this at the top because this is what I feel is most important. I have ZERO empathy most of the time. School shootings, event shootings, people just dying, etc. I just think nothing of it and I feel like a normal person feels at least a little sad or something towards it. I lost my mom when I was in middle school, and didn’t even cry. However I have cried many times about her occasionally in the years after. Other than that the only times I cry are when I watch movies/youtube videos. Usually I cry when it’s something involved with love, family love, friend love, or partner love. Yes Theory is my favorite channel (if anyone is familiar) and just their speeches about people they love and meet or their stories make me cry. But death doesn’t. I don’t know what to do, I just want to feel.

I will also add that I recently lost not only my entire friend group, but my best friend since birth. This was because I over exaggerated many things and even lied occasionally to make either myself or my friends sound cooler. They then called me out and “wanted to help me” and I accepted but they just kept kicking me down til I just said bye. I feel like if they really wanted to help me (on an issue I didn’t see is so harming) then they would work with me instead of denying everything I say. Anyways I bring this up because for some reason, it doesn’t bother me at all that I don’t talk to them anymore, and I feel like that’s not normal. I do occasionally think of them or maybe trying to reach out in some way, but very very rarely and never actually do.

Sorry for the long rant i’m just hoping someone out there has been through or even going through what I am so I know i’m not alone. Please ask any questions.",13Jul2020,1
407,"Hey there, perhaps this topic is quite simple in essence and I'm just over complicating it, just wanted to put this out so I could get some guidance. Sorry if this gets too long, and I'm not a native speaker so excuse any grammar mistakes.

The thing is about a week ago I met these two wonderful people in an online game after I was playing on ""fill"" and we won the match, so they added me as a friend and to my surprise they had microphones and were almost my age.

We played some more matches together and spoke about the typical things one asks after meeting someone new on an online game: ""where are you from?"", ""how do you like the game currently?"", ""how many wins do you have?"", etc.

After an hour or so they had to leave so they asked about my Instagram account to keep in touch, I shared my account name because they seemed authentic and I wasn't going to oppose them, I had no reason to and I actually wanted to know how they looked like.

Fast forward a week and I've already talked to them a bit and know them better. They're definitely not catfish, and they're some of the nicest people I've met over the Internet. 

They are portuguese and I'm spanish, meaning if some day in the future we were to meet distances are not a huge problem. We communicate in english even if our languages are really close but I can understand them a bit whenever they're talking to friends who are over at their home or some of their irl friends join the party.

Now, onto the problem. I've had around a dozen of internet friends over the years, most coming from online games in the past 3 years, and many have disappeared overnight. 

I used to think they might've had something important happening to them or they might've got tired and just left without warning, but I'm starting to think it might be me they're getting away from.

I'm a very caring person and when it comes to my friends I like to ask them about how they're doing frequently: not 3-times-a-day-frequently but perhaps once every 2 days or so. I'm not even too annoying with it, it's just a quick check up to see what they're up to and to show them I really care and I'm here to listen to them.

I don't want my new friends to vanish like the others and so far I've talked to them about three times each for about an hour in a week's time, but I'm just dying to know more about them and have a good conversation.

It's been two days since I contacted the girl and I really want to talk to her, and the boy left me on read yesterday after I asked what he was up to and if he was playing a quick match in some minutes.

I'm currently feeling down because of this and I know it sounds really pathetic, but I genuinely just want to talk to them some more without being too annoying, I just can't get the frequency or the content of the conversations right. So far we've been talking about our interests and the state of the game we're playing, if anything I've talked a bit more to the girl as she felt like talking some days ago but now she's on a 7 day vacation and I wouldn't want to bother her.

Any tips on contacting these guys? I'm giving them their time and space for now, but I would want to talk to them more frequently. They're quite important to me and I wouldn't want to see them go like the others.",13Jul2020,1

409,"Im a female and I just turned 20 in June. 

Currently I have a full time job I work 40 hours a week, and I make $15.02 an hour. However I still live at home with my mom and step dad. I also currently don’t have a car, I use my moms cause she can’t drive anymore but I need to get my own car soon cause she’s learning to drive again. 

I know I need to save up to get a car and I need to start saving so I can move out again. I used to have an apartment with my sister when I was in college but after college I moved back in with my mom and my sister moved to Idaho with her fiancé. 

I went to college right after I graduated at 17 and I had to take out student loans to pay for it. Thankfully I already got it paid off. I hate owing anyone money so I started paying it off while I was still in school. I got the loan paid off and my credit score has went up. My Transunion is 728 and my Equifax is 729 though I don’t know the difference between the two as no one ever taught me.

My sister who is 22 just moved back here from Idaho about 2 months ago with my niece who is 4. It’s important to note my sister and I both have very bad anxiety especially with the corona virus stuff going on. I have a heart condition and if i get the corona virus I’d probably die. My sister is currently living with our brother and sister in-law but schools are opening soon maybe and my bother and his wife are planning to send their kids back to school. That makes my sister anxiety so bad cause obviously she doesn’t want her or my niece to get sick. That being said my sister (who is also my best friend) is planning on moving back idaho if my brother sends his kids to school. Cause she lives with them and doesn’t wanna be exposed to anything. 

I obviously don’t want her to go back to Idaho cause she’s my best friend so I told her I’d get an apartment or little house to rent maybe a 2 or 3 bedroom for me, my niece and my sister to live in. My sister is planning on going to college and doesn’t want to have to have a job which I totally understand, when I went to college I had an apartment with her and she paid for everything and I didn’t pay any bills so now I wanna do the same for her. 

However I am terrible with money I have the mindset oh it’s only a dollar or oh I get paid every week so I can always get more money. So I like to spend, spend, spend. I also have the mind set of if I don’t but it for myself who will. I’ve never admitted to having a shopping problem but after looking at my shopping for this month I know for sure I have a problem. 

To give some in-site to my shopping I bought 8 swim suits this month and 17 pairs of shoes. So I need some help or advice. 
 
My goal is to be moved out but August 15th ish because school is supposed to start back up August 13th. I know I can definitely afford to move out and I can afford to take care of the bills too however I’m just scared about my over spending. I don’t have any credit cards or anything so I don’t go into debt but I over spend my own money and stuff and that’s what I need help/advice with.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated",13Jul2020,1

So i'm an 18 year old male and my mom since i've been 18 she has just refused to treat me like an adult. I don't exactly know where to start here so this may be more of a vent/rant if anything but no matter how hard I try to be my age around her and sit her down to talk about how she treats me she brushes it off or throws a tantrum about how hard she works, I understand she works hard and struggles but.. so does most other people's parents, why should I have to be subject to her shitty attitude and laziness when other people go through the same things?

 When it comes to learning how to drive (which I should have learned at 16 but nope she's too lazy to teach me) she constantly says she's going to put me in a driving class which we absolutely do not have money for so that's out of the question or I make arrangements for her to take me out driving but she always cancels on me and tells me she's tired (mind you especially now 90% of her day is sitting on the couch and watching conspiracy videos). If you're wondering why I don't have somebody else teach me is because my dad has too many issues to help me currently and I just literally have nobody else. It's extremely frustrating that I can't just do something everybody else my age can already do.  


Next would be getting a job, since I was in high school she kept telling me not to get one and never helped me until I turned 18, which now all she does is badger me about getting one and only to take my money I earn because she cannot manage her own money. I've applied to so many places already and I normally don't even get a call. I know it's partially my fault and I try to improve now by researching different things to put on my resume and all that but the problem I have is she always tries to change my resume, she tries to make her resume the way she used to when she was my age which as you can guess doesn't really work out the same way it used to and on top of that keeps trying to force me to harass companies I apply to by calling them just about every other day. When I tell her she's wrong based on what other people who are way more experienced in writing resumes these days she throws a tantrum and says they're wrong and that i'm going to do it her way.  


And the last thing and just the worst thing I think is that she basically doesn't allow any criticism whatsoever. Anything I try to tell her she's wrong even in the nicest way I can she just gets upset and throws a tantrum like I said previously saying how hard she works, I get she works hard but it does not give her an excuse to act like a toddler when things do not go her way and to try and tell me i'm just being an abusive (I have never yelled at her once above a small raise of my voice to make her stop yelling nor have I ever said things that are belittling or anything like that). The most this happens with is when I tell her a simple ""no"" it doesn't happen nearly as much since the pandemic but she usually likes to drag me around with her when she goes almost anywhere like i'm some toddler who doesn't get a say in anything. If I say no she tells me i'm going, if I say no again she starts screaming and I feel like I can't do anything and just go with her, I might start saying yes if she would just respect when i'm busy or just accept that if I say no I mean no, but no instead she acts like i'm still a kid and have to go with her places just because she wants me to, I understand why she wants me to but that doesn't give her a reason to throw tantrums about me not wanting me to go.  


I know somewhat why she acts in some of these ways, my dad when they were married was honestly pretty abusive, not physically but would belittle her and scream... a lot. Knowing this though i've been thinking maybe she needs therapy or something like that to heal a bit instead of throwing her anger about it at me and before he moved also my brother. It's so difficult to deal with but I have no way to get away from it currently, I have no place to move to and when I try to live with someone else like maybe my dad (which I know how he was before but he got therapy he's a much better person these days) but she constantly acts like she needs me because she can't clean (she can she just uses back pain as an excuse not to do anything, it isn't nearly as bad as she claims) or take care of her animals by herself which to be honest is NOT my problem, if she cannot take care of them she shouldn't have them. I just want to leave and get on with my life and learn the skills I need to be independent without having to worry about my mom guilt tripping me.",13Jul2020,1

421,"I stay at my boyfriend’s place 4 nights in a week. When I say boyfriend’s place, I mean his parent’s house. We’re currently saving up to buy a place (we’re nearly there! Just a few more months). We used to rent but it inhibited us from saving for a future home. His parents were nice enough to let him stay home for the time being while we save up enough to be able to get on the property ladder.

The issue is, sex has been happening less while we’re both back in our parents house. I am the one who goes over as it’s always just been our dynamic and it works best for us. His parents live in a 3 bed house and mine is only in an apartment. Thing is, I understand that the idea of having sex at your parents house can dampen the mood. I also could be loud, but I try to be quiet when his parents are around. However, it’s now getting to me because while we’re having less sex, he’s been wanting bjs all the time. I’m more than happy to comply as I like pleasing him, it turns me on. But I feel like ever since we’ve gone back to our parents, it’s been more one sided. He get’s blowjobs all the time when I’m at his, and I’ll be lucky if we have sex more than once a week, sometimes in two weeks. I’ve explained to him that I’ve got needs to. I’ve got a high sex drive and this has been putting me down, but he always just says once we get our own place, it’ll be much different, and that it just really doesn’t get him in the mood being at his parent’s house. 

To be fair, we did have regular sex when we were renting so I know how different it could be. I guess I’m just really frustrated and I feel like I’m always the one pleasing him. It also doesn’t help that there’s been time’s I’ve initiated sex at night, and he rejects it as he says it’s embarrassing if they hear us. But if it comes to bjs, he’s down for it straight away. I don’t know what to do? I get men make less noise when being pleasured so it’s not as much of a problem while we’re at his parents house, but this is starting to really get to me. It’s been more than a year now. It’s been more than a year of limited sex and unlimited bjs and it’s starting to make me feel unwanted. 

I feel like I’m being unreasonable everytime I ask for sex and it sucks. I feel like I can’t voice out my frustration without me sounding whiny and unaccommodating.

We should be able to buy somewhere by the end of this year, but how do I get over this for the time being? Or how can I make him understand? He does give me oral etc at times, but I’d say majority of the time, it’s just me pleasuring him.",13Jul2020,1

I realised I'm the kind of person that really thrives on introspection and talking out loud and just acknowledging every idea or thought in my mind. It's almost like I check back in with myself in that time. I wasn't doing that for the past month I think. Now i feel alone with my thoughts and there isnt anything to say. The lockdown has started to feel like a sick experiment. 
I'm really tired and exhausted most days. I dont know what it is maybe lack of stress. This is a transitional period for me and things are more complex because of corona. 
I miss my friends and because my college is almost over it's an end of an era and corona took away the last few months of our time.
I feel like there is no order or system with everything that has been going on which makes me think that nothing I do or will every do will matter in any real way.

Today while looking at old pictures I realised that I've changed in a drastic way to who I was even a year ago. I dont think the same way, act or do the same things.

But when I started college I started to become really motivated and confident in everything I did. Over time I felt really empowered and had a good self image and my life was overall improving. 
These days I'm so much more insecure I feel really bad and lost and completely detached from the person I was and though was my true self. 

I'm supposed to be studying for masters entrances which I used to love to do but I now get extremely tired after short periods of time. In may I was flying through this subject, a chapter a day non stop i felt so motivated because it's something I'm genuinely interested in, but I had to put it on pause to focus on final exams of my bachelor's which was such a fuckfest, I was completely riddled with anxiety and studying, which was the purest alone time I have, was dissolving into a black sludge of doom, contaminated by my very blank mind.
Now I cant focus, my attention is divided and I'm very unmotivated. I feel some odd combination of eustress and distress at the same time. I feel less like myself each passing day. 
I think I cant focus on anything now is because my mind was conditioned into associating studying with anxiety and feeling insecure. 

How do I condition my mind to thinking positively towards studies and feel more motivated?",13Jul2020,1

426,"I've been dealing with mental health issues since I was 10, I've hidden my issues from everyone I know. I'm 16 now and I'm at an all time low. 

I've made the decision to try and get help, it wasn't easy since I'm really shy and I breakdown whenever I try to talk about my mental state. I cried just texting my mother that I wanted to see my doctor.

I'm not sure what to do now. I'm seeing my GP in the weekend and I'm unsure on whether or not they'll help me mentally, and I'm unsure on what to ask. I just want to be diagnosed finally, since I haven't officially been diagnosed on whether or not I have depression or something else.

428,"Hello,this is my first ever question on reddit. I need your advice on something that has been going for a long time.

How do I begin, well basically there's this guy let's call him Shrimp. Shrimp is a nice dude, but he has one flaw he keeps nagging me trying to make me ""fall"" for him for a loooong time. To be exact somewhere around four and half years. I don't know what happened this year, but he got much more intense this past quarantine period. He started sending good morning texts, call me pretty, send comparison pictures of other girls and me, good night texts, spamming me with messages/calls at 4 am and much much more etc... Ik it seems harmless but it has been going on for too long and I'm frankly tired of it. I tried to explain to him that I have a loving boyfriend, but it won't go through to him. I tried blocking him, he spams on a group chat asking why I blocked him and that I'm mean. The thing I can't even report his harassment as he can just say I was just being ""friendly"". I really don't know what to do I dropped many hints that I'm not interested in his advances, but anytime I do I just get another confession from him. I once told him that I wouldn't date him, because he was too short and now he has an obsession of becoming taller than me. Not only that now Shrimp wants me to desperately meet him on the beach, but I'm very uncomfortable to do so because of what happened last time I did. Basically I met up with him and my friends during this period and he non-stop was eyeing me up and down, INFRONT OF MY FRIENDS. I told him no and made excuses countless of times, but he just ignores it.
 
Please fellow redditors pleasee how do I get through to him, he goes to my school and I have to see him in September. I feel bad for him, but I really don't know what to do at this point. If you have any advice that'd be terrific, thank you so much in advance.

431,"I'm an art thief. Have been pretty ever since I started drawing.

In primary school I had a bit of a natural talent for drawing and was known for being good at art. Unfortunately that talent wore out once I reached high school, but I already had a reputation for being an artist amongst all my friends and family, and I've received countless art-related birthday presents, so when I noticed my art wasn't really improving at all and I was at roughly the same level as everyone else on the planet, I just sat on it and kept it a secret. It felt like I had all this pressure weighing on me to keep performing. So I started faking it.

I started finding obscure artworks and just started straight up plagiarising. I just wanted to keep my reputation and not let on that I just wasn't good anymore, and it just kept working. But, of course, even though no one else knew, I knew, and it was draining me so quickly. Every compliment I got on ""my"" work only started hurting, I got no satisfaction from it, it felt like I was spiralling. But at this point it was a habit. I had no artistic talent of my own so I shamefully stole from other people.

I tried to break the habit more than once, but every time I did it just reminded me how rubbish I am at it and how I can't do anything on my own, so I just gave up and went back to plagiarism. I don't have my own style or anything like that. My art is comparable to the average 14 year old's.

So yeah, my question is, how do I break this habit properly? I know that the answer will more or less be 'just draw your own stuff without copying' but I really hope there's more to it then that because I can't stand looking at any art I do myself.",13Jul2020,1

It’s incredibly painful and I honestly don’t even know what to think. I also have a younger sibling who my mother has simply been feeding a ton of propaganda basically about how good life will be back in our hometown. When I know they won’t be as it is not a very well developed place and it’s infuriating as I wish I could have a sibling on my side.

Asking with the uncertainty of finding a job soon after graduation due to the pandemic. It’s just a very hard time. I feel so incredibly alone and anxious and just don’t even know how to handle this situation as I never would’ve thought it would happen.

435,"Hey guys

I’m in the middle of the most random case at work and need some help with Facebook. 

A married woman got drunk on a day out and did something she isn’t proud of towards me. To cover herself for the last 9 months she’s lied to her husband about it and said my answer to her was very bad, in an attempt to take heat off of her and put it on me. I’ve had grief from them both. 

A couple of weeks ago we were re-seated at work and now pretty much sit next to eachother. I emailed her to sort this out for good and within 2 emails we were arguing. I stupidly mentioned that I know she’s twisted my words...

She filed a complaint to HR for misuse of emails AND harassment. She’s trying to get me fired because she now knows that I’m aware of her lies to the husband and what that could do. She has sat down and very cleverly made a gigantic false story up but fortunately through Facebook and witnesses I’m able to disprove nearly every single accusation. She hasn’t heard this yet.

I think that a great point to have in there would be when we became friends on social media and who added who.

436,"So, pretty much my entire life until I moved out at 18, my dad emotionally abused me. He's a complicated person because one half of him is a good dad, if I need something then he'll do it for me and he works really hard for the family. But the other is obviously the abusive side. He's a person who isn't self-aware or aware of how he makes others feel. I never allowed him to just treat me that way without standing up for myself or just allowing him to act that way without consequences. As a result of how he treated me, I never allowed him to have a father-daughter relationship with me like he desperately wants, I'm civil with him but I'm extremely uncomfortable just being in the same room as him.

He has improved a lot and doesn't act nearly as close to how he was in the past and because he's improving, I want to show him I appreciate him for everything he does for the family because I know he doesn't feel respected or loved (which he isn't aware the reason for that is just the after effect of how he treated me for years). I'm extremely uncomfortable with showing any emotion or vulnerability in front of him, I even cringe when he hugs me. So is there any way I could do something for him without showing that side to me?

I miss the feeling when I would have ambition for thinking of being a guy's girlfriend because I beleived that no one could compare to me and the bind we would have. Now, I can't even imagine being with someone because I either think of the competition or think of what my ex did. 

Every now and then I think to myself that i'm content alone and hate being around people anyway but I feel like thats a cope.

451,"I (M 19) have been having a hard time these days because I just heard some shocking news. I made a new account because I cant access my old one, so I know this is the sub where you get some real advice. I never had a serious challenge before so I expect help, and I am being serious.

So I had a tutor (F, currently 42) who taught me for about 4-5 years (from like 8th grade to senior year) who helped me with math and test prep, and she was really nice to me. You probably know how this is going to go so I'll cut to the chase: I have a crush on my tutor. I know it's a weird trait that happens to guys sometimes, where they would develop crushes for their female teachers. I never knew this would happen to me, but the world is filled with unexpected things. I know most of you reading this are laughing and disgusted, and that's the reason why I am on this sub writing my thoughts out. Believe me, it's not like that feeling where its like ""oh I want to sleep with her"" and end it like that. She not only helped me with school work, but also took the time to talk with me, and hear my struggles at school. I don't know when, but all of a sudden, she just became so attractive to me. Yes, she is 23 years older than me, so this is creepy. But I really ""like"" her, and not just as a woman, but also as a mentor and friend.

She and I established a close relationship, and I even ask her questions for college math courses from time to time. We also text alot about how I am doing in college and all that. She obviously doesnt know how I feel, and I hope she never finds out or I might get seriously disowned by my parents. Anyway, as I mentioned that I received shocking news, here is the part. So I recently found out that my tutor had been married all this time. Not like recently, but she was married for about 14 years or something according to my mom. I also found out about her age at the same time too, and was older than I expected. Mind you, she already looks too young to be in her mid-life, and I expected her to be like at most around 8-10 years older than me. Also, her house had no family pictures and was pretty small, so I expected she was single. She doesnt do any social media either. But I also heard from my mom that she faced some issues with her husband. I think they separated but arent divorced or something so they probably have two homes so each could have their own space. I dont really know the details, but you could imagine what my face expression was like when I heard this from my mom.

I honestly dont know what to do now. I've liked my tutor for like 4 years now, and it's really not easy to forget about her. On top of that, it was legitimately sincere, and I didnt have any crushes in high school except her. I feel so guilty for developing these feelings to her despite that she is married. Honestly, I want to ask my mom if my tutor has children (hopefully not), but I just decided to stay quiet to prevent any suspicion. 

It's not like I am in the appropriate position to confess to my tutor, as that is definitely an asshole move as well as a breaking point in my friendship with her. But I just cant stop thinking about her. And I just cant find a new crush right now because of covid, so I'm sort of stuck in my mind right now. What should I do?",13Jul2020,1

454,"Sorry if the format is off I'm using mobile.

Hello, I'm not really all that sure if this is the correct subreddit to post my concerns on or not but I hope it is and I hope someone can offer me some well needed advise.  

I know the title makes me seem really sensitive, I'm not sure if I'm just being a baby or my feelings are valid in this situation. I'm hoping someone offers me a second point of view. 

This involves me - me, my older brother - J and my best friend- S (initials have been changed)

A few hours ago my best friend snapped me and said something regarding a guy and she told me some really spicy stuff was said. I told her to spill what happened and she told me she wanted to tell me the next time we saw eachother (we're both still in quarantine so I'm not sure when this will be), I felt bummed out but I agreed, she then dropped that she already told my older brother everything that happened the night before, I asked her why and she said ""it's fine don't be like that, I only told him because you weren't awake. It was like 3 and I wanted to tell someone"". I feel as if it's important to add that I was awake (I have a horrible sleeping pattern I know).

There have been many occurences like this but for some reason this one really hit me hard, after she said this I said ""oh, it's good to know you choose to tell my older brother what happened and you won't even give me a rundown lol I feel betrayed"" I said this with a joking tone, even though I probably shouldn't have. S replied with laughing emojis.

I'm not sure why this instance upset me so much considering there has been way worse things she has said and done to me but I think because it involved my brother it really burned. I'll give you a rundown of how it led up to this point (I'm sorry if this is confusing).

My best friend S and I met around 4 and a half years ago in school, we instantly clicked and have been super close ever since, our friendship hasn't always been great, there have been many times where we fought about things but we've always made up or just stopped talking until it didn't bother us anymore. My older brother J and I have always been pretty close, I'll admit we do tend to fight alot but it's usually over dumb sibling things like who gets to use the t.v. first.

Around a year ago S approached me and asked my opinion on if I would be comfortable with her approaching my brother and beginning a ""relationship"" (they're not actually dating, just messaging and constantly flirting with eachother). I told S that I wasn't very comfortable with them starting a relationship and that I would prefer if they didn't, she said okay and I thought that was the end of it.

Shortly after my brother came up to me and told me she had added him on snap and they've been talking. J told me ""I think she has a crush me or something"". I will admit I told him about S approaching me and I told him about how she often talks about him because I thought it was cute and funny at first. 

Fast forward a few months and this has escalated to the point where whenever I talk to my brother the conversation is always about how S talks to him all the time, or when I talk to my best friend the conversation is always about how she got J to talk to her and the things they talk about. They both have been in and out of relationships in this time and I know they are both talking to other people,
It has been like this for around a few months now. 

My relationship with my older brother has  diminished to the point where I can't be around him without starting a fight and I've started painting him in a horrible light, I've also started distancing myself from my friend and whenever I talk to her I start tearing up. I'm not sure if I'm doing this because of jealousy or if it's something else.

I approached my parents and told them how I felt but they told me I was just being sensitive and that J and S only wanted to have fun while their still young. I was still unsure how I felt so I approached mine and my best friends mutual friend group during a discord call for more opinions (S was not present when I asked) 3 of my friends agreed with me and said they would be uncomfortable, 1 friend said I was being nosey and too sensitive. I'm still unsure as to how I feel about this. I'm also worried if I should have told them earlier about how I felt because its being going on for over a year now.

I was thinking of approaching both my brother and my best friend separately and telling them how I feel about their relationship and how it's affecting my relationships with them. I was going to do this originally but they're both very important people to me and I don't want to lose either of them over my stupid insecurities.

If someone has advice for me please leave me a comment or pm me, I just want to know what I should do to be happy around my family and friends again.

Also if anyone needs me to eleborate on parts that might not make perfect sense, I can.

I had a big talk with a long-term flakey friend of mine several months ago, after she figured there was something wrong and asked if i just didn't want to hang out with her anymore. So I told her that i need a break from this friendship because we just aren't compatible anymore, reasons: her being flakey and canceling schedules often, not responding my texts for several weeks, being on the phone a lot when we saw each other, always reluctant to meet up...etc. So as you could see i was pretty straight foward.  


After our big talk, she apologized and said she understood. Yet, she still continued asking me out. The first time i told her that i wasn't feeling it. And now it's the second time. I do not hate her, but i'm just tired of this friendship with her since i've tolerated a lot of her behaviors for many years and I am just really over it. Maybe we will be friends in 10 years, but for now, im not willing to invest more of my time and energy. What are your experiences with   


Is there a need to have a second big talk? Is there a nicer way to let her know that i am not in the mood for hanging out for the next few years so please do not contact me again?",13Jul2020,1
456,"I'm yrs. old and need some advice and words of encouragement from you guys, coz I have no friends to talk to when It comes to my problems in life.
I had a fight with my parents because they favor my older sister more than me, and after that I looked back
On my past. Throughout highschool I've been bullied alot because I'm ""wierd"", no one really aproach me back then, nobody wants to be friends with me, and because of that my confidence is crushed. I cannot speak for myself because of that and people often laughed at my back. Throughout my 4yrs. Of highschool I was depressed and suicidal my parents doesn't really cared about me and I have no friends to talk to at that time.
But recently on that time I have started watching these ""reincarntion"" anime where they go another world after death, and I have come to a conclusion where ""what if I die restart my life and get a better life, family, friends etc.""
I was fscinated by that Idea and began to fantasize about it every night because I just really wanted a better than what I have today. I have several attempts every night but my fear is the one that stopped me, I'm a coward and my crushed confidence makes it even worse, I've endured 4yrs. Of highschool with humiliation and torment and even now people laugh at me and that made me severly anxious on what am I going to do, I never left my room because of that.

458,"I started a new job as an assistant at a local bank last march. The department I'm working at specializes on loans (e.g. for houses, apartments etc.). We are a very small team; my boss, another guy and myself. 
The numbers in this department have been going up for the last few years. We get recommended quite a lot. Therefore there's always a ton of work. 

I got into my new work really quickly and I also start having my routines. But nonetheless I can't handle this huge amount of work. It never gets less and I always have to work overtime, even though my boss doesn't want his employees to work long hours. And overtime won't be paid, you'll have to take the extra hours off - I can't even to that because then my tasks will wait for me and my mountain of to-dos  will only grow. The person doing this job before me never had problems with the amount of tasks my boss told me when I asked him.

I took two weeks of as a summer holiday. My last days of work were horrible because they realized I'd be gone for some time and gave me even more tasks. At the moment I'm trying to spend my last few days of holiday relaxing but my job always pops up in my mind. It has already started to stress me out and I kind of fear my first day of work after holiday.

459,"Basically, I’ve been friends with this girl since 6th grade and now we’re seniors in high school and we’re going to be roommates in university for a year before I transfer to another university. Sometimes she’ll make me second guess myself because she insults me quite frequently. Once I asked her if anybody has ever said anything mean about me to her and she said, “no, you’re kind of a nobody” and it stung me for a reason. Another time we were talking about a classmate and she remarked that “everyone knows he’s smart and that you’re not as smart as him.” The most common type of insult she throws at me is my intellect. She will constantly remark that I’m stupid or dumb. Sometimes when I insult her back she gets defensive and says I’m being rude. But other times she surprises me and tells me I’m smart for doing something or she compliments me. I’m in a very confusing situation because when she’s being rude to me I just want to end the friendship but her occasional pleasant behavior reels me back in.",13Jul2020,1
460,"I (17M) am currently in a ""relationship"" with a close friend of mine (17F), I use quotation marks because we didn't make anything official yet. Well my problem starts way back in 2018 when I was only 15. I had a big crush on this other girl, and I was planning to tell her I had thing for her. On my birthday party, I finally told her that because my friend forced my hand basically. She told me that in the moment she didn't really want to have anything with anyone, but if waited a little bit we could have a thing. Some weeks pass by, I was really happy that I had a chance with her, but then one day came out amd seh told me she didn't meant what she said and nothing was going to happen.
That kinda sucked but I it wasn't enough for me to stop liking her, a few months go by and valentine's day comes around (I am Brazilian so valentine's day is in june) and I stupidly thought it was a good idea to ask her out to do something then, when really I should have moved on by that point. One I ask if she was down for something, she said yes, and once again I got my hopes up. I come around to ask her out, she just says No, no bells and whistles, a flat out no.
Fast forward to the end of 2019, (it's still the same girl) we are at a party and we hook up, we have this big sentimental talk about us and I, once again, got my hopes up. At school, I ask her if we can talk about what happened at the party, and she tells me she ""doesn't remember anything"", which is just absurd because we weren't fully drunk, we barely had a buzz on, and she remembered things she did at that same party when she was really out of her mind. That fucking destroyed me but it was enough for me to finally move.
At the end of 2019, I started having a thing with ""current girl"", we were having a good time, we started to like each other, but at the beggining of this year, out of nowhere she blew things with me. After a few months, we start talking again.

Life has pulled the carpet beneath my feet for 4 times in the last few years when it came to this kind of thing. And right now I have no reason to believe it will be different, every time she takes a fee hours to answer my texts I start freaking out. This is not healthy but i don't know what to do.",13Jul2020,1

463,"So a bit of backstory: 

My friend Mark (fake name) had been crushing and liking my friend Ana (fake name) for half a year now. 

Ana had a boyfriend (fake name Tom) of 2 years but because of the current health situation and social distancing measures Tom has refused to see her since February,because Tom has respiratory issues and elderly sick parents. This means no contact irl and minimal texting, for her birthday he sent her a generic Viber sticker, when she failed her course she begged him to just come and hug her but he said no, and they have basically had 0 contact and very little communication. He also controls and tells her who she can and cannot hang out with or he get jealous and yells and stuff. Tom hates our friend group from university, but Ana and I have been friends since we were 15 and he hates me and constantly tries to make her not hang out with me, so she needs to lie to him about going out with other people instead of me. So during this period of him not giving her attention, she started to talk and get close to Mark. 

The two of them got really close, she started telling him how she really wants to kiss and basically have sex with him, and how it's hard to control herself around him. They went out a few times and she like teases him in public, she made a bet with him about a course grade that if she gets X grade she will have sex with him even if she is still dating Tom. She told him she likes him, but not enough to leave Tom for. He is open about liking her, and her being the first girl he has liked since he broke up with him ex gf of 5 years in Feb 2019. 

Basically, for the 4th of July me and my friend had a barbecue and celebration in the forest and it's also my birthday. On July 2nd Ana breaks up with Tom because Tom gave her an ultimatum that if she celebrates with us he will not text her or anything until August or September and that she will get no attention from him. **She broke up with him**. 

**So on Saturday, the 4th of July, Ana and Mark hooked up.** They were cuddling the whole day, she was sitting in his lap and calling him baby names, he pushed her on the swing, he made her veggie burgers, and they made out and at one point their got up and went to the bedroom and had sex. 

She called me upstairs after they had sex because she regretted it cause she missed Tom, and she said that the trigger was that Tom had a bigger dick than Mark and that she started thinking of Tom and regretted the break up. She then talked to Mark and told him that she wants some alone time, but that she doesn't plan to get back together with Tom cause she is aware that he is to some extent abusive and neglectful. That night she went home and made up with Tom, but she didn't tell tom she hooked up with Mark, even tho he asked and said that it's okay since they technically did break up.

On Thursday, her and Tom saw each other for the first time since February and he saw a hickey. She then admitted to him that she had sex with Mark, and **Tom broke up with her** because she lied to his face and had close contact with someone and didn't tell him putting himself and his family in danger.

She is now heart broken and regrets everything, but every night since the break up she asks Mark to go out with her, and he drives her around the city and takes her to his fav places, and she just bitches at him. She made him meet her mom and friends. She holds his hand and kisses him. **And last night, she blocked him on all social media**. 

When asked why she said he doesn't take no for an answer, and that he wants more than she does. Fair. But then **she said he FORCED himself on her on Saturday.** She said she felt like she had to make him happy so she had sex with him, even tho she didn't want to, and that he emotionally, mentally, and physically forced her. 

Mark found out she told everyone he forced himself on her and he's mad and hurt because **he says it's not true. And he says this is why**:

* She just broke up with a bf of 2 years 2 days ago, he didn't plan to do anything with her cause he wanted to give her time but he supportive and there for her. 
* she kissed him and started making out with him first, and started kissing his neck and stuff (and for this there are witnesses)
* she took (like took his hand and pulled/lead) him up the stairs to the bedroom. 
* he asked her twice if she sure, and she put a hand on his mouth to shut him up and continued to do stuff
* All the time she was the one pulling moves, asking what he wants to do. She took off her clothes herself, with him not insisting on it and himself being clothed. 
* She was on her period, and they talked about how period stuff is gross to them, so he expected nothing. He didn't bring condoms with him or anything. 
* Additional:  I walked in on them when they were finishing up and she was kissing him while he was missionary in her and  stuff, and it did look consensual - but this is not argument enough!

He said he didn't force himself at any point and that it seemed consensual, and he is genuinely shocked and hurt by her saying he forced himself onto her cause he has 2 sisters and was raised by a single mother, and that he would never stoop to doing such a horrid act upon someone, especially not her. But she said he forced herself on her, and that **she did it to make him happy,** but she said it's technically not rape, and when I ask her in which way did he force her for her to give me more info she just says she was forced because she didn't want to and she did and **she felt forced and obligated to do it.** 

The problem: I (F20) got raped when I was 12 and suffered a lot, with very little people believing me until the person re-offended and confessed later. I have the mentality of always believe victims, especially cause if it is true then she needs support and people to believe her and in no way victim blame her. 

But, there may be the case that she now, since Tom broke up with her, *feels shame and guilty and broken and is maybe in a way shifting blame from herself and her choice to sleep with him, and is projecting a current mindset of she really didn't want to do that to a past memory and making it seem not consensual*. But this could also not be the case, and he could have forced himself cause non of us were in the bedroom with them, except me walking in on them. 

I don't think she's lying, but I do believe there is a possibility that she is looking back at events now with a new mindset and that they do not look consensual, and that she herself truly believes that it was not consensual then, when there is a high chance that it was.

So I don't know what to do. If she is telling the truth about that day, then I don't know what to do with Mark cause then he's drooped soooo low in my eyes. But if she is projecting current feelings and not being honest about what happened that day but merging it with a week afters feelings, then is accusing him of really really heavy stuff that could ruin his life, especially is she is more publicly stating it. 

Please help! PLEASE! I can't be objective, and I need an outside perspective and help. 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Female friend broke up with bf and slept/had sex with friend she got emotionally close to on July 4th. She got back with her ex and lied about not hooking up. Ex found out and broke up with her. Now she's saying the sex on July 4th was not consensual and that she was forced. Guy friend said it isn't true because he really didn't expect anything, didn't insinuate it and asked her during. She accusing him of forcing himself on her, I don't know who's telling the truth. 

PLEASE HELP!",13Jul2020,1

My (20F) aunt (50F) and my moms mom bullied my mom when she was a teenager. They would comment on her body, which led to a eating disorder for many years. 

My aunt has stolen things from us in the past (makeup, perfume) and just said some weird things in the past to us and to my mom, but my mom accepted her anyways. She has never stood up for my mom, or even been there for her during her whole life. When my grandmother died she tried to get all of their heritage money and didn’t even seem to care about sharing the money with my mom, she just made up excuses why she should get the money. I honestly feel like she only cares about herself and i would call her a narcissist. My mom is absolutely amazing, and it makes me so sad that her sister doesn’t support or even seem to care about her. 

Last year something that really hurt me happened. I have really bad social anxiety that i’m working to heal from and last year we had a family gathering of basically all of our relatives, and i get really nervous about meeting so many people. When i get nervous, my hands usually shake a little (even if i’m only a little nervous).
So i was sitting next to my aunt and i put my hands above my eyes to shield me from the sun, and as i was doing that she looked at my hands shaking a little and gave me a very annoyed look and shook her head. She knows i have social anxiety. 
I felt embarrassed and i didn’t know what to say. That incident may seem small, but it was the last drop for me. Now i really feel like i don’t ever want to meet her again. Meeting her makes me feel anxious and just horrible. I don’t like her as a person and i don’t want someone like her around me. 

My aunt is coming this week (she lives in another country) and she said to my mom that she wants to meet me but i really don’t want to meet her and now i find myself coming up with a bunch of excuses in order to avoid meeting her, but i can’t come up with a good one. 

Am i right to avoid her like this? What can i say so i don’t have to meet her?",13Jul2020,1

is there something off putting about wanting to hangout and get buzzed???

He expects to just use my New Dab Press whenever he wants too. like when did my shit become yours but not vice versa? smart.

He always puts down things i like and is agrumentitive in even when its something he doesnt know anything about to someone who specialises in it. He has a tendancy to act like hes the smartest person in the room. Most reciantly hes mitagated and trivialised my life experiances and traumas and that really hurt me 2But worst of all hes making my gf of 7+ years and my best friend upset. But im also kind of a high empathetic person and cutting a person out would break my heart. Also the fact we now work together is a big problem i dont know if i should aproch my manager about this and not cause a big workplace drama. But honestly i dont know if i can take anymore straws in this mountain of straws.

So, first let's make somethings clear: 1. I am a student, I will be 18 in a few months. 2. I live away from home, for college. 3. My family is in a good financial condition, and might be considered rich by some. 4. My dad has always hated me and been very abusive towards me. 5. I am a skilled programmer, Video Editor, and also really good with people. 6. I would happily work for anyone/any place but here you can only get jobs after 18 and people don't give jobs to young people like me.

Story: So it all started when I came home like I do every month, I noticed everyone was sad and my dad was in a really bad mood, I think mom and dad might have had a fight. So the next day when I asked my mom for the rent for my place she told  she will have to ask dad and when she asked dad for it, he refused and said he doesn't want to pay any rent anymore and doesn't want me here. Being a egotistical person like I am, came back from my home to the place I was staying in. In India, it's taboo for students to earn or work and parents provide for everything. And as a kid, when I actually was making money from online surverys and stuff, my dad stopped me and said I didn't need to make money because he already is. He takes away everything I hold dear and I have never been happy with him and he has been very abusive towards me since I was a kid. I now have to look for a job, but I am 17 currently  so, there **ARE** no jobs for me. My rent and food in total will cost around 150 dollars which is a lot here in India. How do I make a living? I don't want to go back to my family. I want to work and rise up on my own feet. I want advice on how to start and where to start with my skills.

474,"I'd been planning to move out with a friend and his female friend for almost half a year, but we were prevented from finding a place due to stuff related to covid. Now that things are beginning to open up and I can secure more work hours I was about to start house searching, but now they're dating and want to live together instead.

Essentially, I'm almost 22 and have virtually no qualifications due to intense panic attacks in classrooms and can't date for medical reasons that probably won't be resolved for a long time due to covid. I'm pretty fucking down on my luck. I've tried twice to complete my A-levels (UK) to get into university but couldn't get through the year(s) due to panic attacks, so I'm stuck working a dead-end retail job and I literally have 2 friends left, who I very rarely speak to or socialise with. I spend most of my time chatting to my 15 y/o sister and watching old sitcoms. 

Before lockdown begun, I was planning to move out and spend my year getting help for my issues, as well as going out and doing activities, meeting people etc with the hopes of being able to return to education fairly promptly and kickstart my life, which just feels as if it's been 'pending' for about 3 years now.

I just don't know what to do now. I could move into a house share with people I don't know, but what would be the point? I can still live at home for considerably less rent. But then if I continue to live at home while working retail and doing literally nothing with my life, I'll probably wanna kill myself. And I'm sure a lot of the responses (if I get any) will be to immediately start pursuing education again, but if I'm completely honest, I've been in and out of education for longer than most people. I've redone the same shit twice now. I have no life and have had no fun because of it. Due to this, I literally don't have the motivation to do it right now. I'd like to do it in the future but trying A-levels, dropping out, trying again, dropping out, and then trying again with literally no pleasure in between will be disastrous for my mental health.

I know a lot of people have it worse and I should be grateful that I have a house to live in and whatnot, but everything in my body is telling me to... I don't know, do something. I'm incessantly restless and need to workout each day just to keep me sane. If I go somewhere that isn't my house or the tiny shop I work at it feels like a fucking vacation.

  I figured that this is a great place to ask for advice.  I just got demotivated to do my job since last week. I'm working from home so all I did was sleep or play video games even when it was within my shift.  I don't know what triggered it but I don't know, like it just happened. Has anyone else experienced this or am I just losing my mind? Could it be because I have been staying inside my house for too long? I don't know man but if this keeps going I think I might end up resigning (or getting fired).",13Jul2020,1
487,"Sorry for the dramatic title, it's the most concise way I could think to word it.

So here's the situation:

I had a spare room in my 5 bed university house at the start of this academic year and it was filled by a random guy who needed a room. Long story short, he was a really really nice guy but he was gross. Beyond gross. 11 bin bags of takeaway boxes and beer bottles in his room, mold growing on the walls, making the house smell vile... that kind of gross. Aside from the smell, he kept his mess to his room and because he was so nice we only really intervened once. 

He was recently diagnosed with something that I will not share for privacy's sake, and it meant that he needed medication that needed to be injected. He ended up moving back home recently so that he could go through his medical treatment at home with his family, but he left a lot of his stuff here. His mum came over 2 days ago to move the rest of his stuff out and clean his room (our contracts state that we have to leave the rooms clean and empty)

Basically she didnt clean his room that well. And decided that it was a good idea to leave all his rubbish and belongings that she couldn't be bothered taking home on our front garden (I live on a main road, its basically a 2ft patch of gravel and a small wall)

We tried to recycle some of the mess because it was recycling bin collection day yesterday, and in the pile of rubbish we found his needle disposal bin. Does anyone know how I should deal with this? Should I reach out to him and let him know? Should I tell my landlord? I dont feel okay letting the bin men collect it on household waste collection day... surely theres a proper way this should be disposed of?

I live in the UK for context.

Thanks in advance!

TL;DR : housemate moved out and his mum left his medical needle disposal tub on our front garden - how do I dispose of it?",13Jul2020,1
488,"This summer has been kind of rough to be honest with COVID. I'm going to college for communications, and have a couple of years left if I continue. I switched to that major from engineering and sciences because it seemed like it might  allow me to have a better work-life balance. I work with our school's outdoor recreation department and it feels kind of like a second home to me, and also is an avenue for me to try and meet more people and develop more relationships, another thing I kind of need. It also has been great for building on leadership, planning/management and similar skills. I was thinking about trying work in marketing or HR and using my experience there as a testament to my abilities to do well in the field. 

&amp;#x200B;

This past summer, though, I've just been sitting around at home a lot because the restaurant I worked at was closed. An older sort of mentor I know helped me get some work just doing some home maintenance work around his townhouse complex. It was kind of exciting learning things about home maintenance and working with my hands, and made me think about possibly working in a trade like carpentry or masonry. I'm more excited about following that prospect than I am thinking about continuing school, but I'm afraid to sacrifice the effort I've put in with school too soon. I just don't see myself being really gung-ho about anything I'd do with my degree. I am fine with studying and don't have a problem with grades, but I think for me school is just a way to try and keep being social. I don't have a lot of close friends, relationships or networks. It takes time for me to work towards that and so I've been pushing myself to do that more and more as time goes on. I'm a bit torn though between continuing down that path or just going after a trade and getting in to work. Any thoughts would be awesome. Thanks.",13Jul2020,1
489,"Hello! I hope you are having a good day so far.

So today, basically 10 minutes ago, my mom told me that she heard our neighbor talking sh""t about us. We live in a building, and last night my father hung out the washings (sheets). My mom then went to that area where the sheets were to sweep up the floor and she heard our neighbor (an old woman and a 40 year old woman who is her daughter) laughing at our sheets saying they were old (wtf... I wish I could show a picture but we literally bought them 2 years ago and they look totally fine. That's what gets on my nerves). And well, this is not that big of a problem compared to other world issues, but it makes me feel disgusted and angry that we have helped them so so much, mostly economically, and THEN they talk shit about us, insinuating we are nasty or dirty when dude... Their house is like full of stuff and super messy, so they should shut their mouth and look at what they have in their house first. And well, the first thing that I wanted to do is go to their house and liberate my anger, but that's absolutely what I don't have to do since of course, they would say: ""oh we haven't said that"", And I would look like an angry liar. 

Even though I talked about this example, I have seen a lot of fake people and I never know how to act when I find out someone is being fake at my back. I get super angry and I really don't know how to deal with this. If you have experienced something similar, I would be really thankful to hear your opinion and your advice.

493," Today, I felt depressed again, I was listening to a local podcast about loneliness online, to improve my mental health, when suddenly one of the speakers mentioned she was currently living abroad. And it just struck me like a lightning out of nowhere. I suddenly felt depressed again, because I felt jealous of the speaker, she get to live abroad while I do not. The main purpose of listening to the podcast to lift my moods has now condemned me into a much deeper, darker place.

I can hear the critics bashing my ungratefulness. Every single time when I see someone else having a better life than me I get depressed. Just yesterday, I was scrolling through Instagram, and I came across a post showing a couple being happily together, I get cast into the same deep, dark place. I feel my own inadequacies, never having a relationship in my entire life, being rejected by multiple girls. Is it because of my looks or my shyness or my lack of relationship experience? I immediately deactivated my social media to try to regain any sense of happiness.

But happiness was never meant to be found, for I can never fully escape the triggers of depression, escaping one just to find another. After graduation, I can never hold down a job. I was either too slow to complete my work or too unsociable.

My life is a mess, for wherever I go I meet a trigger for my depression, for whatever I do it has been deemed not good enough whether it was in terms of relationship or my job. For my life really is a mess because I live through it everyday.

I would really appreciate any suggestions, comments and help. Thank you very much.",13Jul2020,1

She was my first love, we had a very rocky relationship which lasted for just over a year. We were 20 when we met now both 22. It was a very typical young love story, very intense and never apart. She turned around to me about 8 months in and told me that she no longer wanted to be in a relationship, she wanted to be single. I was hurt and it destroyed my self esteem. We still had casual sex and hung out sporadically for 3 more months. She still had feelings for me but did not want to be a couple. Like a fool i told myself that i should accept this current situation and in time she might want to be together again.

After a month of silence on her end and me trying to act like i did not care. I was told she had begun to date another guy from her work. A  few weeks after that i was told they were now a couple. It broke me and sent me into a depression this came around mid  November and lasted til February. 

Saturday night we bump into each other. I had been day drinking since 4 and was drunk. I tried my best to stay cool but i threw some verbal jabs towards her. I behaved like an asshole and left without saying goodbye. I apologised over Instagram message for my behaviour but was left on read.

I don't want to be friends with her or have her in my life at all despite how much i still love her. Unfortunately we share mutual friends and go the same bars.  How do I keep cool around her? How do I act pleasant to the girl who made me feel worthless? She is happy in this new relationship so why cant i move on?",13Jul2020,1
499,"I've posted here before about this very same issue and it's still ongoing. With the whole Corona lockdown still present in my country, I've been resorting to gaming as a hobby while getting my essential stuff (class work, etc.) done before I play games.

Recently, my mom snooped through my phone and read my group chat with gaming friends (League of Legends) where swearing is a bit of a norm. She immediately called me out on gaming, calling it a ""demon's tool"" to drag me down.

She's got off the phone (video call with dad, cam facing me) as she led a sermon where I refused to speak. Dad's okay with me playing games so long as I continue accomplishing things and functioning like a normal human (Not a shut-in, sociable, clean, good grades on top of getting through uni and landing my dream job). My mom, though, is heavily against it.

I have lied to her about it several times, but it was more in the sense that I felt *unsafe* divulging personal matters to her since she has a ""my way or no way"" mentality as well as a love for ultimatums.

She's just called me selfish and repetitive for slipping back into games recently despite me continuing to do what is expected of me, with games just being there to fill the down-times between generic chores, studying, reviewing, and exercise.

I honestly feel I can't stand up to her nor can I convince her about allowing games, I feel cornered about this since I don't have many friends to talk to (about anything) nor do I have siblings old enough to understand. Dad is too open with her so I can't talk to him without knowing either.

I've been the outcast in my school's (and community's) circles for my unusual passions (Impromptu, MUNs, Debates, Chess) as well as being one of the few fluent English-speakers while retaining a spot in my batch's top 10. I don't fit with the athletes, actors, or paper. I have no one other than other ""weird guys"" to hang with.

We are very close and have a very intimate relationship that is borderline romantic. There's another guy (23 M) who will soon be my co-worker and we have hooked up with once before. It was just a fling for me but I believe he has developed some feelings for me. He has constantly been asking me to hang out with him but I've been blowing him off, coming up with excuses. So the night the good friend of my comes over I take a picture of him and put it on Snapchat (thinking absolutely nothing of it). The other guy sees it and tells me he's a little (obviously more than a little) bitter that I made time for this friend but not him. I go on to tell him we've planned this for a while, etc. while still trying to make him feel better. Anyways, he brings up to me that he told the manager of my upcoming job to go ahead and hire me and now I feel he's going to hang that over my head while working alongside him.

I know this is a very petty issue but I never thought this person would get so upset over a picture. I'm worried he's going to make my new job hell, etc. and I really need some advice on how to handle this predicament.",13Jul2020,1

In June, other clinics have opened back up following quarantine protocols (social distancing, sanitizing every after each client, having sanitizers and hand washing stations, wearing PPEs, etc. — all provided by the clinic owners/employers). The owner of the clinic I work in, however, never took initiative to do such and seems to have no plans in opening the clinic soon.

The clinic couldn’t run without a workforce but me and the other therapists are very tempted to resign and open our own private practice. It seems extreme to quit and leave the owner without a workforce when she opens back up, especially after this pandemic, but at the same time we all need to find our way to earn! And if we do quit, we’re almost a hundred percent sure most of our clients would follow us and the owner would lose clients entirely. Thoughts on this? How do you see this in the owner’s perspective?

my sister and i have been saving up money for three months and have been putting it in a safe in my sister’s house where i live at for the meantime. i ended up saving over $400 and my sister was trying to save up as well but in between jobs she saved up almost $500. well, since i am an exotic dancer, all of my money was in one’s and five’s. so i go to change them all out into bigger bills. i brought the whole safe with me, which is only a small black box, and meant to take it back straight to the house. when i got to the house, the house was locked. i have no key, but my sister and her baby daddy do. i had to go to work so i car-pulled and brought it with me since i did not want it to go missing. (my car does NOT lock at all) 

after work(i have an actual job as well), i hit up this man who had left me a note on a fake blue bill.  now i didnt ask this man for payment of any kind at the club he just handed it to me as a cute lil hit me up and maybe we could be a relationship type of game and i was like, okay im so down for a game because ive NEVER had a man EVER do something like hand me his number like that. so we go and meet each other but he takes me in his car so we could go chill by the water and have a deep conversation about what we like and what we dont like and so on and so on.

well it was really cute and i had fun. my sister pulls up to where we are located. she impulsively asked me where the money was at because unknowing to me she had all ready gone to my where my car was parked. she had found the safe but i did NOT mean to leave the note that guy had left me in there. so she got heated and thought i was on some game play or screwing her over. she had ripped out my battery. she had left my car in such a disarray with my clothing items all on top of the hood and around the parking spot my car was at. 

i had to tell her that she had $550 whenever i went to go exchange the one’s we had.
i had $260. 
that did NOT add up.
my sister insisted that she had $600 
she would not get it through that what i was saying was all facts and that i was NOT trying to do anything towards her or anyone else. 

i was out on a date. i was not doing anything i wasnt supposed to do. i had told her i was coming back home that night. so for her to be instant gratifying the situation, was not my fault. thats what i think.
i had tried to put the safe back but i did not know her baby daddy was going to be locking the house. 

i just need some advice on what to do or how to react because i am such a pacifist.

So over the last 7 years i (m20) have been involved with my girl (f21) but have recently found myself always being put down by her, but when ever i announce how i feel im told im arguing or looking for a fight
To break it down these are some of the things she has said to me 
You need help
You are sick
You're unstable
You cant handle me
You dont get me
I hate you
I despise you
I resent you
Numerous times ive been told to ""get the fuck out"" 
She has issues with my family/friends
I have issues
Im too quite
Im acting different


These are just some examples. And im at a point where i dont know what to do. She uses her words as a way to make me wonder what my self worth is. But questions why im the way i am. Ive lost all motive for doing anything and everything i enjoy. I cant even name one things that does interest me anymore. Ive lost or at least it feels like I've lost every person that was in my life, im in mental state of wondering if im good enough or if theres even a point anymore. Ive been manipulated into thinking that i struggle with everything and that i cant be by myself my mind is so warped into believing that theres so wrong with me.

But the response i get is ""this is me this is how i am and thats that, i please myself before anyone else, im doing what makes me happy"" i feel like her making me unhappy is what is boosting her up and keeping her on top

510,"For context, I'm young and still studying at college. One thing that often that I often feel is that when I'm bored and there's nothing for me to do, I feel really frustrated about it. It feels like I have to force myself to waste time and spend it somehow. I typically feel this way when I have quite a bit of time on my hands, like right now when I'm currently on holidays after the college semester.

I typically spend my time on the computer and play games. Things get bad when I have no games to play, no friends to play them with and in general there's nothing for me to do.

This situation is only made worse due to the current situation with COVID. I don't have that many friends nor do I hang out much, but due to the situation with COVID we are forced to self-isolate and that limits my opportunities for hanging out and having fun when I actually have time to.

Things I try to do to help is mainly try to find new things to do:

* Trying to be productive by making apps. I'm learning programming so I tend to do my own projects and self learn before study starts again
* Try to find other things to do, like watch anime

I haven't been successful in finding much else to do and eventually I end up in the same spot. LIke with any game or anime, there's eventually an end to things. There's something frustrating with just having too much time and not having anything to do to spend that time enjoyably and wasting your time just for the sake of it. It feels like I'm on a long airplane ride somewhere and desperately trying to find things to do.

I feel like I find joy in spending time with others. For me, this is usually playing games with friends. But I don't have many friends and a lot of the time, it feels like they don't want to play with me either.

I am not sure if others feel the same way as me and things would probably change when I get married and have kids. But how would you deal with this situation? It's a recurring situation which I've had for a long time.",13Jul2020,1

He gets mad over everything, and acts like it's his job to police how my friend behaves. Also my friend is in her 20's so it's not like she's an unruly teenager. She's not unruly at all either. She's very introverted, and conflict avoidant. She has Asperger's. 

He doesn't seem physically abusive thankfully, but it sounds like he just gets mad about everything, and is non-stop verbally abusive. I'm going to post some stuff my friend has told me he's done;

&amp;#x200B;

This is a message my friend sent me recently - ( **I  need to get the F\*\*\* out of this house. Come January if I can get my  stuff to be sent to Florida to my dad’s house, I’m fucking gone. I just  had to hold back tears because of a confrontation with my step father.  My mom’s at work and I made myself coffee ( yes I drink coffee but only  cause it helps me wake up cause of my energy problem, I use sweetened  creamer but I had to help my steps with a game while I waited for my  coffee to pour, I had brought out the creamer and whipped cream to put  on/in my coffee and then I went and helped. I go back in the kitchen  following my step dad because I needed to make my drink and he goes  “ugh” seeing the creamer and whipped cream and picks it up and takes it  to the fridge when I was about to use them I get angry and groan at him,  but he says to use them and put them back I go over to him and I think  he’s gonna hand them to me since he held them out to me but nope guess  not because when I go to take them he says “ don’t you fucking dare try  to take stuff out of my hands” along with other garbage shit and I get  annoyed and frustrated as he lectures me and then he asks if I used  them, I said no and  he said, something like “ those are your words”  like “ use your words next time” and I take them and make my drink. But I  went up to my room to calm down and I literally had to keep from crying  because I fucking hate confrontation. )**

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what his problem is. I don't have time to guess either. I just want to help my friend, and that's it. The problem is she's all the way in Germany, what can I do?",13Jul2020,1
518,"I haven't celebrated my birthday since I was 21 and now when the topic of my birthday comes up, I get a severe feeling of anxiety and I honestly wish I could skip my birthday altogether. Every year I tend to plead to my family and my partner to not get me any gifts, as I can buy what I want when I want (within reason, e.g. a pair of Jordans for retail or something but nothing huge). When I get pushed to go out and celebrate it by going out for dinner with my family or my partner's family, I end up panicking quite a lot. 

I think for me, I feel like I'm not worth celebrating and don't warrant people going out of their way for and just end up feeling miserable about the whole thing. I haven't achieved anything outside of finishing a business degree and getting a stable job (it's not super high paying and fulfilling, but it means I don't live week to week). However, I enjoy celebrating other people's birthdays every year and going out for dinner's and generally just kicking it with people is never an issue. 

Birthdays aren't such a big deal in my family (thank god), however in my partner's family they're a HUGE deal. They throw these massive parties, follow specific themes (my partner's family recently threw her an Italian themed party to remind her of travelling through Europe) and while all of that is fun to be part of, I would hate being the focal point of it all. When they asked me what I wanted to do for my birthday, I quickly said that I was going to have a quiet birthday and they were absolutely stunned, making me feel like my reaction to birthdays is abnormal and strange. I have a feeling they think I don't want to celebrate with them where in reality, I just don't want to celebrate it at all. 

Is it normal to hate my birthday and all the attention?  

p.s. sorry if this comes across as a validation post or something to that degree. I'm just not sure if I should contact a therapist and discuss whether it's a deeper feeling of sadness/depression, dissatisfaction with myself and/or low self esteem, or whether it's just common for people to not want to celebrate their birthdays.",13Jul2020,1
519,"Yeah, well... where do I start...   

 I've pissed off one of the most dangerous criminal man in the city. He is a white pimp, and he has connections with police, so most likely I won't be killed but will go into jail for something like drugs they suddenly find in my apartment despite I never used drugs in my life or something like that.     
Now about the problem itself.     
I have a friend, a hooker I've banged for years who became a pimp. She steal girls from other pimps and let them work in different cities. She is telling me everything about it, cause we are friends and she is open with me. So I know a lot of things I shouldn't. And I was dumb enough to talk with random hookers about the scheme that girl described me. And so, one of them decided that I am a recruiter. And that means that I am basically ruining business of a criminal fucking boss stealing his hookers.     
She probably already told him that, and they have my phone number. Using police connections, he can easily find my identity and location knowing the number. I don't know if this will happen or not. I am not sure how things will escalate, maybe he will just call me (wtf do I have to tell him then?), maybe something more harsh. It's really nothing to tell to police right now, because there were no threats or actions still, I've just realized what I did a couple of hours ago and I am nervous as fuck.    

What should I do?",13Jul2020,0
520,"Sorry if this post seems long and stupid, I know people have bigger problems than that but I just needed this off my chest. 

So, well, I don't have friends. I'm 16, just finished my freshman year at high school. Before the year started I was talking to my middle school friend how we're going to act in high school and she said she would only talk to people who would approach her, not the other way around. She also said she wasn't looking for friends and will just treat high school as work she just has to get done. I thought it was a great idea, I mean we're both introverts and enjoy being at home watching shows more than socializing. 
But it seems like I changed my mind because I decided to talk to people first, and of course, with my poor social skills, I didn't make a very good impression. I did end up talking regularly to 3 new people in total and 2 other girls I knew before. But the thing is, they're not my friends. We hang out at school but never outside of it. We're just colleagues. We barely have any interests in common but I'm desperate not to seem like a loner so I'll continue to talk to them even if all we talk about is school. 
Why am I even thinking about this on the summer? Because I'm insecure. I'm insecure about having no friends. To be honest it wasn't a big deal before but my mom keeps asking me why I don't hang out with people (she had a bunch of friends my age) and it just makes me feel stupid and as if I'm incapable of being liked.
Also my school doesn't have any clubs so despite having quite a lot of interests I don't know how to find people like me. Or maybe I should just stop looking, and be like that friend of mine that doesn't care? If so, how do I do that?",13Jul2020,1

The person who wanted to buy it sent me a cashier’s check via mail and said she would have her seamstress pick it up from me once I got the money. I just came back from my bank and they were thoughtful enough to verify the check for me before trying to deposit it. Of course, it turns out to be fraudulent. Luckily, I still have the dress.

524,"As a man, I always wanted to have a family. As I grow older, approaching 30, it appears that its possible it may not happen. I'm a very private person, I enjoy insular hobbies like reading, exercising, cooking, occasional gaming. And I try to get into hobbies where there are more people, but the pandemic makes that very difficult lol.
A big issue with me is finances, I only just crack 23k a year and I've been applying to higher paying jobs, nothing has come up yet. In my mind, (and as my recent ex pointed out) if a woman is going to love me, I need to make more money. But the way things are looking at this point, it doesnt look like that's going to happen anytime soon. If ever....I guess what I'm asking is, should I acquiesce and accept it? Just ""live my life"" and maybe someone will walk into my life?? I want to do better for myself, absolutely, but I would be lying if I said self improvement is only about me. I'm only improving myself so that in the end I can get what I want and have the family I never had as a child. 
I'm putting a lot of stress and pressure on myself because I feel like I'm racing the clock, hoping to find someone before I reach the age where the chances become practically nil.
That being said, should I accept that I may never have a family and just learn to be alone? That's not what I want. 
If I acquiesce, worst case scenario is I get a small house given to me and i can live in a minimalist lifestyle for the rest of my days.
But that's not what I want, I want a wife, a child and happiness, now, I know that having a wife and kids is not necessarily a key to happiness. But, for me, its something I always wanted. And I'm constantly being told ""if you dont look you'll find it."" That's nonsense because I didnt look and i didnt have my first gf or lose my virginity until 27.
I'm just under alot of self induced pressure and I'm starting to feel like it may be time to give up hope.

525,"Names are all changed I (Francis 22F) would like some advice on this developing issues. I apologize for the length

So I have 2 coworkers that are my friends, Daisy (20F)&amp; Sara(21F). Daisy &amp; Sara have been besties for yrs. i started hanging with them a yr or 2 ago. I had this feeling that another coworker, Jill (19?F) didn’t like me (idrk why bc I hardly ever talk to her). Jill &amp; Sara only started hanging out in recent months but have become close quickly. I asked Sara if Jill didn’t like me &amp; Sara replies I have no idea etc. Daisy tells Sara I have a bunch Jill doesn’t like me and Sara says “Jill said some stuff but it’s not my place”.

Fast forward to yesterday Daisy and I hungout after work. Sara doesn’t have her car rn but asks to hang/smoke but she knows that Daisy doesn’t like driving while high, and Sara knows this. It’s maybe around 11pm &amp; they live 5 min walk from each other. I could see Sara was bothered by that but we decided to smoke. 

I happen to be sitting on a stoop that’s higher ground than Sara so I have direct vision to her phone. Didn’t mean to look at first but I saw my name &amp; that Jill is saying “fuck Francis” then Jk after (which clearly she wasn’t) The line before it was them talking abt how rude of Daisy to not drive Sara home. Then Sara says (about Daisy)  “Shes annoying me. By simply talking, I’m bothered.”  So after we all go home I tell Daisy what happened. Daisy and Sara have been having other issues bc Daisy felt like she was being pushed to the sidelines even though Sara says their best friends. 

So my issue is that we all work together. Daisy and I are very upset because if I saw that one tiny snippet, what else are they obviously saying about us? Sara didn’t even try to defend me what-so-ever in the text, and while I understand not wanting to get into drama. She was complacent with Jill being nasty to us. I feel stuck because while it’s not right I read the text, the foot was a foot from under my face, and I can’t help what I saw. If we stop talking to Sara at work, she’ll know what’s up. This is a tricky situation definitely.",13Jul2020,1
526,"Hi everyone, I’ve been struggling with this for over a year now and it’s just getting worse, I go to therapy but it hasn’t been helping so I thought the sensible thing would be to ask a bunch of strangers on the internet. I’ve had depression and the whole “I want to isolate myself” before, but this feels way different- it’s more annoyance and apathy. I feel like I’m becoming a robot. It started with some family problems, feeling like my little sisters are getting on my nerves, and then starting to snap at them heaps and heaps and becoming really uptight and grumpy around them- I live with my mum and I only see them on the weekends, they’re small and cute and love me and aren’t too demanding and are very generous and sweet but I noticed I wanted to see them less and less- even when I miss them terribly, as soon as I see them I am ready to go home again. Then it started happening with friends, and my partner, I get annoyed by their presence about five minutes after I see them. At the beginning it was annoyance of them asking me to help with their problems but it then turned into annoyance at them in general, but especially low tolerance when I feel like they’re making a bad decision in their life even though I know it’s their life and their decisions not mine. I’m good at hiding it so it barely ever shows, but it’s been so long now they know I haven’t been keeping in contact as much.

I am 23, I just graduated uni two years ago, and am 6 months into my first big-contract-full-time job. I am a teacher so there’s a lot of planning/marking after work, And I’d say I’m working 50-60 hours a week, but when I do have free time I resent any time I spend with other people and would much rather be alone sitting in silence being a blank sheet of paper.

My therapist says it’s because I’m just in survival mode with my job, but it’s been two years and nothing is getting better even when I put boundaries in place with work or “me time” or anything.

It’s getting to the point now that I wake up, get ready for work, go to work, come home, do an hour of work, sit on my bed and stare into space for an hour, cook dinner, eat dinner, and go to bed by 8pm. If my partner or a friend comes over for dinner or anything I just want them to leave, I’ve tried taking up a hobby that I enjoy but I just get tired out and then want to go home and rest by myself again. I am nearly shouting when someone asks me to do them a favour or swing by the shops etc. I am losing my friends, my little sisters who mean the world to me, and while I love my job I just struggle to face it every day. What is happening to me? Am I burning out after being full time for only 6 months? Do I just hate everyone now? Am I turning into a hermit? I just feel like I want to run away and hide in a cave.",13Jul2020,1

I’m 26 years old (female) and have been dating my Bf (25 year old male) for almost two years.Although we come from two completely different backgrounds and ethnic groups but we make it works.

Lately,however,his mom has been really testing my character.See,she believes COVID-19 is a hoax.She even wants to go to the parliament to protest laws that say people must wear a mask.She is also encouraging people not to shop at business were social distancing is prioritized.She claims that healthcare workers aren’t doing anything and that there is no workload
As the daughter of a nurse this really fucks me up to the highest.Everyday I worry about my mother’s safety and suffer from severe anxiety because of that. many of my nurse and doctor friends have contracted covid and my friend lost his dad (perfectly healthy)to  it.

528,"This is kind of a long story but I would really appreciate some advice. I also realise that this is very high school drama, but i am panicking about what to do. I had a group of friends who I was really close too when I was 16-18. However, when everyone went to uni we drifted a bit, as friends do, I get that it’s only natural. 

But, about four months ago I found out form my best friend (who had been my best friend since I was eleven) that they had been talking about me and my sibling. Needless to say, it rocked my view. I thought I could trust them with everything, but that wasn’t the case. The things that were said were very personal, and made both me and my sibling question everything about ourselves, and as a result I have become a different person, and not necessarily someone that I like. I overthink everything to an extreme degree, and feel I cannot trust myself anymore. 

However, one of them has reached out recently, and we had a few nice conversations. The issue isn’t necessarily with her, but she has enabled another person, who has had a habit of ostracising people she has an argument with, and I can literally see it happening again. 

This girl has realised how badly she has hurt me and my sibling, and now is trying to mend bridges, which I am open too, actually the fact that she reached out made me very happy. 

But I am starting to panic a little. I know it’s stupid, that people  make up all the time, but I’m scared because I don’t actually know what I did to upset her (she confirmed in a call that she had been upset, although she wasn’t any longer) and am scared to ask in case I come across insensitive. 

I have already began having small panics about it, and we only agreed to talk about thirty minute ago. It’s just going round and round in my head and I don’t want to overthink everything and make the situation worse.",13Jul2020,1

We have a beautiful home on a private lake and wonderful family surrounding us. We recently had our first child a month ago and are acclimating to the life of parents. One thing is missing. I have always lived in the state I grew up. I never really traveled, lived anywhere else and it never sat right with me. My fiancé however has some years on me and has experienced the world in many different ways. We are adventurous, love to hike, run and be active in every way possible. We decided we think until our little girl is old enough to start school why not enjoy life with her and take her on adventures. Live in different cities and experience life as a family and give her something we both never had as children and find a home base when it’s time for her to find friends and begin her educational journey. The only issue is my family. This is their first grandchild. My mom will guilt trip me to hell. She will cry, make me feel awful and refuse to let me take her grand baby away and it ruins my excitement and desire to go. I’m so sick of feeling stuck here.

I recently moved into a new apartment, about 2-3 months ago, and so far every weekend both Saturday and Sunday there are massive parties.  I live right next to the pool, and of course I expected loud noises but this isn’t just your common pool noises.  So far, I have pictures of beer pong tables, massive speakers, and very very large gatherings.  I’m honestly not one to complain, in fact this is the first time I’ve ever reached out to my apartment with a complaint.  During the weekend, primarily at night time, I can’t watch tv.  The music just bleeds into my apartment since the pool is maybe 4 feet in the closest direction to my window.  I sent an email to the property manager and never got a response and I was going to go talk with her today, just wanted some advice on how to approach this conversation.  A few rules for the pool, 1) music must be played through headphones only.  (well clearly that’s not enforced). 2) no drunkenness aloud (again, not enforced).  If any of you have had to deal with this before how did you go about it?  When this first started happening, I got a response saying I was not the only one complaining about this and they would handle it but it seems like they’ve done nothing and now I can’t get a response from them.  So I’m fairly certain that I’m not the only one complaining because if I can hear the music when the speakers are at the opposite end of the pool the residents closer to that are probably having a nightmare with this.  I’ve thought about going to my neighbors and asking them how they deal with it, but I wasn’t sure if that’s something I can do.  Are my options just to deal with it or move out?  It would cost me I believe a month in advance rent to move out but honestly I’m debating it so I can have my sanity back.

Thank you for your help!",13Jul2020,1
547,"About a week before everything started to shut down in March, I \[24M\] moved over 1000 miles away from my nearest friends and family for a new job. I was looking forward to meeting new people and having new experiences, however, with the virus that hasn't been possible. At first I was still excited about being in a new city and doing a lot of socially distant exploring by myself. But now that it's 4 months I realize I still don't know anyone here and am starting to realize how lonely I am. If I go on a solo hike, I see others with their friends and it kind of brings me down. I've been calling and staying in touch with my people but it's not that same as being with someone face to face. It's kind of dipped me into a depression and now on the weekends I just stay home and get drunk and high until I can go to bed. I don't even find joy in my hobbies anymore since I have nobody to share them with. I understand the importance of getting out in the world but I've started to get self conscious about being alone so much, especially because my co-workers are always asking me what I did over the weekend. So I guess I just want to know how to be ok with being alone all the time until the coronavirus restrictions are let up?",13Jul2020,1
548,"I haven't contacted him (lets call him S) for about 4 years. He said something ""as a joke"" and it infuriated me. I was mad at him for not apologizing. And he was mad bcuz I was being ""too politically correct"".

We were both very young and very stubborn at the time so we ended up not talking for 4 years. It was very easy since we had zero mutual friends and we didn't go to the same college.

I honestly haven't thought about him in 4 years. But these past few days I find myself thinking about him more often. I feel bad for the way things ended. Also I was in a very bad place back then and was pushing all my friends away. I think subconsciously I wanted to find reasons for our friendship to end.

I want to apologise to him but I don't know what to say.

550,"Hi there. I have reached a point in my life where I cannot sleep, go out, or even just enjoy my day anymore.

I (21 F) am a college student who has in the past two years become hyper-aware of the atrocities of the world. In particular, since I have joined Reddit, I have accidentally stumbled upon many “incel” communities. This was really eye opening in the sense that my entire life, I had assumed that violence against women was situational. It happened, but not frequently. I now have come to understand that that is not the case. That, for thousands of years, men have perpetrated violence against women for no reason, and that there are so many people who still share the mindset that that is okay.  
 I have broken down many times knowing that there are so many people out there who wish for my death or rape or slavery only because I am a woman. Most of all, I cannot understand why they would think that. 

On top of that, my boyfriend recently told me that he used to struggle with porn and has stopped watching in the past few months. While I am so proud of him for the strides he has made, some of the things he has shared with me about how porn had made him view women made me uneasy. I love him very much, and he is the sweetest, kindest soul. He has never treated me with an ounce of disrespect. BUT thats the scary part. If he — the kindest man I have ever met — struggled with how he viewed women, it makes me wonder how everyone else views women. Every time I open my eyes I hear a story about a teenager being raped by her friend’s dad or Epstein trafficking young girls, or a (not even very famous) comedian getting thousands rape threats because someone posted on an incel forum that she was a “slut” and “deserved it”. Just a few hours ago I stumbled upon a subreddit where people just talk about violently using and abusing female political figures.

It has gotten to the point where I don’t trust any men (even my close guy friends, boyfriend, father, step-father, and 8 year old brother) because I worry about who they are behind closed doors, or in the case of my brother, what he can become.

I am a woman majoring in Computer Science, and I especially worry about going into the tech field, as it is so male dominated. More than ever I am afraid that I won’t be taken seriously, or that I will be sexually harassed.

Sorry for the long message but I cannot get any of this off my mind. I have seriously thought about this everyday for two years. If anyone can help me please do. I cannot do anything without thinking about this. Please. I am absolutely desperate for help. I am crying as I write this.

tl;dr I have recently become hyperaware of violence against women and how men view women in society and it is impacting my life greatly.",13Jul2020,1
551,"Here is my Hinge profile:  [https://imgur.com/a/NAicUTY](https://imgur.com/a/NAicUTY) 

When I planned to join Hinge, I also planned to join Bumble and OkCupid, so before joining I planned out my pictures and made myself a bio. However, on Hinge you don't have a bio (which is debatably stupid), but of course I still want to describe myself on the app.

I'm not sure how obvious it is, but in my Hinge profile (link at top of post), I have spread out the parts of my bio over the captions of my photos. My first photo caption sums up my personality, my third caption tells my interests, my fifth caption says my favourite places and of course I've used the all-important ""I'm looking for"" answer.

Basically, since you don't have a bio on Hinge, I've used the elements of my profile (mostly the photo captions) to tell you about myself, similar to how a bio would work on other dating apps. **Is this a good idea? Have I done my profile right or should I scrap the idea of a bio and just fill in whatever fun information?** (Obviously a bio is the next essential thing after photos so I see it as very important)",13Jul2020,1

554,"I am a student at an Ivy League majoring in biology with a concentration in social issues. I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety but sometimes I think my failures has been caused more by defects in my personality—laziness, lack of motivation, shyness—than by my mental health struggles alone. I know several people at my school who have persevered and made impressive achievements despite their own struggles with mental health. And yet, here I am. My GPA is worse than an engineer’s. I was on academic probation the previous year and was supposed to graduate this year, but ended up withdrawing mid fall semester and taking a health leave of absence because I didn’t go to class; police had actually been called on me because a professor had been worried about my whereabouts. (I cannot explain how I’d let the situation escalate this much. I’d watch my grades turn 0, receive frantic emails, and phone calls, and simply ignore them, numb to the world, even as it crashed around me. Instead of frightening me, I felt nothing.) I’ve been sent to the school psychologists before because I had been red flagged as having suicidal thoughts, and the only treatment I have ever gotten was from my college because of lack of health insurance coverage around the area. I do not know if talk therapy has helped much. Additionally, I have not been very involved in extracurricular activities and have made very few friends—one former friend had started spreading vicious rumors and harassing me online for some reason, which was a significant contributor to the deterioration of my mental health—so I don’t even really have the college experience of socializing/networking or much of anything to put on my resume.

I plan on returning this fall semester but I am utterly directionless. I don’t know if even getting straight A’s in all my classes will salvage my GPA. I don’t know if that’s even possible with my classload—I have to take at least 17 credits for the next two semesters in order to graduate. I don’t even know what I’ll be doing after I graduate and if any graduate school or job will take me with my shitty GPA and resume. I’m afraid of falling into deep depression again and just sabotaging my chance at a secure future. I feel guilty because I know many people would kill to have the opportunities I have. Help. What should I do? Is it possible to turn my situation around?

555,"I'm not really *that* hostile towards him. I try to compliment him whenever I can and I'm rarely mean to him (sometimes I get cranky but it's with everyone not just him). But one thing i notice is I can't stand cooking for him and I get really hostile about it. I'm not sure why

Like when I cook for my mom it's because I want to and I have a great deal of respect for her. But when I cook for my little brother I get annoyed because I feel like an obligation and that I don't have choice when he's not even my child . It also annoys because he has a habit of standing there while I cook or pacing back and forth as a form of rushing me and will sometimes keep asking ""is it done yet?"" or telling me that the food looks like it's done when it's not so he can eat it early (which annoys me because I can't just fucking give him undercooked food). 

I keep having to remind him to say thank you because most of the time he doesn't even thank me for making the food. And he's really lazy. Sometimes he'll just walk up to me and say ""I'm hungry"" not even saying ""can you make me something to eat? "", so I feel that's rude from the start. He'll say for example he wants a sandwich, I'll tell him ""you can make that yourself"" then he'll switch what he wants to something complicated that he can't make so I have to cook it.

I don't like that my mom calls me his ""second mother"" because I don't want be his second mom. I don't like him that much. I'm not sure why I don't but I don't. I still try my best to let him know that I care and I compliment him when he creates things on the video games he plays or when he does something independent.

So, like everyone, this year has been a trying time for me. All the obvious social, economic, and health related stuff has taken a huge toll on me mentally. Which, is probably true for most of us...

Hiwever, Nothing really gives me satisfaction anymore, though.

 I hit my 5 year anniversary with my company and it felt flat. They sent me a little plaque and that was it. Meanwhile, I watch my boss group text his managers happy birthdays and congratulations for some of us, hit never me. 

I've been an avid gamer all my life, and nothing seems enjoyable anymore. Not even playing old favorites, or new releases I'd been excited for.

Don’t get me wrong, I absolutely love giving him pleasure and seeing how much he enjoys it. But it’s gotten to the point where he’d much rather I just give him a blowjob rather than have sex. When it does happen, the sex isreally good and it’s not like I just lay there. He just loves his blowjobs and says it just feels so good and makes him feel like a man seeing me pleasure him like that. But holy guacamole, I have my needs too. He does give back every now and then, but if I’m being honest, I enjoy penetrative sex more than anything, and it sucks when all he does is shove his dick in my mouth all the time. It doesn’t help I’ve also got a high sex drive. 

I’m at the point where I just feel like I should just give him a bad-bordering-okay blow job every time so he doesn’t enjoy it as much. Is this the right thing to do. 

I don’t even know anymore. All I know is if he had the choice, he’ll probably want a blowjob everyday for the rest of his life. 

I can’t believe I’m even asking for help about this

My husband and I met in Asia, where we both work there, and both was having a well paid jobs for the  income standard of country that we were living in. I am running an architecture studio together with few  of my friends, and we have a studio of 125 designers, and architects since 2006.  2 years ago, my husband and I moved to Switzerland, for his new job in  one of the largest bank in Switzerland. 

Since we moved to Switzerland, I have been continuing to run my architecture studio. I spend 40% of my year in Asia, and 60% in Switzerland, while trying to find a Swiss Architecture studio that I can work with. But my work search in Switzerland has not been successful. My work is quite demanding. Since I am working for different projects in different countries, often I work late, or travel far, and my income, (although I work really hard), is not comparable to the job that my husband is having right now.  Nevertheless, I really enjoy my work, I love doing what I do, and I love my studio. I don't mind staying up late  for drawing, or traveling to remote island to design.

My husband and I have independent financial flow. we have separate bank account, and we manage each of our own spending.  But since I don't own ""a Swiss income"", often I can not join him in vacations, or trips that I can't afford.  

Since he often see me missing out on things that I can not afford, he feels that I should be more aggressive on searching for Swiss jobs with higher income, he advises me to maybe start slow like working in a cafe or restaurant and work connection until I can find a job in an Architecture studio.  Although that actually make sense,it is not in my interest to let go of the studio that I have built. I really want to continue doing what I do,  He told me that I am wasting my talent, and that I should work for anything that pays me more. 

Although I always try, It is really difficult for me to make him understand that I love my work, and I really don't want to throw away the work that I've done to build my studio.

579,"So, to give a bit of context, I have been terrible at academics for the last three years of school. It's not because I am a party boy or anything like that, in fact I am probably one of the least popular guys in my grade. My school is also a pretty high acheiving school, so when it comes to academic performance, i stick out like a sore thumb to my parents, as well as some of the teachers.

I cannot really point out one specific reason why I became such a terrible student all of a sudden. There are just a lot of emotions constantly flowing through my brain all the time. I feel down many times due to the stress of not being able to live up to my teachers and my parents' expectations. I have tried to work hard and use my time wisely, but I just can't seem to sit straight and concentrate for long periods of time ever. I also often cannot control my emotions in school and at home when I'm yelled at for my academic failures. Some friends have suggested that I may have mental health problems which are weighing me down, and i have tried to tell my parents about them many times, but they always say that I'm trying to make excuses for my laziness when i bring up that topic. (Maybe they have some merit to what theyre saying; maybe im just projecting those problems onto my life and it's all a psychological thing, cannot say for sure right now)

Basically that all has led up to me failing to even get the IB diploma. And according to my knowledge, I think i am the only one in my grade who is in such a situation. Since i have the option of retaking the exams in november i decided to take that option. But over the last few days, my parents have kept telling me about how i've betrayed them by wasting their money and their time, and how all my friends will forget me and leave me because of my piss-poor academic performance. That just makes me feel even more shit about myself and I don't know what to do.",13Jul2020,1
580,"I'm a college student. For the last 2 years, I've been buying season student football tickets for ~$200. There are 7 games in the season so each game would be ~$28. I usually sell tickets ranging from $45 - $150 each depending on who's playing. A lot of students sell their tickets for higher prices (which is illegal); some even buy more tickets for cheap off of someone else to sell for a higher price. If I ever want to go to a game, I buy a ticket for myself for $10 - $15. 

When selling, I simply ask the buyer if he's willing to pay price X, because someone else has already offered me price Y. Sometimes it's true, someone offered me price Y, sometimes it's not. Am I a scammer?",13Jul2020,1
581,"My parents are orthodox Christians. My mum is a part of the choir at the church and she is deeply religious.

She was planning on going to church this Sunday and I kept pleading with her not to, considering the rapid spread of the virus and pandemic on the rise all over my city. 

My mum isn’t willing to listen and considering that I’m an atheist (which they hate about me and aren’t willing to accept) she and my father are now accusing me of trying to stop them from going to church and getting in the way of them and jesus.

Also I go to office on alternate days (3days a week) but I take all the precautions that need to be taken for example, I travel to my office in a car, I wear a proper mask and a face shield and I carry a sanitizer with me all the time. 
In the office too we’re being made to sit at 6 feet distance from each other and there are only 8 people.

My mum thinks that it’s unfair that I get to go to office but she shouldn’t go to church.

My mum believes that Jesus will make sure neither she nor her family will be affected by corona because she is a deeply religious person and infact if she skips on Sunday services there are more chances the virus will attack us.

Both my mum and dad have extreme diabetes which is a clear comorbidity for corona and I’m scared out of my life for both of them. They are well aware of the lack of hospital beds and the horrendous facilities for corona treatment in the city I live in. And yet they are misconstruing my concern for them as me trying to get in the way of them and Jesus. 

After having a fight at home that night, my mother went to church on Sunday morning and my dad went to drop and pick her up. 

When they came back home, I simply asked them if they washed their hands properly and they went all ballistic on me and said horrible things to me about how I don’t care about them.

my mom said she doesn’t know why such a kid was born to her. Who overthinks and tortures her. I’m not normal apparently. My dad didn’t even correct her for that. 

Then I decided that I should start looking for a single room flat outside because
1. if I get the virus from office and I’m an asymptotic carrier at home then living away will be safer 

2. and also to encourage the rest of the family to stop using me going to office as an excuse to do things that are potentially harmful to the family (like going to a crowded place such as a church) 

and I told my sister about the same. But I didn’t want my parents to know yet.

Today I found out that my sister told them about my plans and I feel completely betrayed by her and my father instead of asking me to eat dinner he’s like if you want to leave we’ll make arrangements. Your peace is important to us. 


I’m not doing this for my peace. It’s for everyone’s peace. But how do I get that across to them? They think I’m simply throwing a fit for no reason.

Please help. Any advice is appreciated.",13Jul2020,1
582,"Hey! So I found out that I need to get some emergency dental work done that's going to take a really hard hit on my finances because it's so extensive. The clinic I would usually go to because it has in-house financing options isn't offering that right now because they're afraid people won't pay it back due to layoffs during COVID-19.

I've been spending much of my savings helping my parents pay their rent and such while their business is struggling during the shutdown. At the time, I had the mindset of ""I still have my job and my family is struggling, this is something I can do to help."" But it's left me with nothing to get this dental work done. And because I'm still fairly young (22) and have little credit history, I haven't been able to secure a loan.

I have about $6,500 in my 401K and heard that if you're struggling from a COVID-related financial hardship, you can withdraw with no penalties. I asked my HR department about it and they said it would be determined by the company we do our 401K through once I apply. I went through the application, though, and noticed they just ask for whether you've been financially affected--no documents required.

Would this count as a COVID-related hardship because I've been using my savings to help family and because my usual clinic isn't offering in-house financing during the crisis? I'm lucky in that I haven't had hours reduced at work, nor have I been diagnosed with COVID, but this is a really big financial emergency that's even worse because I can't do financing.

I'm really desperate to get this done, but I don't want to end up going to jail or something if it wasn't actually a COVID-related hardship. Does this sound like it would qualify or is it better to not apply?",13Jul2020,1

585,"So, hey I'm back here after last time because I got amazing advice, so my girlfriend had her final exams of her 12th grade before covid19 started and today her results had come out and she got an average percentage and is super upset as she had worked really hard to get an above average and she had spend day in day out studying so that she could get into a good college, as if that wasn't sad enough her parents are really mad at her and her mom even burst out crying because they put this insane amount of expectations on to her. 

Now the problem is we were already in a middle of a small fight which happens every now and then but gets resolved soon so I had decided to end the fight and told her I'm sorry after I heard her marks and I keep telling her if she is feeling upset she can talk to me and marks and these results don't really matter, but she is not letting me get through her and she says she doesn't feel like talking so I'm letting her have her own space now but what I'm worried about mostly is the fact that she is under a lot of pressure at home and she is not very emotionally strong and I'm really worried since we are in different countries as of right now and also her grandma had passed away during her exams which she is still not over even though she pretends like she is to not worry anyone, all of this is worrying me a lot and I don't know how to get through her on text alone what should I do....",13Jul2020,1

But ‘Dan’ who I’ll call for the story, had told me it didn’t bother him that we were a thing for a short while and didn’t mind at all as I’d checked with him out of respect. Then another week or so later we were at a party and he brought along his friend from another town who had openly admitted he didn’t like me and I’d only spoke to him once or twice he seemed ok but for some reason he didn’t like me. And for some reason Dans friend had been trying to get me and Dan to have a fight but the reason was unclear but it must have been about the girl I could feel it as Dan had stopped talking to me completely. Anyway I spoke to dan and said all this stuff about a fight is completely wrong and I’d never even mentioned him as dans friend had been saying we were calling eachother names behind our backs (which was a complete lie) but after clearing the air with Dan he continued to take the mick out of me at said party and I overheard. At this point I was half a bottle of vodka down and rather tipsy and I saw red. Without hesitation I went up to Dan and punched him clean in the face and then did the same to his friend who he brought along.

I usually say yes to that question but never really taken it that seriously. Meanwhile, these past months, people have been copying and plagiarizing my video. I eventually lost motivation since I've been doing those videos for almost 2 years and then stopped posting since April. Suddenly, today, I got a notification from this one ""fan"". She used to tell me that I was one of her biggest inspirations and drew me loads of fan art. She usually asked questions about how she can improve her videos and tells me how much she loves my videos. But today, this is what she had to say.. (word for word)

""We need to talk""
""(Please)""
""You must cancel *video name*""
""Now""
""And why have you cancelled your 20 videos?"" (I lost motivation and privated my old videos that I didn't like)
""Why""

597,"I’ll apologise in advance and this post my be long winded and I will probably waffle ad repeat myself but i just really need to talk.

I will start right from when this all started just so you can get the whole picture. 

So around 3/4 years ago I was in my last two years old school, taking my exams.I went to an all girls school and could not wait to get the fuck out of that place, I hated it, to put it simply; especially those last two years. Those last two years were my epitome of hell. When i first started in that school at 11 i was a little bit weird, still quite childish and not at all like the girls i would be mixing with. I became a target, not so much for ‘bullying’ but i as picked on, teased, rumours spread etc,just basic bitchy behaviour- that i could put up with, but the last two years i was treated with such difference that I never understood to this day and it still has an impact on me 3/4 years later. 

My last two years in that school, i took different classes than a lot of my small friend group and ended up on a completely different timetable, in classes with girls in my year who i had had no previous interactions with.  I am a naturally shy person, so was automatically out of my comfort zone but i never did or said anything to where i deserved to be treated, how I got treated. 

These girls just loved making me uncomfortable in anyway they could, they would snigger, deliberately leave me out,humiliate me and make me feel stupid. They would give me nasty looks and just be damn right rude and unpleasant to me for no reason. Some of them would ‘offer me’ to sit with them, when really they just wanted  that opportunity to make me uncomfortable. 

So that was going on at school, i was living a life of misery, and in the background I had a lot of problems with family surrounding my mum and brothers relationship. It consisted of a lot of fighting, aggression and resulted in my brother moving out and me losing my relationship with him for a long time.

After school, i went to college to study a diploma in Animal care. I started off in college very nervous and almost afraid of people, I didn’t want a repeat experience of school. However, i met a girl called Lydia who i spent a lot of time with in lessons and around in college, she was confident and bubbly an really brought me out of my shell. Lydia and i then ended up becoming friends with a really great bunch of girls and college felt amazing...that was until December of 2017. Lydia had gone on a college trip to Germany with a few other of our friends, on the morning of December 10th 2017, I received an email from the college principal saying that Lydia had suffered a severe asthma attack while in Germany and had sadly passed away. I was in shock. I didn’t want to believe it and it took a long time for me to accept what had happened. I became a lot more reserved after Lydia’s death,but i was lucky to have great friends who were very supportive and i as able to enjoy the rest of my college experience. I graduated with a merit, as happy as i was, i wish Lydia could have been there to graduate with us. 

I left college over a year ago now and my life has literally gone no where. My dream is to become a Vet Nurse and it is soul destroying when you have qualifications, heaps of experience working with  animals and in vets and yet still not being able to get your dream job. I have lost count ho many jobs i have applied for and most of the time i never hear back from them. I’m suck in a shitty part time job that i hate in a fast food joint and i cant seem to escape. I feel like I’m wasting my life away, i cant save any money and do the things i would love to do because i don’t have full time job with decent pay. Instead i sit all day at a screen, emailing, ringing and applying to places with no avail. 

I’m at the point now where i will have to take any job now regardless of whether i like it or not.

I have become depressed because of these things. I know i have, I’m at a dead end. Any happiness i experience is always short lived and never feels genuine to me, nothing excites me anymore, i dont want to see anyone and i have no motivation to do anything. I’m tired of feeling so low all the time and as if my life is going nowhere. I honestly feel trapped, like I’m scratching and hitting at the walls for a way out but nothing happens, the walls stay where they are.  Some days i feel like giving up and think just lying down and dying would be a much simpler and easier thing to do. I am not suicidal,i could never do that to my family but the thought of not having to exist seems peaceful to me .

604,"My sister (52) and her husband (53) are currently living with my mother (80, healthy) in my hometown, my husband and I live 350 miles away. He just got a new job and they'll be moving out of state even further away than we are now. They have the opportunity to stay with us or at least stop by on their drive to the new state to start the house hunt, but they aren't doing that for their own reasons. My BIL will stay in the new city while my sister flies back to my hometown to prep for the move. My husband and I are talking about driving back to my mom's this summer to visit and introduce her to our puppy that she only sees photos of but wants to meet. She can't travel to us due to bad hips and how long it takes to drive here, and she won't fly.

I'm feeling so conflicted about going there, mostly because of the risk of transmission and infection we might unknowingly bring with us or catch there (we are sure we already had COVID but the antibodies are long gone now and we could catch it again). My sister and her husband just returned from visiting their children via a flight to the coast, and now they're traveling again to a different state that's also seeing a sizable uptick in infection rates. All of this feels careless to me and I don't want to contribute to it, but I also feel a certain pressure to visit my mom since we haven't seen her since November '19 and who knows when I'll see my sister again after they move.

My family are all conservatives and are likely getting their information from sources that are downplaying the virus risk, and we are the opposite of that (socially isolating, masks, etc), so I suspect they don't think any of this is a big deal at all. Also, traditionally, I/we have traveled to them 90% of the time we see them, they don't visit us, so if we want to see them it's up to us to make it happen.",13Jul2020,1

607,"I dunno if this is the right place to ask but,
The other day my dad had a bit of a back and forth with a co-worker over email. It wasn’t anything serious and just stressed pettiness. The coworker did not report him and they are on good terms however HR have got involved. 
HR held a zoom/Skype meeting with my dad for four hours to discuss this. This went on until past 7:30 pm. 
It is known to HR that my dad is on antidepressants and his own dad recently passed away. Not that that’s an excuse for his behaviour however- 
Is this something he can talk to higher-ups about or is this normal?
It has really effected his mental health and my mum believes it comes under bullying. Is this normal/right?

I cannot even explain how frustrating it is to try to do this as I have no idea where to even start because I need this blood test ASAP. I have called multiple people who have been pretty useless or haven’t explained who I need to go to (I need a physician which I don’t have) and I tried calling a community health place and they also didn’t really help. I really need the test done and it’s making me really upset that it’s such a hard thing to do because it really should be available easily?

609,"I’ve been talking to this guy for a couple weeks. Today I peeped his phone and saw that he had messaged a girl when we first starting talking. Naturally, I lost it because I haven’t done anything like that since I became interested in him. I went crazy and we had to leave the place we were at (a little drunk). He apologized and we went back to the party. I couldn’t get it off my mind though so I kept bringing it up. It bothered me so much that I called him at 7am to talk about it. He apologized again but told me I was over reacting. I think I annoyed him because he said he’d call me when he woke up and hung up. 

Now, I realized that I might’ve been overreacting because well, we’re not officially dating, it was the beginning. I can’t help but to feel like he’s screwing me over but I also feel like I’m sabotaging our relationship by not letting it go. 

I don’t want him to think I’m some sort of psycho girlfriend but it did bother me. How do I make it up to him while standing my ground? I want to apologize because I acted out of pocket but I also want him to reassure me that it was nothing.",13Jul2020,1
611,"Hi! This is a throwaway account and first time posting so I’m a bit nervous... but I’m feeling completely lost. I guess I’ll start with explaining that I do have depression and anxiety, but as I’m sure with many others, Covid has made it quite a bit worse.
I was working from home for the first 3 months of lockdown and somewhere at the beginning of June I was forced back to work in office. The first week things were obviously weird, I assumed I would become adjusted to the change and had felt okay (quarantine had eased a lot of anxiety), but we were initially coddled with “please let us know if there are any reasons you will be unable to work in the office, including anxiety, etc”. By the end of the first week back my anxiety was very, very bad. To the point where I was already seeing my work ethic deteriorate. There hadn’t been (and still aren’t) any practical measures to keep us safe, and besides 2 people (aside from myself) there isn’t a single person who wears a mask. I decided to take the opportunity that I was offered to wfh, and had addressed my anxiety with management and asked if I could go back to working from home. Everything seemingly was approved, until the end of the day... 
I was told by my company that regardless of my anxiety being Covid related or not, it just wasn’t a “good enough reason” to allow me to wfh and that my position requires me in office (again - I was wfh for 3 months prior to the week this was told to me). The only valid “solution” they offered me was to find a therapist. 
It’s been over a month at this point since this has happened, and things are only getting worse. I’m currently looking for a therapist that suits me, but I can’t help but feel like I’ve put myself in a vulnerable position. My company had asked me if my mental health was interfering with my work and I had said yes at the time, and I feel like if I go to them again they will turn me away again or even find a way to fire me.",13Jul2020,1
612,"i am a 17yo (male) . I read somewhere that a new hobby can help you become more motivated and make you feel better so I started trying out different things. But everytime I start doing something I just lose the motivation or the intrest to do that thing and I just go back to playing some games that I barely enjoy anymore. most of the times the reason is because anything I try one of my friends can do better than me and something completely new which no one else does often gets boring because no one is there to talk about it. I once put a lot of effort into cooking but even at my best it wasn't that great so I don't feel motivated to practice or trying out  anything anymore.

maybe I'm just being lazy can someone help and tell me what I should do?

The one person I know who chose a therapist told me they were horrible, so I am really afraid I'll make the same mistakes.

My one friend (let’s call her Krystal) has a BF as well and the four of us like the mess with each other by touching each other’s faces stomachs etc but we never would cheat on our SO. 
Krystal was hanging with us at a graduation party and was messing with my BF a little nothing crazy just poking his chest/cheek and sometimes smacked his butt. I honestly didn’t mind cause I trust both of them and my BF has told me many times if anything he does with other girls bothers me I just need to tell him and he would stop. 
His mom was pissed though, that we allowed her to do that saying it’s disrespectful and I shouldn’t trust her like that. She even got mad at him for rubbing her back when she was having an anxiety attack... 
Part of me wants to just ignore her and move on, but the fact she doesn’t trust him or my friends annoyed both of us.

620,"My brother didn’t talk to me because I played a game he called dibs on (he’s 21) and I brought it with my money and even offered to let him play and now he’s not talking to me and has been almost three months.

Now part of me wants to be beat him up for being immature and stupid, and another part of me wants to confront him about it and destroy the points he made as to why I couldn’t play the game.

Now for context, I brought a PlayStation because my brother told me to and I thought it was fun. So when P5R came out I thought I would be fun and my brother says the he couldn’t allow to play because he wanted the game first and also he wants to feel unique and experience it for himself. He also said that the game wouldn’t have much to do with me (which btw isn’t a precursor to play a game and fun fact, the game is centered around psychology which i majored in + it has some elements of my own interest the more I played the game). He sent me a text about his feelings towards I played anyways and then he hasn’t spoke to me since. 

It’s a shame because it would’ve been cool to have someone talk about the game and share our experiences with it but he decided to be a bastard about it

I’m not going to forgive him because that’s going to enable him that he was right and I also think what he is doing is very confusing. What is the point of him shunning me?

621,"Recently my roommate got a new girlfriend and she has been coming onto me, touching me without my consent, and making comments about me. (I'm a girl, and my roommate is a guy). I have told her multiple times to stop, but she has ignored these requests, I have even loudly told her to stop in front of people and she doesn't care. I have told my roommate about the time when she came over and it was the second time I ever met her, she pulled me into another room and forced me to make out with her while my roommate was in the bathroom. I've told him about all the times she has touched me, flashed me while he wasn't looking, kissed me, grabbed my breasts, and butt, shown me herself naked, came into my room without knocking to see me changing or come into the bathroom and peed in front of me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I told him recently about everything when he tried to say she wanted to move in, and he said she wouldn't be moving in and would be coming over less. I'm really tired and anxious all the time, and can't be comfortable in my own home when she is over because she has shown time and time again that she can and will do anything she wants to me. Sometimes we have hung out and she is completely normal, or it starts normal then she makes it weird. She always says that she is used to doing that stuff with her friends in her home town and that it is normal, even though I've told her multiple times to stop. 

&amp;#x200B;

Is it wrong of me to ask for her not to come over anymore and for him to just go to her house when he wants to see her? I'm also asking if there is a way for me to just be ok with her doing the things she is doing to me, and if I'm just being dramatic? I was molested when I was a kid, raped as a teenager, and also sexually assaulted by a guy a year ago so even when I tell her this she finds a way to say it isn't her problem that that happened to me and just keeps doing it. I even told her it makes me want to kill myself and she just told me not to say that. I've tried asking her in person, over text, tried telling my roommate multiple times. I just feel like my roommate isn't taking me seriously, or I need to find a way to just deal with it and not be so anxious and stressed all the time. If I can just find a way to be ok when she does it to me I won't have to get in the way of their relationship or be accused of making it up.",13Jul2020,1

1. Stay in Florida. Move back in with my boyfriend (rocky relationship) go to school part time and get a less stress job

2.fly to New York. Already have housing secured and a job lined up- and keep a part time/full time job and start school in 1 year 

3.stay in Florida but move to a different city/county- keep a job and go to school

To give you the backstory
I have been in Florida 2 almost 3 years-I am not happy with my job nor my living situation due to the amount of stress. I’m hesitant to move back in with my boyfriend due to the fact of us just recently getting back together. I think it’s important for me to start school but i feel like I am still young enough where I won’t be outrageously behind(but maybe that’s wishful thinking) I have lived in New York before and I personally love it but I am just completely conflicted because I don’t want to fuck myself in school.

Our friend group consists of me, her, and her “friend” 18M. Friend in quotes because they have a romantic type of relationship but they’re not technically together. Its odd but its wasnt my problem until I started seeing how she just kept leading him on and it was like he was wrapped around her finger. She says she doesn’t have feelings for him so I think its kinda fucked up shes doing that to him. Because, I been in his position before. 

I brought it up a few times to ask basically if she knew what she was doing and she would always get mad at me or angry. So, then I officially decided to butt out of it and let whatever happens between them happen. 

Last week I was going through some shit and lashed out a few times. I apologized and regretted it. But, she kept bringing up how it seemed I was closer to 18M than I was close to her. I’ve been talking with 18M more and thats true. But, she said it was like I “shifted and was against her” But, that’s incorrect. 18M and I may play video games together and talk on discord a couple times but we’ve never been besties or whatever. We’re good friends but not the type I talk to on a daily.

* Oct 2017 - I join the company
* June 2018 - I change departments, where I now tangentially interact with Coworker
* Sept 2018 - He emails my boss directly about the cleanliness of my desk, rather than speak to me.
* Oct 2018 thru Jan 2020 - Roughly three occasions where my boss says ""hey Coworker mentioned to me that he doesn't like \[blank\]. I know you're fine but just do what he wants, ok?""
* Feb 2020 - My boss leaves the company just as COVID hits.
* Mid-June 2020 - We return to the office full time
* Today (21 workdays later) - My VP (who is now my direct superior) sends me a meeting invite that says: ""There have been concerns about your attendance, reports about lapses in daily work, and overall lack of engagement. These concerns have been documented by the operations team."" among other things.

I am going to clear these issues up with my VP, which are (I swear) misunderstandings based on this Coworker making assumptions about me and deciding not to talk to me about it. Afterwards I want to go up to him and say ""hey I understand how you could make that leap using the information you have but I know how to do my job and you are the only one who complains about how I do it. I would prefer it if you would address me directly when you have concerns about how I do perform in the office.""

633,"TLDR; Im super insecure, loud, talk a lot, techy, play video games, get high grades, spam my friends, and send a lot of memes. Am I weird for being different than all my friends I hang out with?? A guy friend pointed it out and its been bothering me all night... Should I be more closed off and quiet like I was before? I think everyone hates my personality (im not rude or anything tho ofc)

&amp;#x200B;

So last night (2am-6am), I was in a discord call with one of my guy friends who I met back in February in class. He's super introverted and when we talk he always says he only talks to like 5 girls max, and is pretty closed off from ppl (he still has his own group of friends he's always with tho). Anyways, he told me that I'm way different compared to other girls and I honestly took it as more of an insult that compliment even though I'm pretty sure he didn't mean anything rude or nice by it? It was more of a comment than anything.

All my girl friends are super girly, not techy at all, and dont play any games. Im pretty knowledgeable abt it tho, and im super different from them (we're all still friends tho and rlly rlly trust each other) I tend to spam all my friends a lot, talk a lot, barely sleep (like srsly, an hour or two at most of sleep), and send A LOT of memes. I still get rlly high grades tho and work super hard, and he said other than academically, im completely different than my friend group. I've always been quite insecure abt this already, so him pointing it out kind of hit me where it hurts. 

From gr 4 - gr 8, I had the same classmates so I didn't really get to meet a lot of people and I was super shy too so I wasn't really myself half the time. (My friend group is still the same btw, all the girls from my middle school class just sit together) I slightly opened myself up last year and tried to be a little more outgoing and when my personality wasn't rejected, it made me so happy. This year I decided to talk to everyone I meet and to just be 100% me, but honestly I think my real personality is just a bother. I don't really see anything wrong with sending a bunch of messages to friends but I think its see as annoying and I'm so quick to think that people are annoyed or hate me, and I get super anxious because I dont know how much of myself to actually act like, without annoying others.

My guy friend also said that his first impression of me was super different then how we talk now. Am I that strange? I always knew I was kinda different than my friends since we have very diff interests but I didn't think it was that bad? I'm probably just overthinking things like I usually do, and when I was talking to my guy friend, we actually left that topic and moved on pretty quickly but its just been bothering me all night. Should I change the way I act? Am I too clingy and annoying? Should I just go back to being more closed off?",13Jul2020,1
634,"I'd like to keep this brief, but this is something I've been keeping boiled up inside for a little while, so I apologize if this is too long.

Also, I'm sorry if this sounds mopey or pretentious. Maybe this just stems out of a bruised ego lol. I wouldn't be surprised. But I don't intend to sound narcissistic here.

For starters, I wouldn't say I'm the dumbest person of all time. I'm a high school student planning to go to college decently soon, and I'm fifth in my class. I'm pretty proud of this, and I'd say I'm pretty dedicated with my studies; I plan to (if everything is to go smoothly) major in a field I love and hopefully maybe do research in it. At least that's the hope, and it's something that I've been seriously thinking about pursuing for the last few years or so.

But there's where the problem lies. It's hard to perfectly describe how I feel, as it's honestly a very conflicting string of emotions. Maybe it's just hormones or teen angst - which honestly I'd be willing to accept - but I've felt a continual and nagging insecurity and about my own intelligence and potential for quite some time now.

I guess it arises out of several things. For one, it kind of started in full force when I began to look at the capacity and quickness of one of my peers/friends, and realized that they're most likely ten times more capable than I am. It's not that I *loathed* them for being better, they're great people, and I value their friendship very highly. But there was a really painful subconscious envy that arose in me that I couldn't let go of. And it was a bit frightening, because then I started thinking about what my potential was. I tried to console myself by saying that if I put in the work and dedication I can be successful. But there's where the second factor began to come into play.

I began to look at great people that I look up to, alive and dead, and all they've accomplished. And that's when a thought came to me that, given the same amount of motivation that I put in, they can do ten times the things I would ever be able to do. Say I work really hard, I get a good job or a good position in something I enjoy. Say if I dedicate myself to research, I could do something slightly interesting, or could potentially contribute something to my field. But with that same amount of motivation, these people could do things I could never do had I worked on something for a hundred years. And that's when I started compulsively researching things like natural intelligence, natural capability, and natural talent. And an obsessive fear began to grow that all of my interest, all of my devotion, all of my studies might not amount to anything.

I might burn up and peak half-way through undergrad - hell, I might've peaked in high school. I might get into grad school (with any luck) and realize I'm not cut out for the ""big leagues"". That some people will just do things 10 times more interesting than I could ever do. 

And obviously in some sense I'd be fine with that - obviously there's going to be someone smarter than you. It's inevitable. There's going to be someone quicker, who can see things that much more easily, who can solve problems that much more expediently. But it's more than that - I'm deathly afraid that whatever I do, or whatever I try to do, in terms of a contribution it won't mean anything in the long term. That all the people who are naturally more capable than me, the geniuses, the ones who can truly innovate in spectacular ways, that they've got me beat before the race has started.

I'm deathly afraid of my own natural limitations. I'm deathly afraid that my genetics or that my natural ability precludes me from doing something that I want to do, that I'm passionate about, that I've dedicated such a long time already thinking about and preparing for.

I'm deathly afraid that no matter how hard I work, nothing I do will be looked at. Nothing I *could* do *would* be looked at. That I'll be mediocre.

I want to believe that if I work hard, if I give it my all, I can do something with my life. But I find it so hard given that there are so many people who just have the natural capacity to innovate. 

I'm sorry if this sounds stuck-up, or whiny. I don't know how to frame this in a way that doesn't sound like that. 

And sorry for the wall of text. I guess I just need some guidance and motivation, to help me push forward. I already feel a bit better having the ability to say it. Thanks for reading this junk.",13Jul2020,1

636,Ok so I'm 27 m with 3 kids and just got divorced. When I was going through the divorce I moved with my parents out of state so I didn't see my kids for about 6 months until the divorce was final. I got my k8ds for the summer and now am feeling guilty for being absent for long periods of time. When I give the kids back ill probably not see them till around Xmas time. Again I feel guilty.Ok so when I was married I had a great job and took care of the ex and the kids. But I got sick and then this coronavirus thing hit and got laid off so thats y I'm depending on my parents now. I'm planning on going back to school and think I would have a better chance of going through with school if I'm with my parents. Then again I want to be close to my kids and think maybe I have a shot. My ex is poison to me and really don't want to be anywhere near her though. My kids are young barely going to school. I can't do the same type of work I used to because I got sick so I need to study for a desk job type career because my disease will continue to progress and make me weaker.

I love my bf and his family to death. They’re very old school republican which is great! They’re gun toting small town country folk who just love a good Coors and they love their country. The only issue is they are anti Democrat and very Pro Trump. 

I don’t want to ruffle their feathers being a Democrat, but how can I point out the inconsistencies of his presidency without being disrespectful? I only want to help by showing them their voting against themselves. One family member sent me a message on Facebook of a COVID propaganda video (voiced by a computer with no source) that says Italy solved COVID, it’s only a bacteria, why are they lying to us!? When in reality, Trump is the one lying to their faces all day every damn day.

The pain started a year ago. I finally went to a doctor about it a month ago. They gave me max dose of an anti inflammatory. Harsh stuff. It worked at first but now, 4 weeks later, it's back. 

The docs said it's sciatica. So I've tried a few Amazon products. I just ordered the harness that hangs from a doorway. Hoping that will alleviate the pain long enough for me to enjoy sitting with my child. 

Getting teary eyes just typing this. 

How do I approach my doctor about this?

Does anyone have tips to relieve sciatica?

643,"(Throwaway) I’ve noticed over my relationship that my girlfriend weirdly craves attention from other boys and tries to make me purposefully jealous. I’m not the type to ignore her or not make her feel good enough I tend to think I’m genuinely a pretty good boyfriend. We have amazing communication, she’s always getting compliments and we’re together whenever neither of us are working, I don’t touch my ps when she’s around etc. 

She has her snapchat pretty open so random dudes message her, not a problem she tells the creeps to go away. However, when someone calls her cute or compliments her she tends to talk to them way more. We’ve had a few issues over phones but we’ve talked them out, one of which was an ex who was manipulative talking to her inappropriately. (Talking about our sex life) I found it incredibly creepy and I wasn’t mad at her because she made me completely aware of it and she was open from the start, however she never told him to stop, I was the one who had to tell her to stop talking about them things to him. He refused so she blocked him (her own decision, I was okay with them talking as long as it wasn’t about our sex life). 

However, there was another time she was sat in front of me texting someone and I went to get up and noticed a message she sent which was really weird. She said “my boyfriends just left me with his friends.” It was me and her in the room and that’s it. None of my friends where around or anything. So this really confused me. 
Also whenever she becomes friends with an old friend (male) or like a new male friend she mentions them constantly. Yes I’m glad she’s making friends but she doesn’t mention her female friends even close to as much as she does her male friends and it really weirds me out. I don’t freak out or anything because she’s allowed friends like I’ve got female friends she’s got male friends it’s no problem but it’s like she’s actively trying to make me jealous. 
As far as I’m aware there’s been no cheating in the relationship and I don’t suspect her of that at all. But I do think it’s really weird what she does. 

Honest opinions on the situation, am I too insecure? Or is this actually quite strange?

644,"Hi there, long story short my girlfriend of 5 years was acting odd because it turned out she was hiding a HUGE secret from me while she went away to complete her masters degree. 

Apparently all of our mutual friends knew she was cheating but chose not to tell me. Her bestfriend ended up telling me because she couldn’t stand how good my ex was able to cover this secret. 

It’s been roughly 4 months since this all went down, and I can honestly say days have been looking better.

I cut off all our mutual friends because I don’t need those fakes around. 

Her best friend, the one who told me what was going on, we still keep in contact because she does not like my ex anymore. She wants to remain very close friends still but I’m trying to move on in life and get my career going. I feel that our friendship reminds me too much of my past with my ex and I really want to move on with the situation.

Me and my exes best friend only became close friends because we related to the negativity my ex caused. 

How can I tell her I want to stop being friends for my own benefit. I just can’t handle being her friend solely of the idea that it reminds me of the pain I went through this year. I just want to start fresh with life. I wasted 5 years... I don’t want to be reminded of that life right now.

646,"Throughout my whole life living within my home my mother has always been in control of what I wear, what I should be and who I should associate myself with. For a long time I always had an issue with how her parenting has been, she doesn't take no for an answer, always has to be right, When she speaks no one should speak back ya know simple stuff like that. When I try to tell her how I feel or put my point across in a good manner she starts to shout, scream, have a fit and gaslight me for ""abusing"" her or being a disrespectful teen. When ever I wanted to pursue things that any kid that is growing up does, she turns it down and mocked me time to time. Than asks why I am not pursuing it and why I am not being ""normal"". All she's done is shout at me and discourage me and I can't take it anymore. She always been on me for my body as well. I am a girl and my chest size is rather big and all she does is say I'm fat and that if I eat too much I will become a rolling ball. Than later she antagonizes me for not being confident in myself. She never let's me pick out what I like and says I have no sense of style. The other day I had to secretly ask my dad to buy me a razor since the remaining of my teen years she never let me, and ya know body hair can create a musk. 

So she would get mad at me saying I smell when I wash really well. What doesn't help are the clothes that I've had since middle school. Every time I tried to tell her that she put me down. Recently, I've had enough of her shit, I've been depressed and insecure for years and I want to break ties. I want to be free to do what I like. Yesterday she came into the room asking why I don't draw anymore. Which was due to a series of her making me feel worthless and not deserving of my passion. I just shook my head. Se kept rambling on about college and that I should pick sooner than later or she will choose what she wants for me. And leaves the room smiling. This made me very sad because I have to deal with her manipulation and bad tactics of being a mother. All she does is shame me. I can't even feel a certain way because she sees it weak and dramatic, yet the words she pours onto me are very hurtful. She never says sorry or even asks me how I'm doing as a person. To her I'm her property and I must obey or she will cause terror. She wants me to be how she wants and it hurts.

 I'm sorry if this sounds like I am complaining yet  I have nothing else to do that will help me. I don't have friends due to the lack of my social skills and I now just get bored with normal things. Anyways, For most of my high school career I joined a coding program that I wanted to desperately be in as an opportunity to pursue art. The program was sadly not up to the expectations they told me. I felt robbed later on I told my mom and she says she would take me out. 3-4 years later here I am still in it. I've had countless arguments with her about it and she says I'm ruining my future for wanting to leave. Yet the thing is she's ruined mine. She's ruined me in ways I can't describe and I want out on the program it makes me very depressed and with her influence I feel like I am bond to her. I want to break free and today I plan on telling her how I feel. And I'm planning to quit it. It wont go so well but I will also tell her that on my birthday I will get a hair cut. And I just hope the odds are in my favor because I'm very anxious. Thank you so much for reading. I will update you guys. Sorry for it being so long. XD",13Jul2020,1

Same thing goes with relationships, I go watch some movies or twitch streams which glorify being in a relationship, but when I am in one, I find it tedious and more of a bother. I even find having sex tedious sometimes and just prefer to jack off.

Same goes for the gym, but I see it like it's my job, even though is fucking boring as shit I have to keep on doing it or it will end up hurting on the long run.

I’m sick , tired and depressed about this situation my whole life men have treated me like shit because they don’t find me attractive I actually hate going out side because it’s always something being said, little comments and random guys laughing at me to their friends or me walking by and getting laughed at or a guy saying to his friend “ that’s your girlfriend “ just to take the piss . 
I seriously just mind my business but men always feel the need to comment on my looks and I feel very self conscious and angry because what makes other people ppl feel they have the right to make another human feel like shit, for something they were born with and cannot help.
 I actually feel like I’m cursed because I highly doubt this happens to loads of women ( if it does please tell me ) 
I always think of ideas to try make myself look better I spend hours in the mirror doing certain hair styles to try and make myself more attractive but it’s still the same old . 
Ppl always say I have very good dress sense so that’s not the problem .I always tried not to worry about what others think but it’s hard when loads of people keep saying the same thing there must be some truth to it ,I know there is truth to it 
I’m so traumatised by it in my past relationship everytime I would be with my boyfriend and we would so happen to see his friends randomly) he had loads of friends ) in the street I would always turn my head and act like I was doing something or walk off so they wouldn’t see my face ( in another post relationship my bf told me his friends called me ugly and they would laugh when they saw me and said I looked like a well know footballer I forgot his name )
 . I hate that I think about my looks 247 I never used to but  I know others are going to comment on it .it’s mostly men from my race (black ) I hate walking through a crowd of black men because there is always a comment or laugher but I notice when ppl are alone they’re ok mute 

Why are men so worried about other females looks even women they do not know or have never spoken to in their life ?( in not saying this doesn’t happen to men just talking from my experience )

I know I should not worry about what other ppl say but it would get to anyone if you have heard bad about their looks all there life

I chose this degree thinking, this might something for me. Because I like understanding things, but coding is something I get, but I just don't want to learn

To make matters worse, you have to be able to code, wich I can't, I get how it works, but I don't really have an interest in it. Like I have fallen asleep at my desk multiple times trying to learn code. And even if I could I wouldn't be good at it.

So I made a wrong chose for my education. There is still a place for engineering, but it's a bit vague for me. Like I haven't tried it and don't know how to try it. Like how do you know if you like engineering or not?
It's interesting, but I am unsure about it.

As I've mentioned above, I want to help my SO with his financial issues regarding the cost of the necessary dental procedures for his teeth. You see, several of his teeth needs to be removed. He already went to a dentist to get it checked and the dentist wants to charge him $1400 just to remove the teeth. So, about a couple of months ago, he went to a different dentist, just to get a second opinion and also to see if they would be able to remove the teeth. 
This dentist told him that they didn't feel confident to pull his teeth and recommended him to return to the dentist who recommended him to get the teeth removed in the first place. The dentist also told him that if he'd have a bridge/denture made for the three teeth that would be removed, it would cost $1500 for that. In the end, the dentist just prescribed him some antibiotics to kill the infection (because his teeth has been hurting a lot).

I really want to help him but I am also not in a really good spot, financially, as I am currently studying and I also just lost my part-time job in my uni because of the pandemic. 

He didn't ask me for help (and I know he never would), but I am really worried about him.

I’m worried I won’t get enough hours at the position I accepted, causing even more regret as I run financial equations out seeing how much more I could have made. How do I avoid all of these feelings of deep regret? I would have felt similar regret if I took the other job which makes everything more annoying. I can’t go back in my decision because both had their pros and cons and I’ll feel this same feeling either way. I just need advice on how to work around this discontent.",13Jul2020,1

666,"So I passed my learners with flying colors July 10th being 18 which is somewhat older as it seems as though most my friends are already driving. 

I never really showed interest in driving most likely stemming from the fact I was in a pretty scary car crash when I was in first grade. (Which was the other drivers fault.)

 Ever since then sometimes I would have dreams of me driving and being horrible. ( driving in the wrong direction, accidently running into a building,the car rolling down the hill) 

My family seems enthusiastic that I am starting to learn how to drive specially my older sister who keeps asking me when and if I've started learning. My older sister has ADHD as well so I know it won't be that big of an issue. But I'm also worried about several things focus,

U.S lanes and making 100% sure I feel comfortable with knowing lanes like I know some basic book stuff that they gave us but some of my panic is making me not understand a few things. Like how can I be 100% sure about traffic direction. Silly things like that...

670,"I posted this in r/ relationship_advice but I thought I’d post here too.


So my university recently laid out its plans for reopening in the fall amidst COVID, and most of my classes are online; for context, I’m a rising sophomore, the university is a 9 hour drive from home, and I’m living off campus with some roommates. My main issue at hand is that I genuinely don’t know whether to go back to campus (if not, I’d opt to take all my classes online, but unfortunately I’d be running into troubles with my apartment’s lease, a situation I know many students are trying to navigate) based on my living environments at home vs. school.


Home: So after basically everyone moved back home due to the pandemic in March, I’ve been living at home ever since. I know this has been the case for many people universally, but ever since then my mental health has seriously spiraled out of control. Note: I had been going to therapy before this pandemic started. I have a history of anxiety and depression, and I know that therapy is the best solution but before I go back, I want some outside input. Anyways, it was really hard fo finish the semester and I’ve been continuously feeling the effects of this isolation mentally. I have an older sibling with autism, and as you could imagine, being stuck at home away from proper access to therapy and doctors has been hard for them leading to many meltdowns, etc. I really wish I could do more to help them. Unfortunately, my dad is emotionally absent (and has been my entire life) when it comes to these situations; he simply locks himself in his study to work, leaving my mom to handle everything and not being a proper dad to my sibling. While I have been living with this situation my whole life, this quarantine has exacerbated all the effects of the environment on my mental health, and since no one knows when this virus will end, I don’t know how long things will be this way. My mom knows this and is very concerned about my grades taking a dip because of these home issues, so she’s encouraging me to go back to campus and take precautions (even though I wish I could be there for her). As a side note, my mom works at a public school, so we’ve thoroughly talked about how even if I stay at home, there’s still a lot of risk of the virus in my own home when she comes back from work every day (because I know going to a university seems worse).


School: Simply put, my freshman year sucked socially. I had a nice group of friends in high school, and my closest ones mean the world to me. We all still keep in touch too, but I really want to solidify friendships at college of course. I came into college determined to not make the same mistakes I made in high school and I just wanted to grow and mature as a person. Turns out making friends was way harder than I thought and all that initial determination and excitement turned into a mess of social anxiety and loneliness by second semester. I joined clubs and was social in class, but no one truly “clicked”. I have my roommates who I’m barely close with and a couple people I regularly studied with but it never progressed into a true friendship. Now looking back, there were moments where I should have taken more initiative to say ask them to hang out; but in many instances, I felt like some people just didn’t want to put in effort to hang out. Most of my high school friends found nice friend groups at their colleges; so did so many people in my dorm. So I decided mid-February, when the loneliness was really hitting hard, what new clubs I wanted to join next year and how I’d try to be more social. Then this pandemic screws everything up. Even if I go back to campus, I’d hardly be leaving my apartment, there are no clubs, and I don’t want to go out to social places and risk contracting/spreading the virus. I feel like I just lost a whole year to redeem myself; if I go back to campus in the state it’s in, I think I’ll be even lonelier knowing I made no friends last year and I won’t have any opportunities to make more this year. Saddest part is that I love my university experience otherwise. I’m studying what I love in a place with so many resources and things to do in the city, but I feel so alone. I’m embarrassed to tell my mom or high school friends all this.


There are clearly a lot of reasons as to why I should/shouldn’t go back other than my friend/family issues; holding all other factors aside (money/apartment lease stuff, etc), I’m confused on how to navigate my life right now. If I stay at home, should I perhaps consider family therapy to see if it helps my mindset/mental health at home? If I go back to school (most likely) how do I navigate friendships in a socially distanced world/cope with general college loneliness? Throughout quarantine, I’ve made it a point to keep developing my hobbies, learn new things, and take online classes, so all that is keeping  me busy at present, but I seriously feel scared for the future.",13Jul2020,1

672," My ex and I broke up 2 months ago. We were together for 9 months. I saw him for the first time since we broke up at a party and it sucked. It was painful having to glance at each other and awkwardly walk in different directions to avoid each other. At one point, my ex had completely disappeared from the party and none of his friends could find him. Eventually, he ended up being in the host's house crying because he wasn't over me and it was painful that he couldn't be with me, regretting the break up. I decided to check up on him to just clear things up. I told him I still don't want to date and that I need to focus on myself. I told him that it might be best if we didn't text each other as much because it doesn't help us to get over each other. He kept saying he still wants to text me and he doesn't want me to leave him. He admitted that he drinks a whole case of alcohol every night because he is depressed and that just made me so sad. He also admitted to dating some random girl for a few weeks in an attempt to make me jealous which is kind of messed up considering he just used a girl to trigger emotions out of me. I still ended up hugging him which might not of been the best decision but I just felt so fucking shitty for him. I still don't want to date because I don't think we are right for each other in the long run. He has intense jealousy issues that just made me feel like shit. I still love him and care about him and neither of us have completely moved on (Although I have begun to and he seems to not have at all).

How can I tell my ex I don't want to talk as much without blocking him? I always see people saying blocking is the best thing to do but I just can't bring myself to do it. I find it immature. I still want to be friends with him but I realize getting to that level could take a long time. He is my first boyfriend and I am his first girlfriend so we are figuring out how relationships work still and how to go about healing from this break up. I know I've already committed some faux-pas.. I think the best way to heal and move forward is to stop texting each other as much but he seems stubborn to comply. Should I really block him? I would just feel like a dick after admitting he is suffering in other ways.

He says he would like to call tonight to talk. I'm thinking of being as brutally honest as I can be but I don't want to cause him more pain. But the more we text the more it makes it harder for us to move on.

689,"So as my title says, I just quit my job to try and follow my dreams... I’m a 22 year old male. My dream is to be a professional gamer. I’ve always had a severe passion for it and I’m really good when I’m able to put the time in. When I say able to put the time in; since I was 17 I’ve been working after high school pretty much full time every week. So working 40 hours per week would not cut it with gaming when you have kids still in high school able to play 8+ hours per day while I’m at work. I’m always still able to keep up with them, but it got harder as time went on. 

Basically I’m faced with a few problems in the way of pursuing my dream... what I need and the ideal situation is to be able to stay at home with my mother with the good internet I have along with being able to sleep/live here. The problem is that my mother doesn’t support my gaming at all. She never did but I think it’s because she hasn’t seen me gain any success in it. I know if I put the time in there’s not a doubt in my mind I can and will make this happen.

So I feel my mother wants me to either work, or get out of her house. I don’t think she’ll let me stay home even though I’m getting unemployment. My unemployment is enough to get me through 8 months financially. In those 8 months I need to make something happen if I can just convince her to let me stay home and game a my job. I want to even give her $300-500 per month from my unemployment money so she stays off of my back. Is this reasonable??

The only other thing that is in my way is my health: I have a few chronic illnesses that is part of the reason why I also quit my job. If my dream for whatever reason doesn’t work out, then I need to find something that doesn’t agitate my symptoms as bad, but I don’t even want to talk about a plan B honestly. 

My question to you guys is how I can get through to my mother to let me stay home for these 8 months to prove to her that I can do it? I do have some gaming earnings from the past, but not enough to prove to her or convince her of anything.

Anyway, I’m so anxious as I haven’t even told her about quitting my job yet. Any help here would be appreciated!",13Jul2020,1

My siblings and I are moving into a new house and fighting over the room. The room we want is the same size as the one we don’t want, but with a nook that gives it an extra 10ish sq feet. Other than that rooms are relatively similar, share a bathroom.

Person 1 thinks she deserves the room because they have a large desk and need the extra space to for the desk. She will be completing this semester of college from home and needs the study space. She will be returning to school out of state after. She also plans to spend the next summer studying for the mcat (med school exam). The desk and other furniture would be cramped and uncomfortable without the extra space.

Person 2 thinks she deserves the room because she is a senior in high school and has a year before college. Still lives at the house. She will be leaving at school for school next fall and living on campus. She likes the other room better and will be spending a full year at home.

699,"I came home last night at midnight. I make it a habit to lock my door with my key fob. At 3:30 AM I found out my car got ransacked. They stole some cards (that were easily disabled), some cash, a heater, and a part attached to my steering wheel. I feel so awful about it. I really let myself down, but I swear I locked the door. But I guess I didnt since they were able to open the door?? I dont know, I feel like I'm going crazy. I've already filed a police report but I'm dreading the insurance part to get my car part replaced. It probably costs a lot of money if they stole it, and I feel so horrible.

I'm only 22, just graduated uni, unemployed, and living with my mom for covid. I love her deeply, but she is very paranoid and it in turn has made me a very paranoid and anxious person. The thing she doesn't know is, I left a copy of my house key in the car, but they didnt take it. It was wrapped in a crumbled doggy potty bag, so it looked like trash I guess. I know its likely they were just looking for money, but part of me is going insane thinking that maybe they made a copy of the key to use one night when I'm unsuspecting of them. Getting my locks replaced would be ~$300 so it feels like I'm risking our safety. But maybe I am just being paranoid and it's being amplified by my guilty?

My neighborhood isnt dangerous. It's pretty secluded, but in the 10 years I've lived here, I've only heard of 3 crimes, just stealing. I also dont know how to bring this up to my insurance. There was no way to prove that I locked the door or not so Im afraid they wont help at all. Something odd that happened though, was usually when I double press my lock button, my car will beep and flash. For some reason my car stopped doing that, but still locks. I don't wanna shift blame onto my key fob, but why is it acting so weird??? Someone please tell me what to do",13Jul2020,1

701,"I live in a new construction neighborhood. The next door neighbor bought his unit as an investment and already has renters moved in a week ago. Since then I think they are running some sort of illegal or shady business without a permit from their garage.

There was a guy working on various cars all weekend (that guy doesn't even live there). On three different occasions I had to ask the neighbor to move the car and stop blocking my driveway (it was a different car each time). They also had two cars next to each other blocking the entire street and someone else's driveway. It's obvious this guy doesn't care. It's not his personal vehicle blocking my driveway either--its some random stranger parked their waiting to get their car worked on.

703,"My backyard is a moderately downward sloping wilderness with tall grasses and some trees, stretching maybe 50 feet from my house. I want to build a fence around my property line to keep wild animals out and indicate hikers of private property.

I have taken fairly precise measurements of my property line using the city's property map. According to my measurements, my neighbor has a fence corner right on the edge of their property, but uses a strip of my land to cross between their front and back yards (nothing built). Additionally, they have an under-land water pipe (my guess is to empty their fish pond water) that goes about 10 feet into my property (end of pipe can be seen).

I don't want to cause any problems with my neighbor, but I also want this fence built. I am willing to give up a bit of land, but cannot make it 10 feet. My fear is that my neighbor will dispute my land claims. And in order to get the city to map this out exactly for me, they charge $2000, a fee I do not want to pay.

704,"Me and my friend have known each other for about 4 or 5 years and a couple years ago I told him that I have a crush on him. He was accepting but told me he didn’t feel the same because he was straight. I was disappointed but had no issue with it, and because of that I decided not to attempt to make any advances or anything of the sort. He knows very well that I like him and he sometimes brings it up in conversation.

Not long after I told him he started making jokes about us (if we were along he would say something suggestive and say he’s kidding), I thought nothing of these but they kept happening... it got to the point where I told him to stop because it makes me uncomfortable, and he stopped.

But recently he has been acting strange, he messaged me one night and we ended up talking about sexual stuff. He told me that he thinks feminine men can be attractive and that he could be bisexual but he doubts it. He then tells me that he would accept sexual acts from attractive men. I didn’t thu k much of it. But recently he said that he thinks “femboys” are close enough to women and that he has a better chance with them. I didn’t say anything in response I just kind of forgot about it, and then we ended up in convo again and he asks me “are you a femboy” and I just respond with a joke. At this point I was seriously questioning whether he did like me or not. Right after I responded to his message he says to me “I can’t wait to meet you again” and I froze.

Either he isn’t meaning this and it just looks awfully weird or he is trying to drop hints or something of the sort. I just want to know what people think and whether I should ask him about it.",13Jul2020,2

1. They want to come stay in my one bedroom apartment for 11 days with me and my partner. It’s not a larger apartment. 

2. They’ve asked me if I’m taking off work so I can spend time with them.  

3. They gave me a list of several places they HAVE TO visit.  The closest is a 2.5 hour drive oneway, the furthest is a 4 hour drive oneway (with no traffic) 

My friend doesn’t make a ton of money so gas experiences will likely fall on me not to mention the additional mileage.  And they can’t afford to rent a car to go out on their own.  Normally I’d just lend them my car but their driving history isn’t great. 

This is a good friend of mine, and they’re a really good person.  I’m honestly surprised by the lack of consideration.  I do want them to visit and have a good time but I don’t know how to tell them they’re asking for way too much with out making them feel bad or unwelcome.

708,"Hi all. Please can someone advise? My wife wants to home educate our children. She has joined social media groups, joined communities of home educators and is really pushing home school. I would rather our child receive a school education. So far my wife has been doing the lockdown home Ed which so far is a tablet with an app called reading eggs from time to time and TV. Hours and hours of TV. If I question it she becomes aggressive and says that home Ed is informal and captures a child’s interests as they develop naturally.
Now, I managed to find a sort of compromise of flexi school. Which was 4 days in school, one day out to go to educational attractions etc etc. My wife heard this as two days in school and tablet and tv the other 3. If I challenge it, it gets hostile and I get accused of all sorts.
Today our 5 year old asked if she could do more school, 4 days in a row. She wanted me to ask mummy as she didn’t want to ask mummy herself. So I recorded it on my phone. My wife hit the roof, convinced i orchestrated the recording and I was behind it all. I’m very worried her issues are going to be projected onto our daughters! Anyone know anywhere I can get advice?

711,"My girlfriend and I moved into our first apartment on July 1 in the town we both attended college in. Our roommate is a very smart post-doctorate international graduate student who has been living in the area for the last 6 months.

Last night we got home from a leisurely drive at about 12am, and our roommate, us having seemed to have gained his trust, began telling us about problems he has been having with the apartment, the landlord, and the town itself.

The first thing he told us was that someone pulled a gun on him as he walked home last night from the University. This was worrying enough as is.

He then started to tell us that he wasn't leaving the apartment because of the price, which is what he originally said, but because the landlord is extremely abusive. He went into detail about stories regarding the landlords abuse. Of which, summarized include; having airbnb strangers stay in someones rented room due to the fact that they aren't there; blaming tenants for the properties clear low-maintenance approach, the clear bias she shows towards international and domestic students, etc, I could go on and on.

Are we crazy to want to evacuate the premises immediately? We have not signed a lease yet but have paid first and last months and a security deposit, totaling around $2,500. Is there any chance we will ever see any of this money back?

I also feel very guilty about leaving the roommate here to fend for himself for the next month as his lease expires, because undoubtedly as soon as we leave the room will be again transferred into very low priced airbnb, with which im sure a cast of undesirable characters (he told us a lot about airbnb strangers) will be inhabiting.

So, a couple nights ago, my best friend and I decided to hang out. He told me we were hanging out at his ex girlfriend’s house (I had been living with him and his ex when they were dating, but then they broke up and my friend was moving out, so I decided to move out as well). Anyway, on the drive over he told me not to talk about their past relationship. But then he proceeded to play songs about guys who’d had their hearts broken. When we got there, I thought he was making occasional references to their relationship. He was also slapping her ass. I felt like because of the way they were acting with each other, I could say pretty much whatever I wanted to about that situation. So, at one point, I was trying to make a joke about how fucked up it would be if I tried to date my friend’s ex. I should’ve stopped there, but his girlfriend wanted to know what I was gonna say. I asked my friend if he knew what I was gonna say and he just told me to let it go. I brought it up one more time, but then I started feeling guilty. And when I feel guilty about something, I want to talk about it with the person who I feel I have wronged. But he didn’t want to talk about it, so we got into an argument. His ex literally went to bed, and we started there for a little while longer (he was playing a game on his phone, I was watching YouTube, occasionally we would say something to each other, more me than him, though). On the drive back to my place, we started singing songs together. I apologized again for crossing a line and he said “Don’f worry about it. Apologies are for people who’ve done something wrong.” And I also texted his ex the next day and she also said I did nothing wrong. But I feel like I’ve done something wrong. Advice?",13Jul2020,1

I’d be driving down from Wisconsin where I’ve been staying with my boyfriend for a month and a half. 

My dad says he doesn’t think all 40 people are going to be wearing masks. My uncle doesn’t really have the personality where he would wear one, in my opinion. And the weather predicts thunder storms for that day, so I imagine at least some of it (if not all) will have to be indoors.

729,"Background, and why I am even asking for advice on this.

I have pretty bad anxiety. I do have a therapist/medications. I am also an introvert and I like time to myself so even before COVID, I talked myself out of social situations very easily. As the great John Mulaney says, ""In terms of instant relief, cancelling plans is like heroin.""  I am worried this is my anxiety talking, and I don't want to be a wet blanket.


The trip was conceived a month or so ago. Its gonna be 6 or so of us to driving across the state, doing various ""cowboy life"" things and going to a rodeo. It kinda makes me sick thinking about it, but maybe it always would've. We live in Montana and there had been weeks in April and May where there were zero cases in our county and those surrounding. This didn't seem so crazy when we first planned it. My roommates and I are all nursing students and all work at the same hospital. No one is perfect but we have a good grasp on the seriousness of what is going on outside.


This month has really taken a turn in terms of Montana coronavirus. Almost every day at my work in the ER now there is someone who has COVID-19 or already knew that they did. And in a state that's pretty much totally open, this is bound to get worse. You all know. I don't need to tell you about what happens.


So, #I am wondering if regretfully (because I would regret missing the fun and the social times) saying that I won't  come on the road trip is the move to make.#  My biggest worry is that I am being a wet blanket. My second biggest worry is that it would look bad if I saw my boyfriend over the weekend, we are 100 miles apart and try to see eachother every weekend because we can't really on weekdays. So if they were gone, I'd probably go to his place.

730,"So this is mainly with my dad but with my mom too. I’m a 17 year old and I obviously live with them. My dad tends to get really angry about small things, like if I mis-speak something or if I read an email wrong or something. Most of the time the stuff he’s mad about is laughable, like for example once I told him to keep driving forward instead of saying straight and it spiraled into him yelling at me at the top of his lungs with my friend in the car. It’s like a switch flips, and he just gets extremely angry and it’s pretty scary.

Lately I’ve realized that whenever his car comes into the house I start feeling like somethings wrong and I always feel like something bad is happening even though I don’t know what it is. With my mom I’ve only felt it when I drive in the car but she’s just super uptight and always telling me what to do to the point that sometimes she’ll mess me up. (I’m fine with her in general though)  

The main reason im writing this post is because it’s been getting pretty bad over the last few weeks, and I just stayed home alone for three days and I felt amazing. Now they’re back and I don’t know why but just instantly I feel really stressed and like something bad is going to happen.

**TL;DR:** My mental health has never been worse so my doctor recommended I’d hang out with a group of friends. Loved the idea and decided to get together a group of seven. The more I think about it, the more I worry (I live in the states where corona is crazy). They said that they’re okay with staying outside but then I realized that we need to stay distanced. I talked to a close friend and she said they’ve been hanging out with others a lot (no masks, no distancing). I don’t know what to do.
_____________________________________________________________________________________

My mental health has never been worse. I’ve been overly anxious and have developed a depressive mood within the last couple months. I live in the United States so corona has been absolutely insane since mid March. I also haven’t seen friend or left the house (besides to see close family) since then. I had a checkup a couple weeks ago and they made me take a depression test (every teen has to). Let’s just say I didn’t score well and then broke down. She told me that a lot of people have been feeling like this and the best thing to do is to get some normality back into life. She suggested getting a group of friends together. We had been trying to get together before she suggested this but we could never find a date. Now that my birthdays coming up, I thought it would be a great idea.

I ended up asking and they all seemed pretty excited. We got the date, time, and place down pretty quickly. I was really excited but then I started to think more about it. Never once did I mention the guidelines. The next day I told them that we’d have to stay outside because of corona. They all seemed chill with this. The more I read about gatherings the more I realized that so much more needed to happen besides that. Most articles suggested social distancing (which I don’t think would be too hard) and wearing a mask. Telling people to wear a mask for many hours probably wouldn’t end well. Like, I’d be okay with doing it but that’s not going to work sadly. I texted a friend and she told me that they’ve (the group— not her) been with loads of other people while not wearing masks or social distancing and that they probably wouldn’t respect the six feet distance rule. Now I don’t know what to do. 

I really want to see people and they seemed so excited about it. I don’t want to let them down by canceling. I don’t want to cancel either because I’ve really been wanting to see friends. Also, I’ve always been known as this super serious person who doesn’t know how to have fun (or at least I think I am). I’m not excitable, I don’t show much emotion, and have serious RBF. I’m go with the flow (most of them time) but I’m not a huge party animal or anything (yay social anxiety). I’ve been trying to escape that and thought that this would be a good time to do so. But now I’m going to viewed as this super serious, boring person once again. But I’m trying to do this to protect my family. Besides my parents, my family is high risk. They are all older and some have diabetes. If they get it, it’s basically a death sentence. I can’t imagine living without any one of them but, on top of that, I could never live with myself if I was the one who killed them. Same with friends, if anything were to happen and somebody gets coronavirus (whether it’s from this get together or not) I’ll never be able to forgive myself. I’ll find a way to blame it on myself. I really don’t know what to do.",13Jul2020,1

I just said 'wtf is wrong with you' and left the chat, because they (especially the boy) are always doing and saying rude things like that, and I'm sick of it.

735,"Hey yall buckle up

I (M/30) have no money/no savings/no credit. I have a gambling addiction. I've probably lost $100K from the time I was 15. Great. I also have no job right now and have been collecting unemployment since March. In theory that's far from the worst thing going on in 2020 but in reality I've just been burning money and sitting on my hands in so much as making up my freaking resume, much less landing\_jobs.

OK. I have no degree but I do have 5+ years worked in commercial/industrial real estate property management/development and I was involved in some pretty neat stuff at times. Good experiences. I quit in 2018 over some dumb matters of principal I can't even remember. It was a bad situation for me and I don't regret leaving even though I was making $65K a year without a degree. My start in the field came as a teenager for my family and later for a larger group that had bought out the family portfolio. Since then I went to work smashing AutoCad for a civil engineer but absolutely hated every second. It was just the first thing available/convenient. The office shut down for COVID but I was offered my position back around Memorial Day but instead was like ""nah fuck it"". But I'm secretly hopeful I can parlay all this experience into something, fingers crossed right lads

I'm fortunate my living expenses are very low ($1400 a month in New Jersey.) I live in Dad's house but he lives 200 miles away so I'm alone with the gf. My feet are not to the fire to move out ASAP but it's going to be time to sell this house soon. GF has a 45-60 minute commute so I'd like to fully relocate to that area. We've got doggers too :)

Anyone relate to any of this? I've lived with addictionS, massive depression, diagnosed bipolar (no medication in 5+ years, also haven't spoken to my therapist since February) since the time I was a boy. It's rough out there. I'm pretty bright, at least I used to think so. Now I realize I'm an absolute bum and a 5X college dropout. I just never did anything. Enroll and lose focus. The strongest real positive I have going is physical fitness. I'm in the best shape of my life right now and on track to complete a full marathon in September. I'm up to 50 miles a week and stronger than ever. I'm off ALL drugs/booze. The gf is great, she wants a ring (ha!). I have some hobbies I'm passionate about. I do find ways to remind myself how to feel.

I could hit 10000 more sad sack fun facts but what's important for me is I remember where I was on this night 9 years ago. I was a bloodied suicidal wreck. I told myself that night we all get to make choices. No matter how things shook out I was choosing to never give up. Keep swinging. 9 years later and things are still rough for me, but we're breathing here. I'm not even completely underwater

I’m a gay male, 28. I’m also on the autism spectrum - but few people notice. I have many friends because many autistic people are often able to blend in. However, a lot of us still suffer in silence. 

Most of my close friends are heterosexual males. I recently lost a lot of weight and I am now significantly more attractive.

Since then, several of my “straight” friends have tried to hook with me. I didn’t realize how many of these guys are sexually fluid. Now I don’t know what to do. This is causing me to panic. I can not handle these social dynamics. 

To make things more complicated - I have also learned from these guys that they have done a few sexual things with some of our other friends too. (They usually only talk about these things with me one-on-one because they’re embarrassed.)

I wish they never told me this stuff. Now I feel very uncomfortable and jealous. I don’t understand how to deal with these emotions and these social dynamics. I can barely manage normal social situations as it is. I am especially jealous of my best friend Mark. 

These guys really, really like being around me, especially Mark. Not all of them do “gay” things with one another. And apparently it has only happened on very few occasions. 

I don’t want to lose Mark - but I am now so jealous of when he is with other friends. I mean, we see each other more than he hangs out with his other friends - but o am still so jealous. We even sleep in the same bed with one another several times a week. How am I still jealous? I don’t even like him like that...

lately i’ve been thinking, and i’ve come to a harsh realization. 

maybe i’m not living for myself anymore.

i’ve lost joy in the things i used to love and it’s scaring me. journaling, drawing, listening to music. they all seem pointless to me now. it’s scary because these things all brought light and joy into my life. to have that taken away from me is a feeling that is unfamiliar— it’s frightening. 

i feel like i’m not really living my life anymore. i’m living it the way others want me to. all my passions and my aspirations are gone, and i’m living based off of people’s expectations of me. but it’s even hard to do that because i don’t have the internal motivation to do so since it’s not sincerely something that i want to do, but rather what others want me to do. i cant find any goals to try and reach, or anything i want to achieve. i’m going with the flow of life and it’s sad. i watch my peers dream something larger and work hard to make it reality while i’m just here, doing nothing. 

i can confidently say i lost my love for my life. i don’t want to do anything anymore, i just want to wallow away and see where the world takes me. i no longer want to try. i’m just living because i have to. 

i’ve lost myself somewhere, somehow. 

this whole time i’ve been drowning myself in games and youtube videos to distract myself. it’s certainly unhealthy and i spend hours a day doing these things. it’s detrimental to my both my mentality and my health, but i can’t seem to stop indulging in these things. what can i say? it’s easy satisfaction because i don’t have to work hard for anything when doing these activities. 

i keep lying to myself, saying every night that things will be better for me in the morning. i’ll wake up feeling refreshed, like a new person, but it never happens. instead, i wake up and stare at the ceiling, wondering what the hell im doing with my life and i stay there all day, not paying attention to the important things i have to do in my life. 

everyday, life just flashes by in a blur. it’s already been half the year and i haven’t done anything for myself that will help or benefit me. this quarantine isnt helping either, as it is only helping me continue to engage in this unhealthy environment. 

i desperately want to fix myself, but i don’t know how. i dont usually reach out for help, or talk about my problems to anyone because i don’t want to seem like a burden, but i feel like my thoughts have overcome me and i’m lost.

He speaks to them over on xbox which is the other place i have been checking. 

I get this sense of relief when i see he is in a party on xbox and is playing with his mates because i know he must be feeling okay in order to play, right?

I feel dumb for even asking but i just dont know what to do. Im so sad at the thought that hes sat wondering about me or crying over me but surely hes not.

&amp;#x200B;

I ask myself why i even care as even if he were to be crying over me, theres nothing i can do. He will get over it. He is just such a close friend of mine that i would feel this way about anyone.",13Jul2020,1

766,"Hi all, I’m 26 years old (female) and have been dating my Bf (25 year old male) for almost two years.Although we come from two completely different backgrounds and ethnic groups but we make it works. His family is very different from mine but I really don’t mind,we don’t judge. Lately,however,his mom has been really testing my character.See,she believes COVID-19 is a hoax.She even wants to go to the parliament to protest laws that say people must wear a mask.She is also encouraging people not to shop at business were social distancing is prioritized.She also claims that healthcare workers aren’t doing anything and that there is no workload.

As the daughter of a nurse this really fucks me up to the highest.Everyday,I worry about my mother’s safety and suffer from severe anxiety because of that. many of my nurse and doctor friends have contracted covid and my friend lost his dad (perfectly healthy)to it. I am shaking as I am typing this because I can’t believe anyone can be that stupid to invalidate such a powerful virus. I am waiting for the day she will say that my brothers autism is caused by vaccines 💉 as she is an anti vaxxxer as well.

767,"29 years old and I currently work a full-time job while living with my parents in NYC.

After a lot of reflecting, I realized this city isn’t for me for both financially and personal reasons. For one, NY is just too expensive for me and I’m still trying to figure out what career I want to get into. I work for FedEx in their offices only making slightly above minimum wage. I’m considering getting a second job when COVID slows down.

Also personally, NYC is geared towards more extroverted people who are career-orientated. Basically I suffer from Asperger’s and social anxiety, this city is too overwhelming for me sometimes. It doesn’t make any sense to pay for a premium price in a city if you’re not taking advantage of anything here.

I pay rent for my family and while it’s not much ($1K a month). I’m saving up to $25K in regards to a potential relocation.

My parents aren’t happy with my plans however, as they revealed they want my brother and I to inherit the house we’ve lived in. But truth be told, I have no desire to plant roots in NYC and I’m wondering if I’m not thinking rationale about wanting to move.

There are also other reasons such as bad memories and wanting to just experience other places for awhile before settling down. The constant arguments with my family are exhausting every time this conversation comes up.",13Jul2020,1

Finally hung out this past weekend again and it was great. Then the following night I got really really drunk (haven’t been drinking a lot the past year and had way too much this night) and unknowingly hooked up with someone else like didn’t even remember the next day. I was honest about it and apologized many times but he was very upset which is completely understandable. He was willing to try at first but then said he wouldn’t be able to forget it. I actually want to be with him and see how things work out bc i know how special he is (i just have commitment issues yet usually have no problem being loyal even just while we’re getting to know each other so i have no clue why i did this) but I also want to give him space and time right now. He hasn’t unfollowed on socials and our last conversation ended very maturely, wishing each other the best.

769,"So I fucked up pretty much. I would call other girls cute and I would say I love them, but in a way that was like a good friend and I really meant it that way. But obviously when my girlfriend found out about it, she was not happy. I defended my actions thinking I didn't do anything wrong but I never really considered despite me knowing I wasn't intentionally trying to be unfaithful, what I said still hurt her.

This was over a month of torment for her and she flipped. She screamed. I took time to myself after that and I eventually just had it click, I really was a shitty person. I never had bad intentions but I just didn't listen to her. I just didn't want to admit I did the things I did but now, I feel terrible. She has told me she doesn't see me the same way anymore and she will look at me and just feel sadness. In a week she will decide if she want's to work things out now that I am sorry for everything, or just end it all forever. Idk why I agreed to this but just thinking there is a slither of hope I thought would help but now I'm feeling sick, crying and just feeling regret for everything all day everyday I can't cope.

770,"My best friend is getting married mid September and I [F23] am one of five bridesmaids. When the pandemic began in March, I was very supportive of whatever decision her and her fiancé made regarding the wedding, assuming rates of infection would slow/improve by September. At the time I don’t think anyone thought their wedding would be significantly impacted. I also thought if things got worse, they would have no choice but to reschedule. I know they discussed rescheduling, but her fiancé was especially against it. And so they announced the wedding is on no matter what. 

Now come July, cases in the US are much worse and they are still determined to go through with it. I am much more concerned now about being exposed to so many people. My mother is at risk and I cannot socially distance from her for two weeks post wedding. I’m not only worried for myself, but her guests, family, rest of wedding party, any crew catering, etc. Btw, bride and groom are in their early to mid 20s. 
In their defense, they have limited their guest list to about 50, uninviting out of state guests, yet two ppl in the wedding party are out of state and still coming. Both ceremony and reception are outside and they will social distance tables and seating. Governor said no bars or dance floors can open even at weddings, but they said the venue will still allow us to dance just on the lawn and distanced(?). They are also NOT requiring masks. Because it’s outside and people won’t listen anyway is their logic. 

I told her I have to reconsider going at all because it is causing me more stress and anxiety than excitement and while they think they can have the wedding they want safely, I think it is in their best interest and everyone else’s to postpone. Also while the changes they made are great, I still have other concerns about things like bathrooms, getting ready, taking wedding party photos, eating, how we are being served, everyone using one mic during speeches, what if it rains? etc. etc. It’s July and I think they are relying on it being outdoors and social distancing alone. I especially don’t understand not requiring masks. 

For more context, we live in a state that was hit hard in March, quickly shut down, and did not reopen early. So, luckily, we are not experiencing huge spikes in cases like so many in US right now. That makes me feel a little better, but there are still cases and deaths in our state nonetheless and I am worried that schools will reopen and cases will increase right around their wedding date. I’m struggling to justify putting anyone at risk even if it is low or moderate. 

I felt like an asshole letting her know all of my concerns and telling her I possibly won’t go, but I know she understood where I was coming from. She told me they’ll come up with a more detailed plan which I really appreciated. At this point, I can choose to go and social distance best I can, only go to ceremony and skip reception, or not go at all. I really don’t want to miss her day and I would like to attend reception. I trust bride and groom, but don’t trust their guests especially if masks aren’t required or at very least encouraged. I feel like they are putting everyone in a really unfortunate, uncomfortable situation. At same time, I am only one of few who have brought this up to them. I don’t think their family is as concerned. Other bridesmaids have said they are comfortable standing at ceremony and taking pics without masks. So will I be only one wearing a mask? Am I being over dramatic ?? Because it’s outside and I can wear a mask, I should be fine ? I literally don’t know what to do or think anymore. 

TL;DR I’m in an outdoor wedding in September that’s been limited to ~50 guests, masks not required, and with US COVID cases rising I am worried and have no idea if I should trust them and attend like normal or protect me and my family’s health.",13Jul2020,1
771,"I have a very unhealthy mindset that I simply can't tell anyone IRL. But I desperately need someone to tell me, and explain to me that I'm wrong.

So in other words, please ""snap me out of it"" so to speak.

I'm turning 25 in 4 months and have practically zero dating experience, and every, single, one of my friends(all male) are in the same boat. Even on reddit hundreds upon hundreds of men have the same experience. 

Meanwhile I feel like women my age have probably had boyfriends after boyfriends since they were like 16 without much effort, and that they got these relationship experience by simply being female. Not to mention all the FWBs or hookups they might have had.... 



I am just so, so jealous of women when it comes to dating. It was a 50/50 chance, and I lost the coin toss. I don't really think I hate them, I just hate the fact that I'm not one of them. Had I been a woman, I would have been in a relationship right now, and would have had a lot of fun when I was younger because opportunities will practically be served to me on a silver platter everyday as a woman.

I've tried to change my view by reading other people thoughts online, like posts on r/changemyview by people sharing my mindset. But pretty much everything I've read reinforced that my view is ""correct"".

Never tried dating apps myself, but looking at tinder statistics on r/dataisbeautiful. 
https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/ctq357/tinder_over_3_years_1821_male_oc/
https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/cuazgf/oc_my_tinder_experience_as_a_24f_living_in/

The only thing I feel is ""Wow, being is woman must be amazing"".

Half the men on r/askmen are virgins (https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1t36hw/at_what_age_did_you_lose_your_virginity/), while looking through r/askwomen, pretty much everyone had experience.

subreddits like r/foreveralone, r/virgin are dominated by men. And try searching stuff like ""20s virgin"", almost all the posts are posted by men. For the very few posts made by women, the OP is either religious, a lesbian, ""never interested"", ""made out with a few guys"", or had people ask them out but said no.  Single men/virgin men probably outnumber women by idk 10:1

Looking through the relationship statuses on facebook, a lot of guys have ""single"" as their status. However I never see a woman have ""single"" as their relationship status, it's either ""in a relationship"" or that it's hidden.

And on r/changemyview, I just feel like people don't have a valid argument against ""women have it easy in dating"", and simply just change the topic to something else, like safety, in their rebuttal.

And I'm not even mentioning all these studies on dating apps that I've read online.

Just thinking about things like this is making me feel incredibilly frustrated. The is so serious that sometimes, when I see a woman, hear a woman's voice, or saw a woman post on reddit, the first thing that I think of is that ""she's probably had been in a bunch of relationships.. how nice"" or something similar to that. I am losing sleep, and losing motivation to do anything because of this. I can't bear with the fact that while many men and I are struggling in this area, women and a small minority of men are having the time of their lives.

Sometimes when I am feeling down, I even spend time in front of my computer, down voting posts made by women, or blocking female reddit users to make myself feel better, and I just want to stop.",13Jul2020,1

I can’t go home - it’s not a choice, it’s a necessary step to keep me safe. I learned the first time that my parents won’t protect me, so I have to protect myself.

Through a long line of friends of friends I found a nanny job. pays decent, and i work 40 hours a week. I watch the kids at their home while their parents also work from home because their parents have health risks. I’m greatful to have a job right now and I plan on going back to college, the money from my job is to help pay for food and just have some extra spending money for the year. Anyways, I work at their home while the parents are home. And let me paint you a picture, these parents are like the worst type of millennial. (no shade) but they have a parenting style where the kids can do whatever they want. The word “no” is not supposed to exist, and discipline isn’t really an option especially when the parents are right in front of me. I work 8-4 everyday. They don’t make these kids take naps (2 year old and 10 month old). Most nights they tell me they let them stay up til midnight or later. They make me take them on at least two walks a day even tho it is about 100-101 degrees out. the two year old likes to hit and throw things at the 10 month old but the mom just kinda laughs it off and doesn’t do anything about it. I’m exhausted. I don’t think i get paid enough but i feel so awful just quitting on them when i know the family has had a hard time securing childcare during this pandemic.

I don't exactly know what happened after she left, but apparently the girl upstairs was on some serious drugs, and often disputed with her boyfriend (at one point we heard her threaten to hurt herself - thus the calling of mental health hotline) which at times resulted in throwing things around.

After about a month of exhausting on boarding issues I started working on my first task and am so lost.  I don't even know what questions to ask.  The one person that is assigned to help me makes me feel dumb every time I ask questions.  I talked to my manager about how I feel inadequate and she talked to my team.

I hate asking for help anyways because I'm a man and am prideful and try to be independent.  But the issue now is I feel emotionally abused going to work everyday.  I've found that work seems to make me feel like I suck at everything which leads me to video games.  I know video games are okay in small portions but the more I feel worthless at work the more I try to play games that I am good at to counter the feeling because I get doses of ""You're good at something"".

798,"In February I booked a cruise out of NY at the end of September, which got cancelled in April, so I booked another out of Miami instead for the same time of year. That one has also been cancelled, so I now have 2 round trip plane tickets to Miami for a week in September/October. I can't just go and quarantine when I get back, my job wouldn't be able to do without me. So essentially I can't go. We had trip insurance but of course it doesn't cover cancellations due to the virus.

What can I do? I've never bought plane tickets before so I don't really know my options. I haven't been in contact with the airline yet as I really don't know what I'd even be asking.

Could this be legit? The tests look old with marks and an old version of a discontinued model.

Could someone please advise?

801,"First off, this is long so I'm sorrz I just never talked about it before. 

So There was this girl, over a a year ago we became extremely good friends. I was broken and so was she, we helped each other. She was always there when I needed her and I started falling for her. However another girl came into my life at the same time. She was hot but malicous and deeply toxic, I was so starved for attention and affection that I got into a relationship with her, misinterpretating my need for affection with love. One day there was a stuppid argument and she gave me an ultimatum, her or the girl I was friends with (for convinience sake let's call her Emily).

 I made a horrible call and broke off all contact with Emily on order to keep my relationship. She needed me and I needed her, I knew that and still made my choice. I was a scumbag and I despise myself for it. Fastforward to now. THings ended with the toxic bitch and everything came crashing down like 8 months ago. I am in a new relationship with a beautiful and loving girl that I adore more than anzýone else in the world. I recently texted Emily again telling her what kind of asshole I was and that I miss talking to her because we had such a great friendship. She actually answered and told me that she misses it too and that she was never hurt the way I hurt her. 

To this day I hate myself for making such a genuinely good person suffer. I cant stop thinking about her and I dont know if its because I miss the friendship or because I wish I would've gone with her all that time ago, I just dont know what to do, how can I forget the first girl I ever actually fell in love with. I love my girlfriend but this is just all so confusing. Please help me,  also give me all the hate you want, I deserve it.",13Jul2020,1
802,"Title say most of it. I was laid off at the beginning of June and have been on unemployment which has made things pretty comfortable. But that seems to be ending at the end of this month and I have no problem looking for a job.

Only problem is I only graduated May 2019 with a BS in mechanical engineering. I did co-ops while I was in school so my resume has some experience but nothing shows I'm willing to stay for the king term. 

Looking online for jobs I see limited postings that fit my qualifications and, after not getting anything but a standard email saying they have found someone else for the positions, I decided to email one of the recruiters and see why my multiple applications at that company were passed up and not at least gotten an interview. They were actually really helpful but it gave some concerning news. They told me how their selection process works and also the number of applications they received. That number was over 150 for the positions I applied to. 

So now I keep looking for postings but with little luck finding something in my wheel house and have little confidence my resume will shine above 150 others. Plus to add to the stress my wife is due in December and I have no idea when things will get better. 

All of this has made me feel depressed and I don't know what else to do other than look at jobs that I probably won't get an interview for.",13Jul2020,1

While the store help(she's also the cashier; she's basically the only one working in the store because it's a small corner store.) was attending to me, a lot of other people came and started asking for her help and all that.
 
 She probably got overwhelmed and gave me incomplete change. I didn't want to tell her about this so that I wouldn't further overwhelm her or stress her out. 

   When I got home and have my mom the change, she noticed that the amount of money I spent compared to what I bought was strange. I told her that there was an increase in the prices probably due to the falling economy (because of corona).

But the thing is that, I could have used the remaining change the worker didn't give me to buy much more snacks.  Especially because my mom is currently not working and we are trying to manage money. 

I feel so guilty because I lied to my mom and also because I feel like I wasted her hard earned money that we are managing.

I’ve been bringing it up since I started the whole college admissions process and my parents have tried to steer me away from it since the beginning. I mentioned that I was interested in poli sci and my dad said “ok maybe but i need to see a business plan for the future.” I’ve brought it up with my mom repeatedly and she always says something along the lines of that’s a useless degree why would you want to do that?

I’m not sure whether I’ll do law school in the future or go on to do research but I’ll definitely do something that provides job security with my degree and it’s not a decision I’m making on a whim.

They let my sister major in journalism because her school has co-ops built in to the curriculum and their uncertainty about her degree went away pretty quickly because of that. My school doesn’t have that so the uncertainty may last a bit longer.

I feel bad bc they are paying my college education in full and I am extremely thankful for that, but I feel like that should not guide what I major in.

I've been going out of my way to socialize her as best I can, but if any visitors are over, she crawls up onto their chest/shoulders/lap for sleeping/attention, something she NEVER does with me.

821,"So I live in a rough area. We live on the outskirts so it's not so bad, people have it worse, but we still come under the area name for the poor area, and I had never had any qualms about my home. My parents worked very hard their whole lives to achieve (on mortgage ofc) this home, and its fairly sized for where I live. I don't know, it's never been something I thought about. It's my house, I live in it 🤷. My mum takes good care of it, and we keep it clean and tidy and have a pretty garden. 

Now I'm at university. I've made friends with some people, and they are honestly the most lovely people, and I know that they don't care, the richest of them even seeming ashamed of it and neglecting to talk about it ever because they don't want to be seen for their parents wealth. I want to make clear two things: 1) they are wonderful, and amazing friends. Super kind people, and I know in reality that they won't care at all. They're humble and don't care about wealth as far as I can tell. 2) i don't care about their wealth, I really don't care. They're just my friends and their upbringing and such is none of my business, I have the natural slight jealousy at some of their nice things that I think anyone would have, but in the big picture I don't care I can sort myself out, I have my own income w/e we' re all adults.

However, they're all wealthy, and I don't think they've ever been inside the house of someone who wasn't born rich/well off. I'm having some of them over soon, and even though I really really know they don't care and I love them to pieces, I feel embarrassed. I don't want to feel embarrassed, my parents worked hard and I love my home. But at the same time... I do. I can't help it, its this niggling pang of feeling apologetic that they will be in my house when they aren't maybe used to being in the house of a struggling family.

 I think I'm just not accustomed to it. All my friends from round my area; we're all basically exactly the same income and such. And now im at university, and I suddenly feel very aware that I come from the poorest family of them, and I'm the least adjusted to being in wealthy areas and hearing complaints about home life and neighbourhoods that only wealthy people would complain about and wouldn't even cross my mind. Its something they won't be aware of at all because to them it's all normal and I think I'm pretty good at not saying anything and just doing something else because I can't really input when they're complaining about guest houses and pools and discussing their next holiday to the other side of the world and pet horses when I can barely afford to go camping. [to be clear, they are NOT showing off when they talk about these things. They're just talking, the way anyone talks about anything. I'm not exactly gonna be like can you not talk about your lives, that be dumb, they're doing nothing wrong

I also have way stricter parents and they seem to have much more lax parents; they're friends with their mums and dads, and my mum and dad (I love them and I'm fine with it) will forever act like my mum and dad rather than see me as a fellow adult.

I’m going to try and make this as short and simple as I can.                                                                                    I’m 30, my husband is 33, and he has 2 brothers that are a few years younger than he is. We recently had to move into his parents house (thanks a lot COVID). His parents are very nice which I am grateful for, but they are a little odd about certain things. So it’s just us and his parents.                                                                        I’m having a hard time getting used to all of this.         OF course one his brother’s significant other is a real a-hole. She constantly treats me and my spouse like we are not there and she is so weird. She is freakishly obsessed with her 2 giant dogs and will sit on the floor and talk to them while ignoring me and my husband. She only talks about her dogs and treats them like royalty. At holiday parties, she legit lays on the floor spooning her dogs and whispers in their ears like a lunatic. No one says anything or even seems to bat an eye. I feel like I’m on crazy pills or something.  She claims she loves all dogs, but I saw her shove my 10 pound poodle once. She hates my dog and I keep my poodle away from her when she is here.             Whenever they visit, she will say hello to his parents but flat out ignores us. His brother is so kind and always gives me a hug. I always have to be the one to say hello to her and she either pretends she doesn’t hear me, or just says hello without even looking at me. They are getting married in 2 months (oh joy), and I know I’m going to be seeing a lot of her unfortunately. I have known her now for like 6 years, and she never once has asked me anything about my life. I always have to be the one to initiate any conversation, and when I do she acts so annoyed and put off. His brother is very nice, but he is clearly whipped by this chick.      She is so type-A and is a control freak.                          My husband and I helped them move into their first apartment and she did nothing but scream and cry about EVERYTHING. She snapped at me for putting a box in the wrong room. I wanted about to punch her in the throat.                                                                                My in laws never gossip or have anything to say about anyone(at least not when I’m around), but I noticed my mother in law did kind of slip up by mentioning how anytime they visit for a holiday they only stay for a few hours and then always leave to see her side of the family. (I feel guilty like maybe it’s because me and my husband are here, so she tries to bolt out of here, and his poor brother just does whatever she tells him.) Literally the only thing this witch ever asks me about is when we are moving and she has to know where exactly we plan to move to. (I can’t tell if she is making digs at me since we were on our own and due to financial hardship are back home with his parents, or what her deal is.) They of course have a lot of money (she was adopted into a rich family and got her out of state college tuition paid for....) and are habitual one uppers about everything. They have a nice new house in the city, amazing careers, go on lavish vacations, own a freaking peloton, etc... Their wedding of course just has to be better than ours, they are going on the same honeymoon we did but are staying at a 5 star resort, the list goes on and on.                                                       I have noticed she is way nicer to his youngest brother and will actually carry a conversation with him and his girlfriend, but does not act like that to us. My husband struggled with depression and has been hospitalized a ton for it which also lead us to be where we are at currently.                                                                         The only other thing I can think is maybe I made a bad joke at one time that she took the wrong way, I honestly don’t know. My in laws are very dry, quiet and awkward people. My family is the total opposite and I try to be funny at times to liven things up, and no one would laugh. The only jokes they are into are dad jokes and popsicle stick jokes that are so awful but you have to force yourself to laugh.

849,"Hi all,

As the title says, I think I may be a ‘functioning alcoholic’. My parents have always liked to drink, my mother probably drinks at least a bottle of wine a day so I didn’t really see it as a problem when I would get a bottle of wine to myself. I am asking for advice because I don’t know if I actually need help (since I still function) and if I do, where would I get it? I am sorry if this is long but I just want to first describe my relationship with alcohol to see if anyone can relate.

For some context, I am 24, female and I’m in the first year of my PhD. I have suffered with depression and anxiety for a long time and I would say I probably have an addictive personality. I smoke weed daily and drink regularly. The thing is, no one notices because I get through life quite well. I have a Bachelors and a Masters degree both at the highest classification and was admitted to my PhD with unconditional acceptance. The whole time I was smoking daily and drinking regularly. I find that weed actually helps so it is not something I want to stop (it’s a little pricey but hey). Alcohol, on the other hand, seems purely detrimental.

It is really 50/50 in terms of how alcohol affects me. Sometimes I am fine (love to sing and dance around), other times it causes me to be cripplingly depressed. The last time this happened, I ended up taking a load of tablets which luckily didn’t do anything. If I am sad, I will drink, if I am bored, I will drink, if I am celebrating, I will drink. It’s gotten to the point where I will sit on my bedroom floor swigging a bottle of wine just scrolling through reddit. Other times, I’m coding stuff for my work while swigging a bottle of wine. If I have a meeting with my supervisor where I was less nervous than usual, I will “celebrate” with a bottle of wine. Once I have the one bottle, I will find myself craving another (even taking glasses of my father’s whiskey which I absolutely hate). 

I guess what I am saying is that alcohol is only a problem because I feel like I am becoming dependent on it and it can make me do dangerous, stupid things. I want to stop but I am not sure where to start because technically, it’s not actually a problem (yet). Does anyone have any advice where to start? It is not as simple as “just don’t buy it” because I always end up buying it and regretting it when I’m slumped over the toilet seat at 2am.",13Jul2020,1
850,"I have been wanting to adopt a cat for some time however my mum and sister have told me I shouldn’t. 

Their reason is that I live alone, and work 5 shifts, 8 hours at a time. I have tried to explain my intention is to adopt and older, possibly less human friendly cat, or less mobile cat, that would be comfortable during this time.. and that simply having another existence around me would make ME more comfortable too. 

I have been nervous about going through with it because of this. I’ve been treated like I will neglect the cat. They have also questioned my ability to afford it, despite my explaining that since going sober a month ago, I have gained £350 disposable income and would happily pay out £150/m for said kitty. (Insurance, food and litter and toys and treats.. anything else)

Technically I only have a community garden but if the cat is wanting to roam (after getting comfortable with me) I’ll happily take the time to introduce it to the neighbourhood safely, make sure they know where home is and never leave them out over night or while I’m at work. I have even been growing dozens of plants for months to get myself into a routine of caring for another existence.

Ever since this work has started he's been making comments that make me feel not so nice as well. I smile and laugh and go back to whatever.

So bit of a backstory me(18M) and my GF(17F) have been together about a year we met at our karate class(about 3 years ago) and we’ve clicked since and been dating for about a year so I decided to introduce her to my younger brothers before the rest of my family, since I’m very close with them (16)(14)(13) I arranged it for when my older brother(19) was out cause I don’t get on with him 
So I brought her over and we all chilled in the living room just chilling and playing video games and drinking alchohol so late on in the evening my older brother came back pissed off I had set him up to get caught smoking by my dad ( my dad is really cool and doesn’t care about drink but he would never let us take drugs or smoke) 

when I told him to stop he told me to fuck off and dislocated my arm and beat the shit out of me leaving me bruised all across my shoulder and stomach(my Gf saw it and got suspicious but I told her I got hurt during karate practice which she didn’t believe cause she usually spares with me and though she wipes the floor with me she doesn’t hit hard enough and in that way to leave those kind of marks)

I handnt told anyone in my family about dating my gf so he didn’t even know so he came how and when he walked in he didn’t see her so when he walked up the stairs and saw me emerging from the bathroom started screaming at me and full on attacked me twisting my arm really painfully(my older brother used to do karate but he quite a while back) and hitting me in the same places as before my gf ran up and saw and pushed him away from me but he just pushed her away and punched me full force in the face well when he came to do it again my gf blocked his punch and hit him in the face as hard as she could giving a bloody nose then twisting his arm till she dislocated his shoulder and proceeded to push him into one of the rooms upstairs 

She then proceeded to yell at him if he ever touches me she’d break his jaw.after that she cleaned me up cause I had a bloody nose and was in pain so we left the house and went to her place where I’ve stayed for the last few days 

My parents are due back in a couple days and I have no idea how to resolve this or what to do I’ve talked to my gf about it and I’m not really mad at her for what she did caused she explained the impulse to me and it makes sense but I have no clue how to resolve this any help is appreciated 
(My younger bro’s don’t think less of her in fact they are kinda happy she did that cause my oldest brother is a bit of a diсk)
(Also my parents love him the most and I really don’t want them to find out about my gf this way ,especially cause my dad woudnt like the concept of me dating someone who can beat me in a fight)

TLDR at the bottom

Okay so I (21y/f) and my boyfriend (24y/m) were hanging out the other day and we got a little.... horny. And one thing led to another but we were in the car at a public park, being stubborn little horndogs no one was around so we figured why not? We knew it was too open (and in broad daylight) to have sex but we figured a little touching couldn’t hurt. We ended up both trying to finish ourselves off, and unfortunately because I did first he was still going. Now it’s been about 15 minutes and I’m trying to help him keep lookout, and we didn’t see a car pull up a few spots down from us but after a minute we noticed a lady staring at us in disgust. He quickly stopped, we pretended like we were just doing something else, and after two or three minutes playing it off (it felt like eternity) we drove off. She was on her phone by then. Not sure if she got our license plate, we feel extremely guilty, embarrassed, and dumb. Like we know it was an awful idea and a stupid thing to do. We don’t have a place to do that kind of stuff so when it’s in the moment we kind of lose our heads. My boyfriend feels absolutely sick and we won’t be doing ANYTHING like this ever again, is there any way we are going to get in trouble? I’m so scared, every knock on my door makes me think it’s the cops here to arrest me. Please help, I know what we did was wrong and we would never do it ever again.

859,"
Okay so my boyfriend (20 M) and I (19F) have been dating since 8th grade. We are now both rising juniors in college. My bf, we can call him P, has two sisters one older one younger. The older one had already moved out and the younger one lives with his mom and himself. 

When we first started dating, I met his family and everything went great until his older sister found out. She became extremely jealous and put immense stress and pressure on him, his other sister and his mom to make him break up with me. Since it was in the beginning of our relationship, and it was both our first relationship, he fell into that and chose to let her come in between us. She insulted me behind my back even saying she would hit me but was nothing but nice to my face. 

Anyways, our paths crossed again about half a year later and we decided to give it another shot. At this time that same older sister who is pretty toxic has distanced herself from their family and left their mom in a lot of debt. And even left them with her three cats to take care of even though they are allergic? She even cursed out their own mother for not wanting to give her more money. 

Miraculously, however, she comes back to the family earlier this year to “make amends” and “Apologise”. But she made it a point to apologise to everyone except for me. All the While she was incredibly rude and even referred to me as “it” at one point. Obviously this really bothered me because I felt disrespected and she wants to pretend nothing ever happened. And so does my boyfriend who wants to just “move on” despite knowing how strongly I feel. He says he respects my feelings but should just let it go. 

I move on from a lot of things and I let things go, but this is different because it is a big deal to me. On one hand, I understand she is my boyfriend’s sister and I don’t really want to get in between that. But on the other, I feel like I deserve an apology which feels irrelevant to everyone in the situation except myself. 

Update: he spoke to her and she refuses to apologise telling him I should grow up and move on

Lately, he’s been reaching out to me, and telling me how much he’s been drinking again. He’s even passed out once and it required him to get stitches on his face.

I'm told multiple times a week to not run orders that are due within the next few days in favor for an order that'll fill the line and make good numbers.

I, like a lot of guys have been addicted to porn since puberty.

I've been trying to become pornfree for a while now, my wife and I have been together for 6 years, but only married recently. She has known about my porn addiction in the past, paticularly 2 years ago when it really blew up and she caught me on a NSFW anonymous chat site. That was the lowpoint of out relationship. After that, I tried online therapy which ultimately failed. Then we just kinda moved on without my issue really being addressed or solved.

After we got married, I felt very motivated to renew my attempt at pornfree, I've been trying to work out, meditate, limit my internet use, I read ""Your Brain on Porn"" in its entirety.

I feel like the biggest missing piece of the puzzle to my recovery is my wife. I really haven't mentioned my addiction since the thing two years ago, I'm afraid that by bringing it up, I'll be opening up old wounds and bringing her pain. Plus she's out of work so I don't want her spending all day worrying about me without anything else to keep her busy. For these reasons I've let myself suffer in silence. 

When we last addressed this 2 years ago, I kinda got the impression she didn't really believe in porn addiction, which did not help me. I'm considering getting her a copy of ""Your Brain on Porn"" to read so she can understand the provden science behind this addiction.

My hope was that I could become pornfree in secret and just return to a happy life without ever bringing it up, but I'm not sure if that's possible.

Hi guys, as the the title says I hate exercise. I dont like watching or playing sports nor am I at all a competitive person. I dont enjoy walking or running. I hate keeping up with the dietary and exercise routines. Like food journals and keeping up with how much water I need to drink. It just seems like extra stress that I dont want.


 I never liked the idea of going to the gym. I'd rather do it at home. I've tried to establish a workout and dietary routine before but it always failed. I've tried starting full force with 100% intensity and I've tried slowly incorporating exercise. I've tried walking with and without weights, pushups, sit ups, crunches, and many others. 

I looked into intermittent fasting and I'm not sure on it. Some say it works great. Some say it doesnt work at all. And some say it's actually dangerous to do, so I'm really unclear on that.

I've tried looking online for advice but all I see are articles and posts that say what all motivational speakers say. ""You gotta believe in yourself and work hard blah blah blah."" All that means nothing to me. I need real and helpful advice. I'm, by definition, morbidly obese and I'd hate to look back in 10 or so years and think, ""if only I had started working out back then.""

I've tried those ""diet pills"" but after one time of use I never used them again because I dont like how they feel and they dont change the underlying problem that I have. 

I guess you could say that I'm lazy but I think that is a shallow answer that isnt helpful. It's more so that I dislike every aspect of working out and dieting. It seems to suck the fun out of everything. If I want to enjoy a meal with my family I have to be all like ""does it have this or that in it?"" Or I cant enjoy the food I traditionally like. 


Also I hate HAVING to do something which is exactly how I feel about exercise and dieting. It feels like a prison sentence. I feel the same way about working as well. The day before I have to go back to work is always dreadful because I know that I'm going to essentially waste a day doing almost nothing when I could be enjoying myself elsewhere. I even feel this way about brushing and flossing my teeth. Although since it takes less than 5 minutes and I can immediately go and do whatever I want to do afterwards, brushing and flossing doesnt really bother me. If work and exercise were the same way then I'd have no issue. Dieting, exercising, and working are so inconvenient for me but I know its necessary.

Please give me real advice and not the ""believe in yourself and work hard"" speech I've heard a million and a half times. I'm beginning to worry that I will never be a healthy weight because I just cant find any help in this department. I dont want to lose all hope but it's getting harder to hold onto.",13Jul2020,1
870,"So I’m F19 and my best friend is F20.  She’s like a sister to me, my family sees her as part of our family as well, it’s the same the other way around etc.

First off, I think this is pretty important to the story - she’s EXTREMELY insecure about her looks. She always complains about her weight since she’s on the chubbier side and basically hates every part of her body. I’m very comfortable in my skin and content with my appearance.

These past few months, like most people in quarantine, I’ve gained a few pounds. I’m still considerably slim but nevertheless it’s somewhat visible if you knew me beforehand. Now I don’t care about such things too much until my best friend pointed it out a few times. I usually don’t mind my friends pointing out ‘negative’ changes about my appearance like a fucked up haircut I gave myself or my new glorious fat rolls when I’m sitting down but her comments always have a bitter and hateful undertone. Like the other day we were hanging out with our girl friend group (quarantine is over in Austria lol) and somehow got to the topic of cellulite and stretch marks. Out of the blue my so called best friend said ‘I think you and *other friends name* have quite a bit of cellulite on your asses’ and pointed at me and said friend. I openly shared that I indeed have cellulite on my ass, even showed it and said that I don’t really mind it since it’s natural. She then had the audacity to say ‘nah I mean stretch marks are whatever but cellulite is a no go for me. I think it’s AWFUL’. I got irritated and said that if one genuinely thinks there’s anything wrong with cellulite they’re terribly immature. She went on and basically bashed me for something that’s almost purely genetic for at least 5 mins until someone changed the topic. There was also the time she cried on Facetime about her new stretch marks. I was being body positive and tried to tell her that it’s absolutely natural and fine to have them. She then said ‘well at least I don’t have cellulite, that’s way worse than stretch marks imo’ which was obviously directed at me. I hung up shortly afterwards.
Then there have been numerous occasions where she tried to make me feel bad about my height. She’s around 4’10 and I’m 5’6. Deep down she’s insecure about being so small and told me several times but sometimes she just randomly says ‘I’d rather be small tho, your height is too tall for me, men find small girls cuter anyway. Like for a girl you’re basically a giant’ as if 1. being 5’6 was overly tall and 2. male validation had any significance whatsoever. She also absolutely hates whenever I get something that she doesn’t have. Like the time I was the happiest last year (I was in a relationship, the fittest I had ever been, went on vacation while she couldn’t and pretty much everything in my life was going smoothly) and I felt her being salty and jealous with everything she said or the time I started my drivers license at 18 and she still wasn’t allowed to do hers due to her strict mom. She genuinely told me she begrudged me the drivers license.

At this point I just feel like everything she has to say is negative. She tries to make me feel bad about myself in every way possible in order to boost her ego and it’s starting to hurt me. I love her with all my heart but I’m slowly starting to avoid her. I’ve told her that she’s being unnecessarily negative several times and she always goes with the ‘stop being so sensitive’ argument.

I just felt like ranting and would appreciate any kind of advice or something that doesn’t make me feel like I’m being overly sensitive. Thank you for reading this far.",13Jul2020,1

873,"First of all, English isn't my first language, secondly this post will most probably sound very fake, I feel like only someone familiar with south asian culture and parenting will find this post believable. 

My(15F) parents have always been a little different. I go to an all girls school, and am not allowed to talk to guys(which isn't really a problem for me cuz I think I am not straight, I am not sure what exactly I am, but I am definitely not straight. I don't know what my parents will do if they find out, but that is another subject altogether). I am not allowed to lock my bedroom door. The only door I can lock is the bathroom door. In about 7 years my parents will find me a husband and will get me married to a man who I  barely know. But all this isn't the crazy part. My parents are very religious Muslims. This is how its always been and I am used to it.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the crazy part: I never thought about my parents being crazy before the pandemic. They never really checked search history on my devices, and gave me some privacy. Since quarantine has started my parents don't even let me close my bedroom door, even if I am studying. My parents are always barging into my room to ask what I am doing. They do that at least 20 times a day. My mom has appointed my younger siblings the duty of spying on me and reporting to her whatever I do on my phone. I think my parents even checked my phone when I wasn't around. I just found out that my dad even created an instagram account just to spy on me. I don't feel comfortable in my house anymore. I feel like one of my siblings is always spying on me. I don't like the fact that my parents always want to know what I am texting to my friends about.  I even confronted my parents about this multiple times. They always reply with stuff like ""its our duty as parents to check on you"" and ""you wouldn't have a problem with it , if you weren't hiding something"".  I told them I deserved some privacy, they laughed and replied with ""there's no such thing as privacy at your age"". I wouldn't be able to move out even when I am of legal age, because in our culture, girls don't really ever move out until they are married. I just want to run away. I feel suffocated in my house.  I don't know what I can do in this situation, I have already tried talking to them multiple times. I don't think I am just being ""overly sensitive"", cuz that's what my dad said.",13Jul2020,1

I want to pick up my instruments again and learn playing songs on my own, but unfortunately, my teachers in the past never paid too much attention to my base key (""left hand"") sight reading, so I could easily bypass actual reading with written notes and such.

My preferred taste in clothes is darker colours, sweatpants/joggers, hoodies and t-shirts. This really pisses off my mother, who I usually shop with because I'm female. These are the clothes that I would like to wear, and I try to avoid wearing the clothing she attempts to force on me.

If I go to my dad and ask him to take me, ( which would be nice since he doesn't really give a crap about what I wear, and will allow me to buy and wear what I choose ) my mother will take personal offense in that.

She's a narc, takes just about everything personally, turns herself into the victim etc. And I really don't want to cause a scene or have to explain to her that I prefer shopping with my dad because he doesn't care as much.

881,"Im 27. Been dating my boyfriend for 5 years and moved to a different state a year ago to live with him. The move has been really difficult for me. We did long distance for 4 years and during that time I drove 3 hours every weekend to see him. This took me away from my friends every weekend which frustrated them and eventually we started to drift apart and now I feel like I don’t really have any friends. I’ve reached out to them to try to reconnect and they are of course nice to me and whatnot but with Covid going on I haven’t been able to plan a meetup to rekindle our friendship in person. I feel very lonely and like my life revolves around my boyfriend. It makes me feel like a loser. I work for a company that is small and I only have a few coworkers and they are all much older than me, so making friends through work isn’t an option. 

I have constant fear and anxiety about my situation. What if one day we break up? I’ve put all of my eggs in his basket and if we break up I would have to start my life completely over again and it is beyond terrifying to me. We aren’t in a bad place and he does tell me that he wants to be with me forever, but a voice in my head keeps telling me that I am not good enough for him and one day he will break up with me and my life will be in ruins. It makes me nauseous and even dry heave sometimes when I think about it. I think about this constantly and it is getting worse. It’s almost like a self fulfilling prophecy too cause I’m marking myself miserable with these fears, and who wants to be with a miserable person?

It’s gotten so unbearable that I decided I need to do everything possible to nip this in the bud and get control of these feelings and my life. So I started therapy. I’ve been doing it for a few months now and I’m not sure it’s really all that helpful. I feel like I have a lot of trauma from my past that my therapist is trying to help me cope with but it just all feels like it’s just not doing much for me. It feels like a bandaid for a massive gaping wound. It’s hard to explain but I just haven’t had any “aha” moments. She does things like telling me to focus on my breathing, or journaling, or exercising. I’ve done all of these things and they don’t really help at all. I’ve actually gotten really into exercising for the past year. But I don’t enjoy it, I do it because I want to look good. In fact I kind of hate exercise. I wish I enjoyed it and got the “runners high” people talk about but I never do. It feels like a chore and I hate every second of it. 

In fact, I feel like nothing excites me. I don’t have any hobbies and when I try to think of a hobby I could pick up they all sound uninteresting to me. Everything feels like a chore. Everything. I have no desire to do anything. Yet I’m so bored with life at the same time. When I go out on a bike ride, or read a book, or whatever the whole time all I can think about is how I want it to be over. My therapist has told me to work on mindfulness but that hasn’t helped either. I don’t appreciate anything in life. I’m just so profoundly unhappy. 

My boyfriend has never experienced depression or anxiety and he really doesn’t get it. When I try to open up to him about he says stuff like “you can choose to be unhappy or happy. Choose to be happy”. I wish it was as simple as just making a choice, but it’s not...

I wake up every morning with a lump in my stomach and a racing heart. I think about worst case scenarios pretty much all day long. It’s exhausting. I’ve decided to try giving anxiety medication a shot but I’m still waiting to hear back from the psychiatrist I reached out to. It seems like everything is more difficult right now due to Covid. 

I cry almost daily. For no reason. Nothing bad happens. But I keep obsessing over these fears of my boyfriend leaving me and having to start my life over again. It is constant. My therapist is encouraging me to try to take some classes to meet new people and as much as I don’t really want to I will try it. But, again, that’s really not an option right now with Covid. 

I’m so miserable. My body physically doesn’t feel good everyday because of the anxiety. Everything in life is boring to me. Nothing is appealing. Nothing is fun. Everything feels like a chore. Nothing satisfies me. I’m so very unhappy. 

Should I try seeing a new therapist? I’ve tried Zoloft and Prozac before and felt no difference. Maybe a different type of medication could help? Anyone who has experienced bad anxiety, what helped you overcome it? Any and all advice is appreciated. I want to get better and enjoy life again but what I’m doing isn’t working. What else can I do?",13Jul2020,1

883,"I am feeling all sorts of feelings. My dad lost custody of my sister when she was 3 years old. We had her every other weekend and every Tuesday and Thursday. My dad was an alcoholic at the time, he’s not anymore, but his ex-wife (my sister’s mom) lied to the courts about there being guns in the house and that my dad was abusive. As much of a drunk that he was, he was never abusive. He’s never raised his voice at me ever in my entire life. When my dad was cut out of the picture, so was I. I was 11 and it was up until a couple months ago I stopped blaming myself for being the reason they broke up. (I always told myself it’s because I was born out of wedlock in a previous relationship. Now I understand that their family is messed up and erased every memory of me to make it seem like their life was perfect.) 

My dad’s mom, my grandmother, died 2 weeks ago. This woman has taken care of my half-sister, pretending to be a family friend. She took my sister to piano lessons, swimming lessons, and everything that she did for me when I was younger.

My grandmother died and they told my sister everything. Apparently she’s known her whole life that her adoptive dad, her mom’s current husband, wasn’t her real dad. I was a complete surprise. She’s probably hurting very bad right now, and my ex step-cousin (my very good friend as we’ve always stayed in touch) said if I write a letter, she will make sure that she gets it.

I don’t even know where to begin? I’m so sorry that your parents never told you about me? I’ve been waiting 10 years to be in contact with you again. She’s 13, and I want to keep it light and fluffy. She has two other half siblings that she’s been allowed to grow up with, but everyone erased me. 

I am filled with anger. I’ve had a horrible childhood. I’ve missed her every day since she was taken away. With that being said, I want to do this the right way. I want to forget about the pain that my childhood became and get close with my sister. 

Any suggestions are greatly appreciated!",13Jul2020,1

886,"Gosh okay i feel like the past two years since I graduated from uni has been crazy.

Background-

Female, aged 23, living at home, unemployed from the UK but has £3k in savings. 

Since graduating i took a gap year and went travelling.
Then Spent a year working in retail while trying to break into the tech industry. (Exhausting!)

I studied a science subject at my undergrad degree but I don't want to go into that field. I want to become a software engineer, more precisely machine learning/artificial intelligence field.

So for a year i spent learning code from scratch, networking and applying for jobs (while working in retail).

I managed to get an internship, wasn't very techy but in the sector and i got to work with developers.

Unfortunately covid hit and the internship had to end due to funding.

For a month i've been back to applying for jobs(entry level, internship, apprenticeship) , many rejections so far.

Then the UK government put out these data science and AI conversion master courses with placement (not guaranteed) to get more people into the tech sector. And i got a place! 

So I'm happy but now I'm scared.

Should i do the masters or keep on applying for jobs?

My reservations

- when I finish the masters I'll be 24 and hasn't got a grad job yet, i feel like i'll be too old? 
- Scared to have a masters but still struggle to get a job in tech.
- masters will be paid for using the masters loan but my savings will only cover about 5 months of rent/bills. I'm 100% planning on getting a side job but with covid about it'll be hard to find one for a while.


Why I applied

- I love everything about this masters! 
- It's in a city (not london) so renting will be cheaper!
- I can finally move out home (home life has been toxic)
- The placement would great experience! 
- Covid has made the job market very volatile so I don't know how long i will be unemployed for, so the masters could pass the time?

Sorry this is like a brain dump. I'm so anxious on making the wrong decision any guidance would be greatly appreciated thanks.",13Jul2020,1

So I receive a Facebook message from someone I don’t know, but now works at a bar I worked at about 2 years ago. She said that a guy had been to the bar asking about me and my girlfriend and he said that he had some baby photos of my gf that he wanted to give her. So he left his contact details and left. I honestly thought it was a total wind up at first but she was serious and went on to say he’d found me because my FB said where I worked.... there’s a lesson to be learned here guys.

I contact some old work buddies and turns out he had two other people look for me last week, too. So now I’m fuckin worried. I don’t live in that town anymore but my Facebook page said where I live now. (Again, guys, fucking delete that shit from your Facebook).

Over the past couple of years I (26f) have become closer with a few friends and have slowly been hanging out more with their friend group. On a number of occasions I’ve hung out with them along with one friend in particular (for anonymity let’s call her Caitlin). Caitlin (22f) has a very abrasive personality. She makes sarcastic remarks that often come across as rude, but she does it to everyone (sometimes it’s clear she’s joking, sometimes not). I’ve gotten along okay with her in the past (though definitely not someone I wanted to become best friends with) as she did it to everyone and so I wasn’t bothered when she would make those occasional remarks to me. 

Recently we went on a trip with a big group of people, most of which have been friends with each other for years as well as a couple of new people. I’d say I’m fairly good friends with only a couple of people who were able to come on the trip, a few of them I don’t know well but get along really well with as well as a few guys who are close friends with Caitlin that I’ve had a harder time connecting with. It seems to take a lot for this group to invite new people into their group. I’ve felt excluded in the past countless times (though I’ve kept this to myself) and it’s taken me a couple of years to be invited on a trip like this. So I was very happy to be invited and was a bit anxious to socialize with so many people I didn’t know super well. 

Anyways on this trip rather than Caitlin’s usual sarcastic/rude remarks to everyone, this whole trip she directed them towards me. It became clear pretty quickly that she was excluding me and being passive aggressive towards me in particular. It first started when I wished her a happy birthday and she acted annoyed that I brought it up. I thought she was joking though, so later in the day I asked how it felt to be 22 now and she got angry that I brought it up again. Totally innocent remark and when she got upset I said “Oh sorry I thought you were joking earlier!” and I changed the subject. For context, I also found out that that first night she broke down a bit I guess because she was turning a year older and now realizing she didn’t like her program and so didn’t know what she wanted to do with her life. She had a few of her close guys friends supporting and talking her through it (meanwhile me and a bunch of the others were hanging out elsewhere). 

From then on the whole weekend she directed rude remarks towards me and it was like she somehow knew some of my own deep insecurities. She made comments multiple times like why did anyone invite me, that I had no friends there and shouldn’t be there, etc. She never said this jokingly, it was always with a bitchy, sarcastic tone of voice. I already felt a bit insecure because I don’t really feel part of the group and I know that I’m not really friends with most of them, but I’ve been trying to get closer with everyone. I’m ashamed to admit that while we were out, at one point she made another one of these comments and I took it too personally. I managed to go hangout with some of the others and keep it together for a few minutes before leaving because I knew I wouldn’t be able to stop myself from crying (especially because I was a little drunk at the time and so couldn’t hold it in and pretend I was fine). I went and cried in a park, waited another hour or two to calm down before walking back to where we were staying and I just went straight to bed. No one really asked where I was or checked up on me, including my friends, except for one guy the next day who also didn’t know almost anyone in the group. I debated going home early the next morning but I ended up deciding to stay (which I’m now thankful for - as I did go and do a bunch of really fun activities with some of the others). 

But Caitlin continued to do other little things as well, most of which others probably wouldn’t have noticed because it was very passive aggressive. But because it wasn’t just once or twice, it continuous the whole weekend (and along with her comments only made towards me) it was clear to me that she was directing it specifically to me. I’ll give some examples. We were passing around a bottle of alcohol to share and when I got it she tried to grab it very aggressively out of my hand. I’m stronger than her so I was able to hold onto it (barely) as she angrily tried to get it out of my hand and as she commented again why anyone invited me. I laughed it off and told her to be careful because I was holding scissors in my other hand (from an activity we’d all just been doing) and she said “Why are you holding those, are you dumb.” (Even though she’d just been doing this activity too so she knew why I was holding them still). She tried for long enough that I think the others noticed this time it wasn’t a normal/jokey thing. Eventually she still wasn’t able to take it out of my hand so she eventually let go and walked off angrily. 10 mins later I sit down with some of the group with her there and as I’m distracted she grabs it out of my hand and hands it off to someone else, though at that point I didn’t care anyway. The next day again we were again passing a bottle of alcohol around for everyone to try and right before it came around to me she grabbed it from the person next to me so I couldn’t try it. She would often bring up events they’d all been to that I hadn’t been to and talk about how fun they were. She never once even acknowledged I was there the whole trip except when she got angry about me saying happy birthday and asking how it felt to be 22. She would get people into a picture but then not invite me into it. She would make comments like “Can you imagine being 26 years old?” (I’m the oldest one in the group and the only one who is 26 years old). After hearing about her breakdown the first night I realize that this comment must have been related to her own insecurities. (Though probably everything she did probably is). I’m sure there are more things that I’m forgetting that she did but the point is to me it was super obvious. I didn’t really say anything though because I wasn’t as close to a lot of the people there as she was and a lot of them were very good friends of hers. And it was just super weird to me because I’d spent a bunch of time with her in the past and she’d never treated me like this before. 

I have heard in the past couple years from my three closer friends in the group that she’s done this to them and other people in the group. There’s always one person apparently that she targets more specifically. They’ve all had their issues with her before but I hadn’t hung out with her enough to really notice it (or maybe it’s because again she’s so good as doing it so only the person it’s directed at notices) When I came back from the trip and talked to one of my closer friends, let’s call her S, who was unable to come, she told me that Caitlin has in the past treated her the exact same and she did it in a way that most people wouldn’t notice it. So that at least tells me that it’s not about me, Caitlin just has her own issues and probably takes it out on other people to feel better about herself. But yet S still thinks Caitlin is a good person and just hides behind a mask of being mean. I don’t understand how anyone could call someone who treats them like that a friend though? I asked how who she directed it changed, and S just said she never said anything about it and Caitlin just eventually stopped doing it to her. 

Another thing I’ve noticed is how Caitlin always needs the attention to be on her, especially with the guys. She’ll constantly make jokes about sex, about how the guys wish they could be with her and she’ll be provocative to get their attention. She’ll flirt with them and then when they flirt back she’ll be like “ew stop flirting with me.” It just seems to be a really weird dynamic but the guys seem to love it for some reason. 

But honestly this feels like I’m back in junior high. I was bullied in this exact same way for a couple of years, to the point that I was suicidal and just wanted to die. So even though I know it’s not me that’s the issue, it’s hard for me to not take it personally. How do I deal with this situation? Normally I would just avoid her, but if I want to go to group events then there isn’t any avoiding her. I also don’t want to make the same mistake that I did in junior high and stoop to her level, being passive aggressive back. Which would both make me feel worse in the end and I’d rather be the mature one. Honestly, we’re adults, how is this kind of thing still happening?! I never thought I’d be dealing with a situation like this again. But as there’s only so much I can avoid her, how do I react to this while not making things worse? Should I try and ignore it? Should I kill her with kindness? Should I call her out on it one on one? (As I also don’t want her doing this to someone else later on when she decides to stop targeting me). I can’t believe I’m in this situation at 26, once again a decade later, but I need your advice Reddit.",13Jul2020,1
898,"Ok so I am pretty sure that everyone will think that it's a joke and I am lying but it's not. Even if it was a joke then I would not post it in this subreddit.

Ok so before I begin I just wanna say some important things to you guys.
I am a 13 year old female girl and had been seeing ghosts since 10years or more cause I don't really remember (more or less, when I was 3) and I only thought that I was the only one in the family who could see it but now even my 2 year old brother sees it.(because some times he shows his finger in the direction were the ghost is standing and tells ""booth booth""  translated in English is ghost ghost so yeah)And also I think that it is a curse because it's really creepy seeing the dead people moving around your house, on the roads,bridges, etc.

So at first I began seeing shadows and when I was 4 I first saw a completely red cutted palm with fingers (bouncing like a fish when taken out of the water ) it was between a small gap in my kitchen how I saw it is a whole other story maybe afterwards I might post in the comments...
Nvm after that I again began to see shadows and oh boy it got worst....
After my grandma (mother's mother)died at the age 9, I could see them in shadows or even completely some times but luckily I did not lived in a ""so called"" haunted house so I just saw them some times and also from that age onwards I can sometimes predect the future and see the past of the places were I lived.

Ok so why this shit is so important because the place were I live right now is 100 percent haunted, so I don't know what to do.
(Before anyone in the comments say that girl u should call the priest or tell my parents, or leave the house first I have already done that but the ghosts would not even go away second it is not possible during the COVID Virus so let's forget about that option.)

Ok so there are 4-6 ghosts living in my haunted house and I can see them perfectly. There are 2 women (some times maybe 3 because I rarely see a small girl playing with a yo-yo type of ball in the hall way), 1old lady, 1 old man and 1 man living with us. Sometimes so!e of them would just walk around the house, go out, come back etc etc. I can tell many incidents of them but luckily them have not broken or done anything like that in haunted movies.But there is continuous temperature increase and decrease in our flat (oh boy also I forgot tell you that my family lives in 1.5 BHK which is really small but I don't have problem in it. and there are four peps in it my parents my bro and me)

So Yeah what is really creepy is that the ghosts tells me and my bro to leave their house and some times the see the old man raping one of the women and the man is beating the other one with his leather belt.also I can't communicate with them but I can see all the activities.

My parents are also for no reason at all fighting with each other for this ghostic environment.

They both believes us but sometimes, when ever my brother gets scared by seeing their faces, he tells them and they say that just to ignore them or again you kids are saying ghosts.(and I am no !ore really afraid of their faces cause I see them every day but the woman who got burned have a disfigured face so it's scary I will tell u about her in the next line.)

Also now a days the environment is getting worst me I don't know what to do I am not getting into details that what else did happen, but altest I am gonna say that after the old man continuously raped that woman, he burned her in fire and while she was burning she said that everyone is gonna die. And right after seeing that I fainted.

So yeah I really do need help so pls comment down below that what shall I do.

(Also I am in tablet so sorry for any mistakes)

(I might post some of the incidents of the ghosts afterwards in my posts.

(Btw this is my first post)

And don't be creeped, right now as I am writing this post, the woman who was burnt in the fire, is standing right in front of me and creepily looking at me...",13Jul2020,1
899,"I don't know what the right thing to do is, if I should do anything at all. My mother in-law came to see my daughter for her first birthday yesterday. What we didn't know is that my father in-law was home sick with covid. She came over yesterday knowing he was sick but he was only tested this morning and it came back positive. My work sent me to be tested, as they had told me in the past that they offer testing for us, and though the doctor tested me, she said the it was too soon to have tested as I was just exposed the day before. The doctor said I needed to quarantine 14 days and come back between 7-10 days to retest even though I was negative today. 

The HR person I spoke with was not happy and made some calls and then called me back, suggested my mother in-law was lying and that I would go to work like normal but wear a mask and use sanitizer. I was trying to be responsible and get tested also to make sure for the rest of my family. But now I think I'm in trouble with work and I was talked to as if I did something wrong or just looking to get out of work. They doubted his ability to get tested, where he tested and kept asking more questions about them. I don't care about them being mad at me so much, as that is just life in the workplace, but what is the point of testing and posting policy around the office about not coming in and doing everything possible to explain why the doctor is wrong. What do I tell my coworkers? I have limited interaction, but it is still there. Also, if I start feeling sick and am then out, am I responsible if someone else get sick from me and I knew I was at least a risk?

904,"I don't know if this is the right place but I need some advice cause I'm at my limit. 

My soon to be ex husband (haven't divorced yet because he won't get the  divorce papers that he can afford, but I can't because I have bechets syndrome and severe social anxiety and can't work (can't get disability because I'm still married to him and he makes too much. He literally makes $1,500 a month.) 

But anyway, the amount he tried to push on me was $150 for our two kids (ages 6 and 3) and I pushed for $500, but he shot that down so I was stuck asking for $250, which he still whined about saying it was too much.

I get calling DHS, but because of Covid19 it's not open so I can't call them to get the correct amount of child support for two kids, so I'm stuck.

He says $250 is enough, because he's only thinking about bedtime pullups, milk, juice, some outfits and shoes and toys. 

He doesn't think about holidays or medical that isn't covered by insurance. My mother had to get money out of her own pocket when our daughter had to get her adnoids removed and spend $30 on throat numbing suckers. 

All surgeries, doctor appointments, he hasn't been to at all.

Our daughter even has 3 different therapy teachers (PT, OT, ST) and he's only gone to 3 sessions in 6 years. 

But the worst of it is when I remind him of the set day (he said 3 weeks of every month) he literally, in his own words says, ""Then what are you going to give me?"" This is child support and he's acting like the money is for me. 

It makes me sick that I can't ever get the agreed amount of $250 (last 3 months it's been $150, $100, and $200) and he's complaining about not getting any and he'd only give me the money if we have sex and I'm at my breaking point.

A week ago I had something with a friend of mine (M obviously) and we hadn't anything for prevention. No birth control pill, no condom. BUT we didn't have sex.

Now I'm two weeks overdue, feeling tired, been reaally annoyed with my parents without any reason (still live at home, no moodswings, just generally bad mood) and I feel like I'm going to the toilet more often. 

I informed myself, I knew there is a chance you can get pregnant if there is no prevention and you kind of get it all over (not into!) your ""kitty"" (sorry for that wording). I also did take some tests online, were too anxious to buy a real one yet, and I don't feel any morning sickness and my breasts feel normal too. 

I'm just really afraid I could be pregnant, but I also think my period could be overdue because I'm making such a stress out of it? 

I know I have to buy a test, but for now, I'd just like to know if these things can also come up without being pregnant?
And would anybody have some tipps what I could do now?

Originally, I thought our fling had ended fall semester because we didn’t see each other towards the end of semester, but he’d texted me out of the blue on New Year’s and we briefly started hooking up during spring semester again. Really liked him but his grades had  tanked fall semester and he told me he’d be too busy to hang out the rest of spring semester until after his project ended and that I could go find myself another guy real easy—but coronavirus happened and everyone ended up self quarantining anyway, and I ended up coming home to stay with family. I’m going back to my apartment soon to move to my new apartment for the new school year and I’m wondering if it would look bad if I dropped by at his place?

926,"My dad is an egotistical narcissist who believes that he is unscammable. He acts like we still live in the 80's and has no grasp of just how dangerous it is to give out your ID number. He believes that he is either too smart to fall for scams or that he could intimidate the scammers with threats if need be (which is laughable in its own right).

Today was the third time that I vetoed a scammer before he had the opportunity to scam my father. He claimed to be from one of the banks and offered my father a gold card (credit card). I immediately sensed this was a scam because they asked him for the credentials they supposedly have in front of them and, oh right... We're fucking blacklisted due to a metric fucktonne of CREDIT CARD DEBT (along with some bad business decisions regarding property).

No bank with 2 brain-cells to rub together is ever going to offer you a fucking credit card when you're blacklisted and I told my father this. His response was to get angry at me for basically cockblocking him.

He demanded, yes DEMANDED, that I help him send an email that contained a picture of his ID card and I told him no. He demanded again and I basically told him to get fucked and that I'm not going to help him get his identity stolen.

Eventually my mom intervened and told him to go to the local branch to sort this out. He was still in a huff and said something along the lines of ""but the email is faster"" to which I responded ""are you willing to bet your life on this?"" and, still in a huff, we go to the bank.

Upon coming there, the branch was closed but there was a lady wearing a bank branded shirt outside so clearly a worker and I asked her to tell my father whether or not the situation we just went through was a scam. She didn't even need to think to say 'yes' it was that obvious. She then gave a simple list of things no bank will ever ask of you over the phone or email (card number, pin number, and ID number) and I could see it all going in one ear and out the other for my dad.

And what do you think he did after he realised it was a scam? Did he thank me? Did he feel happy or relieved that he got saved from having his identity stolen and his savings account butt-raped? No, he pouted for several hours because he didn't get the credit card he wanted (which we don't even fucking need). 

All my dad could think about was how much money he just lost (which, because of me, is fucking ZERO). See, I know my dad well enough to know what he was thinking. He's one of those old bastards nearing his sixties who thinks that he can do what he wants and no one could do anything about it.

I fully expect that he wanted the credit card so that he could max it out and then throw away. ""He's already blacklisted, right? What are they gonna do? Double blacklist him?"" is the kind of shit he probably thought. I obviously don't have proof of this, but I know him well enough to think it is probably exactly what he thought. Or maybe it's as my mother says. He acts first and thinks later. He is definitely one of those types so both are very plausible.

How do I get him to stop taking scams so lightly? I'm his son and I am tech-savvy, but I won't be living in his house forever and who will veto his bullshit when the next scammer comes around? He won't take it seriously. He'll think he won the lottery again just like he did this time and then his accounts will be drained and his identity used for fraud and who has to clean up the mess then? Who will have to pay for the lawyer fees to straighten everything out? What do I do about this and how can I make him take this shit seriously?",13Jul2020,1

I’m legit lying on my bed crying atm.   Thanks in advance.",13Jul2020,1
929,"Hello, I need some advice. The first course of action was taken appropriately and it did not work.   


I was told (via research) that if that were to happen I should contact animal enforcement or local law enforcement.  
My friends live next door to these people whom I do not really know. They know them in a neighborly sort of way. At the beginning of the pandemic they got a ‘quarantine puppy’.   
The first time I seen him I fell in love with him. He’s a mostly white pit bull. He’s so sweet... for now. Now he is about 4 months, not fixed (that’s a problem) not vaccinated.   
Problems besides that...   
The biggest one is the dog is outside unattended all day. The family leaves frequently, every day and leaves the dog in a yard where he can get loose. The dog does have water and sometimes food in the yard, according to my friends who regularly check up on him. My friend said one time he had ants in his food bowl so he's definitely not going to eat that. I'm just concerned because of how hot it has been lately. These 2 days in question it was 90+! Water is no substitute for a cool environment.     
The pup gets loose all the time, this is particular cause for concern considering the family is never home. Yesterday the dog got loose and wandering the street. The dog regularly gets into my friend's backyard and plays with their dog. 

On top of that, they yell at the dog for tearing things up, blame him for everything. But that's more of a personal problem. I just worry about anything physical happening, but I haven't anything like that, except the guy's kids being waaaay too rough with the dog. 

Originally I thought it was not place to do or say anything; until I was at my friend's house Saturday night and the puppy was roaming around in the backyard. I was there with my boyfriend. I went out back to visit and our friends are venting about neighbors and the dog.

Like I said, I've always been attracted to this dog and got to thinking about recusing it. I would definitely treat it the way it needs to be treated. Get him fixed, vaccinated, care for him a lot better than they are.  So we start discussing this. We didn't want to steal someone's dog; that's not right. So we waited a couple hours for this guy to come home to discuss him handing the pup over to us. 

The dog is in the backyard when they come home. This guy starts looking for the dog. My boyfriend comes over with the dog and offers to take it off his hands. Tells him in so many words I'll take him to the vet, get him shots, etc. But the guy is like that's 'my little buddy' etc, doesn't go for it. 

Then the next day, the family leaves and go boating alllll day. They leave the dog outside again. They message my friends. The gentleman we approached regarding taking the dog is now paranoid we are trying to steal his dog and states the dog has food, water and a cage on the back porch for shade so leave him alone. The dog gets out into the street. My friend retrieves him. Dog stays in my friend's yard all day until they return home again. The fact they messaged my friends shows that they feel guilty about it, but will still not change.

Dog is not necessarily being abused, just neglected. He's super happy - for now. I just worry about him developing tendencies from the kids not respecting him enough and also he just needs to be taken better care of. 

I'm not sure what to do. Then gentleman isn't going to come around and get tired of this dog, something is going to happen to the dog I feel like before then. 

I don't want the animal shelter to come and take the dog. There's no reason to put a male pitbull in the shelter, especially when I could take him. And I don't even know if that's what they would do. I know I want the dog removed from the situation, but that's different. 

Any advice would be appreciated. ",13Jul2020,1
931,So basically I'm 19M I have about 7 friends my own age around the world the rest are about 10 years older then me; the issue is I feel like I'm missing out on life experiences my other mates are having.,13Jul2020,1
932,"For a little background, my mom kicked me out when I was 12, and now at 22, my relationship with her is nonexistent. I chose to cut her out of my life because after getting out of the house we lived in (just us) I was on edge every time I saw her. The last time she tried to hug me at 19 I basically shut down. I feel gross when she's near me, like almost repulsed. 

However, I was thinking about when this feeling originated, and really, it goes back to when I was a child. She creeped me out in a way. She scared me in the normal ways that come with living with an abusive parent, but also, I felt weird around her. I felt that she was too comfortable with me and would regularly be naked around me. She would discuss sexual things that made me uncomfortable like just mention things about sex or something, nothing too pressing. That same feeling I have now about her touching me was similar back then, it repulsed me at times. 

Is this normal? Am I overreacting?",13Jul2020,1
933,"I’ve been mulling over this decision for long enough. Please share your wisdom! 

First some background: 

1. My job allows me to work remotely through the end of the year at least. Even prior to the pandemic my job was highly remote able and teammates often came in only 2-3 days/week, so it’s kind of flexible in that way. 

2. I’ve been in a relationship for about five years now. Love him but he is my polar opposite in every way. On a logical level I stay with him because I believe he will balance me out a bit and he is possibly my last chance at having a family of my own. Practically speaking however, I am deeply frustrated and incapable of allowing myself to grow in those ways and accept that as a challenge. I end up being quite frustrated with him, as a result, I think. Call it resentment or call it the inability to deal with the myriad of ways my current life circumstances with him test my limits. But I do love him.

3. Chief source of my frustration: Still living in the city I grew up in and I feel as if I have outgrown it as of 2010. For one reason or another I kept finding myself in situations where I’d be tied down here (read: relationships). I just dreamed of it and never made it happen. (Other relevant bit: I have a monthly rental here).

4. I have family in a city I love that is also nearby a second office location of my company. 

5. I have a dog that I am deeply bonded to, call him a therapy dog if you want. He’s always by my side and I could imagine being away from him for only a month max, preferably less. 


So, as I said my job has me remote through end of year at least. Seems it would be a great time to go stay out there, possibly for an extended period of time, possibly even rent my own place. I’d work remotely, quarantine with family, figure things out and enjoy life a bit.

My question, I guess, is do I do:

A. Plan for the longer haul: road trip with my dog and reasonable fraction of my belongings, get myself a temporary place through end of year or through early next year. 

B. Fly out (cautiously), self quarantine and work remotely for 2.5 weeks or so. Come back and reassess?

C. Something I am not considering?

934,"Currently I tutor 2 children in various subjects like math/english. The children are twins and 7 years of age. The little boy does not struggle and infact excels at many of the subjects given his age. He likes to learn and so he picks up on different subjects quickly. 

The girl however struggles with a lot of basic writing and reading, and has a weak ability to grasp concepts, and often memorizes as opposed to understanding. How do I help her understand what she is reading/writing so she can do it without my help?

Another issue is she often guesses instead of actually trying to spell. So if i ask “how do you spell box” she might reply ‘bxt’, but when i ask her to read ‘bxt’ she understands that how she spelled ‘box’ is wrong

Also she doesn’t group letters together. If she sounds out words like ‘dog’ she will reply something along the lines of ‘duh OH guh’ which then takes her roughly 2minutes to decipher that its the word ‘dog’ which she has read.

938,"hi all! i have a question that i’ve been wondering about for a while and was recently brought up again today. 

i have been on again off again friends with this guy for about four years now. he lives on the other side of the country, and our friendship has always been a bit strange. by strange i mean that he will always attempt to rekindle our friendship, things are great for a month or two, and then he confesses his love to me (or something along those lines) and then one of us has to step back. 

he’s had the same girlfriend for two years, and over those two years we haven’t talked as much, considering he probably shouldn’t be professing his love to another girl. however, he had some slip ups. by slip ups, i mean: asking me when i’m moving to his city so we can be together, asking me for nudes, etc. etc. 

the most recent time this happened was i believe, january of this year. him and his girlfriend live together, so it’s serious. i try to give him the benefit of the doubt, as i know he’s only ever reached out throughout their relationship when he was drunk, and he had some substance abuse issues. 

that said, it really didn’t sit right with me and still doesn’t. i went back in our dms to see what he had said, and everything was unsent. part of me wants to believe it’s because he’s genuinely remorseful of his actions, but part of me feels he was just trying to cover his tracks. 

i don’t know if i should tell his girlfriend. since he sobered you’re it hasn’t happened, but it happens pretty sporadically. if it happens again, should i tell her? i mostly feel bad for her. she seems like an amazing, loving person and it doesn’t feel fair to her.",13Jul2020,1

Tl:Dr: me and my boyfriend are getting kicked out in 2 days because a car accident.. I'm looking for places. We're both out of work, I'm on unemployment and he's just trying to make side money.. we have no idea what to do.. I only have 700 dollars saved up.. my car was stolen. I had left my mom and was already homeless.. fuck fuck fuck. What can I do!? 

6 months into my relationship. I became homeless. I was kicked out because my relationship with my mother was very difficult.. we finally got over the abusive aspects of or relationship. But she was still trying to control me at 22 years old. She was telling me that anyone who tried to take me away from her she would get rid of them, she was constantly telling me I couldn't be with my boyfriend and she hated him and if I wanted him I was kicked out. 

Angrily. Fed up. With the narcissistic abuse I left. My boyfriend took me home with him. 

I've been living with him the entirety of the pandemic. He cannot find a job, I'm out of school, im on unemployment. It's been rough. We've been in 2 car accidents in the span of 3 months. 

Now. Were getting kicked out (is what I've been told. We have 2 days) because his mother is angry about the car damages  from a motorcycler  bashing off the mirror. 

There isn't time for benefits from the state of New Mexico right now.. and because of the pandemic it's making it even harder to get assistance.. because everything is backed up or closed!! 

I'm considering finding a place with free utilities for like 500 a month.. maybe pay 2-3 months off so we have a guaranteed place..


I'm just freaking out.. 

I was already planning on saving up for my own place in the next 2-3 months because I was uncomfortable living with my boyfriends parents. Because they're just as controlling and don't understand jack SHIT. They're so petty and conservative.. I've been trying to be respectful and they're so hard on their son.. he needs their help and they just make him feel terrible. So we have no help from his parents.. my moms a fucking alcoholic with no job. 

This is just fucked. 

Any advice would be nice. 

I'm determined to find a place.. but I dont even know if it's possible for me to find something in 2 days..

3 months ago I started a new job. It’s a split role between two departments one of which I like far more than the others, the role is slightly more exciting and the team are awesome. 

Anyway just after I started my manager in the department I like announces she was leaving, in her notice period she prepped me hard to take over all marketing activity in that department so I could cover while they found her replacement. So the last couple of weeks I’ve worked my ass off and realise more and more that I love this job which is something I haven’t felt in any previous roles. 

They announced this week they’re hiring internally for two weeks then externally for 3, my question is should I apply for it? It’s a step up and I’m very worried they might think it’s too soon. However I am LITERALLY DOING THE JOB and I know I can do it. I’m just worried about making them see that and also the repercussions of leaving the other department having not been there that long. My new line manager is also the director who will most likely make the final decision, should I ask him first? 

I think I will kick myself if I miss the opportunity to do this job that I love for more money. Only problem is if I don’t get it which I prob won’t the person I lost out to will be my new direct manager. awk.

I (F22) meet this guy (M25) a couple months ago online but we only got to hang out this month due to covid19. Had a couple of dates and things were pretty fine, we don’t live in the same city but I have a flat in the city where he lives, because I study there. So things are not serious, but are going okay. 
I knew he was a scientist but he never got deep into that, just kind of told me he does experiences and stuff. 
Today I had a voice in my mind telling to do some stalking. So I did, went to the website where he works and searched for him, only to realise he’s on the research team that (among other stuff) studies my rare disease (fap ttr amyloidosis). I was born with it and has no cure, the only available treatment consists of managing the symptoms of it. 
This disease is nothing too bad but only my closed family know about it and my best friend of many years. So I don’t really know, if this comes up on a conversation of him telling me about his job and talking about it, I’m not sure if I should just tell him I got it. Or just play dumb, but if I did it I’d be an idiot and break the trust we have. 
I was planning on telling him if we got super serious and eventually in a relationship.

Some context about me, when I was younger I had cancer and due to that I'm extremely short (4'8 or 142 cm for anyone not American) and about 80 pounds (36 KG) so very small for my age.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, the most recent argument became the most toxic one we've had in a very long time, maybe even ever. Basically it was like this, after the summer's over I've decided I'm not going to go to college because of the pandemic. Right now, I'm visiting my grandparents while he works with my grandfather in a different state than where we live so I didn't want to do any of what I'm about to say right away, but just after we got back sometime in September. I wanted to get a job at a local pizza shop that I'm pretty sure would hire me and would be good money, I wouldn't even need a car or anything for that cause it's within walking distance of our house. I wanted to do that to save up for college so he wouldn't have to pay for everything with that. 

&amp;#x200B;

See, currently I get a social security check because of my size but that's only because him and my father pretty much forced me to go that route and lied to get me it saying I was worse than I actually am. I never wanted it and I still don't. Plus, at the job I would be making double what I get from that check. Well, that's where the argument started. He basically told me that I'm incapable of holding a job. Yet somehow he thinks I WILL be able to in the future after college? He said if I decide to do that then he's not coming back to our home state with me. So, I genuinely was considering going and staying with my father for a while, still am considering what happened next. He threatened me, blamed everything on technology and phones, threatened his own sister (because she was the one to buy me the phone), took my phone (still hasn't given it back like 3 hours later) and shoved me around. He didn't actually hit me or anything, but I truly thought he was going to.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, he's calmed down but he refuses to talk to me. I want to fix this. I screamed at him several times and technically I ""started"" the argument but he most certainly escalated it. I made it very clear that even if we fix things if he ever threatens me again, I'm gone, no two ways about it. Then he had the audacity to argue with me about that claiming it was just words. I try not to curse unless around friends I've known for a while but **fuck that,** I don't care if it's just words. You don't threaten someone then expect them not to take it seriously. Doesn't matter who it is, a threats a threat and I refuse to take that lightly and be told I'm overreacting. After that is when he stopped talking to me claiming, ""things can't be fixed this time, I'm taking you to your dads on the 24th."" On the 24th I have graduation for my school and we were gonna go back to our home state during that anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do? Is it even worth trying to fix this? Should I just let him take me to my dads on the 24th? The only problem there is that my dad isn't really taking the pandemic super seriously and because of the cancer I'm susceptible cause of a weakened immune system, I also have asthma on top of it. I'd just have to be more careful myself I suppose though.",13Jul2020,1
959,"(repost from r/AmIBeingTooSensitive)

This friend of mine is online. We haven't met in real life yet. But regardless we're really close. We text everyday and will check on each other if we don't reply for a long time.

So here's where my question comes in. Am being too sensitive regarding her comments? There's a few scenarios I feel she was being snarky and I can't tell if I'm overreacting

The first one was when we were playing fortnite. She kept harping on about how she got more kills than me and how she's always further ahead in the battle pass than me. She also kept criticising my game plays. Note that I took a sleep aid so I was really tired and I only recently began habitually gaming, which means that I don't play as often as her. So I'm not that great at the game to begin with.

She kept asking me if I was annoyed too which I was trying to just let the situation die but she began pissing me off with the criticising then constantly asking me if I'm annoyed and asking why I wasn't talking. I told her multiple times I was just tired and I was trying to focus and she kept complaining that I wasn't talking. So I was just hoping this was a one time deal and that she'd stop acting like that.

Since then she really hasn't commenting on my fortnite game play. But fast forward to yesterday we were playing battle for bikini bottom rehydrated. There were two courses we couldn't get passed and so I handed her the remote because I kept messing up and thought that she wanted to try anyway. So she was able to get pass the courses and she basically said something along the lines of ""so I got pass those two courses and I didn't get a thank you? Your welcome"". Like tf it's fucking game get over it. I thought she was joking until she said it again.

She sounded so smug about it so I was smug back and said ""yaaaaaay"" without saying thank you so she let it go. I'm hoping she was just joking but her tone sounded rude  

Now fast forward today not too long ago. I sent her picture of a child gardening and I was told her ""if I ever have kids I want to teach them this stuff"" (teach them how to garden that is). And her reply was ""with your luck your kids wouldn't like that"". This was so rude to me. I asked her ""what you mean my luck? 👀 My little brother wants to join in on the gardening"". So she told me it takes too much time and effort so it'll be ""a no"" from her.

So my reply I was ""well I have time and it's worth the effort"". The gaming comments was eh, I could let that go. But the gardening comment pissed me off because she knows I want to be a botanist. Wtf does ""your luck"" mean? Its not like I'm unlucky. So am I being too sensitive?",13Jul2020,1
960,"I recently changed jobs from a highly specialised team in a global consultancy firm to work at a large corporate and am finding the change in average competence in my team quite jarring. I’ve described the details below in case there are specific actions I can take, and would also appreciate general advice on how to adjust.

I’m not responsible for the performance of the new team, but I was hired with the expectation that I could help bring in best practices from my previous employer. 

At the consultancy, everyone in the team had the same degree, with varying specialities. There was an extremely strong graduate recruitment programme in place, where we pretty much had our choice of the top 30 graduates in the field each year and would make 5-10 selections from that pool based on how strong that year was, culture fit and team balance. Senior recruitment was even more rigorous, if less formalised. Retention was ok, and over time this resulted in an extremely strong team.

My new team is multidisciplinary, with qualifications including engineering, accountancy, actuarial science, psychology, IT etc. I am really enjoying the wider skill mix as it lets us take on much more interesting projects. I also slightly prefer the culture in this team, it’s a bit younger, there’s much less admin overheard and it’s less hierarchical than the consultancy was.

What I am struggling with is the vast gap in average competency between the teams. Previously I could rely on team members to complete work to a high standard and just generally be much more driven. There was a good balance between people figuring things out on their own and asking for help when they get stuck. Specific issues that I have noted in the new team are:
- slow delivery time on work items, which results in us being bogged down with routine work instead of performing value add work
- very weak self checking and peer review culture, which results in conceptual issues and basic grammar errors in reports and emails
- low quality presentations and poorly run meetings with stakeholders
- very little rigour/validation when modelling, with alternatives not being considered
- bad file management, very frequent issues with not being able to find items/lost passwords

I think some of these issues can be fixed by formalising processes and insisting on peer review, but that feels very bureaucratic and could just slow everything down further.  

I’m not sure how much of this is attributable to the calibre of the team compared to the culture of excellence at my previous job. I can influence the team culture and our recruiting going forward, but changing our teams current composition is off the table.

Should I adjust to this environment and just commit myself to reviewing work that I need to rely on or can I change things in the team?

How should I have a discussion with our manager about this without coming across as exceedingly critical of the team?

How do I manage the pressure to just take on more work? My mandate is to delegate everything I can and to spend time on work the rest of the team can’t do, but it often feels like it’s faster to just do things myself rather than to delegate and then review it.",13Jul2020,1

967,"Long story short, mother in law just messaged us on Facebook letting us know she tested positive for COVID. Our immediate response was worry, concern, fear. Then she said she was tested 8 days ago and never told anyone she got tested, not even my father-in-law who she lives with. She visited my spouse and I, and our 3 children out of the blue about 4 days ago, never mentioning she was tested. She also offered to watch my nephew for my sister in law and brother in law, knowing she was tested for COVID. The cherry on top, my spouse and I are pregnant and about to enter my 2nd trimester.

I very much so feel that my mindset is different than everyone else’s here and I’ve had a tough time fitting into any crowd I’ve tried to get myself to be apart of. I just want a fresh start. I’ve got a little over 2 grand in personal savings and I’ve got a very good education fund ( money strictly used for pilot training and flight school courses). I have been thinking about what would possibly be stopping me from picking up and going for a year, getting a part time job(30ish hours a week) and grinding through my pilot training distraction free. The job ive applied for says pay is 100-200 a day (high end Mexican restaurant) and the places I’ve looked at living are 6-700 a month for a room. I’ve fully paid off my car and my grandma has paid my insurance forever(very fortunate for that, please don’t think I come from a family that will throw me any bone I want. They will not fund rent on a move like this.

973,"I'm a new grad nurse applying for my first RN position. Not a great time to be trying to find your FIRST nurse job, right? After applying for months and lots of rejections I've received two job offers today. The first job offer is close to my hometown in a critical access hospital where I would learn many aspects of nursing (med/surg, OB, labor and delivery, emergency room, pre/post surg, etc.). While I know I will greatly improve upon my skills and critical thinking at this job, I will be living alone in a town of 700 while my other friends have accepted positions in major cities or have continued on to graduate school. There are opportunities for growth at this facility, and I had actually hoped to find a position here after grad school when I would be ready to settle down, but I'm young and I don't want to settle down... at all. I have hometown friends who have stayed, but they're not exactly going places in life, if you know what I mean. 

The second offer I received is a home health position in a major metropolitan area 2.5 hours away from my hometown. I would care for one patient 8 hours/day, full time. While this seems like a cushiony, easy position, I know that's not what I need, especially as a new nurse. The kicker is that I have a life-long friend who lives in the metropolitan area who I can move in with. She and I have been friends our entire lives and would have a blast living together. She's very excited for me to move in, but I'm terrified of letting her down if I choose the first position. If I don't move in with her she'll have to downsize to a smaller apartment to save money after I've strung her along for two months talking with her about potentially moving in. 

I'm at a crossroads in my life and I have no idea which path to take.

974,"I’m a second generation asian american, but I’ve never felt strongly about my roots. I grew up in an immigrant neighborhood, so I raised with a blend of a million different cultures, that everyone shared. I literally grew up eating shawarma all the time, going to ethiopian restaurants on the weekend, drinking bubble tea with my friends, shopping at latino grocery stores, etc. I’m pretty sure at this point I know words in arabic than in mandarin or korean combined (I’m half korean half chinese). I grew up surrounded by people from all over the world, and funny enough, in my neighborhood, white people are the *significant* minority 

The flip side of this is that I’ve never really cared about about my culture. My parents always tried to get me excited by playing korean music and eating korean food, and speaking mandarin, but honestly, I just don’t care. I’m not resentful- I genuinely don’t hate myself at all for being asian. It’s just that a lot of people make it their identity, and I can’t relate. I rarely think about the fact that I’m asian. 

I’d rather eat a burger over bibimbap, pancakes over congee, and I swear I can’t go longer than a week without shawarma. A lot of my asian friends all want to travel to thailand and japan and south korea, but I just *dont care*

978,"So i'm just going to list all ""issues"" and explain then, then you can try to give advice to wichever you can. I'm 18 for reference

1. I got no friends or social circle, sounds a bit over the top but it's true. Bullying+kinda social anxiety. For the last 4 years I've mostly been alone and in my room. My former best friend started being a dick to me in middle school. Lost contact with the few others I had and never made new ones. Now everyone claim lonlinness is unhealthy so I guess this is an issue even if I dont realize it or want to admit it. 

2. I'm more or less severely deppresed. Now this links up to several issues I list here. I feel like my life has no point and everything is shit. 

3. I hate how I look. I guess most you can guess wich community I come from, well I left but I'm still celibate and deppresed about my looks. I used to just want a gf and so on you know, but now it's different. It's like I don't really want a gf, I just want to be taller and better looking. I hate my height, my hair, my face fairly so too and other things. I am doing things to ""improve"" or atleast not look worse. Including skincare, good hygiene and grooming, ""No-fap"", working out, so on. But it all just feels pointless even if most ik claim I don't look too bad. The worst is my height and hairline. I'm really short and I got a high hairline. 

4. I want a gf, but don't think I can get one. ( yea ik this makes no sense because of my last statement but I still feel a wish for it). I don't think I can tho, mostly because of my looks. I tried Tinder and despite swiping right on 95+% of all girls within 100 miles of me I got no matches. Now it's fair to mention even if I got a gf I would still be deppresed and hate my looks. 

5. I'm considering sucide, well not right now, but I think I will do it atleast within a few years. This is kinda not an issue alone as it's a part of the deppresion bit. 

For reference I don't agree with most things in the certain community we all know what is, but I agree with the blackpill. I left because people in the community and outside told me to.

I feel like I'm so so so ugly that I can't go out anymore. I have a big nose and a big forehead. 
I feel ugly and dumb all the time and I feel like I can't do anything about it, like I'm a lost cause. I go out only 2 times a month, and when I do, it's always in the morning when there are not so many people outside. I feel like everyone feels sorry for me because  I was born with an ugly face, even my brother, and that is why he is so kind to me. 
My friends always want to hang out with me and they keep asking what's wrong, but I just can't tell them. I tell them that I'm busy/I have somewhere else to go/I have family guests over, etc just so I can avoid going outside. Some of them think that I have a problem with them, but that's not the case, I love my friends. I know it's a silly thing for some of you,you're probably thinking it can't be that bad, but my appearance has really affected my life and the way I think. I used to love going outside, now I'm fucking terrified. I don't want people to keep judging me, I hate the way they look at me, like I'm some kind of weird creature. I had a classmate tell me to my face that I'm kind of ugly. Boys act really weird around me, when I'm trying to have a conversation with them, they look nervous/like they wanna go away from me. People always mistake me for being older than I am. I downloaded some apps on my Phone to start talking with strangers. We had great conversations but the moment I sent them a selfie, they ghosted me. So if until now you thought I'm lying about my appearance and that I'm actually a gorgeous human being like the people who post on the amiugly subreddit, trust me, I'm not.
I'm sorry, I know it's not a big problem, some people have it worse, but I feel like I'm falling apart. I've told myself that l still am worthy of love and I'm alive for a reason but everytime I look in the mirror, I have a mental breakdown and forget everything I said. 
My depression is getting worse day by day and no one knows/cares about it ( I feel like I can't tell anyone what's going through my mind because I don't want to make them sad and it would make me feel selfish, there are bigger problems they probably have to worry about, not me. If I suffer, it doesn't mean that the people around me should suffer as well) 

Last summer I spent it all in the house and I didn't go out even a day/or an hour. And that's not even the worst part. The worst part is that I'm also dumb as hell and I'm not gonna do anything with my life. I stay in the house but I don't do anything (just some sport sometimes). Besides that, I watch movies/TV series and play on the PS. Those are the only things that make me feel good. Being ugly really hurts my soul and the fact that I wasted my teenage years staying at home all the time instead of going out and having fun or learning to do some things that are gonna help me in life. 


Sorry if you had too much to read. Can you, please, give me some advice? How can I love myself and how can I stop being such a lazy piece of shit? Maybe therapy would help me?

He has this friend, she has had a tough time over the past few years.  After losing a work colleague tragically a couple of years ago they have banded together to process their friends death.  They text a lot and offer each other support and as far as I know have a great friendship.

However. This friend has had problems with her mental health. She has attempted suicide two times recently.  She engages in what people would describe as unhealthy coping mechanisms. She has esteem issues and engages in self destructive behaviour when it comes to relationships with men.  

During lockdown the friend took another attempt on her life. What seemed like out of the blue. A couple of hours after a zoom party. She told my partner via a picture of tubes coming out of her arms.

She isn't wanting to seek help with a professional therapist and instead has poured her need for therapy into my partner.  He isn't keen on talking about things either. He is bottling his issues up as well and won't tell me what is bothering him. Except when he drinks.  He told me today that his main concern is that he can't keep up with supporting his friend through all the problems. The men, the suicide and her reliance on him.

He has a lot of other things going on and I'm trying my best to comfort him and be there but as I said he doesn't want to tell me stuff because he's worried I would judge the friend.

I met this girl - we'll call her - 'Jude' on Discord. She was playing League; her friends stopped and left but she took an instant liking to me. It's not a surprise to me - without sounding arrogant I get a lot of attention from girls. I don't really ever return the favor - I think I want what everyone else wants; a buddy, someone to play games with, someone half pretty. I had a ton of attention but no one who really clicked or wanted what I wanted. 

'Jude' was different. She was autistic, told me everything, no matter how embarrassing, and appearance wise, I just thought she was adorable. She quickly fell in love with me - and I guess I was just so overwhelmed with someone appearing like this out of nowhere that I felt like she was meant for me. My friends called me stupid as hell, but blessed it anyway because I told everyone how amazing and honest she was. She wasn't the most clever, the most beautiful (To me she was), but she was honest, and sweet, and seemed so loyal it felt like someone I didn't want to give up on. In the past year I had a really rough time so I thought finally something good was about to happen to me. Even though she was in another country, I'm a teacher so it means I can travel easily and she could come with me.

She was child like in stupidity, quite clumsy, and I felt like I had to protect her. She told me things she did in her past, like stealing a car, getting beaten up by her drug dealer boyfriend, getting into fights, rehab, how her mother doesn't talk to her, and how she was rejected entry into the USA for a vacation. I took this with a pinch of salt and thought it was just exaggeration and lies to make me be more affectionate - I gradually found out it was true - there was even a post on her Facebook with 8000 shares of her bruised face that her ex boyfriend did to her for no reason - and she told me things like ""Everyone gives up on me"" and that 'everyone had promised to treat her good but lied' and this is something that hit me so deeply I just wanted to make every deep of hers come true and to never hurt her again. She was deeply in love with me, and wanted to come with me for my dreams. I loved her more than I loved any other girlfriend, I didn't care for her self harm scars, the noose scar on her neck, the drug usage, the criminal background - even though it is the exact polar opposite to me, I just felt so enamored. I wanted to be the one person in their life who treated them good. I know what it felt like to feel like a yoke was on my shoulders so I wanted to be the one to take it off their shoulders.

\&gt; I should have kicked her from my server and ran physically from my computer the moment she came into my life.

But I didn't. I listened to her problems. She would cry about her nose as she was unhappy. I know how girls are - she lied and said it was broken - but the truth is she just had a fat nose (bulbous) and I agreed to pay for a liquid nose job. Just to make her feel better. She had emergencies for her dog (poisoned, sick) and I didn't listen to my inner gut and thought I was just paranoid and I paid for them too. She hated working - She's autistic, has a criminal record, so I helped her with that too.  She was on benefits and let me know about them. She slept on the couch of someone who she pretended was a gay housemate, but was actually her ex boyfriend.- She had pictures of her old exes on her Instagram (She has over 280 photos) - but none were with him. My friends comforted me, told me how handsome I was - That she was a complete moron if she was lying; I never found it hard to find girls to talk to in real life or online,  and I loved the attention, but the only person's attention I wanted was Jude's. But she seemed so distant.

I was quite upset with her at times - I never swore at her EVER, but I asked her for attention, because every relationship, no matter how bad - couples spend a lot of time together. But she didn't. I used to have to call her phone and send her a text, and she wouldn't answer, she would only respond on Snapchat, or call through Snapchat or VERY RARELY Discord - her use of WhatsApp was minimal, but her Snapchat Score was through the roof. It was only for things like Valentines; when I made her a box filled with fake rose petals, bought her new shoes for work (Nike Air Max - she's was a chef for like a week), coffee, chocolate, a teddy, and a letter, buying flowers, getting her breakfast and food sent to her house after a tough day, or being spontaneous like writing sweet messages or fixing things like her torn jeans that I would notice in Snapchat photographs that she would really become engaged with me. I put it down to her autism - her whole family has it, and she even mentioned that it was this - a lot of people complained about her being 'weird' but sometimes I would mention something like 'dogs' and she would talk for hours. 

I met someone online who lived a few minutes away from me and who was really sweet; she told me to leave Jude and to be with her and that she would give me everything I wanted.  She wasn't like Jude, she was really into me and was just honest. I don't think God exists, but maybe he was trying to save me in that moment. I was confused - I told Jude that I wanted her to be happy and to be happy myself - but she said I belonged to her and that nobody understood her love for me, and told the girl to 'back off' - this gave me confidence and I had my confidence renewed temporarily. I noticed she started using drugs more often, but it was just weed and 'molly' at the time and I was worried  - but I thought that when we would be together I would be able to fix her. I thought we would live together and I'd be able to distract her from the 'pain' that made her want to use drugs. I mean, for me, her being around me made me the happiest person around, and just hearing her speak or seeing her message me on my phone made me so excited and made me want to be a better person and better myself so I thought I could return the favor once I had the chance to take care of her. I was really convinced, we spoke daily, she was gorgeous to me, I even had my new job lined up. She would message me and tell me how much she loved me, and how she wanted kids with me and it really felt like I had my paradise in this person.

But I just kept feeling like something was 'wrong' I became suspicious. First she told me she had an emergency to deal with - and then I found she was playing games  with other people - and she had told me she didn't have a computer at the time. My friend made me feel bad, and so did Jude, because her explanation was that she was simply finding time to play - she was always stressed no matter what - and that the computer didn't belong to her. I thought I was being crazy.  She made me feel bad and wrote pages and pages about how she loved me and how she had stress. I questioned why her Discord was on and why she didn't respond and she said it was just not used by her. I tried to put this behind me and focus on us. But I noticed another huge red flag - Her friends didn't know who I was.  He was rude to me on Twitch when I had commented on her chat - and claimed I was a 'stalker' - she was sending love hearts to another boy - who was head admin for a group on Facebook and I messaged him but he said nothing was going on so I assumed it was nothing. Her best friend did know who I was however; We'll call her 'Lemon' and I messaged her in regards to her whereabouts, and she responded positive and knew who I was. But her gay housemate, 'Bob' who was actually her EX, didn't respond and supposedly yelled at her for me messaging him. 

Again she would tell me I was just being paranoid and that she loved me. And I let myself love her deeper. But I couldn't help myself - something was wrong. I realized she was taking drugs and ones which I hadn't seen before. Weird silver cannisters with balloons, methamphetamines, molly, and benzodiazepines, and I took photos and she even proudly sent me videos of her face when she was high. Her face was changing; it wasn't aging but it was worse. I was increasingly worried about her each day - she'd refuse to eat and then binge. She had concern about her weight gain but I was concerned about her drug usage.  I would bring it up along with our future and the fact she didn't seem all that interested in it like something was up. She had gotten angry and 'fed up' of me questioning her loyalty and said she would be done with me if I accused her once more of being 'fake'.  Shortly after, I basically assumed she was only like this because of the debt she was in - and the fact she couldn't have her own space and that her housemate was basically sharing drugs with her - I then made the decision to end her debt - by giving her £2000 as a 'loan' (Which to be honest, I'd never ask for it back) so she could pay off her debt in Sweden and get out of her hell hole. She changed immediately and it was positive for a few days -  We were having a deep conversation one night and she mentioned that she had an emergency - that 'Lemon' needed her - when we were meant to be doing things together. Due to her own issues.  We were supposed to play a game together as her housemate wasn't home and she could use his PC. I didn't want to be selfish so I said okay - 30 minutes later, I noticed she was playing League and streaming. I was upset and confronted her by text, and she became angry and blamed me, and we broke up. I spoke with Mina; a really nice friend about what happened and was pretty distraught; my friend who despite having her own issues and being in a world famous beauty pageant, stayed up comforting me at night about it on Discord. She even told me to cancel the money I sent because it was clear she was a scammer.

Oddly enough, at 8AM the next day I get a phone call from Jude, who tells me that she didn't block me because she wanted me to cool down, and that she never wanted to lose me. She said if I wasn't BLOCKED it's because she didn't want to lose me. I told her that I needed change, and that I took back the money. She was quite hurt by this - and said she didn't even know  (The bank froze her funds immediately so she went into negative bank balance) - I was hurt because I felt like I hurt her. So I told her don't worry and it's all forgiven. I then made sure the funds got back to her and that was that.

I noticed worse things over time, her drug usage just became daily routine. Like ritualistic, with weed being used all day just to function, and pills and other substances on top. I complained; I noticed she was suddenly spending money (She's autistic so I blamed it on that) without realizing she was going into debt, and just degenerating. Her voice became really slurred. I was scared at one point, and thought about calling police in her country, but stopped myself.  I then noticed the Facebook group I had tried to join - which she was a member of - had banned me before I even could join - and her friend was the head admin.

I began to dig deeper, and messaged someone who was recently banned; Melena, who basically revealed that Jude was planning on meeting with another guy. I confronted Jude, and then the nightmare truly began. Malena explained she was saying I was a stalker, and that everything I was claiming was false - I had to show Malena photographs and go on cam to prove I wasn't a catfish, and was forced  to basically prove it was all a lie. But this wasn't enough for Jude. Jude decided to try and spread the lie to everyone that I was a stalker - but the scariest part is she believed it, I tried to speak to her and she kept making up strange reasons and excuses. Her voice was slurred. I tried to explain to everyone that it wasn't true.  Jude's friends who did speak to me, told me she was never cheating, and one even mentioned it was a misunderstanding. My own friends - such as Marley who I had known for years and is a teacher; and Mina, they told me to run for the hills - that it wasn't her first 'rodeo' and asked why I wanted to be with a druggy. I didn't listen and I told them to delete me and was just too blind in love and didn't want to give up on Jude - because I felt like everyone else had given up on them. That they'd just get worse with drugs and die. I didn't want to give up when I had loved someone so deeply, that everyone else had given up on. 

I contacted her ex - on Instagram who confirmed everything. That she was even messaging him but he smelled the bullshit, that she was a scammer. He told me on the phone to let her die.  In my idiocy, I contacted her and told her that I loved her and cared and that even though all the people told me what she was, I didn't want to think of her in that way. She contacted him and threatened him and he refused to speak to me; knowing what she's done to me now, I wish I had just realized that I should have ran but I didn't want to be like the rest. I wanted to help her.

I contacted her friends and family, tried to explain the truth - as she continued to tell them lies about me. I tried to speak to them to explain everything wasn't true, and that she needed help for drugs but nobody would listen. I tried to speak to her and she gave different reasons each time, I tried to ask if she even loved me, if I ever meant anything, and I got confusing answers or none at all. I called the police a few times in her home country to try and get them to help her with her drug usage, but they did nothing besides calling her mobile phone; her dad told me on the phone that he didn't care if she was on drugs. Her mother living up to her reputation that she didn't care what Jude did anymore. (Probably because of all the shit Jude did as a kid; there were tons of 'missing' posts on her moms facebook because of the times she ran away to do drugs and mischief)

Eventually her friends realized I was telling the truth - they spoke to me and told me things  and this angered her. She was **EXPOSED** \- people began to trust her less and they realised she wasn't who she said she was. She swore to 'get me back ' on Snapchat but I didn't listen. I didn't think anything of it. And she reported me to the police on April 24th - claiming I had WIRETAPPED her, hacked her facebook, Instagram, email, and that someone of my 'likeness' had taken her Snapchat and stolen images, such as nudes. She claimed I was going to kill her dog, her boyfriend and her. She claimed we were never in a relationship and that I was calling her phone hundreds of times.  (I did not know about these claims until the arrest)

I told her how much I loved her that I didn't care and that everyone makes mistakes. I just felt that I had given my love money and she was going to use it to buy drugs and kill herself and wanted to 'save' her by getting her to seek help or just getting her friends to get her to. I even contacted her parents but they still didn't care. Even though she lives with her dad now - he didn't care about what she did.  I opened a court case in her country and eventually closed it because I felt like it wasn't worth it, and I wanted an apology - I tried to let her know that if she apologized, she could keep all her 'gains' but I spoke with someone who works with children who have autism and they claimed that someone with autism will rarely apologize. I then stopped the case myself and emailed the 'Judge'. I then messaged her to let her know that I wasn't doing the court case because I cared for her and her wellbeing. And that I loved her still despite everything she had done. (These emails are all still on my email address)

She then messaged me in **June** on Snapchat, and I was in shock - we were talking and I had the bright idea to record so I downloaded the app and began to record what was happening, she was sending me snaps and also letting me know where she was. I pulled down on the top of the screen to show the date, and she also sent a snap at the same time of her in bar. She said that I belonged to her, and that if I 'dated anyone else she would know'. I loved it. I thought my love came back. But by this time I had been crying a lot so I stopped believing in fairy tales, so I noticed she was playing games with friends - I messaged one who didn't know me, and he claimed she was calling me a stalker - he then invited me to a Discord server where she was shocked to see me and then began to speak erratically and scream - and swear that she'd slit my throat. I told her to block me and she refused. I messaged her friends and family to make her do it. That I was too weak to do it. That I just feel responsible for her because nobody else gives a shit and that I am tired of this and that they need to take responsibility and told her parents to be 'actual' parents and do something about her.

I was quite upset so I asked her why she kept insisting on doing this, on lying, on trying to unblock me just to speak to me and possibly get things, and treating me bad but I got nothing out of it.

Eventually I got so fed, I just spammed her to block me. She unblocked me on my Facebook and I just spammed her with it non stop. I asked her friends (NICELY) to tell her to block me and even explained why. I was brutally honest - that I loved her so much that I was worried about her daily and couldn't get rid of her. But she kept insisting on posting lies about me, and I noticed a guy she was playing with who she was sending love hearts to, and so asked him to make her block me - I stupidly called him and texted to make her stop lying - because her instant opener was to make up claims about how I tried to rape her along with the usual lies. 

I said ""If it's true just BLOCK ME"". One of her friends who did ask her to block me was met with a block himself and she said ""You are so SELFISH"". 

Naturally, I wish I took a step back to see what was being done as I would have slapped myself the moment I thought it was a good idea to trust someone like this in the first place.

But I  just kept spamming her to block me and that she had a choice to come back and be normal because we were meant to be spending time together on my Birthday - and if she hadn't come back by then I'm done.

ARREST

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I had police come and raid me over 7 days ago, at 1AM. I was arrested; they took not only my things but took anything they could find. They took my phone, my PC, my nephews belongings (???) such as a really old amazon fire tablet, his games console, the television box and the router. 

Her claims from April 24th Onwards:

\- &gt; I had Wiretapped her phone to listen to conversations - **Complete lie**

\- &gt; I had hacked her social media - to steal her photos **Complete lie** \-&gt; I have conversations etc that would make no sense  (Their words were, someone of my likeness hacked into her account - they were reading a statement)

\-&gt; I was spreading her nudes -&gt; **Complete lie** \-&gt; The 'worst' picture I have of her is her in panties and a vest with bra. 

\- &gt; I had threatened to KILL her, her 'boyfriend', and her DOG! - **Obviously complete lie**

\- &gt; That I had sent her things and made up a relationship - **Complete lie**, I have WhatsApp conversations, Emails where she's confirmed parcels, Paypal transactions etc. 

\- &gt; That I was calling her phone - *YES as I was worried about her  - that even after everything she did, I was trying to get her friends to help her and then to block me if she had no feelings, but she went back and forth because I felt like giving up and eventually got fed up and asked her to block me.*

&amp;#x200B;

I was stupid and didn't take legal support at the time - I was so stressed I was in a cell for the first time, and I was overwhelmed with fear and just panicked. The police were nice and the interview didn't last long. They asked me why I had done things, and I explained the story and they seemed to understand completely.  I had to hand in my passport and they gave me bail and I'm meant to return on the 20th. I have a ton of screenshots on my phone and a ton of proof that I was never even abusive once, but I did call her and her friends a lot - but for a good reason. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Post arrest

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

But the moment I got out, family absolutely destroyed me. I am a monster to them. I never told them about any of this. I kept this to myself because I thought nobody would understand or care for her like I did, because when I told people about who she was and the things she did they just said to leave and the drugs would be the revenge. But I never wanted the drugs to kill her. So I tried my best to the end. I never did 99% of the things she's saying. But my family said if the police went this far, then I am doomed. They said I should 'watch the news' and that I've ruined my life.  I am a teacher - and I realized that even a caution basically makes me unemployable. I won't be barred but it will be impossible to get work abroad, and at home - and that all my dreams will be crushed.

I keep thinking of a screenshot from her which is on my phone which was sent by her at the end of June where she laughs at me and says ""Knock knock"" ""It's the police"" as a threat - but I ignored it. 

I spoke to some solicitors and most comfort and say I should be completely fine - but I am overwhelmed.  They took so many electronics, stuff that wasn't even mine.  People say it's because they have one goal and it's to convict me. A lot of them are asking me for A LOT of money £1500 just to come with me to the police station on the 20th July - when either the police release me without charge, they charge me with a crime, or they extend it to investigate longer (which IS CRAZY), but  I wish I had could pull myself back and run when I had a chance because she knew how much teaching meant to me and this is her revenge. To try and make me kill myself.

It really hurts, because I honestly was trying to be the best person and every time I hear a noise outside my window I keep thinking it's because they're here to take me away, and the stress is overwhelming. Even a police caution is a death sentence. I would happily sign a form that means I would never enter her country if it meant I wouldn't get a blemish or any punishment.

She's clearly way more intelligent than I ever anticipated, and I feel like she has zero concern about me. She doesn't care what she does to me and I wish I knew that sooner. Her ex warned me and said she thinks she can get away with anything and she was dangerous. I should have listened.

Now I don't really know what to do.

TLDR:

Drug addict Romance Scammer who I thought loved me deep down, reported me to the police and now I think I ruined my life cuz I called a lot (never abusive). 

Idk what to do. I feel like a really dumb Tyrion Lannister except I don't have a champion or someone to take me away to Daenerys.  I feel ashamed of myself not only because I fell for her lies and her scam but because now I'm scared my whole career is in jeopardy.",13Jul2020,1

This has been a secret from all my family for years and I'm scared of what my dad would do to us if we ever told anyone. This has been affecting me, my mom and my siblings' mental health and home situation, which also happens to be extremely strict in islam. Me, not believing in islam has to hide the fact that I'm an atheist which is slowly tearing me down day by day. On top of this, my dad tries to be in control of my whole life; He forced me to tell the bank he has permission to access my bank account, meaning he can take any money out that he wants. He got me a turkish citizenship, since he is from Turkey and he got me the citizenship when I was little. I do not want this citizenship and on top of that, I have army duty there because Turkey still has mandatory army training. All of these problems are overwhelmig me and I am scared of how secure I will be in the future. Does anyone have advice on how I can or should deal with any of these problems? I'm genuinely scared of my dad and believe he would turn to physical abuse if I do as little as talk back to him.

I need some kind of structure, Anything I can truly look forward to. I've found that without that, the days just drag on. Days and weeks go by and it means nothing at all. With nothing to look forward to, I genuinely have motivation to work, lose weight, or even live.

990,"I'm in the middle of taking private lessons at a driving school. I feel like my progress has been good. I'm 22 and just now learning how to drive. I've put off learning because of anxiety.

The school I'm at right now specializes in people with anxiety and disabilities. They've been a great help.

I've had quite a few lessons. I plan to take my test next month.

I feel like I really need to work on parallel parking and reverse. With parallel sometimes I'm too far from the curb and with backing in sometimes I get too close to one of the cars on one side.

Yesterday during my lesson I was practicing reverse parking in a grocery store parking lot. The instructor had me try to back into a space next to a truck. As I backing into the space a dude yelled ""HEYYYY!!!"", and I looked behind me and a man was at the truck and he was looking at me like I was crazy. I put my hand up to say sorry.

I didn't even see him walk to his truck and my instructor didn't either. However, had I been paying better attention that wouldn't have happened. I was so focused on backing into the space that I didn't check to make sure there were no pedestrians around.

My instructor said something along the lines of, ""Oh that guy saw that we were backing in, he could've waited.""

I disagree. It's my responsibility to make sure the coast is clear when I was trying to back in.

I just felt really bad after this. I could've hit him.

I will definitely be a lot more careful next time and make sure that before I back into a parking space to double check for pedestrians, etc.

There's no way I would ever be able to afford that... It's either therapy or eat if thats the case. The lady on the phone was incredible though, and she said the price may be an issue, and suggested a website called ""BetterHelp"" and another similar too it.

I dont see what she has to gain by turning me away from her place of work to another, so I trust her when she says that. The problem is, is that BetterHelp cant prescribe medication, and $180 for something im not even sure will actually fucking help me is fucking stupid.

My wife may move to New Zealand and take the kids with her to take care of her mother, I am supposed to go but my own mother is not doing well either. My mother has a boyfriend who has been unemployed since I met him maybe 3 years now and I know he’s a leach and my mom spent all her money on him even the stimulus check. Every time I see my mom she’s getting skinnier and skinnier. Now I can move back home to Cali and take her out of a bad situation that she can’t choose for herself which is her disability and she does receive. Up close it looks like my mom is all there but there some mental thing that non of my family is telling me she has why she gets disability but I need her in my kids life for as long as I can. But if I move to New Zealand with my kids And wife I believe in matter of years not only my wife’s mom but my mom will definitely be dead and cosmic energy.

997,"To be honest this year is taking it's toll on me. A few years ago after my fathers passing, which I saw, I slipped into a very deep and traumatising depression. After various attempts on my life I finally got help. Last year, I finally felt happy again. Like I was myself again. And then my partner [27M] left me, we dated for 7 years.

It was a huge setback, I finally finished my treatments and that happened. As if I csn not take a moment to enjoy life. During that same time my grandfather passed, my best friend [26F] and I got in a fight and oh yeah my suicidal thoughts were back. During all that I got my degree with good grades. But that never really registered. It is like constantly living in survival modus. I finally learned to relax a bit during therapy. Theh told me, not always bad things happens when you relax. I now know I can't relax. Everytime I do, something does happen. 

Got on my BD a negative performance review at my job, they gave me 6 months to improve. And trust me I did improve. Hours and money spent on training, I set up meetings every two weeks to review my performance. To see if everything was going according to plan. My manager told me he saw improvement, that everything was good and great. Yeah well last official performance review was negative too. The reason? Lack of experience... I worked from home everyday in my crappy apartment, made tons of hours more than needed, did everything well or so I was told. But oh well, they wanted someone with 5+ years experience and I don't have that... No shit you knew that when you hired me. I found another job, but I know I'm not gonna make it. 

I've met with a therapist. But.... that cost me all of my savings. In the end not worth it. Still depressed, still on the verge of ending it. And now I'll be probably kicked out of my apartment because I accidentaly broke one floorpanel while cleaning, goodbye 1500,- deposit.

I'm not saying that all is bad this year. It's not. But most of it is overwhelmingly negative.",13Jul2020,1

999,"Last Monday I woke up feeling weird. I felt like I was sick but wasn’t super sick, I could just feel my body was trying to fight something off. I rested the whole day but Tuesday I still felt off and had to call out of work. I had chest pressure, a bad headache, a dry cough, I felt congested and stuffy but had no mucus and my nose felt dry. It was all a weird feeling I hadn’t felt before when I’d been sick. I felt sick but like a different type of sick. I felt hot but not a bad fever; everyone I told was worried I had caught covid so I got worried that I got covid. I felt worse on Wednesday and scheduled a covid test for Thursday morning and got that done. By Thursday I was starting to feel better.

Fast forward to now I can feel like my body is still trying to fight something off but feel way way better than a week ago. I had the last of my bad symptoms on Friday. I’ve been lucky to be able to get this last week off from work and my job has been understanding. I’ve felt guilty that for the past few days I’ve felt able enough to work but not at work because I do not know if I’m positive for covid or not. But I also feel uncomfortable going back into work not having gotten my test results back yet. The nurses said it would be 5-7 days and my roommate told me she and everyone she knew who went to that testing site for their results in 4 days so for me that would be today but I have yet to hear anything. I’ve been checking every few hours everyday despite knowing they would email me. 

My manager messaged me today asking me to come back to work tomorrow despite not having gotten my test results back. I can understand why, being a man down for a week can take its toll on the business and my coworkers that have to cover for me but I also feel uncomfortable being asked that seeing as the virus is spiking and I live in one of the epicenters of cases, in south Florida. I asked if we can wait one more day just to be safe. I feel like I should definitely get my results tomorrow, but I feet guilty asking because I do feel capable of working. I just want to be safe and not risk any of my coworkers. My manager hasn’t responded to my message. 

How can I tackle this situation?",13Jul2020,1
1000,"Hello Reddit,

For the past few months, I have been lonely as hell. Nothing to do, unable to do anything and the future looks like nothingness, an abyss if you so will. The pandemic had forced me out of a job without any furlough pay (in the UK) and I had to drop out of university due to personal reasons for myself and the family and it was too much to carry on. Also, I have no motivation to study online at all which ruined the university experience and my studying schedule.

This year has literally ruined me as a person. I attempted suicide this year after I had crashed my car and wasted thousands of pounds which I saved up whilst at university. I'm sitting in my room with nothing to do and no one to talk to and tbh I have been used to it since March. I very rarely go outside with anyone.

I want to move abroad, Spain or the Netherlands - I speak both Spanish and Dutch very well and I know I'll live a much better life there but I don't know what to do.

I have applied to jobs but every place has rejected me and barely have any hope for the future tbh. My mother sees me quite low, never says hi to me, never asks how I am. I feel like the shit underneath the shoe and she shuts me down anytime I contest with her with anything she disapproves of.

Say anything you like, sorry, I've had a really shit year and even worse past few months.",13Jul2020,1

1002,"Hello everyone, as the title says, I got into an awkward conversation with the guy I'm going out with. We didn't fight or anything it was just...weird. 

Pretty much we were talking about how easy it is to find tutorials on how to do 'illegal' stuff on the internet, and I said something like 'You're probably interested only in hacking' (he's an IT graduate) and he just said 'who knows' in a joking manner. We were bantering and having fun like that until I said something like 'Oh tell me what you look up, I'm curious'. 

He just said 'better I don't tell you anything haha' so I just continued making jokes like 'It's not like you're reading how to rob a bank or anything lol ' and ' oh come on I'm not going to judge u or anything unless it's stuff on hurting people'.  


I think he misunderstood me somehow? From that point on he said something like 'calm down' and ' i shouldn't have told u' and I was like '????'  
After that, he sent me a vocal saying he wasn't turning into a criminal just bc he was reading stuff like that.   


I was dumbfounded. I had to explain I wasn't accusing him of actually doing anything illegal and I was just bantering and having fun...  


He answered 'ok'.  
I said 'great' and that was the end of the conversation.

1003,"Back in March when people were getting furloughed, the company I work for let go of 29 people, with only 9 remaining. I was one of those 9. When it happened I messaged my family group chat to let them know what was happening, and they asked about one of my colleagues that they all know and who used to babysit me and my sisters, I told them she didn’t make the cut, but not to mention it to anyone because for all I know, everyone at work might not have found out their fate yet. But, because of my sister, word got back to her and she essentially found out she was being furloughed because of me.

I only found this out today, because I was talking to my boss and he happened to mention that they had a date for another colleague to come back, so I asked when but he said he wouldn’t tell me because he knows that I’d tell her, and labelled me a gossip, then filled me in on what I talked about in the first paragraph.

So essentially, I found out today that my boss thinks of me as a gossip, even though I only told my family because they asked specifically about this one person. At the time I didn’t think too much of it, but the more I thought about it, this means he’ll never trust me with any information that isn’t supposed to be known by everyone, I’ll definitely never be in a managerial position because of this, what with managers obviously needing to know things before their staff. 

I’ve been there 6 years, I’ve had 2 pay rises, one sort of promotion (assistant manager) but I don’t actually have any manager tasks, I think they just wanted to give me a pay rise because I was doing well, but they wanted a reason to do it. But now I know that my boss thinks I’m a gossip, which means I’ve basically peaked, I’m never gonna climb any higher up the ladder, because I know he’ll never forget what he’s labelled me.

I guess I don’t have a specific advice question, I just needed to get it all out there and if anyone has anything to say in response, go for it.",13Jul2020,1

My father was rushed to the icu last night after a fall, he was bleeding in his brain and they performed surgery to relieve pressure.

Or what to do to plan for pallative care.I know what his final wishes are but I'm 27 and have not had any experience dealing with courts,wills, or funeral planning if the worst happens. I dont even know where he put all his paper's and important documents.

 I'm barely holding it together right now and I don't know how I'm going to carry on if he doesn't make it. I cant stop crying. I want him to recover we had plans to do things together (father/daughter) and now I fear that I will be burying him instead.  I was hoping/ planning on moving out but those hopes are in the toilet now, ive been a full time caregiver twice already I cant handle the mental toll it took on me a third time.

1011,"I'm part of a wedding party for an old friend. For some background, I am in graduate school and therefore do not have a job right now. I am recently married and my husband is working but we are just making enough to get by. When I considered the role of bridesmaid, I was clear that there needed to be a budget if I was to accept. So far, I have spent close to $800 on the dress, alterations, hair/makeup appointment, travel, and a gift. $800 is a lot for me but I understand that being a bridesmaid can be expensive. The maid of honor (MOH) reached out to me saying that she was now planning a spa day the day before the wedding (giving me 3.5 weeks in advance notice). I have previously shared that I will not be there until 8:30 PM, due to travel. Despite the fact that I will not be there, I offered to pay for the bride's pedicure ($70) because I want to make sure she has a special day and I want to help out with the cost. I also said I would buy a bottle of champagne and split the hotel room that the bride and bridesmaids (including myself) will be staying in that evening. As it is only myself, the MOH, and one other bridesmaid, things will be split 3 ways. I've already spoken to the MOH about my needing a budget, but when I asked how much I owed her for the hotel she said we could settle it after the spa day, hotel stay, etc. I repeated that I would need a budget because as a graduate student, I have to plan my finances in advance. The response I got was that ""we are doing this as a gift for X.""

I feel hurt that when I was transparent about my finances, I was not met with understanding, but rather dismissal. I don't know how to respond. Do I call the bride and explain the situation so she doesn't hear it secondhand and think I'm a bad friend? Do I call the MOH (whom I have never met in person) and talk about it over the phone so I can explain myself better than via text? It seems like the other bridesmaid is unbothered about finances so I feel alone in my concerns. What do I do?",13Jul2020,1

1021,"tw//alcohol, sex, bad hookups

I was talking to this guy for a while a few years back, when I was a freshman in college. He seemed really into me, based on our text conversations/snapchats. Like, very into me. As time went on over the course of a few weeks, I got really into him, and we didn't really meet in person, just kept talking despite living in the same building. 

After spring break a few weeks later, he lets me know he wants to kiss me, after finding out I'd never been kissed before.  He also lets me know that he drinks to be more comfortable around guys, which is understandable. However, I would, for moral reasons, refuse to be sober in that case. When we finally meet up, I make a point of also being drunk because I'm nervous and something about being sober in that situation is obviously wrong. So on a Thursday night, we kiss, we hook up, etc. (no sex). The next day, everything's great, and it seems like it was great for both of us. Having him be my first kiss definitely amplified my feelings for him. 

That Friday, I am going out with friends and, perhaps mistakenly, was hoping for a round 2 of intimacy. I was with a group of people I didn't know very well at the time, along with friends older than me I was trying to impress. I got hammered, to the point that I blacked out for parts of the night (made a fool of myself, but besides the point). I was drinking heavily, but I think it was also in part due to a shaky antidepressants regimen at the time that I had such a major drunken stupor. One of the things I did was that I was snapping him casually, but because I thought he was taking a while to answer, I would snap-call him and hang up so that he got the notification again. 

After snapping, I *really* don't remember much other than snapshots. I ran into friends on my way back to my dorm, and was apparently extremely incoherent. We ended up making out in the laundry room because both of our rooms were occupied. He may have been only available for a short amount of time? unclear in my memory, though likely. The table I was on actually broke (which I do remember), and we had to fix it before he called it a night. I didn't want to go to bed, and my memory is very fuzzy about this, but I think I was pleading with him to hang/makeout for longer. The last thing I remember is that he had both hands on my arms in a controlling way, probably to encourage me to go to bed. 

The next morning, I snapped him immediately, asking what happened the night before. He was a little colder than usual, so I asked if I had made him uncomfortable. He said yes, and that the reason he was uncomfortable was that I was drunkenly being very lovey-dovey and mushy in what was otherwise supposed to be a quick makeout session. I apologized profusely, offered to give him space, etc. He accepted the apology from what I remember, and he ended off our conversation with **""we should do less love, more lust.""** Later that day, he sent a picture of the table we broke during the hookup as a joke.

I'm still extremely horrified and embarrassed over this. I obsess over it almost every day, and feel so gross about everything. His point of view makes me think that I didn't like, commit assault or anything along those lines, but even still, there is something off about the situation, exacerbated by the fact that I literally have no recollection of much of the evening/hookup. 

I guess I'm asking for advice about what you all think. Did I do something terrible here? Is it even worth dwelling over since I would go on to hookup with him multiple more times (which he for the most part incited), and  he doesn't seem to have any animosity toward me (if anything, he still liked me to some extent and wanted to be friends at a later date)? There were moments throughout this entire time in which I would be made uncomfortable as well, either through weird questions, random nudes, matchmaking, telling me whenever he or his friends saw me on campus, etc. I'm an extremely cautious person when it comes to consent and boundaries and the like, almost obsessively so, which is why this lives in my mind so strongly.

1026,"     Hello good people of reddit.

     Just thought I'd ask for others recommendations on how to go about sobering up a loved one who has a meth addiction. She will just deny it if I confronted her, and she will always have some kind of excuse on why she can't find a job, can't fix her phone, can't do this or that because of this, etc. 

     But if I don't do something sooner than later she might get into more trouble or worse. She's also leeching off my grandparents money which also needs to stop. Plus, I know the longer a meth addict is on meth the users brain will get more and more damaged overtime, eventually leading to a meth psychosis, so the sooner the better. 

     I heard most hard drug users have to go to rehab 6 - 7 times before they finally get the message.

     So, back to why I'm here, how should I go about solving this issue?

1041,"My SIL, whom I am very close with and so is my husband, lives in Florida. She lives on the beach but not near any major city. She wants us to come visit for a few days so we can all hang out before our family moves much further away and we don’t know when we’ll see each other next. Obviously COVID is running rampant in Florida while also spiking around the country, so initially it sounded like a really stupid idea. To be honest, it still sounds like a pretty stupid idea, but it also sucks to know this would be our last opportunity in who knows how long to see each other and spend time together. 

My husband and I have been working throughout covid, but we have very little contact with humans and have been wearing masks every shift. We only ever step out to run quick errands like going to the post office, doing groceries, essential appointments and things like that. My SIL works in a grocery store so I’m sure she’s run into a fair amount of people, but she’s also been properly social distancing.

Would it be awful to fly down to see her? Even if we ONLY stayed at her place (and social distanced at the beach which is literally her back yard)?  Is there any way at all to make this sound sane? I feel so removed from the whole pandemic sometimes because I don’t know anyone personally who has been affected and I’ve been trying so hard to quarantine properly, and I just don’t want to be ignorant but I don’t even know how to live my life anymore.

1042,"Some context here- my younger sister is in her first serious relationship. She really floored it with this guy, moving in after a month or two of dating. My family has been supportive but vocalizing concern for them from the get go (she has never been one to use judgement or consider consequences). 

A week ago, she caught her boyfriend soliciting nudes from girls in his hometown. He denied, blamed her and ‘relationship issues,’ blamed his troubled upbringing, grief over his fathers death, and ‘everyone is coming between us’ for days before he finally just admitted to fucking up. I am livid he did this to her and that he had the audacity to try and lay blame on her before he begrudgingly admitted it was his fault. I am sad for my sister, and I have vocalized as much, but we have a tense relationship and she believes I am judging and trying to tell her what to do. Ive been giving advice like “please put yourself first” and “he will do this again and get better at hiding it.”

She has been silent and not contacting us for several days (she called the entire family and told us what he did the same day) and I made the assumption she has decided to stay with him. I reached out today to ask how she was doing, and she confirmed they are “going to work it out.”

I am scared for her and what will happen next. How do I continue to let her know I am here for her without pushing her further away? She has always barreled into decisions without thinking first thoroughly and they tend to have terrible consequences that she does not acknowledge or confront. I worry about her retreating further into this toxic relationship and losing her.",13Jul2020,1

It's got to the point that I feel quite sorry for the guy because it's hard to imagine what sort of home life could shape a personality this way, but I'd like some quick and easy ways to shutdown pretty pathetic claims and - from what I can tell - straight up lies. Bearing in mind I'm living with him (along with others moving in soon) for a year, so insults - as satisfying as they would be - wouldn't be good.

It's not the type of competitive drive you'd admire in someone running their own business, or training for a place in a sporting event, it's a petty, childish, immature sort. ""my bike is bigger than yours"", ""you're really just taking your time aren't you"", ""oh right yeah you need to learn a lot more"", ""would that be big enough? ok good luck with that xD, good luck!! xD"", ""it's a pretty simple job really, \*no offence\*"" and similar, along with the classic achievement listing.

I'm not the most socially skilled person there is. I'm not the most affluent in the world of dating, either. I need advice on how to begin. After going to an all-boys Catholic high school for four years, working at a construction company and on a farm for at least half my life, and having very little time for anything else, I know for a fact that things are about to change, much of which I am excited for but also nervous about. I don't know if I should be blaming my lack of success with dating completely on the fact that I have had no time to do it or on the fact that I really don't think I'd be any good at it even if I did have the time. I don't really know what I'm looking for but I just would love any and all advice you could give me. I want to become the type of person that perhaps not that girls could love but that the right girl could love and would love. I don't know what I need to change about my looks. I am pretty fit, mostly because of the amount of physical labor my life requires with all the work on the farm and with construction. I am also afraid that my hobbies, including fishing, swimming, hunting, and pretty much everything else outdoors, are not the types of things that either allow for much socialization or are very attractive or helpful when it comes to dating.

1055,"I (31F) have a fun job in my field of interest (tattoo artist). I have always loved art, drawing, painting, creating, art history. For years, I knew I wanted to do something art-oriented for a living, and I just kind of fell into tattooing by accident.

It’s a great job and I love it, but I’m not sure if I can see me doing it forever. I’m the kind of person who likes change, whether it’s a new hobby, new environment, or career. I feel like I might want to do something else in the art field at some point.

In my early 20s I went to university, and basically messed about for three years and failed. IO learned nothing and it got me nowhere. At the time I was dealing with severe depression, I hated my course, my art school was frankly a bad one, and I feel like I was too immature.

Just recently I got a job as a pool renovation labourer, I was extremely excited to get the job because it would mean that I could earn up a bunch of money for UNI next year but after my first few shifts, I already want to quit.

&amp;#x200B;

My main problem is with the guy I work with ""Carl"". The business only has 2 people other than me working for them, the owner and Carl but the owner is a bit older and can't really do much labouring so its just me and Carl working all day. 

Carl told me on the first day that he is ok with mistakes as long as they are not stupid mistakes and that I should ask questions whenever I am confused or need help. The problem is whenever I ask a question so I can understand what he is telling me he immediately gets angry and either explains in a very condescending tone that doesn't make me understand the situation any better or he tells me not to worry about it and moves on. So I cant actually learn how to do my job better and understand what I'm meant to be doing or what he's asking me so I make mistakes or ask for confirmation which angers him more so he has a go at me and doesn't bother explaining what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

The second problem is that Carl has 5(ish) minute lunch break in the day and since I'm working and need to be helping him all day I too only get a small break meaning that I barely eat anything the whole day. I spoke to my boss about this and he said that I should just take a break when I need it but since he isn't there I can't because Carl needs me to work.

&amp;#x200B;

Yesterday is what really makes me want to quit. I was yelled at basically the whole day, I thought by now Carl would be better but it was worse, I hated every minute of working and went home depressed and stressed out. I now dread going into work, my stress makes it hard for me to eat and I can't enjoy being with my friends or family because I'm thinking about work.

I spoke to my boss about Carls anger and he said to just ignore but he also said that a lot of other workers had quit because they couldn't deal with him which doesn't make me hopeful for the future.

1065," **Background;** 35 years ago my mum dated a neighbour of hers they were first loves and all that, he essentially won the lottery, moved to another continent and forgot about his old life and my mum. Long story short, mum moved to said continent and had 2 kids by another abusive man, first love “rekindled” what they had but never put her first and was essentially the other woman :( Last summer they actually started dating for real but he’s very emotionally and verbally abusive.

**issue** None of my mums relationships have been successful, it’s a mix of bad choices and she never stands up for herself so they walk all over her. my sis and i had an intervention with my mum on Sunday telling her that she needs to leave the guy bc he is very abusive, she said she wanted to break up in person not over phone call. I said it was a bad idea because he’ll end up putting the blame on her somehow and making her forgive him.

Tonight (Monday night) he came to our house and began his emotional abuse, an abuse scene came on tv and my mum confronted him and tried to break up (i wasn’t there but could hear from my bedroom). 30 mins later he calls my sister and i to talk to him ... basically my mum told him that we had concerns about him that needed to be addressed :/ i just wanted mum to leave him and now she’s making us do it basically. She said that my sister and i had issues with his drinking, the way he talks to our mum, fat shames her and that he’s an alcoholic.

He tried to explain his behaviour but i didn’t care because this is what abusers do, i’m aware of it. He thinks it’s all sorted but took no responsibility. How do we make him go away ?

Should I get my mum to leave him by text ? My mum gave him a key to our house.

Despite having this aggressive cancer my dad is still able to do basic day to day things and doesn’t like sitting around. I’ve tried telling both my parents that if they’re going to insist on going to the store themselves my mom needs to go. But my dad still goes occasionally. I realize I can’t make them do anything, and they’re being careful and wearing masks when going to the store.

The bigger problem is my 21 year old younger sister.  She still lives at home with them while in college, and she will not stop going places/being around other people. She regularly hangs out with groups of friends, and is planning on going to a gender reveal party in a couple of weeks. I’ve tried talking to her multiple times and she ignores what I tell her. Her response is that she’s not going to live in fear. I told her that’s fine but her actions could potentially kill our dad. She dismisses this also. 

I’ve tried talking to my parents and they agree that’s she’s being immature and shouldn’t be doing what she’s doing but they won’t do anything about it. My mom keeps saying “she’s 20 years old I can’t make her do anything”. I’ve told my mom to make her get a job and move out, but my mom thinks that would be mean.

If she wants to continue doing what she’s doing she can move out and support herself.

1067,"Okay, never really did a post like this before. So I am sorry if this seems like a rambling mess lol.

I moved towns back at the end of February of this year. I left a good job but provided proper notice of my resignation. I left the job on good terms.

 But my roommate, in the new town, got a job offer out of town and I could not afford the home on my own. So back at the end of May, I moved back to my original town.

My previous job told me, before I moved, that their policy is: If you come back within 6 months, and had given your two weeks, and there is a job opening, you are immediately hired back at the same seniority level as when you left. I followed the process and submitted an application for an open position back at the end of May (as soon as I knew I was moving back.) The application stated that I was a returning hire and its status said ""Recruiter Reviewing"" for all of June and the beginning of July. Well, last week, it switched to a status saying I was not selected. Even though, according to their policy, it is supposed to be immediate as long as there are openings. It is an essential business and is ALWAYS hiring. My friends who are still employed there say how they are so desperate for help.

So do I continue to try to get back in to this job?  I have been emailing and leaving voicemails on their answering machines. They just keep giving me the run-around. Maybe I am just paranoid but I feel like they are trying to drag this out so that they can get me past the 6 months so that when I am hired back, I am a New Hire and lose my seniority and pay level. 😅

I am asking this because this area is an extremely small town. This job is the ONLY reason I chose to move back here. Other then this job position, every other job in this town is minimum wage and part-time. So I am trying to figure out if I should keep hounding this job to adhere to their policy. Or just move again to another larger location and find a new job?",13Jul2020,1
1068,"22 male here. as a child i struggled with body dysmoria, sexual trauma, and depression. i met this girl, and fell for her hard. extremely long story short, i let alot of my problems ruin our relationship and turn her bitter and cruel towards me. i became wishy washey, i ended up getting another partner to avoid having feelings for her as i felt i was broken and not good enough, i constantly came back to her and then left over and over. this, obviously, enraged her but she would stay and deal with my bullshit. then it got to a point where, wed fight, and shed start insulting me, calling me down to the dirt, and i would just sort of take it like a bitch because i felt like i was garbage and she was right.

she ended up up leaving and never coming back years ago, and while im in a good spot in my life right now, with a partner for four years, about to go to school, great friends, I still find myself having nightmares about the nights wed fight and wishing shed come back to me. not even romantically, she was just so important to me and I loved her so much I am having such a hard time letting go.

i hurt her and im struggling coping with that. and its strange, as I've hurt people in the past and acknowledged that it was a mistake and ive learned from it. and i acknowledged ive learned from it with her to, but, i cant seem to accept it was a mistake. its just her. for years shes been a hole in my heart, and im not even sad while i write this, im annoyed and a bit empty.

ive tried to contact her a couple of points through the past like five years, and every time she insults me and jokes that im pathetic. i know im not, i just wish i could get her to understand how much she meant to me and how sorry i am and how ive recovered from all my issues and i wish i could have a friendship with her. but i know this is not possible- i know that. yet my heart wont accept it. 

has anyone else had a similiar situation? does anyone know anything that can help me cope? i know im on the path to recovery, i know i will heal from her some day. but its just hard right now.

thanks a bunch",13Jul2020,1
1069,"I'm 19, and my mom married my stepdad when I was 2. I have always hated him, and I think he's a piece of shit, but I've never viewed him as a creep, and he hasn't really made me uncomfortable until a few months ago. My stepdad has always been verbally and emotionally abusive towards me, my mother, and my sisters. That isn't super relevent, but I feel the need to explain why I already hated him prior to his recent creepy behavior. Anyways, over the years I can admit he has changed for the better in some ways. He's still an asshole sometimes, and I still hate him, but he's more or less just left me alone for the past few years, and I honestly think that's the only way for us to coexist. So, when I randomly decided to tell him about how much I was struggling mentally, and that I had been having thoughts of suicide, he was very sympathetic, and hugged me. Did I like it? No. Was I gonna be a dick and push him away when he was just trying to comfort me? No. So I just awkwardly hugged him back and then went to my room, no biggie. I guess I should've tried to make it clear I wasn't comfortable with him showing affection to me in that way, because he started asking me how I was feeling, and then hugging me a lot, and a lot of times when I'd try to pull away, he'd either hold me there, or only let me go for a second before hugging me again. Okay, no big deal. I hate it, but whatever. Then he starts smelling my hair and telling me I smell good when he hugs me. Fucking wierd. Then his hand gets closer and closer to my butt when we hug, until he literally just has his hand on it. Literally disgusting. Then at one point when he's hugging me I thought I could feel an erection. Absolutely repulsive. For some background, I was molested when I was a child, not by my stepfather, but either way that kind of trauma made me extremely paranoid. At that point, I was freaking out, crying myself to sleep, and I was scared to be home alone with him. My mental health somehow gets worse, and I decide to tell my mother what's been happening. My mom was obviously concerned but didn't seem nearly as upset as I was hoping she'd be when I told her how he was acting, but she talked to him, and he stopped the hugging for about a month. I figured that'd be the end of it. Of course it wasn't though, otherwise I wouldn't be on here! A few weeks ago he started up the hugging again, this time without the butt touching or hair smelling, which made me think that maybe he just didn't realise that he was crossing a line before. I still fucking hate the hugs, but I didn't feel nearly as uncomfortable, so I'd deal with it. Then he starts complimenting me, which wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't something he has literally never done with me before, and he only compliments me when I'm wearing tight or revealing clothes, he either compliments my outfit, or my appearance in general. Like I said, this wouldn't bug me if it wasn't literally only when I was wearing shit like leggings and crop tops. Then I started to notice how much he'd just stare at me, especially when wearing tight clothes, it makes me incredibly uncomfortable, and just grossed out in general, especially because he isn't particularly subtle. All of this I could've brushed off as me being paranoid if it wasn't for another hug where I thought I could feel his erection! It might be important to note that at the begining of this year, a month or so before the first incidents with my stepdad happened, I got a boyfriend, and he boosted my confidence a lot. I never wore clothes like leggings, crop tops, bodycon dresses, or tanktops until I met him. It's gotten to the point where I'm scared to wear anything at home that isn't just a giant t-shirt and sweat pants. I wore a v-neck shirt and leggings today and noticed him staring at me several times. Another thing I want to note, is that my younger sister, his biological daughter, is CONSTANTLY wearing short shorts, tanktops and croptops, so I don't understand why me wearing them would be getting any kind of attention unless he's being a creep. I'm really not sure how to handle this situation. I'm obviously extremely paranoid from what happened to me when I was a kid, and I'm not going to act like it isn't possible that my paranoia is getting the better of me in this situation. Either way, I am extremely uncomfortable and scared to be at home with him, or wear anything I feel confident in. I don't want to bring this up to my mother again unless I'm sure that this is an actual issue, because it did make my mother upset before, and he also yelled at me for ""accusing him of wierd things"" I'm sorry this is so goddamn long, but I'm panicked right now, and I just want help.",13Jul2020,1
1070,"So, a online friend of mine, a little while ago about a few months or weeks ago in my DM's told me that if they come online asking for the date to tell them and send them away. I know I'm clearly poking my nose in my friend's buisness, but i didn't quite expect it to happen so quickly, or for them to, well sound so different.
Their normal way of speaking is very friendly and playful, using all the shortened stuff, but when they messaged me, they spoke in a completly different mannor, almost the complete opposite and it scared me a little, but i forced myself to not say anything, and send them off of the chat app as they instructed
I looked for reddits and saw this one is r/advice so i thought maybe this could provide me with an answer that might help. If not, I apologise and will take this question elsewhere. 
This is my second time using reddit, so I apologise if this doesn't make sense/is just really weird/if im in the wrong subreddit, i'm just really lost is all.",13Jul2020,1
1071,"A few of my friends are meeting up without me now restrictions have eased. Before the lockdown, we spent the year hanging out, drinking, going to the pub and clubbing etc. Usually there would be about 8 of us. However, 4 of the girls I wasn’t really that close too ended up ditching us completely. The reason for that is because they didn’t like that their friend( in the original 8) was spending all the time with this boy(also in the 8). 

I understand their perspective, considering she barely contacted them anymore and slept every night with the boy for about 2 months straight in our house, even though they aren’t in a relationship(friends with benefits). Either way, there were many times before they split that it would just be the 4 of us(3 guys including me and one girl- the girl sleeping with my friend). 

The reason I know they’re meeting up without me is that she literally took a picture of my door where I live. My door has a funny sign on it shall I say. And I asked her why she was there, and she told me she was with the others. I didn’t even want to give her a reaction. I’m more upset at the fact that I was sent a picture of my door( in a house she doesn’t live in) rubbing it in that I wasn’t invited. And it probably wasn’t intended that way, but it shows that a lot of people don’t think before they do. By the way, I haven’t fallen out with anyone. 

Sure you can argue people can meet up with whoever they want. But I think it’s messed up you exclude someone who hangs out in the main 4 a lot, and then send a picture showing that you’re meeting without them. I have other friends I’m meeting soon. However, the reason I wouldn’t invite the other 3 is because they’re not friends with them. They don’t get along that well, and so it would just be a bit awkward and pointless. They didn’t hang out with them all of last year. I was mostly hanging out with the other 3 but sometimes with my other friends. 

I think that problem is that I’m expecting too much from people. Butter  I do think a lot of people are horrible at times and don’t think about other people’s feelings. I live with one of the people whose excluding me and I’m pretty sure he’s the one organising the meetings. We’ve been friends for 2 years, and I introduced him to people when he had no friends at all, at the start of college.I could of never gave him the chance. I also introduced the girl who sent me the photo to the guy she’s sleeping with( the guy I live with). So it’s kind of more messed up. 

I’ve introduced a lot of people to my friends who didn’t really know anyone. And they even said themselves they felt much better since finding friends they got on with properly. Never get any sort of praise for it though. If someone took a chance on me when I had no friends, and introduced me to people who I clicked with, I’d never forget what they did. And I’d definitely owe them one but that’s just me. Having friends at college can make things a lot easier and I had no obligation to help anyone when I already had people I knew and hung out with. 

My question is how should I respond and cope with all of this. Is there any reason to point this out as I don’t want to give them a reaction. Do I just cut them out completely. I think the guy organising it is the guy who’s deliberately excluding me, even though I live with me. I suspect the other guy probably suggested me tbh, we got really close last year. The other thing to mention is that I was introduced to him, by the person I live with. I wish all of this didn’t affect me the way it does.",13Jul2020,1

1073,"I (15F) am using the summer to improve my time management skills for the next school year and whatnot. However, even while I am doing something, my Mom (45) keeps giving me reminders, which I think are unnecessary because if I listen to those reminders, I end up being more reliant on them and that’s what I do not want. For instance, while I’m watching some videos on the laptop, my mother would give me a reminder to do something, and sometimes it gets repetitive to the point she’s nagging me to do it. I keep telling her that I will do them, and in the end, I do end up doing what she wants me to do anyways. However, the fact that she keeps giving me reminders bothers me a lot, and I believe holds me back from improving my time management skills. I’ve tried to tell her to stop giving me reminders but she has the set belief that I would never do them if I was not given a reminder. The way I interpret time management, it’s to make a plan and do things without being reminded. However, my mother keeps giving me many reminders to do many things around the house, and I would like to work on my time management skills without any reminders from anyone. Is there a way for me to talk to my mother to stop her from giving me constant reminders to do something?

1074,"I have a close friend who is the top of our class, in the student council, never swears, essentially a model student. This friend has 2 other friends both of which are in the top percentile of the class, and they often talk bad about her when she’s not around (normally before she comes to class). I don’t know if I’m right but I think their jealous of her as well as they also talk about how they think the Teachers are biased towards her because she gets selected for advanced classes, and how the fact that she is in the student council let’s her get more opportunities.   We are changing our classes next year so there is a chance she won’t be with the same people next year, but I don’t know if I should tell her about how I feel as she trusts them a lot and I don’t know if I’m just over reacting.",13Jul2020,1

1076,"Hi everyone, I (22f) recently posted on here (cannot find the link but it was about my mother unfairly raising ky rent and my peace just being constantly disrupted). After getting some advice from everyone I decided to let my bf(26m)  know how I felt about my current living situation and he suggested we find a place together. 
I'm excited but keeping it on the downlow from my family until we've found a place. 
The thing is, I've never lived anywhere except with my parents. I have quite a few questions and answers to any of them or just general advice would be great!

-how do i politely tell my parents I don't want them to know where I'm moving to, but that I'm planning on telling my sibilings (who still live with them)?

-ive heard a lot of people say that moving in together causes a big strain on a relationship, what can i do to hopefully avoid or at least navigate through any growing pains/adjustments?

-how can I keep some ""me time"" while sharing a space with another person? (I love my bf but i'm very introverted and need alone time to recharge)

1077,"Ok so my girlfriends parents happen to be out of town, I went and hung out with her for a little before we both went to work this morning but I wanna see her more because we both live in strict houses. 

So my proposal is sneaking out. I already asked my dad about sleeping over and he said because she gave me a hickey and my car won’t start I can’t sleep over. I have a bike and skateboard, sadly the bike is stuck in my garage. She lives about a 15 minute bike ride but with there being no traffic late at night the skateboard ride shouldn’t be much longer than that.

I have two issues primarily. One, I live in south Florida, and I do not know if police will stop me and make an issue out of seeing me skating down the road early in the morning. And two, I have a set of keys but the front door is very loud and we have a even louder screen door. I can sneak out the back through a quiet sliding door but if my stepmom gets up and sees it’s unlocked I’m locked out and have to use the front. Any tips?

1079,"So, this has been bugging me for sometime. I currently study engineering, and have an awesome curriculum in it. An internship in a major company, an award for the best internship project in the year I worked there, a first place at a national engineering competition between universities from all my country. Also, I was an exchange student for one year in another country.

However, some other things I also have from university are two major cases of depression caused by it, low self-esteem and an absolute disdain for what I did at my internship, what I study and my work possibilities as an engineer. Sincerely, I hate what I do and I don't feel like I wanna work with it for the rest of my life. I fell that everything I do is meaningless.
Sometime ago, nonetheless, I involved myself with voluntary work and found out something that I like doing and has meaning for me: helping out people - in that case, I used to teach children from low income families. 

So ever since that, I think about trying to go to a med school or becoming a teacher (two professions where I feel like could help people for a living), but I'm nowhere as ready to take an acceptance exam as I was when I finished High School. Also, I feel that maybe I'm too old for that. In the best case scenario, if I get into med school next year, I'd be 24 and would only graduate when I'm 30. My parents would be able to provide for me, but I really feel bad about it.

What should I do? Should I try it? I talked to my psychologist already and she told me a lot of people only have this realization when they are 40, but by then, it's much harder to make those kinds of changes in their lifes (I guess it's the famous ""mid-life crisis"", maybe?) and she's glad I'm already taking some steps to change mine.
My mother told me she would be okay with whatever I wanna do and she'd support me. However, I can't help but feel like I'll be a failure if I need my parents to help me sustain myself until I'm 30. Also, I'd feel bad for all the time I ""wasted"" in my current major.",13Jul2020,1

1081,"I posted in r/amitheasshole about this about a week ago if anyone needs more context on the situation. 


I’ve been dealing with a lot emotionally and physically in these last two weeks. I had to have emergency surgery, I might have cancer, and my dog also had to be put to sleep. I’m also very behind in work because two other people in my department quit, on top of all that.  

There’s a girl that I’ve known since we were teenagers and I’m trying to fade out of my friendship with her. She is very needy and immature. She wanted to talk to me last week because she is thinking about quitting her job. She has been thinking of quitting her job for the last year and a half and complains to me about it every single time I get in contact with her. She doesn’t listen to anyone’s advice and just complains about the same thing over and over and over again. She’s not even struggling financially or anything, she still lives with her parents so she is very close with and they pay all of her bills .

she wanted to FaceTime last week fully knowing why I had been through, after staying at the hospital for two nights and then putting my dog to sleep the next day. She still wanted to FaceTime to complain about her job because no one else would talk to her apparently. I told her that I needed to be alone and that I would call her later in the week and she got really mad and called me a bitch and a shitty friend for not wanting to talk to her (mind you, I had surgery on my mouth and it was very painful to talk).

She texted me again today, not even apologizing or acknowledging what it happened last week and that she wants to talk to me on FaceTime about her job again, and that she really need someone to talk to. I feel bad for ignoring her but at the same time I’m so done with her bullshit and wish she would just tell someone who cares, because I don’t anymore.

So this September, my girlfriend is going to start working at an accounting firm where she'll start out making a lot of money. Over twice the amount I make starting out.

Now I've heard that in some cases a lot of relationships tend to fall apart due to the pay gap between couples. Some saying that the breadwinner (the one who makes the most) expects more from the other because they internalize worth based on income, do subconsciously they'll see the other as ""lesser"" If this is really the case, I'm a bit worried.

Should I be concerned? Is there anything I should be looking for if this happens? This is also coinciding with us moving in together which I feel two changes at once might add to the stress.
