1,"I am a “nurse” at a nursing home and I am planning on putting in my two weeks on Monday. The reason I put nurse in quotes is because they originally hired me in April as a nurse and when I show up on my first day they have me working as a med aid. When I explained to them that I was hired for the nurse position all they said was “we don’t have med aids, we hire nurses to act as med aids so you are technically still a nurse, so sorry for the confusion, but you are going to be on the med cart” ...this was not the job I had signed up for, but I stayed as their med aid anyway because they promised to train me as a nurse as I was fresh out of nursing school. I got two training days. 

Just for fun here are other reasons I want to leave: 
-because of the incompetence of the facilities ability to handle the pandemic, I got coronavirus which ruined my sign on bonus (the only stipulation was that I had to work 30 hours a week, I had to be off for corona and couldn’t work the hours so I lost the last 500 of my bonus) 

-they make their workers work DANGEROUSLY understaffed which is not safe for the residents at all (I’m talking 1 nurse and 2 aids to 4 halls at night). 

-the highschool, talking behind your back, drama bullshit (a coworker that I have barely spoken to said this to me the other day: “hey, don’t take this the wrong way, but are you pregnant? Your hips just look a lot wider.” I was not pregnant -_-)

-management handles a lot of situations with the residents with little to no care at all like putting off things that should be handled the same day just because management needs their weekend off. 

-they call me nearly every one of my days off and try to convince me to come in because we are understaffed (I have been saying no or ignoring them more recently which has been making management pissed) 

-other employees will work five 16 hour shifts in a row and get mad at me because I don’t want to pick up crazy extra shifts like them which makes me not look like a “team player”. 

-i HATE the schedule. We will work 4 days, get one day off, then go back for 3 more. I also work the evening shift and I HATE it. I feel like I never see my family anymore. 

ANYWAYS, I feel guilty for quitting because we just had this hurricane blow through and while my facility was not effected, I already know it’s going to make me look bad wanting to quit right after a natural disaster because I’m sure there were some employees who’s homes were effected, but I can not stay at this job. It is deteriorating my mental health. I was going to put in my two weeks last week, but I ended up evacuating for the hurricane. I really just want to give them a weeks notice, but I feel like I should just give the two. I feel so guilty for wanting to leave. I really hope I don’t chicken out on Monday.

Anyone have any tips or advice? Do I just give my two weeks to HR if my boss isn’t there?",30Aug2020,1
2,The title say it all my daughter told me today about her boyfriend I'll call him J now I don't know much about J but he seems like a pretty decent kid but I'm just kind of bothered by the gap in there age.

3,"I'm 29 years old and I'm considering going to technical college, but I don't know what to go for. I'm afraid to just jump into something because of the financial trouble that could come from choosing a path I either won't like or won't be very good at.

The things I have boiled down are going to be either in the Business, Health, or IT fields.

Business I was considering mainly accounting. I've heard that accounting is the heart of business and I figure it wouldn't hurt to go down that route just to be able to have the skills to organize and budget my own finances, since the most reliable path to wealth is through.managing and saving.

Health I'm not to keen on,.mainly because.the vast majority of jobs revolving around nursing are not very appealing to me....I just don't think I would handle nursing very well, being yelled at while I have to clean up body fluids is no bueno. But I have considered things like Physical Therapy assistant, Surgical Technology and just about anything else with tech in it. But I think the biggest thing would be PTA and eventually go to University to become an actual PT, but idk...

IT is the most open ended field for me because I know absolutely nothing about it outside of Programming and Computer Support Tech. I know.absolutely nothing about computers, but I figured that college is there to teach you, so why the hell not? It seems like a good field to get into due to the expansive use of technology and the internet, so maybe a good investment.

So that's about all I got at the moment,.if anyone would like to chime in with advice or experience I more than welcome it, I beg for it.",30Aug2020,1

I have 0 ideas on what i want to do for a career and every time someone suggests something like oh why don’t you do something with computers they don’t get that just because i like being on the computer and playing video games doesn’t mean i’m computer literate in terms of coding &amp; softwares.

-teaching
-anything involving computers

I go on the computer and play games to be chill and relax when i have time, not to work. Its just so frustrating that people sort of pressure me but continue to give me the same career ideas they know damn well i would not pursue because I either don’t want to because i’d be miserable or just don’t want to because I don’t understand shit.

5,"I (20) have a friend whom I have known for a while now. We get along very well, do a lot of stuff together, have just about the same sense of humour, flirt sometimes and have (in my opinion at least) great chemistry. I can feel myself falling in love with them.

We're both the same sex. And I'm pretty sure my friend is straight.

8,"I worked at Mcdonald's all summer before College. I would have been eligible for a $2500 scholarship had I worked there 90 days, but I was just shy of the 90 days when I left for College. They told me as long as I would come back for holidays, I would still be employed. I told them yeah, I would come work on holidays, so I was supposed to get my scholarship in about 12 days (that would have been my 90-day achievement). While moving to College, I misplaced a paper I needed to file for the scholarship, so I had my grandma go ask for another copy since she still lives nearby the site.

9,"I asked in another thread what percent of men shown to women on Tinder have defined abs. One woman said seeing defined abs was ""rare"" (which is what I would expect) but then went on to say that by ""rare"" she meant **30% of the guys she was shown had defined abs**.

Wtf?

Where on earth do 30% of men have defined abs?

I have been trying to get buff for years and I will spend the next 2 years working out obsessively to try to overcome my shitty muscle building capacity. But if 30% of the guys Tinder is showing women already have abs and probably they're also taller and better looking plus a better race that seems like a losing proposition.

I've read bodybuilding threads where people typically guess at most 1-3% of the young male population has abs. Doesn't that then clearly imply Tinder is only showing the top 10% of men to women?

How else could 30% of the guys women see on there have defined abs?

Will getting buffer myself make any difference at all if I'm up against a cohort where 30% of guys are already buff and probably white/black so bigger than I can get naturally as well?",30Aug2020,1
10,"I'm 23 years old and until I was 18, I was lied to and told that my dad was someone else. My family did this because he was abusive to my mom. She lied to him and said that I wasn't his daughter, and to never come back. I had been looking for him on/off for 5 years. Recently, I decided to stop looking and be appreciative of my  family that I DO have and the people who acted as father figures to me.

And as life goes, when you stop looking, what you want comes. A friend of his/my brother's who I had contacted 5 years ago called me and said that by chance he spoke to my dad today. Apparently he hurt himself and was in physical rehab for 2 years. He told my dad about me and my dad was absolutely ecstatic, he said he had his suspicions. He was so eager and wanted me to call him tonight but I told the friend to tell him that I need to process this and will call tomorrow.

What do I even say? What should I ask? I found out from his FB (which he just recently made un-private, which is how this all happened) that he's a Trump supporter. He goes on RAMBLES to himself on his selfies. He's friends with girls who look like porn stars too. So I'm really nervous for that aspect. Also, he lives in FL and I'm in NY, so there's no way he'd be able to get to us and I'm going to lie about where we live.

11,"So we've had this one tenant for about 5 years. She was also the lady that would find us other tenants and get service charge for it, that's what she does for a living. A year or two ago she lost two of her parents at the same time and we felt pretty bad for her so we lowered her rent and stuff like that. Anyways, years pass and she begins to agitate us. She starts to come up with excuses about late payments and from the other tenants we discover that she has a drug problem and constantly brings a different guy to the house. The area our house is located in is a kind of family friendly place and the other tenants are families so they are worried because of her.

Moving on, because of the pandemic she said she is jobless and is unable to pay rent so we ofc gave her 3 months to chill but 6 months have passed now and she isn't giving us any updates or telling us anything, she is just taking advantage of the situation and living her life (can see her on social media and she is just constantly travelling and going to restaurants etc.) It's fucking annoying basically. She isnt even trying to find a job. My mum eventually told her to move out and she said that she needed a month. We just want her out asap so we were okay with that. 

The problem is though, this lady managed to trick my mum into not taking a deposit from her (big oof), she did sign a contract but the law system is so fuckd up and expensive in my country that, it isn't really beneficial to sue if things go wrong, which they already have, she owes us a lot of money but we just want her out. So at this point we are forced to trust our tenants to do what's right. My mum however, is PARANOID because of this woman. She is so scared that she is going to do something crazy and wreck the place if my mum tries to be strict and direct with her. I keep trying to encourage my mum and tell her that SHE is the landlady and the one that has authority, she could literally call the cops and kick her out in an instant but noOoOo, she might wreck the place out of vengeance. I don't know what to do in this situation! This lady is really making my mum unhappy and worried and we can't seem to get rid of her! JUST now she forgot her keys, came into our garden at 3am, woke everyone up to get OUR ladder. Took OUR table and combined the two to climb the roof and find a way into her block, like, bruh, what the fuck lol.

But, I worked my absolute butt off in high school, I had a job, leadership role on a team, honor roll, good test scores, APs, you name it.

I don’t want to hurt their feelings by giving my reasoning. They also keep suggesting close by schools to them, also that aren’t what I’m looking for. 
But this is continuously being revisited and I need a way to stop this from coming up, it’s become too much of a focal point in our friendship, and I can’t seem to properly iterate that I’m not following them to their school.

19,"I got a second job at a grocery store. I don’t NEED the money, it’s a want. I’m supposed to have my first day there on Monday. So far I’ve only done HR stuff (onboarding) and met a few coworkers with my manager. 

I’m stressing about it now because I didn’t realize that I would be unloading the truck full of frozen foods, meats, etc. I have noodle arms and can barely carry my 30 pound dog up the stairs. I worry that I may not be able to do it and I don’t want to embarrass myself in front of my coworkers. The coworkers I met during my onboarding were also not very friendly at all. Also, my time management skills are GREAT and while I can handle school and two part time jobs, I still want to allow myself time to relax and don’t want to accidentally overload myself.

I need to make a decision on if I should quit my job or not. Should I:

&gt; A. Call and tell them I was under the impression that the job was something different. I didn’t know I’d be the person who unloads the truck or that it would be so physically demanding.
Pros: This MIGHT allow me to tell them that I’d rather work there as a cashier and see what they say to that.
Cons: bad excuse, if they don’t mention anything to me about working in another department I’m out of this second job for good. 

&gt; B. Call and tell them that I accepted this job before school started and am having trouble getting my scheduling straight to allow time for homework and such. 
Pros: I wouldn’t look as bad giving this reasoning, it MIGHT lead to them telling me that I could have a week or two before I start, I would still have a second job.
Cons: I would still have to work the job I probably wouldn’t like though.

&gt; C. don’t quit at all/give it a couple weeks before you come to a decision.
Pros: money, maybe I’ll end up liking it?
Cons: I’ve been stressed out of my mind since Wednesday dreading going to this job and just want it to stop, I don’t want to possibly quit after all my coworkers know me, I don’t want to give the unfriendly coworkers something to talk about/laugh at

25," Hi there,

First of all, I think I have to provide some background on my family to give better context to the situation. 

My father (56) is currently unemployed, but used to be a delivery driver. He has elected to not work and collect unemployment due to the Covid risk and general slow down in business. This was when he could collect the $600 a week and now he's waiting on the new round of  unemployment benefits so he hasn't worked in about 4 months.

My mother (56) is a stay at home mom taking care of two autistic children (16 and 34). They are also provide the bulk of the household's income through government assistance.

I (29) recently moved back with my parents due to Covid and uncertainty about my employment (which thankfully, I'm still working full time) and have been back for about 2 months.

My parent's for the most part have gotten along, with the occasional restaurant, movie, and road trip. Unfortunately, they have also had their fair share of fights, mostly verbal and initiated by my  father. There was also some domestic abuse from my father in the past,  but he hasn't done anything in that regard for more than 10 years (as far as I know). I knew about all this and for the most part just  ignored/tolerated this since its been part of their relationship for a long time. Ever since my father  started staying at home and collecting unemployment, these fights have been frequent. There was a fight not too long ago where my mom collapsed from the stress of arguing back to my dad (I don't know for sure who started this fight, but usually my dad is the culprit). Although they've made up from that incident, it's still at the back of my mind (I thought my mom need medical attention from the way she was breathing).

One day, while I was in the bathroom (one that I share with my father), I noticed his phone unlocked and sitting in plain view. I took a look at  the screen and he received a message from a random woman with some suggestive language. Curious, I took a look further in his messaging app and saw message from 20+ different women, with messages to them ranging from ""I can't wait to meet you"", ""send me more pics"", ""I've been single since January"", etc. (I will post links to these below). I know I shouldn't have been snooping in the first place, but the more I came across, the more I had to keep going. I had so many questions flying through my head at the time: ""Is he physically cheating on my mom (there was nothing I found to suggest he had actually met them in person, but he did request to meet and there were also outgoing calls where I obviously have no idea what was said)"",  ""Does my mom know?"" , ""Do any of our extended family/friends know about this?"", etc.. Frankly, this disgusted me, so I took some pictures of  these messages and confronted my dad privately the next day.

I showed him the screenshots of his messages and he started nervously laughing. I told him to stop doing this, that it was wrong, and I would share this with mom if he continued doing it. He agreed nonchalantly and promised he would stop. I told him I'd check on him, because his tone wasn't serious at all and he agreed again. Pretty quick conversation. A week later, I take a look at his phone while he was sleeping and noticed more outgoing messages to random women. 

I showed these messages to my mom and she told me that she's known all along about this. To her, my dad is only flirting for fun and isn't going further than that. I have other suspicions, particularly due to his suggestions to meet but I don't know for sure. He is a night person and tends to go out around 9pm or so, but he claims its to visit his mother or one of his brothers (who all live in town and also stay up late). I'm not super close with my uncles (they like him a lot and might even cover for him) and have a bit of a language barrier with my grandma, so its a little difficult to verify whether he went or not. Short of placing a tracking device in his car, I have no way to prove he's actually meeting these women.

Back to the conversation with my mom. She says she tolerates this because she needs him for support to take care of my brothers who both have autism. Financially she'd be ok since the bulk off the house's income is coming from my brother's government aid. It's more of an emotional need for the children since my brothers are pretty attached to him. For that reason, she would rather be with a potential cheater than be alone. Although I don't agree with her decision, I will respect it as it is ultimately her choice to make and is the best case for my brothers.

However, I can't respect my dad at all after this. Not only is he committing adultery and verbally abusing my mother, he also straight up lied to me. I haven't spoken to him since the initial conversation we had and he does not know that I checked his phone again. I don't know if I'll ever be willing to speak to him again after this, based on how much he has hurt my mother. Even though my mom is a very forgiving person, I don't know if I can be. Not sure what to do from here, if I should even be doing anything, but it sucks to even see him around the house. I am moving out by the end of September, so I won't really be seeing him anymore outside of house visits, so that will help. Any thoughts on how else I should be handling this situation would be appreciated.

28,"Over 10 years ago my old neighbors moved out due to a major bust that led to a series of arrests.  Since their eviction (?) we got new neighbors and since their move-in, they've done everything in their power to make surrounding neighbors lives hell.

They're the epitome of white trash, though the title is more than gracious considering how these folks are.  They act as they live on a ranch, but we live in a lower-middle-class neighborhood.

They have a son who is in his late teens and this boy has problems.  The police has been called on them twice - both of which have resulted in his arrest.  An ambulance was called once bc he took his anger and frustration out on their wooden face with his whole ass head.  They bought him a dirt bike and he would ride all over the neighborhood all hours of the day and night.

He recently got a car, and for the past 8 or so months he'll wake up midday and race his car around the street, neighborhood and a tree on their property like he's in a derby - his car looks like a junkyard car with a loud motor (idk cars) and he will do so until 5 or 6 in the morning.  Myself and my family are kept up or woken up bc of his ""racing.""

My uncle owns the house kind of, but these folks are on a rent-to-own deal so it is also technically theirs.  We've complained to my uncle and nothing.  We've tried talking to the neighbors - nothing.

We don't have an HOA in our neighborhood, and I'm not sure the cops will do anything other than giving them a warning.  

I'm tired and frustrated, as is everyone on our street and maybe even our neighborhood.

Any advice on how to handle them - even petty - is greatly appreciated.",30Aug2020,1
29,"I’ve been with my insurance agent for five years.  During the last year, every call I made ended up being mishandled.  Every promise of a call back resulted in nothing.  

After the most recent non-returned call, I decided I’d transfer to another agent.  It used to be that I’d have to call the old office to ask them to transfer everything to the new, and this afforded an opportunity for some honesty.  Now it’s just a call to HQ, some keyboard wizardry, and the transfer is made.  

Maybe I’m just Covid-cranky but I sort of want my old agent to know why he lost my business.  It’s really not just crankiness at work but also the thought that he can’t correct what he’s not made aware of.  

So my question is:  do I send him a note to tell him why I’m moving on or do I let it go?   I have the letter written but it’s been sitting on the counter for a couple days, which I take to mean I’m conflicted.  

TL; DR:  Should I let my insurance agent know in writing why he lost my business?",30Aug2020,1
30,"This is going to be a long one so I apologize in advance.
So I am going into my second year of community college as a Computer Science major. I come from a small town and the community college I am in is just not that great. There are some amazing professors except the biggest problem is that it is a pretty small school with a LOT of students. This causes a huge problem when it comes time to register because all the classes fill up almost immediately. 
The computer science degree at my college is not very popular and there is only one professor that teaches all of the classes for it meaning,
- There is only one class of each course each semester
- There are only 10 available seats in the classes
- Select courses are only available specifically in either Fall or Spring
This community college is starting to get on my last nerve because when you try to get help the answer is almost always, ""There is nothing we can do"".
Now, there is a way nicer community college about the same distance as my current one, in a different county. Which means if I enrolled there, I would be paying out of county tuition which is double the in county tuition. 
Here is where the issue comes in (besides the ones with my current college): I planned on going to my states online university (I learn a lot better from online courses). The tuition is about $100 more per semester than the community college outside of my county. I am torn on whether I should try to tough it out at my current college or just enroll in the university and start my bachelors now.
The university I planned on attending offers a community college alliance that guarantees entry to any student that graduated from any community college in the state with their associates degree for tuition of $12,000 or less to finish their bachelor's degree with them.
If I do not get my associates degree first, I will be paying $4000 per semester to finish my bachelors degree (I currently have 30 credits). 
So, basically, I would love to get my associates degree at my current college, especially considering the amount of money I would save, but I am getting SO fed up with how they operate and its seeming impossible to get my degree in my major in a decent time frame. I could go to the community college in my neighboring county, but at that rate, I could basically pay the same amount to go to the university. 
I was trying to save money if possible but I will still have to pull out a loan either way.
If anyone has any advice on what they think the better choice is, anything helps. I am having a hard time finding good guidance because my parents never went to college so they don't really know. I feel like there is an obvious answer here but I would like to hear other people's experiences and opinions. Thank you to anyone putting in the effort to read and respond.",30Aug2020,1
31,"Hi. So there’s this girl I stumbled upon on Instagram, she seems to be my age and I find her attractive.

Thank you in advance!",30Aug2020,1
32,"So, I made a big mistake recently and now I don’t know what to do about it. My best friend B (f19) and I were joking around and I made a comment about her marrying my older brother A (m24) so that we could be real sisters. We laughed about it and she said the idea was crazy and we got off of the phone. Then I went into the family business where my brother works. I happened to see my brother and made the same joke to him about marrying B to make us sisters. He laughed but I could tell his interest was piqued when he asked about her interest. I laughed it off and gave him some sort of vague answer. This is where I messed up, B was coming over to my house that Friday and I had forgotten that I had also made plans for A to come see my apartment for the first time that same day. Instead of being rude and canceling on either of them, I saw no reason that we all couldn’t hang out together. Over the course of the time in which we hung out together I made a couple quips about my previous joke. I noticed  my brother flirting with B and saw genuine interest from him. She was taken aback as she doesn’t handle thing like this well. She has only been in about 2 serious relationships. The next day B and I went on a short road trip and over the course of it she decided to have me send him her number. At this time I didn’t think I would care very much if they started dating. I didn’t see why it would be an issue. Long story short they went on a date and a week later they were “official”. I didn’t really have a problem until I realized what a wedge this is putting between us on my end. First of all, She has basically moved into my parent’s guest house (where A lives) within 3 weeks of them dating. I feel that this is exceedingly irresponsible of her considering this is my brother. I feel that she should take more care and be more cautious In this relationship than others because it involves me and my family. She has also had some very odd times in past relationships, telling me she’s “never felt this way before” and things such as that and then a week later she never wants to talk to the guy again. Recently she told me she feels like she’s going to marry him. She is never not with him and we used to see each other often, now I almost never see her. I tend to feel pretty angry whenever she talk about him with me and I honestly just don’t really want to see them together or hear of it much? I have never wanted to be unsupportive or jealous but I just feel as though she is handling this poorly. And I can’t help how I feel. I find myself avoiding her and not really wanting to talk to her anymore or have her around my home. When she does come the energy is off and uncomfortable. After 4 years of close friendship it’s pretty heartbreaking. She is also talking about moving in with him in 2 months even though they’ve barely been speaking for a month. It doesn’t help that my older brother A and I have quite the rocky relationship. He is not somebody I love having around, nor is he somebody that fits well into my group. I cannot share private tings with him as he is too close with my (judgemental) mother and will tell her. This makes me feel like I can no longer tell B anything either. I’m in a really weird place right now and starting to wish I didn’t keep my circle of friends so small...any advice on how to stop feeling this way or how to go about discussing this with her would be great. Thank you! 

TLDR: My best friend is dating my older brother. At first I approved and even supported but now it’s making me feel less close to her and angry. What do I do.",30Aug2020,1

34,"My dad is 46 years old, and ever since around the start of June, I've noticed some unusual eating habits in him. To be honest, he was never the athletic type or very physically fit. But recently, his behavior became questionable, and he seems to just eat non-stop every single day. He eats a lot of cereal in the mornings. Normally like 5 or 6 bowls or cereal, with the bowl full of milk. I don't know if my dad is lactose intolerant, but each time he has milk, he releases loud, nasty, squeaky farts. Apart from the cereal, he also eats close to 20 pieces of bacon, several hard boiled eggs, and he drinks 6 to 8 cups of coffee. And he also eats a couple pop tarts in the morning as well. He eats way more than any normal person would. The eggs make him so gassy, and he releases silent but deadly farts because of them. And the coffee gives him really stinky breath. Each time he talks, I have to hold my breath because my dad isn't very meticulous about brushing his teeth.

Then when my mom cooks dinner, my dad tends to eat a lot. When she cooks something like tacos or makes a chicken casserole, my dad eats like 90% of it. But the weird thing is that when she makes broccoli or asparagus, my dad doesn't even eat any of it. He apparently seems to only like unhealthy, salty, meaty foods.

The worst part is that his non-stop eating gives him health problems. He goes to the bathroom around 50 times a day at home, and he farts so loud and it echoes around the house. I can hear him release massive diarrhea and burp when he's in the bathroom. Every time he is thirsty, he goes into the kitchen and drinks straight from the milk carton, and then he rips out a colossal, scary fart that resonates for around 30 seconds. He seriously needs to stop eating and drinking so much. His level of gassiness is just plain unacceptable!",30Aug2020,1
35,"I'll try to keep this as brief as possible, 

I recently went on a trip with a group of close friends and I thought I noticed my friend was showing possible interest in me such as rubbing my head(I recently buzzed it), insisting we all sleep in the same room(usually we would separate guys and girls) and choosing to sleep beside me which she wouldn't have done in the past, sitting beside me sharing the same blanket and us resting our legs on eachothers and some spooning in sleeping bags which I didn't shy away from.

We would talk alone away from the group really comfortably together and I noticed her staring once or twice while I was showering outside after a swim. She had never been touchy-feely with me and was actually quite reserved compared to the other girls in that department.

We've been in a tight knit friend group for three years and I honestly never thought about her in that way, I do find her attractive, our personalities mesh well together, we're both quite similar, I know her while family really well and honestly I think my parents have been hoping that I'd end up with her.

The obvious solution would be to ask her out but I don't know if that would ruin the friendship and the group, she's quite reserved in general and I'm  worried that I'm wrong but I have been known to miss out on extremely obvious signals( a girl grinded and sat in my lap at a party and I didn't do jack shit about it, one of many examples).

TL;DR. A close female friend of mine seems interested, nothing direct, should I ask her out and risk friendship/friendship of the group

A friend of mine, once a romantic partner, is getting mental health assistance. To make a long backstory short, we used to date in high school, broke up due to them cheating. Before we met, they struggled with drugs, and once we did meet, they were actively working on getting away from the drugs, however, they had said to me once that they were doing it for me, because I deserved someone better. As flattering that sounds, it made me almost ashamed that he wasn't going to do it for themselves, that they were so down about themselves, that it took another person caring about them to make them want to change, but I didn't want myself to be the goal for them. I wanted them to do it for themselves and it be something they could do for themselves, which could possibly show them that they are better than what they think of themselves. Over the years, we have kept contact sporadically and only for short periods of time due to the new ""girlfriend"" going through his phone and removing me from their social media. I know that I shouldn't be in contact with someone who is in a relationship, however, the times that we did speak, it was nothing more than catching up, seeing how the other was doing, and just being someone that the each of us could talk to at any point we needed it.

In June of 2019, they were arrested and charged with a felony of Assault with a deadly weapon. Though I do not know the extent of the story, nor was I there to be able to tell the full truth, I am skeptical on the whole aspect of it and what the truth really is. I am not naive when I comes to them, I know they have some anger issues, drug issues, and overall mental health issues, but I don't want to assume too quickly either. 

Here in May of 2020, they were arrested again for domestic assault in the presents of a minor. The story behind this was that their dad found them trying to kill themself, and proceeded to step in to stop it from happening. Their younger sister, the minor in the situation, was scared and ended up calling the police, which resulted in him getting arrested. 

For this charged, they were in the local county jail since the end of May 2020 until last week sometime. My purpose of reaching out is that I have reached out to their mom and basically just said that I am rooting for them to make a change in their life, do better for themselves, and start making a change in their life. They don't see the true potential that they possess but I know that it is down to them for to make a change. 

Their mom ended up finding a bed for them in a center that could help him, but when they reached there, it was confirmed that they were much more mentally damaged than expected, and was in desperate need of medication for the current things that they were experiencing. While in the jail, the other inmates began to pick on them, target them, beat them up, and take advantage of them, which caused a lot of mental battles, since they ultimately ended up being placed in solitary confinement for most of the time they were in jail. Hearing voices, deep depression, and even beginning to hurt himself. 

I contacted their mother and she was happy that I have contacted, and is eventually going to tell them that I have said that I am rooting for him and an available source for him to contact as a friend if he would like to. 

They are currently getting medicine, which from when I talked to his mother was actually working soon after they began taking it. It is expected for them to be at this place for close to month before being transferred to the original place that will address the drug and alcohol abuse. Their mom asked if I would like to be added to a call list, if I wanted address so I could send letters, and possibly even go to visit him at some point. What I need advice on is if me being in contact could possibly deter them from their progress or trigger something? I would only want to do this if they agree to it, and are okay with doing so. I wouldn't want them to feel uncomfortable about it.

Again, thank you in advanced to the people who take the time to read this lengthy post, and even take the time to reply. Anything sort of insight would be greatly appreciated.",30Aug2020,1
37,"My ex bf (31m) was convicted of child porn featuring girls aged 3-14.  He is on a register for 2 years and will serve zero time in prison.

We started seeing each other just before lockdown.  He was arrested for child porn in June 2019. He only informed me once he plead guilty in July this year because he had to sign the sex offender register and they have to tell potential or current partners.  He didn’t tell me the age range and was extremely hesitant about the facts during his disclosure.  I found out the details via a local newspaper and whilst they said his name, the court had suppressed his work because it’s relatively high profile.

Anyway, he moved to my city in 2018 and was fresh out of a breakup with a women who has 2 pre-teen daughters.  I was raised by a single mum and I’m also a victim of sexual violence myself.  My mum said I should tell her on Facebook (that’s the only account for her I can see).  However, I really don’t know the best way to go about it.  It is a playing on my mind a lot.

Other question for advice: he is constantly around my flat.  I live in an area with a lot of bars, restaurants, but I’m tucked away on a side street.  He is always in bars at either corner of my street despite not living nearby. It is making me feel paranoid and kinda uncomfortable.

*Apologies for the ramble but I’m upset and can’t think properly just now.",30Aug2020,1
38,"This is my first time posting on reddit, and it’s because I keep thinking about this over and over In my head, and I can’t get any closure on the subject. I think I would benefit from a separate opinion. 

My best friends boyfriend continuously abused and bullied me. He told me I had small boobs and the body of an 8 year old boy. He told me to fuck off and that nobody likes me. He consistently talked about me behind my back. I don’t know why I stuck around and let myself be hurt repeatedly it was extraordinarily unhealthy, and throughout this time my best friend either defended him by saying it was all he knew  or made other excuses. I knew If I told her to break up with him or talked poorly about him that she would probably just take his side and I cared about her. I could see what she was going through with him , he really didn’t care about anyone but the person he would bully was always me. 

When I first met my best friend she had another best  friend named (a?) and a was very kind and shy but her boyfriend was jealous of him and always talked poorly about him. One month my best friend stopped talking to me and then blamed it on a saying he called me immature and she just believed him. ( I’ve now talked to a and he never said that) but she came back into my life and pitted me against a and dropped him out of her life saying he gaslighted her and was manipulative I’ve and toxic. She ignored him and never talked to him again. 
My best friend had also left other friends behind In the past with the same concept of her being the victim of their manipulations. She always plays this victim role, and stonewalls people while telling everyone they’re horrible abusers. This ruins their lives for a short while and hurts them terribly. .. and then she did it to me. 

Over quarantine she left her boyfriend and stayed at my house for 2 months. Over this period my boyfriend was very sick and almost died of liver failure so I was a mess, and found it hard to cope with the uncertainty of his life. (He lived and is ok) 
 She sucked the life out of me over this time, I drove her everywhere , listened to her cry about her ex, helped her craft text messages and agreed with her about her qualms.  She also told me she wished I was single, and would be very touchy with me. In the past she had often made comments like this and she even  kissed me before. I wasn’t ever interested. I helped her get a cat and find a new place eventually, and she started seeing a girl we both knew. Over this time she started to ignore me , even when I was in a lot of pain over my bf being In the hospital and not knowing if he would make it. I called her out for ignoring me and always cancelling plans and we ended up having a long talk. During this talk she told me 
- I took a toll on her mental health 
- she shouldn’t have stayed at my place 
- I ask too much of her 
- we shouldn’t have held hands or told each other we loved each other (even though she always initiated the hand holding) 

After we fought about all this she ended up taking it all back and crying and trying to hug me but I had had enough for the night and I left telling her I’d talk to her about it tomorrow. 

After that she completely ignored me.. completely stonewalled. Answered no texts , declined all calls. 
I showed up at her house with the packages that kept coming to my house and she told me to leave and that she didn’t want to talk, that she needed space from me.  &amp; to bring packages over and leave them there when I got them. 

5 months have gone by. She has told everyone I’m manipulative and abusive and that she was the victim of my abuse. She told our mutual friend I was in love with her . She told other mutual friends I asked for too much. She mostly said she could spot manipulative people and I was one of them. She told everyone to be careful and not to hangout around me. 
I still see my friends but this caused huge detriment to my self perception and still has. It seems like a projection and I fail to see how I could have come across as manipulative. It hurts me terribly that this is how people could see me now because of what she says about me. 

I don’t know what to do because our mutual friends mean a lot to me. I still see them and they don’t think I am the way she says I am but it still scares me. The way she abandoned me and demonized me is really hard to get over 

We know a lot of the same people, a lot of them close friends , a lot of them get tattooed by me and are my clients, and I hate that perhaps she has opened up this way people might see me as now. 

How did I get over this, how do I figure out how to deal? Could this all be a projection on her part? Could she be the manipulative toxic person, or could her statements have truth? (I truly don’t see how)

42,"Okay backstory: I had my daughter when I was 20. Her dad had been sober for 8 years and relapsed shortly after she was born so I left him and raised her on my own. I struggled a lot, was always financial emergency (I’m talking $400) away from losing everything. He got sober when she was ~5 and has been extremely active in her life since then (he is an amazing father and I LOVE their relationship)

He was always Hesitant to help financially- I can’t say he hasn’t helped at all but let’s say maybe $200 every few months. Financially it’s been 98% me and I was drowning in San Francisco. The tech industry moved in and made it even harder. We lived in a TINY studio, that I paid an arm and a leg for and I was drowning in debt and- just to keep this short I was miserable and hanging on by a thread.

My family lives in New York and they offered for us to come to NY to get my head and my financials straight. The agreement with her dad was he would have her summers and he begged us not to go but accepted. We have made it work and moving has changed our lives- after my parents helped I was able to sustain a really great job, make good money, and get back in the black and out of the red. It was the best decision I’ve ever made, but all along my daughter has been saying she wishes we never moved. She is so unhappy here and even though her quality of life is much better, she just wants to be close to her daddy.

I am considering going back to SF but my family is staunchly against it. (For selfish and selfless reasons- they don’t like not being able to see us and they worry about how expensive it is and whether it’s sustainable for us- I make more here and pay less) They helped me a ton getting back on my feet and part of me feels indebted to them for it. But it breaks me into pieces thinking staying means hurting my daughter. I don’t want her to resent me but must of all I don’t want her to feel trapped or miserable because even objectively- she needs her dad. 

My own personal reasons for staying in NY is that SF was crushingly lonely for me; I had no family, no friends, nothing there for me. Also NY has changed my life. I Love where we live, I love the atmosphere, I feel safe, accepted and at home. 

New York is better for me, but SF is probably better for my child.

43,"I’m (19F) in college right now, living with my Dad. He turned on time restriction for WiFi as I was staying up late a lot (When I was online schooled) and he didn’t trust me. I deal with mental health stuff that made it significantly hard to concentrate in school and so, I would do homework at night. Of course, being a kid (I’m aware 19 is not an adult, but just from a legal standpoint in what I consider this as absurd), I fucked around a bit and would play games at night too, because my days were filled with stress and a complete inability to focus, so I’d try to relax by playing games and talking to friends.

Fast forward, I game basically once in a blue moon and it doesn’t last long. I’m now 19 and stressed because I still have problems focusing (I’ve tried many medications, homeopathics, working out, none of it has worked, but I’m testing a new medication right now) I still continue to struggle with mental health, trying to find the right treatment and when you get on certain medications, it can just make you sleepy. So I’ve slept a bit, but nonetheless I still get my shit done when I can. My depression has made my life difficult in doing something as simple as brushing my teeth at times, but my Dad’s remark is “Have you gone outside?”. It’s so frustrating. I’m sorry, I’m getting off track. He says he talks to me like an adult, but won’t treat me like an adult because I can’t do something as simple as keep my room clean 24/7. I’m sorry my mental health is fucking debilitating and getting out of bed in the morning is exhausting. He says he knows I’m not being lazy, but proceeds to contradict himself.

Anyways, I’m a college student now, I’m doing my best with things and it’s my responsibility as an adult to make sure I do my works, take my notes and do what I need to do. I told him I needed to use his tablet again tonight for notes (As I don’t have wifi access on my laptop after a certain time) and now he won’t let me use it anymore, even though it’s for school. I feel like it’s just a matter of him wanting to be in control and it’s so infuriating because he knows what I can and can’t do, what I’ve tried and it’s still never enough. I’m turning 20 soon and it’s absolutely embarrassing to have my wifi limited because I was just a child and wanted to have fun and was struggling, and then when it’s acknowledged I’m struggling, it’s always “Have you gone outside?” I try my best to have a schedule but it just doesn’t stick right now given my health issues that really impact me and then I continued to be put down when I just need adjustments. Being an adult and a college student is about adapting, what the hell.

45,"So I live on an off campus apartment, it’s actually right in the middle of campus but considered off campus. Today I got a message that they need students to avoid all social gatherings and stuff like that. On top of that, I got an email from my building that someone tested positive in the building (obviously they won’t say who) but that got me concerned.

Here’s what concerns me the most. My building rests ON TOP of a chipotle, potbelly, blaze pizza, and a little sandwich store that’s a mini grocery store,  very small but they sell almost anything. There are tables outside with a narrow space to walk through in between the doors and tables. Every. Single. Damn. Day there are around 20-50 people who don’t live in the building outside, crowded around and in these places. Since covid too, chipotle wont let anyone in, but it’s so busy that online orders take 1-2 hours and people from like 2 miles away come over to pick up chipotle. The crowd around chipotle is ENORMOUS. Now normally I don’t care, people are just trying to hang out and grab a bite. But we’re in the middle of a pandemic. And this stuff with the crowds outside my building scares me SHITLESS. 

I currently live alone in a 2 bedroom , and I’ve been living in the building for 2 years, it’s my third apartment in here and I just moved out of my last one because my roomates are party girls. Nothing wrong with that, but I can’t get sick. Not only is me and my family at risk, but I’m one of the only ones who actually have hybrid online AND in person classes. I simply would not be able to pursue my major online, I’m a glass blower and a painter/drawer. There’s only 8 glass majors too, so the circle is small. I take covid very seriously and people are throwing parties. And avoiding the crowds around my building is very hard. I wouldn’t be able to live with myself if I knew I was the one who Infected my friends/ classmates and or professors who may be at risk as well. They express how much they care about us and I need to give them that back. 

I’m just not sure what to do, my parents need me staying as close to campus as possible because outside is unsafe area, but in a college campus where I’m sure the majority of the students just don’t care. 
What do I do? Would it be unreasonable to call the stores or my office building? Should I contact the city or the police?

46,"For reasons too difficult to explain, among them COVID, I'm stuck with my sister at her house, as well as with one of my brothers and my mother. It's been a horrible year, mostly because of my sister, who I think is an emotional manipulator. Already, she does fuck all to contribute anything and treats everyone like they're her maids (I don't let her because I have my pride. I do everyday stuff, cooking and cleaning most of the time, because my poor mother can't do it all alone). She treats her husband like an idiot and insults him all the time. She doesn't even take care of her child properly, except breastfeeding (and I'm sure if she found a way to cut her boob and make us do it, she will).

The reason I think she's an emotional manipulator is, first, everything she does is ""theatrical"". Recently she acted like she was about to die because of a bee sting in a park. Her first reaction wasn't to call an ambulance. No. It was to call her mother and fake her pain to make her worry about her. 24h later, it's like nothing happened, but whenever someone calls and asks, she acts like she's still in pain. This is a drop in an ocean of faking her life to catch people's attention and emotions.

Second, she never takes responsibility. Someone else must be at fault. She accidentally hit her baby's head against the wall? No, it's her brother's fault for not taking her baby because she's tired (as she always is, except that all she wants to do is go on social media). She forgot to pay a bill? It's her husband's fault for not reminding her.

Third, and the worst, is that she always finds a way to make the others feel worse about themselves, and this has happened with everyone in the household (except maybe the baby). Whenever there is a fight, she's part of it. She irritates people by her constant nagging and loud voice. She pushes their buttons, and then acts like the poor attacked victim in all of this, to make others feel like they ""broke"" her.

47,"Hey everyone! I was hoping someone could give me a solution to prevent overnight acne. I’ve started growing my hair out and ever since I wake up with pimples everyday I feel like. I don’t want to just shave my head since I’ve been growing it for 6 months so please don’t just say shave it. 

No matter how much I wash my hair, it seems the oils from my hair get all over my pillow and give me acne. 

I’ve tried a new pillow case every single night, doesn’t work. I’ve tried sleeping just on my back, doesn’t work. I physically can’t do it I have to sleep on my side to fall asleep.

 I’m thinking of wearing a du rag or something overnight but then I’m afraid the oils will just leak through that and still cause acne. Does anyone have any advice?",30Aug2020,1

50," Hello people of reddit, recently - like 3 weeks ago after i had done with lifting and i was sitting, i had as sudden muscle pain. I did not think about it, even though i got sudden bad chills. It did not pass for a week and i could not turn into my left side at all! I went to the doctor whom gave me bandages and pills and told me no workouts or lifts for a MONTH. See normally i listen the doctors (except their diet advices f*ck them) but i had made such a progress and now i am going to lose it all. He even said no to HIIT and cardio which yes i already tried them but it only made it worse so i stopped- So my question is what would you recommend me for an exercise, is doing yoga or pilates hard on the lower back? Because seeing my new showing abs slowly melting away everyday is more painful than stubbing a toe. I forgot to ask the doctor what can i do after he said no lifts so if there is a redditor have the same experience, it would help so much, thank you!",30Aug2020,1

The topic is…. ***Moments that have shaped me*** (a reference to one of the school values RISE is also essential -Respect, Integrity, Service, Excellene). This is a broad topic and can be interpreted in any way you like (school, family, social, hobbies, spiritual etc.).

Since we've had him he has had some sort of neurological disorder that displays wobber-like symptoms(can't run without tripping over his back end and another of non-aggressive anxiety) $2000 of vet bills and blood tests later and he has not been diagnosed yet. 

He's seen a specialist who was not able to diagnose him (after the blood tests he wanted us to send him videos so he could consult a colleague as he has no idea what our boy has) who has now referred us to an internal specialist but this is going to push us into the $3000 range of spending on him which during these hard times is just not feasible for us.

Our dog seems to be happy most days but gets tremendous anxiety from  hard/new surfaces as he often slips on them (he will freeze and lay down), stairs are impossible and he has a hard time when anything in his environment changes.

 I'm making this post because today we are noticing he cannot even finish a walk without falling all over himself.

Hes a big boy (great pyrenees x akita x maremma) and there's gonna be a point where he is too heavy for me to carry.

Are we being selfish keeping him alive with this quality of life?

Should we just keep him happy untill whatever he has becomes worse?

They'll try and get their point across by talking over me, never letting me speak and outright rejecting any alternative viewpoint that doesn't agree with their own. Often times they use condescending tones and undermine whatever I am saying and say things like ""my opinion is my opinion and nothing can make me change"". When they feel like they're losing the argument they just turn away and do something else, ignoring whatever I have to say and this just makes me feel bad about myself and leaves me extremely frustrated

60,"My husband, my toddler and I just moved into a new apartment. We love it, it’s spacious, pretty view and all. But, I’ve run into a problem. I heard music playing until 4 am, so I got up to find the source, just so I could talk to them because I don’t want anyone to get into trouble. While roaming the hall, I heard the person above us saying “I’m not give you any f* food, until you learn to listen, now get off of me and go away”. I was taken back, but went back to bed, thinking it was possibly an animal. (Still no way to talk to an animal, he was very aggressive and mean). Today, after 24 hours, the music is still going, so I try to find it again, and hear him again. This time I hear a small child (maybe 1, guessing from the sound of the voice), say “daddy”. Then I heard the man scream and tell the child to stop touching him. This was alarming to me because I also heard a little child crying and being yelled at just before I decided to go outside. So, IF he was talking to this child at 4 am saying he wasn’t going to feed it, I’m really really scared for the child. Here’s the problem: I stay at home with my 1 year old, and I’m scared that if I say something, I will be putting my baby at risk.

Only for the past year that i have been putting myself out there to meet people and i felt like i was gaining momentum/Confidence but then this ""pandemic"" hit. 

Im also Currently Studying engineering hoping to get my degree in the next 2 years but even in my class there are only a few people and they are all Men Who are very introverted so it can be hard to get a conversation going. 

I was going out to bars/clubs by myself before the pandemic hit but now i cant even do that because you have to book tables and you need to be with a group of people to do so

I cant even have a Conversation or make small talk with anyone at a Store now because most are wearing masks and are trying to keep away from each other

I have started going back to the gym but at my gym its mostly full of older men who have no intention of speaking to anyone 

On my phone i only have three contacts, On my facebook i only have around 60 friends which most of them are family or people that i kind of know. I did try reaching out to my friends from school but they have all moved on and are pretty much busy in relationships or have friends of thier own

I wouldnt say that im socially awkward and im actually pretty good at having conversations with people. I dress well and i take pride in my physical appearance, I have also tried online dating as well but would get zero matches so ive pretty much given up on that. My pictures are all selfies as well because i dont have anyone to take photos with 

I dont think its because of my looks either because ive had quiet a few women interested in me over the years and giving me compliments but back then i was just too shy

74,"Basically, my little sister's EX friend lived with us for some time and then they both had a fallout and she packed her things and left, but she left her kitten Toby with us. (But she took her other cat) Now my mom has told Anna (Little sister and fake name) that she didn't want another animal living in our house since we already had 11 animals (5 dogs and 6 cats) we didn't need another one.

&amp;#x200B;

Well, both Anna and my dad decided to KEEP Toby. Now the thing is Toby is a kitten and is sweet sometimes, but we have older cats and Toby is also not neutered yet. He tries to play with the older cats, then it would lead to fighting. Now Anna and my dad are regretting keeping him. My father has threatened to kick Toby out of the house because we ""CAN'T"" go to Dorchester Paws and let them have him because he said if we did that they would look bad at us and we would never be able to adopt another animal from there. Though I don't care about that, if we don't want Toby living in our house, he should go to a family (Or person) who actually loves him. But my family is scared of what Dorchester Paws would think.

&amp;#x200B;

My mom has also wished to throw Toby out, she yells at him for ""attacking"" the other cats. I have tried to tell everyone that kittens are like kids, you need to give them attention as you would do with a kid. And if you have older kids and younger kids, then the younger kids would try to play with the older kids. So yelling at them for trying to play isn't going to help. I give Toby my attention, but when you have 11 animals that is hard to do.

&amp;#x200B;

Just today, the reason I'm writing this. It is 9:31 at night (While I writing this) and I forgot to give my older sister her mail, well I went to her room and gave her mail. While I was leaving her room and I was in the dining room (We call it our sunroom) I heard meowing, I knew it was Toby, but for some reason, I couldn't find him. I looked and at first, I thought he got out and was at the door begging to come in... No! I find him TRAPPED in this carry on that use to be our old cat's. Someone put him in there, how I know, well first off the zips were up so he couldn't get out. Now I know cats can't do zips, I had asked Anna's boyfriend, who put Toby in the carry one (He didn't know) I'm thinking it was Anna and Toby must have been bothering her or the other cats and she placed him in there.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, what I'm upset about, was that Anna (Or maybe it was someone else) put Toby in the carry-on, and completely forgot about him. He didn't have any food or water in there with him. And when I talked to my parents about, my dad asked why I thought it was such a big deal. He said that Toby was LUCKY that he didn't throw him out the door.

&amp;#x200B;

I find this cruel to do to an animal when their just a baby. Toby is a kitten and just wants to play and he doesn't have any other kitten friends. Also, I would like to say that when Toby bothers my mother, she picks him up and TOSSES him so hard that he once HIT THE WALL!!! She laughed at that. Also, my family when punishing animals, they hit, now I'm not talking about a tiny slap, no I'm talking about a full-blown slap!! For example, I have a cat named Hestia (Yes I named her after a greek goddess!) and the moment I got her Anna HATED her for some reason, and any chance Anna had gotten she would pick my cat and toss her in my room and close the door. Now My cat never did anything wrong but Anna would still do that. One day something happened and Hestia pissed Anna off and she chased her in my room and HIT Hestia so hard that she SLIDE to the OTHER SIDE OF MY ROOM! My mother NEVER punished Anna for it and Anna never apologized. She STILL thinks she did nothing wrong! No wait, SHE SAYS THAT NEVER HAPPENED!!!

&amp;#x200B;

My family always thinks I'm overreacting when they hit one of the animals, I only hit my cat when she decided to be a bitch and piss or shit (Sometimes both) near our garage door or our bathroom door. I never would hit an animal hard, Hestia now is SCARED of someone MOVING their arm because she thinks she's going to get hit. So I don't hit Toby unless he did something REALLY bad, if he's ""attacking"" one of the cats, I get my hands wet and shake them to spray water at him, or I just run up to them and scare them. (It works) But if it was Anna or my mom, they would run up to them and grab Toby, yell at him, then fling him to either to the floor (Which is concrete) or our couch. So am I overreacting?",30Aug2020,1

I asked my brother if he could run me up to the store real quick because I needed some batteries. I got them and then we went to the first food place but it was closed, probably because of COVID. So we had to go back to the fast food place by the store and then back to the hotel.

So we get back to the hotel. It took a bit longer than expected but that's just what happens sometimes. So I get back and I look around and I just catch our dad turning a corner. I look around a few more minutes and I don't see him so I go up to his hotel room. I see him and there's 2 staff members walking around with him. I tell him hey here's your key and he says, obviously drunk because that's what he does every day,""Don't play no stupid fucking games with me, I let you guys borrow the car and I expect you guys to be back in a reasonable amount of time."" He says that the entire state and county is set up against him. He points to some white stain on the ground and says that it's supposed to represent semen and gestured towards the women's crotches while saying it. The older woman was just awkwardly laughing him off and the younger one looked scared, like actually concerned for my safety. He asked us to open our hotel door and he's looking through all of our stuff. I tried to explain to him that it took us longer because the original fast food place was closed and I didn't assume that he just wanted us to come home empty handed especially because the hotel's food is so expensive, but he wasn't listening to it. He threatened to make me go ""bye-bye"" and told be that I'd have to ""take the bus"" for apparently betraying his trust. I don't know. I'm just tired of the constant embarrassment.

79,"*VERY* long post, lots of backstory, anon account... also I'm on mobile so obligatory apologies for all that.

In the summer of 2014, I (29 at the time) was living the typical American ""dream life"" with my husband (28M). We had adopted, through foster care, 3 boys (18, 5, 7 at the time). We had 3 girls in our care also (5, 3, 10mo) that we were likely going to end up adopting. I was within 2 semesters of getting my degree in Education (essentially just student teaching left), working in the school system as I was taking classes. Then tragedy struck, and it was ""my fault"". I'm not going into details here, but there was an accident and my daughter (10mo) passed away b/c of it (no drugs or alcohol involved, that's the first thing people think). The laws here decided it was my fault (they originally went for 1st degree murder, likely because I was a foster parent and they were setting an example) and I was held responsible. I served 2 years in prison. I have been arrested one time in my life, it was for this. I do not have any other record, nor am I a ""criminal"" in the stereotypical sense. We were very upstanding citizens (I still am, regardless of my criminal history).

My (now ex-)husband got a boyfriend while I was in. (This didn't bother me, we had an open relationship, and obviously with me being in prison...) He also backed off of caring for our boys (5 &amp;7). My mother stepped up to support us. She was a work-from-home mom my whole life, and my younger siblings were still in the home. She would care for my boys during the week, get them to school, etc, my ex would do weekends, etc. However that rarely happened unless he was bringing them to see me (maybe once every 2 months; looking back he wasn't very supportive). My mom tragically and unexpectedly died in 2016, about 6mo before I got out. My dad stepped up (they were going through a divorce) and my ex continued not being there. Then one weekend when he actually had the boys (rare), law enforcement kicked in the front door b/c ex and his bf were selling weed unbeknownst to me.... *we* had never done anything like that (they found nothing because they were out of product at the time, and there we no repercussions in relation to the drug charges). The state, of course, took my boys. I was 2mo away from getting out at this point. In the area we live, legally only one of us (we chose him) could be the legal parent (since we are same-sex). The other was *legally* ""just"" a step-parent (me, we had them take my last name). He signed over his rights rather quickly. And with that, my rights were gone, too. The judge wasn't having any exceptions due to circumstances (he basically said there's no way I *couldn't* have known what was going on in my home... even though I had been in prison for nearing 2yrs... but whatever, beside the point). I could not adopt them back, even without my ex in the picture (we knew we weren't getting back together, for me the final straw was when he failed to step up after my mom died, let alone losing our kids). I was/am a felon, and they don't adopt to felons.

My brother and his wife moved to foster/adopt the boys. The plan was that in a year or two, once the fostering process was complete and I had my feet back under me, I would adopt them back from them through a private civilian adoption. Over the course of the next year (2017), there were many red flags that I ignored or was given flimsy excuses about (i.e. them calling my brother/SIL ""Dad"" and ""Mom"", keeping in mind they had already been Uncle/Aunt for most of their lives; referring to me as ""Uncle"" out of nowhere. I have neices and nephews, so it wasn't totally unexpected that they might pick it up from them)

Fastfoward to May 2018. My youngest son (8 at the time) told me, after I corrected him calling me ""Uncle"", he said, verbatim, ""My mommy says you're 'Uncle OP' now."" I immediately lost my shit (crying almost hysterically), hugged my boys, and left the family function we were at w/o really telling anyone what was going on. I had been suspecting that I was not going to get my boys back for about 6mo at this point. This confirmed it.

I called my brother a couple of days later to find out what the hell was going. Essentially, they had decided as early as Aug '17 that they were not going to give my boys back. When I asked (in Aug) to attend meet-your-teacher, they told me they felt it was something they needed to do to help adjust to the change in their household (okay... i guess?). Come to find out, it was because they were embarrassed to explain who I was to the teacher. They essentially cared more about their image than my family. He told me (during the ""talk"") that they didn't feel like I had stepped up enough, which is true. I thought they needed space to adjust, so I backed off (way more than I should have, in hindsight). So, yes, they had a point. But why didn't they talk to me when it was going on? He had no answer for me. He also did not know what I *was* doing, such as renting a 3br house so that I had room for my boys, working 2 jobs to save money for them, etc. He also made disparaging comments about my primary job (retail manager at a store in the mall; literally my best option w/ my record and employment experience...not like I could be a teacher now or anything). And I'll never forget the first thing he said when I asked him what's up with my son telling me I'm ""Uncle OP now"": ""I'm concerned about you going to heaven."" My family was raised pretty religious, but we had all moved away from Evangelicalism... I am now an agnostic atheist. My brother was never super religious, but apparently *someone* got into his head. (His wife was not raised religiously at all, but is the one who wanted to start church, so I wonder...). So, basically, 1) I'm not a Christian, 2) they're embarrassed of me, 3) I wasn't doing enough to help them. I asked him why he didn't think to talk to me. I am his brother, and he knows I would have ""straightened up"" (I wasn't doing anything destructive... I was not boozing all night every night or doing all the drugs...so don't think that. I worked too much for that, and my primary objective was always to get my boys back. I was dating and hanging out with friends, just like any 30-something that doesn't have children at home). He said, ""Yeah... you're probably right"" almost like he had never thought of it before that moment. ""But what's done is done, and you're Uncle OP now if you wanna be around them"". I have not spoken to my brother since. My extended family has taken the ""neutral"" stance, which we all know isn't *actually* neutral. They all still see them regularly so I can keep tabs. I send them gifts for their birthday every year (3yrs now), even though I do not see them. I know my SIL took the letters I wrote them, so they never saw those. (The only reason being because I signed them ""Daddy""). My family doesn't understand why I have an issue with the name I'm called, I should just succumb to their will. I understand where they are coming from, and of course I want to be around my boys. They don't understand how hurt I am (still) or the circumstances that surrounded the ""name change decision"" (that didn't include me). They don't understand that with all of the trauma I've experienced, too have my own brother inflict the death blow with such little regard is too much. It isn't ""just about the name"" for me. It's so much more psychological than that.

My moral issue is two-fold: my brother, my flesh and blood, made a critical decision about *my* family without including me. He did not treat me as person, a father, or his brother. This was not expected behavior; we were always *very* close, never fought. And I found out *months* later from *my child*. Second, I am *not their Uncle*. I will *never* feel like their Uncle, they will always be my children, I will always be their Dad. I couldn't imagine putting them through that psychological mindf*ck, *especially* since my older one was old enough to remember his birth parents and had ""done this once"". I do not want to give the impression that I condone what my bro did, especially to my children. It was inhumane at the most, unbrotherly at the very least. Not the impression I want my boys to have. So I have gone 100% NC with them by choice, and with them my boys not by my ""choice"".

In July 2020, my oldest (13 now) begged my SIL to invite me to his birthday party. My dad got the message to me. I had a crisis of conscious on what to do. I felt like showing up was telling them they they won and I condone their behavior. I also have nothing more to say to them, but still wasn't mentally prepared/able to be around them. I ultimately decided to go. My child asked for me, and there's nothing I wouldn't do for them. Both of my boys cried when they saw me. My older one almost called me ""Dad"" but stopped himself, and never addressed me by any name at all (I could tell it was because he didn't want to call my by my name). My younger one (11 now) just called me ""OP"" w/o the ""Uncle"" part (not ideal, but I'll take it for now). I spent 3 glorious hours with my boys. My younger one did not leave my lap/side. My brother was at work, so I didn't have to deal with him.  My SIL was busy with other kids/guests, so the most interaction I had was ""Either kind of cake is fine"" and a strained, polite ""Thank you for your hospitality"" when I left. 

So here is the advice part: what do I do now? My boys need/want me, but I seriously have no desire to be around my bro or SIL. Seriously, to me, my brother died in 2018. I had been planning for the day my boys are old enough that I can have a relationship with them w/o my bro/SIL being involved, assuming that I would probably not get to see them until they were adults, just to avoid legal issues (my bro doing something legally, nothing extending from my previous conviction) that might come up if I tried to see them sooner. I never intended to see my brother again and I am very much at peace with that.  Now I'm here. I have no contact with my bro/SIL. I don't want to have contact with them. Even if it was just my immediate family, like at Thanksgiving, I would not want to be in an ""intimate"" setting with them. (At the bday party, lots of non-family and kids to distract both me and SIL, so I had minimal interaction, which was a blessing. That would not be possible at other family-type gatherings). I don't want to deal with them at all, I have nothing more to say to them, I said everything worth saying when I last spoke to my brother. I have no interest in BS small talk w/them. 

So, Reddit, what do I do? How can I proceed? I'm at a loss. I want to see my kids. I know I'll never ""get them back"" like we originally planned, but I now know my boys *need me*. I don't even know how to start that conversation with bro/SIL, or who could intercede on my behalf, especially since I don't want to talk to them at all about anything. And can imagine the info they will try to get out of me about my life, etc, and, again, I have no desire to share my life with them in any way. Let alone stipulations they might have for me to see them (again, demanding control over me). Or the judgement for not being Christian, or still ""only having a mall job"". I will never tell my children to call me ""Uncle"", and I will never be okay with them calling me ""Uncle"". *Never*. Whatever happens, I still plan on resuming NC w/ bro &amp; SIL when my boys are adults and I don't have to deal with THEM anymore. The only connection I feel towards them is that they are just the people who are raising my kids. If they were strangers, it would be easier, tbh. I'm just not comfortable with them knowing *anything* about my life (address, phone number, etc, etc) because they gave up that privelage when they cut me out of my family. I literally don't even want to answer the question ""How are you today?"" if it is them asking it. They don't get to know even that.

For anyone wondering, yes, I've been in therapy for all this trauma over the last 6 years. But obviously they can't give me advice on how to proceed here.

80,"I stopped my birth control and my boyfriend knows. He actually said if I stopped, that would be perfectly fine with him, so I did. We’re not using protection, he doesn’t pull out, but I am tracking my ovulation with test sticks. I had a brief conversation with him about what happened if I got pregnant. He said that if I wanted to have an abortion or keep the baby that would be okay. I feel like I may going to get pregnant eventually cause I could slip up when tracking my ovulation potentially in the future. Things that worry me are whether I should trust him when he says that he’d keep the kid? Am I being reckless? Should I have plan b ready? Should I get back on bc?

At the beginning of this year I started seeing this really vivid scene in my head of my younger self being inappropriately touched by a man on a bus. It came in different sections where I first remembered being touched to now remembering the man's face in detail.

I have always had trust issues and a specific distrust of men, which to this point I never fully understood. I also have taken buses frequently for a long time. However, I don't understand how I can't remember this happening. If this really happened to me why can't I truly remember it? 

Is it possible that I have imagined this? Conversely, is it really possible that I could have suppressed this for so many years?

83,"Hello, to start off I am 15 years old and male I am a closeted gay who has no friends or came out to anyone and lives with a very homophobic family. My feeling towards my family is very confusing?

When I was born my parents were too young to be actual good parents 18 I think. My dad cheated on my mom a lot my mom knew but couldn’t do anything. My dad would get very annoyed with me and beat me often. One day my dad threw a glass bowl at my mom and she divorced him and took me with her. I was 6 or 7 around this time. This experience left me with anxiety and depression and my mom was paranoid with Bipolar disorder. My dad has bad anger issues but has gotten better over the years, My mom is still in contact with my dad and they are surprisingly on good terms with each other. I’ve always been afraid of my dad and my mom doesn’t like that I am and wishes I was on better terms with him. My dad never apologized to me but I know he is sorry because he always buys expensive gifts for my birthday and gives my mom a lot of money. He is horrible with his emotions and I know this but I cant forgive him? I cant help it I’m just so afraid of him and don’t want to be around him but my mom and him insist on me getting along with him and doing father and son activities but I can’t. I’ve been gay for a while and I cant tell anyone because my parents and relatives are homophobic and shun me away. If I were to come out to my mom she wouldn’t disown me she would think it would be just a phase and not really take it seriously, My dad on the other hand.... really hates gay people and would probably beat me and disown me. I’ve never had friends because I’m scared of what other people would think of me as a person would they think Im weird and bully me or would they be fine with me but then when they find out Im gay they’ll unfriend me and bully me? . So I’ve always been by myself and never had anyone. I don’t know what’s going to happen when I grow up because I want to become a hermit and live by myself but my mom told me my family will never leave me alone and always be with me and visit me. My dad said he loves me and Im the best thing that has happened to him but I can change this instantly by telling him my sexuality. Should I get in contact with my therapist and let child services take me away or should I stay with my family and be depressed forever because in the future I want to be in a romantic relationship with someone but that wont happen if I don’t leave. What will child services do with me? Will they let me choose a nice family that will accept me and let me keep the three pets that I own? Or will they give me off to a worse family. If I got taken away this will mentally break my mom and leave her a mess I don’t want that to happen I just want to be happy and safe. I don’t feel safe. I don’t feel loved. I don’t feel happy.

85,"I'm 23 years old and until I was 18, I was lied to and told that my dad was someone else. My family did this because he was abusive to my mom. She lied to him and said that I wasn't his daughter, and to never come back. I had been looking for him on/off for 5 years. Recently, I decided to stop looking and be appreciative of my family that I DO have and the people who acted as father figures to me.

And as life goes, when you stop looking, what you want comes. A friend of his/my brother's who I had contacted 5 years ago called me and said that by chance he spoke to my dad today. Apparently he hurt himself and was in physical rehab for 2 years. The friend said to consider that there's two sides to every story with my mom/dad's relationship, and said that my dad sounds stable. He told my dad about me and my dad was absolutely ecstatic, he said he had his suspicions. He was so eager and wanted me to call him tonight but I told the friend to tell him that I need to process this and will call tomorrow.

What do I even say? What should I ask? I found out from his FB (which he just recently made un-private, which is how this all happened) that he's a Trump supporter. He goes on RAMBLES to himself on his selfies. He's friends with girls who look like porn stars too. So I'm really nervous for that aspect.

ttps://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/iik5jf/should_i_tell_my_wife_a_coworker_confessed/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

I had no idea I would get so much feedback posting here. I felt the need to clarify a few things after reading through the responses. 

My wife works out of town and is inconveniently on a business trip currently, ergo the reason I have time to ask for advice. 

I read a lot of people telling me I need to distance myself from this person. I wholeheartedly agree and intend to do so personally, but professionally I am stuck. Upon deeper reflection, this was a huge reason I’m so hesitant to share this information with my wife as I would essentially be telling her that this coworker confessed her feelings and by the way, we still work closely together, daily. I don’t want her to have to have that in the back of her head, even though, once again, I have ZERO interest in this woman. It’s actually going to make my work life more difficult because of the awkward situation. 


I also agree with a lot of comments that this “confession” probably comes from her unsettled state of mind. I’m kind of kicking myself for sharing my experience with infidelity, and to clarify, yes it was my current wife who had an affair. I shared this with said coworker in an attempt to show her that though it’s difficult, it can be worked through. However, because I am skeptical that her feelings are legitimate, I question whether this is something I even need to bother my wife’s conscious with due to the aforementioned reasons. 

Honestly, if you’re still reading this by now and know the previous post, and you still manage to give me advice, I’m better off than I deserve. 


Lastly, thank you to everyone who responded and PM’ed me, this was my first post to r/advice and I had no idea what to expect and you all well over delivered. 

TLDR: Coworker tells me her husband had an affair, then confessed feelings for me, a married man, who just explained my own struggle with a similar situation.  I can’t distance myself professionally from this woman and doubt the legitimacy of her feelings confession, hence my hesitancy to discus it with my wife.",30Aug2020,1
93,"Hello 👋🏼,

I’m currently in a situation that has been stressing me out completely. I’m a college student (22 years old) with no idea what I’m doing. My dad is a disabled vet, so I have free tuition for another 3 years. 

I’m in a dilemma for schooling. I have 60 Credits right now and will have 75 credits after this semester. They are all general Ed &amp; STEM Class pre-requisites (Math,Science) With some Computer Science courses thrown in there. The quickest degree to get for me would be in Computer Science, as all my credits would count towards it. 

The thing is, I took a year and a half break working as a Salesman then Sales manager between school, and failed my software engineering course when I started back (had to build a website from scratch, only know java and some low level assembly) and completely failed the engineering class, even though I made A’s in all previous computer science courses (the pre-reqs)


I really enjoyed sales and wished I had kept my manager job, but it’s a long story why that didn’t work out. In short, they weren’t paying me correct commissions. 

I’m just lost on what I should do, as I love sales &amp; am good at it, but have this free college thing, and realized I don’t enjoy learning STEM. 

So, should I cut my school credit losses &amp; get a degree in marketing with a Professional Selling concentration (even though I already know how to sell) or just force myself to finish a computer science degree? 

Thank You

Tl;dr: I have 60 credits toward CS degree, but took a gap year, was salesman then promoted to sales manager, quit from incorrect commissions, but have free college for 3 more years. Should I finish the CS degree, or get a marketing degree with sales specialization?",30Aug2020,1
94,"Bit of background, though I'm not gonna convey enough through a couple of paragraphs.

22 Trans mtf, I tried to kill myself a month ago, and now have since been very depressed and have taken up selfharm as coping mechanism when I have break downs and dysphoric episodes. My dysphoria had been getting worse and worse for about 2 months before my attempt, but in between these I was fine. Now I just feel like shit all the time, and the dysphoria episodes have gotten really bad to the point I cut a lot myself to distract myself, because it hurts less. Idk if its dysphoria anymore, its just a fustercluck of wanting to not exist.

I'm used to finding somewhere to hide for a quick cry at work due to dysphoria, but it was always easier to hold it in and push it back. Now its affecting my work a lot worse, where I'm about to burst out crying infront of customers, very aggitated and I am stuggling to contain the urges to cut myself to the point where I was stabbing myself with pens or sawing at my arm with scissors. Its really effected my day to day life bad.

I was just wondering what would be the best way to approach seeking help. I've spoken to my Dr and have been given anti-depressents, but I need something on top of that I think? But I'm not sure much on the differences between counselor, therapist, psychologist and psychiatrist and/or what I need myself.

95,"     I (16F) live with my parents and brother and have been stuck at home due to COVID, and I am currently back at school. There is a lot of debate about whether masks help and the discussion of COVID actions has become extremely politically charged. My father (50) believes the corona theories about how it is a ploy by the democrats and all that, along with the fact that masks don’t help at all and are making it worse for the rest of us. (There is no problem believing these things, but here is where it is really getting to me.) He tries to push this on my brother and I. My father and I got into an argument this morning about masks, and I tried to make my argument, but he tried to shut me down so I could not get my word in. I, in response to this, talked over him and was giving my points, and then he asked “would you be willing to wear a mask for the rest of your life?!” I said that if it protected other people and allowed me to get back to a semi-normal life, I would. He then proceeded to walk out of the room, saying “I can’t believe you seriously believe that, you’re being misled by the media.” He really did not want to accept that I did not have the same belief as him, and he refused to listen. That really hurts when you are a teenager. I’m still trying to find myself, and I feel like he is not accepting what I think and expects me to align myself with him no matter what. 

     Now we get to the part about racism. My dad is very outspoken about these kind of things. I really don’t know how to describe what is coming out of his mouth, and what is racist or not. It’s been going on for so long now it’s become muddled. He believes that the BLM movement is not right I guess? And that it has the wrong agenda and there is no reason to riot. He is manipulating his words to become something else to my brother and I. Yet again, there is no reason to not be able to believe these things, it’s just that he keeps pushing his ideas on my brother and I. After being with my family for so long, seemingly 24/7, it’s making me really angry and irritable. When I go to school, I sometimes don’t want to go home so I don’t have to deal with keeping my mouth shut in order to not ruin my relationship with my family. I don’t know what to do now. This argument today was the very first time I got my points in without being forced to back down, yet I feel guilty about it. Do I talk to my counselor or my robotics coach or one of my teachers? I’ve talked to my mom but she will just say it is what it is and I have to accept it. Is there a way I can be able to preserve my sanity until all of the craziness of 2020 (hopefully) blows over? Or am I overreacting about this? I don’t know what to do anymore.",30Aug2020,1
96,"i mean, i was righteously angry because it was a stupid and careless mistake... long story short, our company has equipment that is for events. based on the schedule, each lead person is assigned a set. i almost always get the same venue that has its own special set with extras. weekends are long and hard, so i prepare as much as possible the night before because shifts start stupid early and i don't want to forget anything in the rush. 

well, last night after i went home, someone went into my set and took 1 too many of my ""extras"" (i can spare a few, but there is an absolutely bare minimum necessity). since i had no idea this happened, and these pieces are pretty small, and i had done a thorough check the night before, i didn't notice when i glanced over everything before heading out to the venue. naturally, i freaked out when i started setting up because not only was i one short, another had been left on overnight, draining the batteries. thank god i had a charger and backup batteries, but i had to do some jerry-rigging to make up for the missing equipment. this job is stressful enough without being sabotaged, so i. was. pissed.

my assistant got an ear-full as i was trying to ""plug the hole in the dam with bubble gum"" - i mean who takes shit assigned to someone else without asking??? ESPECIALLY when there's one other set with the same (but fewer) extras NOT being used this time around!

after my hour-long tirade he sheepishly admitted it was him, and he had borrowed them for something else going on at the company WHERE ALL THE OTHER EQUIPMENT IS (i have the only outside event today). he's a newer recruit and still a little green, so he certainly needed a reprimand, but this is japan... just doing the annoyed tongue click is tantamount to psychotic rage (not kidding, they can be real drama queens over any sign of negativity). i was full on whining and complaining, so he probably thinks i want to murder him now, lol.",30Aug2020,1

I told a freind about everything pretty much besides that part and he didn’t really think i was terrible for it or whatever and it felt good to tell someone. I just feel bad cause im pretty close to my aunt and I pretended to be her a couple times online and that makes me feel awful when im around her sometimes. I did pretend to be one of my other aunts too in one random chat room but that was the only time I pretended to be one of my other aunts. 

I also asked random people if they wanted to see pics of my aunts and i think i may have have said hot aunt while talking which makes it even more wierd in chats a few times and posted a few pics of my two aunts in reddit like 2 times.

99,"I'm interested in witchcraft, okay, no biggie. I've already done some research and overall it feels like I am more comfortable practicing/researching witchcraft rather than being Christian.

That being said, my raging Christian mom is obviously not happy. Her views on what I practice are *very* distorted and warped. She told me she was ""cursed"" and was ""possessed"" or something along those lines, and now she thinks she's the expert on witchcraft and she knows everything about it.

Last night she broke down on me, crying and asking me if I had done something wrong. Of course, like any other kid seeing their mom cry, I couldn't stand my mom sad. She asked me to stop practicing witchcraft, and since my mind was flooded just thinking about the ways I could get her to stop, I agreed to do so.

The day after, I feel like absolute shit for agreeing to stop researching on witchcraft. I think she was manipulating me. I was thinking over her actions and it seemed as if she was forcing me to be a Christian with sharing the Bible with me and making me listen to church services, even though I was visibly uncomfortable. 

I want to talk to her about this and tell her, that I have the right to practice what I want. But I'm afraid she'll break down again and probably manipulate me into stopping. I just feel so upset, I need to know what I have to do and/or say to make her stop, but I don't know how, I don't want her to cry because of me. Help??",30Aug2020,1

101,"So I (F16) got my hair cut yesterday. I've always wanted a pixie cut, so I got my hair cut really short. It took a lot of convincing for my parents to agree, but my mother eventually gave in.

 Before I got my hair cut, I asked my sister (18F) if she thought a pixie cut would look good on me. She told me she thought it wouldn't look good on me, and thought that all girls with short hair are weird, or mentally unstable. She also said, ""You don't want to end up like (my friend with short hair) right?"" I have a friend who's a little bit out there and my sister doesn't like her very much.

 My sister's comments about my friend, and my desire for short hair kind of hurt my feelings, but I got my hair cut short anyway. When I got back from getting my hair cut, I asked my sister what she thought of my hair. She didn't answer me, and didn't look at me. I thought that was kind of odd, because we never really argue, and we've never gotten to the point where we don't even talk to each other. But I ignored her behavior, because I thought she was just being moody. Since then, she has barely spoken to me. The only acknowledgement I get is when I ask her an important question and she just nods or grumbles an answer.

 I can't tell why she's acting like this, because it's literally just a haircut. But I'm starting to wonder if she's just feeling jealous of me again, because my mother has told me that my sister feels like I get more things I want then she does. Especially as I was originally told I couldn't get a pixie cut, but my parents changed their minds. The only other reason I could possibly think is that she thinks I wanted a pixie cut because I recently came out to her as queer. She's not homophobic, but she's also not exactly supportive.

 I really don't know what to do at this point. If I could maybe get some advice on how to move forward with this, or if any of you think I might just be overthinking everything.",30Aug2020,1

106,"I’ve been together with my girlfriend for about a year and There has been a block in our relationship. I believe she’s mentally ill. I am not asking for relationship advice.  I need someone to identify the possible illness she may suffer because I need to talk to her about this so we can move forward. I need to pinpoint what’s happening.  She seems to be fixated on specific things. Cleaning in fact.  She cleans to the point where it’s excessive.  She vacuums five times a week. mop her floors and sweep’s every single night before bed. She shakes out the bed every night.  And she sorts the things on her shelves.  this sounds great which is why it’s so hard to talk to her about this. This still sounds like a good thing. But.. egh...  look I’m a very busy man, I don’t have a single day to myself, I work at a restaurant,  I work at a studio, and I go to  trade school. I’m a very stressed person, but I noticed she had a problem when she seems to be just as stressed out as me.  She doesn’t have a job, she dropped out of high school, and she lives with her father.  why would one be so stressed under no pressure to do anything. Not even her father presses her.  

she’s very fidgety, when I want to sit down with her and talk to her, she constantly gets up to fix something, gets distracted, or briefly changes the conversation. It almost looks out of her control.  she’s very stubborn, she’s very nasty to people who have differing opinions, and she holds a lot of hate in her heart.  she has past traumas including physical and mental abuse, also when she was 16 her mother died of cancer. I know these things are probably the root of the problem.  Maybe she keeps up the house because her mother can’t anymore, maybe she’s pessimistic because of her circumstances. I don’t know, but what ever it is, I need to talk to her about it., she lacks motivation for important life events, like moving out, or getting a job, or getting a GED.  She’ll make as many excuses as she can to not do things that she does not want to do or to have her way.  Even when she’s dead wrong.  What is someone like this possibly suffering from? Depression, possibly OCD? I could go on to explain more things to you, so if you have more questions I will answer.... Someone inform me

Laid there. He said “I can seduce you now or tomorrow.” I didn’t want the option. I just wanted him to do it. I already made that clear like three times. He just goes to bed.

112,"So I’m currently in my low 20s starting my degree in physical therapy hopefully to get into medical school the following year. Now, back when I was 17 I was in a college where I could have completed 2 years of pre-university classes and applied to get into med school through that method. During that time, I trained and competed provincially in my favorite sport (keep in mind, I trained twice a week for 2h30 and played a tournament every 4-6 weeks). However, during those 2 years, my grades were ok but not excellent. 

Now here’s where it gets worse. I come from a family where education is VERY important, so out of fear, I tried to hide my grades from my parents (I lived with them at the time). BIG MISTAKE. They eventually found out, and were rightfully pissed at me. The grades I had also weren’t even enough to get accepted for an interview.

In order to get back on track, I completed a bachelors in biology and biochemistry during a 3-year period and finished with a 3.88 GPA. During those 3 years, I didn’t play at all during the first year, managed to convince them to let me play the tournament in my city during the second year, and during the 3rd year, I was allowed to play tournaments only if I had no exam or projects due during that time period (never trained though, just competed).

Forgot to mention that after the incident, I showed every test grade I got to them to show that I’m not doing bad (my grades were showing an upward trend).

I applied last cycle and got 2 interview invitations but didn’t get in either school and am now in physical therapy as mentioned earlier. Now, the coach for the university sports team asked me to join his team (I’ve known him for years), and the thing is, I really want to. Sports have always been something I use to relax and feel good and I miss the competition. It feels like something in my life is missing (if you’re an athlete, you know what I mean). The problem is that parents think that the moment I join that team, my chances at getting into med school will disappear (they believe I will make the same mistake again).

Looking back though, my study strategies back then were bad. I just kept re-reading and hoped it would stick in my head. Also, the Internet, it’s always a distraction. But thankfully now I’ve refined my study strategies and am less distracted than before and use active learning strategies to better understand concepts and memorize terms. I’m pretty sure that it wasn’t my sport that made me do badly in school, it was my lack of concentration and bad study strategies.

So, now I want to join the team but I’m pretty sure they won’t let me at all. Not to mention, the university has a program put in place to accommodate student-athletes. I already brought this up to one of my parents and they said “You want to make the same mistake again?”. Of course I don’t want to make that mistake again, but thanks to that mistake, my study strategies are WAY better than before.
But they still think that competing meant that I should kiss my dreams of becoming a doctor goodbye.

So I’m wondering what advice you guys have for me to let them know that I will still do well to get into med school while also being allowed to compete. (Keep in mind, they are very close minded, it took a lot of convincing for them to even let me play in those tournaments during my bachelors).

And guys, BE HONEST. If I screwed up to the point of no return and just have to accept it, then tell me. Thanks guys!",30Aug2020,1
113,"So a friend of mine had met someone online, and seemed to get pretty close to them. There was a lot of stuff between them I won’t share because it’s not my place but basically she viewed this person as the end all be all absolute best friend and truly loved them a lot. 

However this person very clearly does not feel the same. Their relationship tends to be flirty a lot and honestly, from everything I’ve seen and what has been shared with me (she has complained to me a lot about this person) it borders on more than friendship seemingly. However, it strikes me as very one sided. 

Because, 
-often friend completely ghosts her
-won’t respond to any messages but posts on social media a bunch 
-apologizes several times for this behavior but continues to do it over and over
-says it’s because she’s depressed or having mental struggles, but has never been open about this while it’s happening or even said she was needing some space 
-my friend complains at least once a week because she’s being ghosted and is feeling really low due to being ignored. However she jumps right in whenever this girl finally texts her back and is willing to go through all that again. 

I’m not a jealous friend until I see a friend getting hurt. I had seen this type of controlling albeit aloof behavior before with another friend and never said anything because I felt it wasn’t my place. But that particular instance ended with the friendship dissolving and a friend of mine really hurt. So my question is, do I tell her? 

This girl is obviously using her, for attention or to feel good or she just likes flirting. But it’s clear as day that she doesn’t actually care about her. I don’t want to see her hurt but I don’t feel it’s my place to mention that this particular person she met online is probably not good for her. I also don’t want to seem like I’m just judging either, but to do that to someone over and over even after they’ve made it clear that hurts them doesn’t strike me as okay. Or even as if this person is very self aware of their actions. I don’t want to lose a friend, but I also don’t want to see her hurt anymore. Should I say something or let it be? 

*i do not personally know this other person only what I have been told and seen about her online. I’m really close to my friend in question and she tells me whatever is bothering her. Even sending screenshots of what the other person has said to her.",30Aug2020,1
114,"Recently, my BIL has been great at doing absolutely nothing. 
He lost his job during Covid, and has not been really motivated to do.... well, anything.
I mean anything.
He doesn’t even want to go out. He’s not interested in making new friends (he still has a girlfriend in his home country). 

For a short back story, he came to live with us (me, hubs, and our babes) about a year ago. His mom was involved with some pretty sketchy shit, and he was stuck in the middle of it. At one point, the safest decision was to come stay with us. 

He’s had a few odd jobs since then, nothing would stick. He is a great help around the house and with his niece. 
He still hasn’t made any new friends and he only ventures out occasionally for family events.

Ever since he stopped working, the zombie has kicked in. I don’t see him until around 2 pm each day.

119,"Long story short been with him since 2011 we were 16/17 we now have 3 kids have always lived with his family ( mom , dad , brother , and sister ) I never had my privacy nor space for myself . Yes we had a room but mind you we have kids . With 5 people in a room ... anyways I’ve always told him I wanted to move out because I need my space . This was when we only had 1 child . If you want me to go If you want to know more back going about all this lmk . Anyways we split up for a few months then got back together . I got pregnant again he wasn’t still living with his parents . We live in CA so the rent for this place was 800$ since his family had lived there for many years. As soon as I had my daughter I left to work then 6 months later I found out I was pregnant again but my plan was to keep working but I ended up having low blood pressure so it was a high risk pregnancy that I had to stop working . Thennnn I breast fed my soon for 3 months tried to go back to work ML said son wasn’t eating so she convinced my bd that I had to stay home so he can breastfeed and that I’ll go back to work as soon as he can eat baby food . It didn’t work out so I stayed home till he was a year but I left back to work as soon as I was able . Anyways I worked 3 different jobs till I was comfortable with what I was doing issues came up and then I got a better job . After we had to move out because the landlord sold the apartment and found another place but it was pricey 1950$ and we didn’t like the neighborhood so we said for the amount we are paying we can pay off a house than rent an apartment. Then covid started and I got laid off . 
We decided Lancaster ca was affordable but his family didn’t want to go the distance and we were ok with that . We went to see a few houses they were nice but my bf didn’t like that everything was so far so he ended up deciding to look in our hometown . His parents then said they would be coming with us if we chose a house closer to home . And we all agreed . Keep in mind I though they were just going to help us for a few months/years while they figure out where they will settle down . I’m thinking they are going to retired in Mexico or something . Turns out my bd said he wants them to stay permanently. Witch is not ok with me because what’s the point of me putting my time money and energy into a home I have to pay most of and Share with his whole family who basically isn’t going to pay shit . Mind you his dad is the only one who works he makes about 200$ a week his mom is lazy and didn’t work nor like to clean or cooks because she said she’s worked from a young age in Mexico . She just turned 51.. my father in law has worked since he was 3 in Guatemala... so I don’t see what her excuse is . Anyways his siblings are 21 and 18/19 soon and they don’t do shit either nor help around . Only sister pays rent because she has her own room . Brother goes to uni but all his final aid money goes to stupid shit instead of helping out . And im tired of living with them . Not to mention his mom gets involved into EVERYTHING it’s been hard but I have barley been able to make her understand that she can’t get involved when I’m doing my job as a mother such as babying the kids when I ground them or when they do something wrong so the kids don’t take any of it serious because they know grandma says it’s ok even if mom says no ...
There is so much issues going on here I don’t want to bore you . It’s slightly embarrassing I have kept quit for so long . Not even getting into the fact that my bf has cheated on me numerous times .. and yet I forgive him . I do so much for him but he can’t sacrifice leaving mommy and daddy behind . 
I don’t mind him helping them out you know . I’ll help them too . Give them money every now and then but I don’t want to live with them and now I’m the bad guy because I just rather end it ... he dosent listen to my opinion or care what I want . All he tells me is that he dosent need me and I can leave . But the times I’ve tried to go he begs me not to . I’m going to talk to my dad to get an opinion . But I just can’t stop feeling guilty about it . I don’t want to break my family apart but it’s just not worth it to me if I’m going to be unhappy in a house I’m suppose to call my own at the end of the day .",30Aug2020,1

I really don’t know what to do, and I’ll try to explain the situation as best as I can here. Also, please note that I want to put a trigger warning here for child abuse/assault.

When I was 15 years old, I was going through a rough patch in life (problems at school and abuse at home). Like many people, I took to the internet and tried to seek out a connection with someone. I was so lonely and wanted comfort. That’s where “A” comes in. A was a 21 year old female who offered me that. I did genuinely feel safe with her and like she was my one source of comfort. Things were terrible at home and all the other adults in my life had failed me. A and I got closer, and eventually she told me she had feelings for me. We started “dating” when I was 16. I put “dating” in quotes because now I’m starting to question everything. Anyways, we dated until earlier this year until we broke up (I finally realized how toxic we were for each other). We remained close friends and still talk daily.

I was in therapy earlier this week and realized something; I’m 21 years old now and the thought of talking to a 15 year old in that way makes me sick. I’m starting to really freak out and question everything. I know anything sexual we did before I turned 18 is technically assault. What about everything that happened after? What does that mean for things? I feel bad saying this, but I enjoyed it. Does it making it my fault? Was everything past 18 considered consensual? This is really bothering me.

Realizing this is horrifying, and I feel so stupid for not seeing it sooner. I wish it wasn’t this complicated, but I feel terrible for not wanting to be friends with her anymore. She made me promise to always be her friend, and I know she’ll be devastated if I suddenly stop talking to her (she’s told me).

I feel so conflicted, but part of me would also feel devastated. For the last five years of my life, she’s been the person in the world that I feel safest with. Everything seems so scary, especially the thought of shoving her out of my life. I feel like I’m losing so much. Is there something wrong with me? I feel so conflicted about what to do next. 

This is so hard for me. I still see her as a good person and find myself constantly defending her despite things. I will miss her like crazy, and still do consider her my best friend. But things feel so different. I’m terrified to lose her but I don’t know if I can let what happened slide, even though it feels like my fault.

We haven’t talked in three days. I messaged her and told her not to message me, and that I needed space.

I don’t know what to do. I’m so lost and very afraid. Please, any advice is helpful.",30Aug2020,1

We're open about our feelings towards each other (we both like each other) however I'm not ready for a relationship after getting out of my previous one. He is aware and understanding of this.

Anyway, today he lied to me about something dumb. What had happened was basically I sent a meme to a group chat we're in while we were in a voice channel on discord. He was honest and said it wasn't really funny, whatever. He felt really bad for saying that afterward and tried to take it back and say it was funny. I called him out on it and he felt bad and said he just wanted to make me happy but he realized that that was the wrong thing to do. He apologized and I told him it was okay but I didn't want it to happen again, that I don't want to be lied to.

144,"(Throwaway for obvious reasons) 

I will keep this brief and try to be concise as possible. I am in my late twenties and have been abusing drugs and alcohol since my teenage years like many friends around me have,  it has really snowballed out of control now though and I desperately need help. I have suffered from depression for as long as I can remember and a few years ago after moving out of my parents house and in with friends things got badly out of hand, I started selling and taking every drug I could and partied all the time which obviously destroyed my mental health even further. 

A few years later now I no longer sell drugs and dont take some of what I used to and cut down on drinking and smoking weed, but now I'm back living with family and relapsed with ketamine which I was addicted to before, and when I go out with friends now I usually disappear for days drinking or smoking cannabis for days on end. Things have gotten really bad the K makes me feel sick but I compulsively take it. I deleted my dealers number last night and threw the last of the ket in the bin just now to save me from myself. I need serious professional help with my addiction though and I dont even know where to begin or who to turn to. My family are aware of my mental health problems and to some extent the drug problems but they dont know how truly bad it is, although they are supportive in trying to help I usually just push them away. 

Do I go see my doctor and tell him I'm addicted to drugs or what? I have no idea how to get real help with this problem and am at my wits end. I have previously been to my doctor regularly for mental health reasons and found it not very helpful, have tried a few different antidepressants which didn't seem to have any effect so after 2 years of use I stopped them a few months ago and haven't been to speak to my doctor since, just been frozen in place isolating myself from everyone which is just making things worse and led me to abusing drugs again and relapsing.

Let me give some background about myself as a person first. I am a 16 year old girl with ADHD, Depression, Anxiety, Panic Disorder, a nondescript eating disorder, and I honestly wouldn't be surprised if there was more wrong with my head. In the past, I was constantly bullied and harassed by the people I thought were my friends, and so now I have deep-seated self esteem issues around everything from my body and my appearance to my personality and energy level (ADHD and all). I also have issues with touching guys, even in a friendly ""eyy what's up homedog"" kinda way due to reasons I would rather not share. In the past I have also had issues with self harm and the occasional suicidal thought. (lol don't I sound like the life of the party)

  
A week ago, I took a 5-day road trip with my best friend, her mom, her brother, my mom, and another really close friend of mine. I've known these people for almost my entire life and since I'm a fairly open book when it comes to, well, everything, they all know basically everything about me. Now, my best friend's mom is VERY blunt, especially when it's something that annoys her. She'll let you know that she thinks you're wrong and explain why she's right.

I am a very sensitive person, and she knows that. She is blunt about knowing it. She tells me I need to be less sensitive, and I was really insecure about it when I was younger because she kept saying that. Before I even left for the road trip, I was worried that she was gonna make me upset with her bluntness. Oh boy oh boy, was I right. 

She pestered me about things more than she pestered anyone in the house, even more than her own children. If I did anything that she considered to be wrong, she would come find me and scold me for it. I am a messy person, I admit, but I was trying to be clean and I told her that. I think I left the package for my lactose intolerance medication out maybe once and she said that I was the messiest one in the house. She scolded me for not wanting to eat, even though my medication is literally an appetite suppressant. G scolded me for asking K to avoid being in my personal bubble and said that I of all people shouldn't be saying that, since I'm constantly in J's space (I forgot to mention above and I'm too lazy to fix it, but I'm a really touchy person and I cuddle/hold hands with all of my female friends all the time) , even though I always make sure it's okay with J and I have made it clear that if she doesn't want to hold hands, I wont hold her hand. I was having a panic attack on the trip because I was already on the verge the whole time do to the scolding and I had just lost my wallet. G helped me calm down, but then later she acted like the whole thing was funny and reenacted her words in a really condescending way. Even my own mom, who was around for maybe 5 hours of the week long trip because she's doing college again, admitted that G gave me a lot of shit. 

A lot of the shit she gave me really stung, too, since they were almost all things that I am working on with my therapist, side effects of my mental health issues that I can't really help, or just things I'm insecure about in general.

I want to tell G that she hurt me a lot and that a lot of the things she said got under my skin, but I don't know if it's a good idea because she might get mad or just call me sensitive again. 

Should I explain it to her? Also, I think I want to ask her to be a little gentler with me in the future because I'm so sensitive. I was hoping she would understand, since H (her son) is high-functioning autistic. With what she did after my panic attack, though, I'm not so sure.

**In 2016 I joined Twitter.**

I was new to Twitter, making new friends. Before this, I was mostly alone, had one friend, I was quiet and too depressed to do anything social beforehand. I wanted to force myself to branch out and meet new people.

**I then met someone incredibly special to me.** We'll call him ""Jake"", I followed him one day on Twitter. Deciding to message him, we became good friends pretty quick. We found out that we lived just an hour from each other. As we kept talking, we found out that we were very similar and got along super well. It wasn't long before crushes developed. Unfortunately, things didn't work out. Something was happening that I didn't know about at the time. **I'll get back to that later... (Labeled with \*\*\*)**

Being friends with Jake, I met a ton of new super cool people. I was finally talking to people! This was so huge for me; I was finally acting normal. One day, one of Jake's friends **Ryan** sent me a private message.

Looking back on it, I should have known his intentions even from the beginning were not genuine...

He started slow, he would come into my DMs, ask how I was, then slip in some sexual remark.

Me, being desperate and horny at the time, I reluctantly went along with it. A lot of times not knowing how to respond, I'd reply back with vague statements.

It escalated. It went from a statement here and there to full on sexual talk. He'd come into my DMs telling me he was ""about to ejaculate"" and that ""I was such a sexy bitch"" almost every day.

He started initiating roleplay. The whole time I did it I felt sick to my stomach. I knew to some extent he was using me, but I didn't fight it, I wanted to be like by someone.

He would slip in sly compliments to me, in retrospect almost in a grooming way. Like, ""oh you're so beautiful"" with ""I want to fuck your obese ass"" shortly after.

This continued for awhile.

Eventually he started trying to press me into a relationship. I was stern in telling him no, but he kept persisting no matter what I did or said. He would keep typing out long paragraphs professing his love for me and how much he needed me. I tried to lay out that I was just interested in being his friend, but he kept trying to push it.

During the time we spoke, he would keep pressuring me for pictures of my body. I ashamedly sent a few. Later, I discovered that he was saving these pictures, and when he invited myself and another mutual twitter friend into a private chat, I had discovered he shared at least one picture with this guy, so I could never be certain how many people saw.

One thing that has made it incredibly hard to come out about anything, is that he also admitted multiple times he would save every bit of our conversations, and he would say things like, ""see, look what you said here, I should show everyone this"" so I've been incredibly scared to come out about this experience.

Ryan would get angry with me if I was doing what I wanted and not doing what he wanted to be doing with me. Even though I kept inviting him to play games and talk to him every day, he would guilt me over doing what I wanted and start fights.

Jake and I kept drifting further apart. I wasn't sure what was going on, but he was no longer interested, it seemed. What was once really sweet, us having comfy game time and silly talks, no longer existed. It was like a rift had been created somehow.

One day, while venting to Ryan about feeling so sad about Jake, Ryan said to me, **""you want the truth? I don't think he's interested in you anymore. he doesn't seem to care about you at all anymore. Sorry if that hurts""** to which I replied ""why would you say that?"" with him responding **""he used to reply to you all the time, he used to want to be part of your life, it seems like he lost interest in you entirely"".**

This devastated me. I was already suffering from massive clinical depression, but being told this, it crushed me. I became suicidal. I stopped getting online, I stayed in bed for days without eating and I nearly died. I was severely dehydrated, somehow developed kidney stones, and ended up in the ER after days of not showering. I felt the lowest I ever had.

I then decided it was time for a break. I was deeply unhappy on Twitter, I was convinced Jake wanted nothing to do with me anymore, and I felt physically nauseous around Ryan.

After about 2 months, I came back. I explained to everyone that I had suffered a mental breakdown and couldn't be around. Ryan, was back in my private messages.

One of the first things he did was send me a picture of himself ejaculating on my pictures.

I had another female friend, we'll call her ""Ana"". Ryan confessed to me that he was initiating lewd RP with her. This bothered me on a level I couldn't describe. So not only was he using me, he was doing it to others as well. He would request pictures from Ana, and she would fulfill them. At times, he would say things like, ""she shared this, why haven't you?""

**Awhile later, a mutual friend of ours that had blocked Ryan came to me in private messages telling me that Ryan had been telling him to leave me alone and instructing him on how to talk to me.**

I confronted Ryan, and through his own admission discovered he had been doing this. I stopped responding to him for a few days, before he confessed something awful.

\*\*\* He came into my DMs apologizing profusely, so naturally I asked him what was going on. He had confessed that... he had told Jake, **""I'm very interested in her. I'm sorry. I'm going to attempt to get her, I love her. I know this will ruin our friendship, but I need her.""** He showed me screenshots of their conversation, so there was no denying it. Jake responded upset, saying ""I don't want to stop going for her, this is the closest I've ever been to something successful, and I don't want to screw it up."" to which Ryan responded, **""Well, I guess it's a competition then"".** Ryan then went to Ana before me to ask if he should apologize to me about what he had done, and Ana said to him, ""this is disgusting, she's not a prize, she's a human adult that can make her own choices"". That mutual friend never came to me to tell me what Ryan had done.

So Jake never stopped being interested in me. He convinced Jake he was going after me, and convinced me that Jake hated me. He completely isolated me.

A lot of time passed, and eventually, I severed emotional ties with both of them. I tried to leave this whole thing behind.

\---

**2 years later.**

Jake and I rarely speak, the divide between us is monumental. All we have left is friendship, however slight that is.

About 5 months ago, having mostly left that life behind, I got a peculiar message. It was from Ryan on Discord... I hate, hate, hate what I did.

He came to me to apologize. He wanted to apologize for how he had treated me back during that whole year of friendship.

Me, being the person I am, I absolved his guilt. Even though he had hurt me SO much, I didn't wanted him to suffer, so I told him, ""it's okay, I hope we can move past this"".

After 1 or 2 conversations, be began to mostly ignore me.

When I pressed him about this, he would respond to me with things like, ""Sorry, it's pretty hard to talk to 15+ people a day, so I often times forget to reply"" -or- ""I haven't been feeling it"".

After some soul searching, I discovered what the intention of apologizing to me was. It wasn't about me at all, it was nothing but an excuse to absolve his own guilt. Once he had, he tossed me aside again.

I then blocked him, ready to finally be done with him for good.

\---

**Now**

I've blocked him on nearly every platform. I'm sure by now he's noticed he's fully blocked on my Twitter accounts.

I *thought* this would be the end of it, but it wasn't. See, Ryan is still friends with every person in my friend group. Specifically, three of my closest friends are all close to him.

Every day, I watch as they compliment him, try to help him with his ""depression"". I've watched Ryan manipulate one of them into buying him game systems and other various items. Ryan keeps being a part of everything.

It's got to the point where I've just wanted to leave everyone behind. I've had thoughts of just abandoning it all and starting over, but... that just isn't fair.

So it's not all bad news! I eventually met a wonderful guy through the same group. We care about each other so much, and he has made me happier than words can describe, so I'm no longer lonely. I've tried to take back a part of myself I felt I had lost, and I've really been doing super well growing. I can't wait to meet him one day soon, we're so excited. But back to the matter at hand...

I tried to talk to one of our close mutual friends, we'll call him ""Vergil"". I vaguely told Vergil I could no longer have Ryan in my life, and that I blocked him. Vergil's only responses to me was, ""you've made this very awkward, because now I'm holding a secret from Ryan and I'm part of it."" followed by ""you've got your reasons, I won't pry but I respect them.

**Vergil wasn't willing to hear me out.**

\---

So here I sit, not knowing where to go. Whether I should abandon my friends entirely, or call Ryan out for the things he's done. I absolutely loathe him. Seeing him mentioned, seeing him weasel his way through my friend's fingers. Wondering how many girls he's done this to, I don't know what to do.

**So finally, my question is what I should do? Where should I go to feel alright? I don't know how to anymore.**",30Aug2020,1
156,"I used to love getting high to experience music on a whole other level and become totally immersed in the sound and it felt incredible. I’ve wanted to quit smoking weed for reasons such as it made me lazy, something paranoid and anxious about how I smell, think etc.
However, since stopping, I’ve noticed that music just doesn’t sound as good as it does when I’m high,this has made me very upset, I love music and I don’t want to lose my passion, interest in the genres, concerts and scene of it all. But without the weed, I don’t get the amazing feeling I felt, it’s just not the same and I haven’t felt as mind blown with music as I used to when I was stoned..

158,"So I've known my boyfriend since the beginning of my freshman year of highschool. We were friends and I changed schools and we continued being great friends up until the end of my sophomore year in which we started dating. (now, this personally has made me so happy) and now I'm entering my senior year and we've been dating much over a year. She says things a lot about how she thinks it's not good we've been dating this long, and that she thinks we're dating because we're ""bored"". she also says that we have more of a best friend relationship... which bothers me a lot because she doesnt even have a glimpse of the affections we have for eachother because to me i feel like she has always reacted nasty. And personally, i feel like she acts this way because she doesn't like what he looks like,, he's shorter than me and she has always made comments about that. And to me he's attractive and he's sweet to me and has always treated me right. But my mom has always been the type if i speak up for myself she threatens to take away my relationship with him as she totally has the ""power to do"". I don't know what to do, and I really feel in love with this boy as I can really see a future with him. I want the person I'm with to be my best friend.

159,"From what you read in the title you might assume I'm young since I live with my parents and don't have control over my pets. My father owns a piece of land just outside the city. It's desolated, on a desert, with high temperatures of 120 degrees Fahrenheit. They have accepted in a few stray dogs to live with them, there is no house or building in there so the dogs just get fed and wander off and get back whenever they want. Lee is the name of this dog I'm talking about, she came in 2 years ago into my father's working site. Upon the death of my previous dog and some months of thinking, I decided I wanted to have a dog at home. And I really wanted to adopt, my parents have bought dogs all their life and think of dogs as some kind of object who can be rated based on quality. Pure race dogs being the best and mixed stray dogs being ""trashy"" (not the exact word, a translation since our native language isn't English). Meanwhile I think every dog is worthy of love and a decent home. So I'm going to explain some of the conditions the dogs go trough in that place, besides the burning sun and the rough terrain, not really proved, but my mother and I suspect the dogs are treated badly sometimes by humans. For example, she was irrationally afraid of brooms and other objects, which she wasn't 2 years back when we first saw her. My parents argue that since she came here she has a depressive attitude and this sad look in her eyes (I think is just the way her eyes are shaped), and attitudes that a stray dog usually has led them to believe that ""that's where she belong"". Which by the reasons explained before, I don't think that's a suitable place for any dog. 
The point of this post is, I want to convince my parents that she is better off here, in home. But I just can't understand their position. Since she came here I have taken her a minimum of two walks per day, 30 minutes each, making it an hour a day; always making sure her water bowl is full and clean; researched about the amount of food a dog should eat according to its weight; lives inside home; gets pet and caressed everyday; making sure her fur, paws and eyes are clean. I'm doing all of this. Her sight makes me happy, how she waggles her tail when she sees me is so energizing to me. Seeing her happy to see me makes me feel important. And if for any reason she got sent back I would feel so bad, thinking about how she would suffer. I just want to know your opinion, about what should I do or what would you do in my situation. Also an explanation for my parents way of thinking would be very useful. I tried to explain the whole situation, but if you have any questions please ask. Thank you if you read this whole post and I would love if you could help me.",30Aug2020,1

164,"Long story short, 4 years ago i was involved with someone who was a lot younger than me and at the time my friends told em to go for it- he was a psycho path, pathological liar and after 7 months of always picking him up, i still never know what house he lived in (apparently out of embarrassment that his parents didn’t have a house). he was pure trash, as is his whole family. 

so, he hacked my facebook account, my instagram account, and my snapchat account always in complete denial, when i knew it was him. and fyi - when someone hacks your instagram, you can’t tell. for facebook, you get locked out for 48 hours and for snapchat you can’t use it til you keep recreating a new password. he used to log in and i watched as his friend was messaging me, the messages were being deleted as they were being sent to me (this was years ago before you could unsend them on instagram messaging.  recently, i accidentally found my previous logins last week and two recent ones were from “new york, new york” where that’s impossible as i’ve only logged in from my phone and laptop, and i was confused til yesterday. 

having a public profile (which doesn’t matter in this case, as he knows how to look at whatever private or not), i got a new follower automatically today that was him. to be honest, even though i had new accounts from when it had ended back then, i always feared i might encounter this issue one day. and i did. i immediately went into anxiety attack panic mode saved everything i could then deleted my account &amp; now the new york logins made sense. the fact that he found me made me realize before he wanted me to know, he hacked into my instagram to take a look at everything i had on there a couple times, then decided to follow me (for whatever reason). 

 when we had seen each other, he told me he knew how to hack into anything, so much so that someone could simply look up his name on facebook, and he would be able to find who looked him up. he hacked all my accounts so often i eventually deleted all of them. he still has old photos of me (normal ones) and one video where you can clearly see my chest because he poured cold water on me during a shower while recording it. later, he referred to it as “i got dirt”.

i don’t know what to do, i feel like i’m never going to have privacy no matter what. and fyi, he must have looked up my first name and checked every account possible to find me as i had changed my last name by then, but my name is unique so there wouldn’t be millions. 

i think my privacy is never going to be safe, and i’m fearing what i’m supposed to do. i even removed my snapchat name/photo and changed all the info to prevent being found. please help.",30Aug2020,1

166,"For a brief backstory, I am Asexual and Aromantic. I have a history of dealing with depression but have never harmed myself. In two days I have surgery, so I need to decide before then if I’ll come out or hope I don’t from being loopy from the anesthetics. Also, my mother is the one taking me to the appointment but my dad will be picking me up a few hours after.

Since I learned about asexuality ~3 months ago I’ve been paying closer attention to things he’s said even remotely relating to LGBTQ+ to gauge how he might take the news. Unfortunately, the subject hasn’t come up.

Based on my mother’s... point of views, which I’ll explain below, I’m afraid he’ll agree with her for once and think there’s something wrong with me.

My biggest fear isn’t that he won’t accept me though, as he’s generally a very understanding person. My fear is that if I do come out (either loopy or not) and he doesn’t accept me that I’ll “finally” be broken enough to actually hurt myself.

As for my mothers point of views. She is blatantly homophobic and transphobic, has said LGBTQ+ is just made up nonsense so people can have fancy new labels, and has outright told us if we were gay she wouldn’t love us. Outside of this, she has multiple mental health disorders and I don’t fear, I know if I tell her I’m LGBTQ+ she’ll flip her shit. Under no circumstances will I ever be telling her I’m LGBTQ+, if I even continue communicating with her past the necessary point.

168,"So I recently just bought a car. Financed for it, actually. I had traded in my old car, for credit onto the car I have now (which I absolutely LOVE to bits). I had to have my dad cosign for me, as they couldn’t run my credit, seeing as I’m only 19 and have only had a credit card for a month. I pay all my bills ahead of time/on time. Yet still couldn’t get a loan, so he helped by co-signing. 

This was 3 days ago that I got my car. The dealership called me today and left a voicemail (I was in the ER getting my finger glued, so I couldn’t answer.) saying that my “loan wasn’t approved”, which is funny considering they told me at the dealership I WAS APPROVED, especially because I have a cosigner, who has a 700+ credit score. They’re trying to put me onto my own loan now, even though they told me I couldn’t do that since my credit score isn’t able to be retrieved by them. And they’re going to now repo my current car I have. Well get this. We just looked over the papers for the trade in. And they listed my DAD as the owner of my old car. Which. You know, is kind of illegal lol. So now not only did they technically steal my original car, they’re going to repo the one I currently have. 

I’m in such a pickle it’s not even funny. I absolutely NEED this car. My grandma has stage 4 lung cancer that has moved into her brain, causing tumors. Those tumors have given her strokes. She’s has 2 in the past 24 hours alone. I need this car to get myself to and from work, so my mom doesn’t have to drive me (so she can focus on helping my grandma, as my grandmas 72 and lives alone). I had to trade in my last car because the engine was going out, and it was a manual. I have a hard time driving stick due to my ADHD which is another reason I traded it in. I have $18,000 due on my car currently. They won’t give me my last car back. Or the trade in value when they repo this car, even though the contract states they absolutely HAVE to return anything I paid on/for the car I currently have. I’m royally screwed at this point. I’m only 19. And on top of that, I got injured at my job today so now I have L&amp;I on my butt for it, even though it was a pure accident of me getting hurt, and I’m facing loosing my job. They won’t give me back my old car even though by law they’re supposed to, especially seeing as how they listed my DAD as the owner and not me. 

I’m scared and stressed on all of this. I can’t afford to loose this car. My mom needs to be able to focus on my grandma and her health, rather than driving me to work.

170,"TLDR trying to leave a job I make no money at for a job I'll make way more money at, sooner than a two weeks notice. i don't need the bad job for a reference, but want to be as professional as I can.

I've been working at my current job for 10 months. I started of interning because I needed some hours in dementia care for an Associates degree as a Dietetic Technician, and I will be  graduating around october. 

While interning one day, another employee mentioned to my supervisor that I should be getting paid, and the supervisor offered me a job, which I agreed to out of not wanting to say no, but also not being able to juggle a job and unpaid internship without working 7 days a week.

I was told I would train under my boss to learn what he does, because the whole point of interning there was to better understand the nutritional needs of people with dementia, since its a harder population to care for. My boss isn't here when I work so I never get to work with the residents, and ended up mainly washing dishes, five days a week. 

I expected to be here for a few months to complete my hours, planning to leave for another serving job to make better money while finishing my classes, but covid hit and restaurants shut down so I've been here way longer than anticipated. My boss also knew I wouldn't be around for long because I was supposed to graduate last semester, which also got delayed because of covid.

The work environment isn't the best, and enough coworkers are rude and unpleasant to work with to make working there a drag. I wouldn't call it toxic, but people are unprofessional with one another and its uncomfortable.

 And honestly I just don't enjoy washing dishes 5x a week, making only 1200 a month, when I'm used to making at least twice that at restaurants. 

I got a job offer at a local michelin restaurant on Friday, and the money I would make would impact my life a lot. There's a delay in starting and my first day isn't set, but its looking like I'll be asked to start before the two weeks notice is up.

Even if for some reason that job falls through, I have freelance work with my college I can fall back on, and can be paid for up to 25 hours per week with that, so I'm not worried about quitting this job and accidentally having nothing.

I'm planning on putting in a notice on Monday, but I think two weeks is too long. Because of other internships, I don't need to use this place as a reference. All I'm doing is pouring juices and washing dishes, and my position is extremely replaceable.

But my boss is still a nice guy and I'd feel bad leaving so soon in the middle of a pandemic, especially considering our facility is going through a covid epidemic. I've already missed two weeks because I've tested positive and have just been cleared to go back. 

But I can't pass up working at an expensive restaurant and keep working at a job that I'm unhappy at where I'm barely making enough to live on.

181,"this man used to be... be a person who used to but not anymore who groomed me.
let’s call this guy ricky, and for context ricky is 20, at the time i was groomed i was 14 (i am now 15)
i met him during one of his most awful moments in his life and i gave him a lot of advice and love in the beginning of our friendship
we met in a multiplayer game online and we connected pretty quickly. at first he was a little distant but i began to show a lot of affection and gave advice so he began to open up. he suffered with a heavy drug addiction to mixtures and pills- etc. i felt obligated to help him and give him my advice.
ricky had never felt heard before and it lead to him feeling attraction for awhile. for about 2-3 months we would have sexual conversations (never pictures) but i ended up learning a lot about him no minor should know.

it stopped after he got a boyfriend but things still didn’t feel like things were normal- the apology i had gotten at the time was “i’m sorry that was gross and i won’t ever do it again” once his boyfriend found out their relationship went downhill and they broke up- right before they broke up i told ricky i would leave him because at that time we had argued so much and i was tired of it and i felt like i never got any justice for what had happened for a few days we didn’t talk about after a bit i felt the need to talk to him again and things were cleared- a lot of it.. or at least it felt like it
he told me how he regretted it so much and he promised to never do that to a person ever again- and since then he hasn’t but something still doesn’t feel right to this day.
about 3 weeks ago he threatened suicide- but it wasn’t your average “i’m going to kill myself right now” he was telling me his plans: “i don’t think my life was meant to go on past my 20s, eventually i wanna sleep long enough to die during my sleep- dying peacefully”
i started trying to convince him not to do that and after awhile it led to us calling and the end result was “i won’t go as long as you don’t”

i’m personally the type to speak impulsively and aggressively so whenever he’d mess up i’d  end up cussing him out and telling him how upset i was with him. he told me it felt like he could never change because of the pressure i put on him. he has issues with time management, drugs, relationships, etc- and to him it felt like i always had something to critique him on
there’s just been a lot of anger and turmoil again and... a lot of pressure put on the both of us- i put a lot of pressure on him

i told myself i loved him from the bottom of my heart and that i’d do almost anything for him.

was i manipulated? it felt like i was a bad friend but it also feels like he’s done... a lot wrong too.
i know he didn’t feel attraction to me because of my age- it was because it was the first time anyone had shown him care, it was just stupid that he didn’t think of my age. 
ricky has a lot of issues and i want to be there for him. have i been a bad friend? and.. should i stay? 
he.. just told me it felt like things weren’t worth it- like staying with me bc all i’d do is push him down... i wanna change how i help him but the thing is that- should i even help him at all?
he’s not my responsibility and neither am i to him- call it a toxic friendship or a manipulation tactic but i know we’ve both messed the hell up and i just

188,"TW: mention of being suicidal, depression

&amp;#x200B;

Last year I moved a couple of hours away to go back to school after dropping out a few years ago. I have made a group of new friends, who I love very much. We are the same year in school, but because I took a break from school, I am a few years older. I also have a group of friends I've known since high school, one I just hit my ten year friend anniversary with. 

My birthday is coming up in a few months, and this birthday is very important to me because I struggled with being suicidal a few years ago and I'm proud of myself for getting to this age and for all that I've accomplished. I want to celebrate myself, and I want all my friends to celebrate with me.

When I started to talk about having a small party to my older friends, I started to get the vibe that they don't like my newer friends. One even told me they ""seem like the worst."" Maybe it's my fault for venting about problems I've had with my newer friends, but we're cool now and I still really like them. Me and my older friends have also had problems, so I think it's unfair of them to hold a grudge against my newer friends. They have not come out and said they dislike my newer friends, but it seems very clear to me. My newer friends have never had anything bad to say about my older friends, and have expressed interest in meeting them. 

Now, instead of being excited about planning my birthday, I'm worried about how my two groups of friends will get along. I feel like my older friends will go into this already disliking my newer friends, and that will make things awkward. I have no one to talk to this about, because I don't want to tell my newer friends and hurt their feelings or make them dislike my older friends. My older friends won't outright say anything to my newer friends or be rude, but I don't want to be stressed about this. I'm afraid my newer friends will embarrass me, not because they're embarrassing, but because my older friends will be looking for reasons to judge them. Should I talk to my older friends and be honest about the situation? Should I just go ahead with the party and not say anything to anyone? I don't want to choose one group to party with. I feel like maybe I should just cancel the whole thing.",30Aug2020,1
190,"I(21F) met this girl (23) online a few months back and we hit it off so well. I don’t think I’ve ever clicked with someone as fast as I did her, even if it is just through texting and social media. It was really nice to just have someone who could understand me and the hobbies that I liked because no one where I lived really showed an interest. We had a disagreement on boundaries a month and a half ago because I felt like I was opening up too fast, talked about it but things still separated ways. I really miss her, and I still don’t even know why we aren’t actually even talking. I’ve reached out to her before, but she never texted me back. Should I try to reach out again.

192,"Throughout my childhood, I was always taught to be kind to people and to “do as Jesus would do.” In this, I never really learned how to say “no,” or developed tough enough skin to call people out on their bullshit. I want to be a stronger man, and I’m working on this. I’m no longer a Christian either, so I no longer have a reason to act like Jesus. I’ve learned a lot from experience, because becoming an adult using what I was taught allowed me to see that people were trying to manipulate me due to my kindness. I’ve always been complimented that I am really nice, and so has my dad. My dad, though I love him to death, shows some of the personality traits of a pushover. He holds the fact that everyone has always complimented him as being a really nice person to high regard. I guess it’s his need to validation, and maybe at one time it was mine too. 

I’ve been trying to change when I’m around people, but it’s easier said than done because my brain is wired to put others before myself. At home, in church, and even in school in my conservative area, I was taught to put others before myself.

195,"My first yoga class was a bit of a bad experience, to put it lightly. The teacher of the group was friends with a few of the advanced students at the gym I attended. And since I was new and it was my first ever yoga class, I naturally wasn't as good as some of the more seasoned veterans, and I later learned from a friend (who invited me to join the group) that the teacher was body-shaming some of the newer students with them after class, much to my surprise

I decided to stop going without addressing the issue, given I hate confrontations. The teacher, however (and much to my surprise), made a rant post about me and some of the other newbies on Facebook and tagged me for some reason, equalling in some of my friends and family learning about it when they had no reason to

I want to continue yoga and I'm leaning towards private lessons. However, I'm tempted to give a fake name because of that experience. The teacher I'm considering accepts cash payments, so that also played a factor into that consideration

196,"I (20F) recently got out of a long term relationship. In the postmortem of my relationship, I’ve come to some pretty disturbing conclusions about our sexual relationship and I need some advice. My boyfriend’s love language was undoubtedly physical affection. He required touching to feel loved. At first, this was alright. But I discovered very quickly I don’t like or want to give physical affection. We tried to work around it, but it was very frustrating. I don’t like sexual encounters, and he found it frustrating that I was never interested. He said touching (even if it wasn’t sex) was the only way he felt love. As a result, I often felt coerced into giving physical affection. After about a year of dating, all our sexual encounters I only agreed to out of a sense of obligation, and also to get him to stop bothering me about it. He would often ask/touch/do stuff to me to try to “get me in the mood” and I wanted it to stop so I would just agree. 

Now, he was (as you can probably guess) quite a bit more adventurous than me as well. He wanted to try anal fingering or sex with me. I drew the line here and said a hard no. I told him this multiple times, and he would still bug me about it in the hopes I’d changed my mind. Then, one time while we were having sex, he slid a finger in without my consent. After I had said no multiple times. I made him stop. He said he thought I would like it if I just got through the worry and tried it. 

Writing that, it sounds horrible. But we were only about 18. There’s a good chance he didn’t realize his constant nagging and touching without my consent essentially amounted to sexual assault. By reporting him, I could ruin his life. But I feel afraid of sex and have no trust in my future partners’ abilities to respect my no. In some ways, any chance I had of a normal sexual life have been taken from me. Should I report him to authorities?",30Aug2020,1

i really just hate how much i enjoy just taking the piss out of people and making them angry and scared.

I also loved playing football as our most of our group would go on a team and slide tackle them basically trying to injure them as much as possible .

203,"**I posted on my other account but couldn't get into my account so posting again for advice** 

I [F21] matched with this guy [M24] on tinder a couple months back. We messaged continously and eventually talked over the phone as well. However, the problem was I live near the border between Canada and United States and he was from the States. So, there was no way we could meet up with everything going on.


During this time the talk of dating came up and we sorta had a misunderstanding and it made me really upset because he basically assumed ""us talking every day"" was me being clingy...and that ""what if I turn out to be like his siblings gf who was crazy"". First of all I don't know why he thought talking often was clingy? It wasn't like we talked every hour of the day and it wasn't just me who started the conversation so I never understood what happened there.

Another problem was that I have international minutes and unlimited CAN/US texts but the international minutes only included certain countries I told him that and he said ""does this mean I'll never hear your beautiful voice again"" and as a joke I said ""do you wanna pay my phone bill ahaha"" and he explained why he could not and I told him I was just joking around. But ever since then he never really messaged again and eventually stopped messaging. It's been around 3 weeks and I really miss talking to him. The last text he sent was saying how he missed talking to me and felt bad about the phone bill. This was because I thought I'd get charged and I told him that for now I can't call but luckily those were incoming calls so I didn't get charged. I couldn't get back to him that day because I was really busy with work and exams but I did get back to him after 2 days which I know was really really stupid of me but I was extremely exhausted that week to even check my phone. 

Now this is where I don't know what went wrong. He told me how he was lucky to have met me because of what he was going through and I helped him through it. He also kept telling me how he would be ready to wait since he felt the connection and so did I. But since then he just disappeared...

I really liked him and and he was genuinely a sweet guy. I just miss him and I wanna reach out one last time and also tell him I didn't end up getting charged. At the same time, a part of me is telling me to just forget it and move on.

I go to a university and I am doing everything I can to have us not shut down, as a junior in college I am preparing for my senior year and the importance that comes along with that. As a singer it is ESSENTIAL for my training to be in person. Despite the current global pandemic I was aware that these people have been partying. But have not said anything, I have told friends about my irritation but nothing beyond that. 

This past Friday there was a party thrown, admits this pandemic... I was informed of the party but did nothing to report, or retaliate against this group of people.

207,"A while back, maybe 9 months ago, I noticed my neighbor in my apartment building wasn’t doing too well mentally. We worked together. I was starting to see the *signs*. So one particular night, where I noticed things weren’t quite right with him, I asked him if he wanted to go for a car ride and pop through a drive through. He opened up to me a lot, and any time he wasn’t doing well, he would ask if we could go for a car ride. After having some chats with him, he said he was getting used to new meds and was going to therapy. Seeking professional help. Not much I could do for him but encourage him to seek help that is actually making a difference for him, ask the uncomfortable questions when appropriate, keep an eye out for him without him noticing, and keep taking him on car rides. Because those really seemed to help him. 

I had a bad feeling about him one night. Something wasn’t right... but I really wanted to finish my laundry and then I would pop next door to see what’s up. Before I could I heard a bang on my door. I opened it and he fell in. Arms slit vertically, swallowed two bottles of pills. My roommate and I dragged him in, called 911, made him puke up the pills, stopped the bleeding, tried to make sure his airways weren’t blocked during a seizure, went to his place, collected the empty bottles, razor blades, and note, and sent everything he might need for a while with him in the ambulance. After that I took 2 showers and bleached every surface in my bathroom because my bathroom, roommate, and myself were all covered in blood, vomit, and that white foam he was spitting up. 

He made it, and later he told me the only reason he came to my door was because he remembered I was the only person that made him feel comfortable to go to when he wasn’t okay, no matter what was up. That made me really happy to hear. I’m really glad he came over because if I would have waited until my laundry was all folded, I would have been a few minutes too late and he might not be here anymore. However here is why I think I might need to go talk to someone about it:

Yesterday on a tv show, one of the characters had ODed. White foam puke, shaking, laying there, friends freaking out... honestly they did a really good job of making it realistic. This triggered a really unexpected reaction, because usually I’m pretty well composed and handle stress and shitty situations well. I was getting ready for work when I saw this and it immediately sent me into a gagging fit and I almost lost my breakfast. It was really hard to hold down. Sent me into having the shakes and I had to find something to do with my hands for a while so I didn’t fully freak out. 

I didn’t expect that to be so triggering. Honestly thinking about the situation is a little uncomfortable but I never just ignored it, and I let myself process that night in a healthy and natural way. I don’t think about it much, and even typing this isn’t bothering me or triggering. Just that clip from the show really got me worked up for no reason. Also, since that night I’ve had a really OCD habit of keeping my bathroom sanitary. 

So, is this something that y’all think I need to seek counseling for? Or do you think those sort of things will pass with time as long as I continue to take care of myself mentally?",30Aug2020,1
208,"I am a female in high school and I have had a couple serious relationships and the rest have just been flings/hookups. I am friends with almost all of my exes and I on and off again do a friends with benefits thing with 3 of them.

I really do not want a relationship right now and I haven't wanted one in years so I think that is part of why I just have flings. I also think I go back to my exes because they know what I like and I really do not want to have to explain sexually what I am into because I really just want it to be pleasurable and then done with and I can go on about my day. Here is the issue..I am not attracted to any of my exes until we are sexting or hooking up.

Like when I see pictures of them or just have small conversations with them I honestly think most of them are unattractive and I hate the way they act. In the moment I can never see myself being intimate with them but it always happens. Also after we hook up I feel kind of ashamed and grossed out because I genuinely do not like any of them as a person.

When I try to start something with someone I think is a good person and treats me well I do not have any desire to be intimate with them. The last boyfriend I had was so sweet and treated me so well and I thought he was a nice guy but I HATED when he touched me. I never wanted to kiss him and he would make efforts to be intimate but I was kind of disgusted when he tried to hook up with me.

I think I might just have a thing for hooking up with people I hate..is that even a thing? This could also be related to the fact that (this is personal but idrc) I really like being dominated by my partner and it turns me on when they disrespect degrade me in the bedroom.

I really do not like nice guys but I know eventually I am going to need to be in a healthy relationship with a guy that treats me well but I am afraid I wont be able to be intimate with him. How do I fix this?",30Aug2020,1

Another club member ended up physically hosting, and I asked for a video link to join in virtually.

214,"I have been with my boyfriend for a little over a year and a half. I thought I knew him inside and out, and vice versa. About four months ago, I started noticing changes in his behaviour when it came towards his alcohol consumption. Thinking it wasn’t a serious problem, I asked him to tone it down a little. He agreed, and in my presence he wouldn’t drink. 

About three weeks ago, I started noticing he was becoming more agitated when I asked about his booze consumption. (As a side note, we play wrestle often, but also noticed he was becoming more aggressive with wrestling. I immediately started suspecting something was going on.) 

He admitted to me that he would drink quite a few during the weekdays. Sometimes in the morning, sometimes 8 tall boys on a Monday. I was upset and asked him to please try hard to wait till the weekend. He said he would. Again, at this point he’s being honest. What would I have to worry about?

After his shift, I attempted to call him to see how his day was and he declined my call immediately. Thinking maybe he’s working overtime, I waited about an hour. I called back, and he was very short with his sentences; abrupt and pushing me off the phone. Thinking “he’s gaming, I’ll let him be.” I went on to snapchat and clicked on his profile to find out that his location displayed him in his drinking location. Angry, I called him back and confronted him. He admitted to drinking, and also admitted that he had been lying to me for a few months. I broke up with him immediately after finding out. A day later, he drank so heavily, that he punched something he doesn’t remember, urinated on his neighbours car, yelled at his roommate and thought about suicide. 

Yesterday, I asked to see him. He was a complete mess. He hadn’t showered in two days, smelled of booze and was incredibly hung over. I’m fairly certain he was still drunk. He had the worst shakes I had ever seen and cried non stop. I comforted him and he admitted he has a problem and needs help. I accepted him back to be my boyfriend but clarified that he needs to truly quit alcohol and prove to me he cares about me. 


A bit about myself: I am caring, kind and a motivated person. I help whenever and wherever I can, but I too struggle with depression and anxiety. I know a lot of the time, people abuse my kindness and try to use me for it. 

Am I doing the right thing? What advice can anyone recommend? I know this person is my soulmate, but I don’t want to be lied to in the future again. What we have is amazing, but the alcohol is destroying him, me and us as a couple. I am encouraging him to go to AA meetings and willing to help him distract himself from booze.

215,"Many years ago I was part of an internet post gone viral (I'll reserve the details, if you all don't mind). I got into a moderate amount of trouble for it, but the worst part of that experience was how some people reacted and completely twisted the focus of it, including the press. However, I've always assumed the responsability for the content of that post and I understand why it caused such misunderstanding. The post caused my family to worry greatly about my wellbeing, when in reality I was fine, just extremely guilty and ashamed that what I've done had put them through all of that situation. Also, other people who were involved in the post went through so much stress and I will always feel terrible about it (they were willing participants of all this, but I still feel like all that mess was my fault).  
Surprisingly and for the greater part, people on the internet were overwhelmingly supportive, but some were just really horrible. This have always gotten to me. It have always gone under my skin, making me feel anxious and laughed at, because these comments did a great job to shift the focus of the post onto the negative and it has always hurt me (I've never told this to anyone before but it's the truth :( ). Throughout the many years, only a few people would recognize me and stop me in public to ask me about the post, which would mortify me and still does to this day (I play it cool, though). It's an extremely uncomfortable feeling because it happened so long ago and I was over it for many years, but the feelings of shame and guilt resurfaced (for some reason) and I feel as though it's going to haunt me negatively for the rest of my life (which it will, I know). What I'm trying to ask to those who had gone through similar public humiliations, what can I do to get over it? How can I help myself understand my mistake and let go of the past? How can I deal with hecklers and trolls? What was your experience and what did you do to deal with this kind of embarrassment?

217,"tl;dr i want my elderly landlord to stop saying sexual things to me and i can’t bail because i started trying to buy his house. 

At least once a week my (40m) landlord (85m) mentions something sexual in nature to me and it feels like he’s trying to gauge my interest.  It started by him calling me sweetheart, then he said he wanted to paint me nude, then instead of ‘sweetheart’ he called me ‘lover’ a couple times.  I work from home and cannot be barefoot if he comes knocking or he’ll make inappropriate comments about my toes.  Today he offered me a beer after running errands and took the opportunity to tell me about his formative years abroad which included details about the abundant amount of time spent in the company of other young men. 

Please understand I’m not homophobic; but I don’t like to hear this kind of thing from anybody. 

Under normal circumstances I’d just move but I’ve been trying to buy the property from him since he offered it to me around November, long before this behavior started, and while he was still staying in a nursing home. 

In order to take him up on his offer I helped get him a lawyer to dissolve the power of attorney that his son had set up before abandoning him in the nursing home.  He’s been back at the house since February and relies on me for trips into town and for help around the house.  I don’t mind helping and he thinks the world of me and my family because no one else was stepping up, but... 

I’m getting uncomfortable with all the dips into sexual territory. I’m not very delicate with words sometimes so whenever he says something I try to say nothing at all or as little as possible, but if this continues I’m afraid that I’m going to snap and say something mean or upsetting one day. 

If I do buy this property he will be my tenant, which frankly might not be for long but anyway he’s going to be around unless I completely bail on the purchase and effectively abandon him like his children did.   I am still willing to proceed but I’d really like it if he would cut it out with the sexy talk.   How can I get this old man to change his behavior toward me without potentially turning the situation negative?",30Aug2020,1
218,"Don't know if this is the right place to post this, but here we go:

I made illustrations for a company for about a month without getting paid and decided to not work with them anymore when they didn't accept my rates. I explicitly told them I did not authorize them using anything I had made so far (which was a lot) and didn't sign any contract or accept any pocket change they wanted to give me for a month of labor. That was back in May and fast forward to yesterday I find a game on the Google Play Store that has a traced version of my drawing in it and the game is from that same company. 

What should I do? US laws don't apply because the company is Japanese and I'm from Brasil. I'm hopeless about getting any money out of this, but I would at least like to expose them or get the game taken down.

220,"Here is my thought process on  buying a new car. 

Long story short, I am finally working after approximately 4 years  due to unhealthy  relationship reasons (i did a few odd jobs, but nothing consistent). I’m basically restarting my life right now. 

I’m currently using my moms old truck that she kinda just let me have since she drives a lot for work and gas is too expensive. She also invested a lot of money on it in a span of 8 years to fix things that would break down.  It’s an 04 Jeep Cherokee with 218k miles. It still runs, but i have to be extremely careful with the smallest bumps, dips, downhills, or practically the slightest of rough roads because the steering starts to shake like crazy and im not exaggerating. It sounds like the metal just clashes on both sides of the wheels. I don’t know anything about cars, but a google search says it might be the shock absorbers? It also uses up a lot of gas, so although I’m currently mainly driving it to and from work, I pay about $30 a week, filling it up once it reaches half a tank. (It may just be in my head but it seems like it runs better if I keep it above half tank.)  So a week I’m driving exactly 80 miles to and from work plus trips to the store or elsewhere nearby.

On to the point.  I want a basic Honda Civic. I started a new job, and am also in a position where I don’t have to pay so many bills.  I get paid an average of $460- $490 a week working at a grocery store and currently pay $150 a month for my phone, my cats vet, and Spotify. I’ll probably cancel Spotify and save the $5 a month. My friend said he could help me out with finding a good deal on a new car.

So, when I told my mom about getting a new car, she said she doesn’t agree and that I should get it and save up instead while I can. She offered to lend me $2k to buy a used car instead. She says she doesn’t think being in debt is a good idea. The first car I bought ended up having so many things wrong with it.  It was an 04 VW Golf, I bought it for $3500 and sold it for $700 and only had it for 2 years. 

The last reason for wanting a new car is the safety. My anxiety builds up on the what ifs in case of a car crash. I tend to ignore it though, but it’s in the back of my mind.


I’m really trying to jumpstart my life. I’m finally graduating with a BA this semester and want to  move up and forward. I don’t want to be stuck in this position forever.

Is it a bad idea to buy a new car right now? What am I leaving out?",30Aug2020,1

223,"I've probably applied to about 40-50 jobs in my field around my state.

I get that finding a job after college can be difficult. That's not necessarily the problem but my other friends who have applied have received rejection emails or letters from many of the jobs.

I haven't received any. I haven't received any notice of any kind from any job and it has been ovet a 3 month period.

I'm worried that there is something wrong with my resume or applications that makes them not even considering a formal rejection. Like I'm not worth their time or something. Now every time I apply for a job I feel like I'm not even being considered and that it is a waste of time but I don't know how or what to fix because I'm not getting any response.

Am I just worried over nothing?

I have 3 past job experiences on my resume and 1 volunteer research experience. I took a career development course in college to help with my resume and interviews. I just graduated with a degree in microbiology. I've even started applying outside of my field and no responses or any kind.

224,"These are friends (M early 20's) i have had for quite a while and after not seeing each other for years we started hanging out again because i moved to their city. We met a group of girls at a bar the week before and all hit it off. I really liked one of the girls and made sure the other guys knew. That day it was us guys hanging out and I was told that we were just drinking and playing video games at our shared apartment. I was having a good time and proceeded to get hammered. I noticed that some of the other guys weren't as drunk but thought nothing of it because hey we were all having fun. Anyway some of the other guys take breaks to shower and change. I asked why and they said it was just to get comfortable. I should have seen something coming but again I was hammered. Then all of a sudden the door opens and it is this group of girls we had just met all in going out clothes and looking very nice. My friends are looking good and I am on the couch hammered in nothing but a pair of sweats, having not showered and looking like shit. It was very awkward. I laughed it off said what's up and went to my room to get changed. A couple of my friends come in laughing their asses off and said ""that was so good."" I asked why they didn't tell me they were coming and they said they thought it would be funny and it was. Tried to take a shower but was told there was not time. Made an ass of myself that night and got no help from my friends. I got a half ass apology the next day but was told I shouldn't have got drunk then and that it was on me.

 I now refuse to get drunk with them and they tell me i'm being an asshole about it and holding a grudge.

I left my lights off for most of the going down there/driving on it but there is cameras, not sure where though.

226,"I have this friend, we've known each other for over a decade, she is now my daughters godmother (just so you get a picture of how close we are). We have only had one major falling out before, about 7 years ago and its all resolved. 

Over the years mutual friends, mostly guys, have pulled me aside and told me that i need to tell my friend to mind herself but as I was always raging drunk I never saw the problem. However now that im sober I can totally see it. 

Let me start by saying my friend is deeply insecure, she has had a lot of failed relationships, with the most recent guy having a problem with the way she dresses. When she first told me about it I was initially outraged (this was over a year ago) but now I kind of understand. His main issue was that when they hung out with his friends she would do flash his friends a lot, via her attire and how she conducted herself.  

My friend will pop over to mine for a casual hang out with me and daughter but she'll turn up in tight mini skirts that show off her underwear, she'll wear tops that expose her breasts if she lifts her arms up and she also has very little decorum when wearing these things and will seemingly flash herself constantly and she is aaaaaaaaalways talking about sex and her vagina which gets pretty boring real quick. 

I feel like my friend comes across as desperate and lacking in self respect but I'm not sure if im just holding her to my standards? But I mean then again how many nearly 30 year olds are flashing their underwear like they're children? If I was going to hang out with her mum friend and her kid I'd probably opt for comfy baggy things that can get messy and that I can move about it. 

It seems like everything she does and says and how she dresses is all for the male stare and not for herself. I dont want to be mean to her because I do care deeply about her but her behaviour makes me uncomfortable and our mutuals tell me they see her as desperate and not respectable because of these things.

What should I do? How should I approach this?",30Aug2020,1
227,"Long story short, I (21F) am currently living with my partner (21M). I got kicked out of my abusive parents' home and so had to go live with him as he offered me a place to stay. I have nowhere else to go (I have tried over avenues, my only other option is homelessness and I'd prefer to not do that). 

Unfortunately, I do not want to be with this partner anymore. I am currently working to gather up money (covid has come at the worst time and I lost my job) to move into my own place, but that may take a few months. I've expressed the fact that I don't want to be in a relationship anymore but would be appreciative if he could let me stay til I sort my money out, and at first he was cool with it but then started hanging it over my head... So now we're back together. 

I feel pretty repulsed by him (I do not use that word lightly, he's a misogynist and has some other very.. questionable opinions) and as such I want to have as little contact with him as possible but unfortunately the circumstances don't allow for it. I'm worried that if I don't act in a loving manner/like everything is okay that he'll start giving me shit and telling me to get out etc.

I understand he's under no obligation to give me a place to stay etc, however I am looking out for myself here and I'd rather avoid unnecessary homelessness. He owes me about 3-4k so once I was out of it I wasn't going to ask for it back, just to ""even things out"" if that's the right phrase. I also don't ask him for literally anything just so he doesn't need to go out of his way for me at all, as I feel quite guilty.

Does anyone have any advice on how I can survive the next few months having to pretend that I still love him etc without feeling sick/going insane? Cos ATM the thought of having sex with him or being loving etc in any way makes me feel like I'm gonna cry and like I need to have a shower.

I’m a little new to reddit and i really don’t have anyone to really talk to about this but yeah. I (21) am confused on how i feel towards my best friend (25). We had known each other for about 7 or so years and yeah at first i had a little crush on her but I was really close with her brothers and didn’t want to Sabotage our friendship. Over those 7 years I grew really close to them and considered them like family. Last year we had fell off and became distant, earlier this year i had got back in touch with her and everything seemed normal until she had called me out of random and told me she had feelings for me. I was in shock and didn’t believe her until she explained to me you know why she felt this way about, she also had a boyfriend at the time. I hadn’t been in a relationship in years and hearing someone tell me how much they had feelings for me just made me feel not so lonely. She wanted me to go see her so i did and I should have expected to feel some type of way when i seen them together because I’m very sensitive when it comes to my feelings. After that i became very distant from her again because she never mentioned it to me anytime after and that’s all i could think about.   I would have wanted to be with her or at least gave it shot, but i felt like i couldn’t provide like her previous boyfriends or the current one. And that killed me. I was scared to mention anything about it again because I didnt know whether or not she actually wanted to be with me or not. So i just never brought it up again and kinda of just ghosted.

229,"So back in my senior year I was crushing on this guy we became pretty good friends. I could tell he had a crush on me as well but I was in an abusive relationship and I didn’t have the guts to leave until well after. My ex tried to make me cut him off and did for a small bit I apologized after I let my ex make decisions for me. We still stayed in touch but would talk occasionally. In 2018 we confessed and we agreed on being friends with benefits, pretty much we just send pics and what not. Afterwards our relationship was great we would talk about everything, whether it was personal, or joke around, we got along just well as we did back then. I fell for him even harder and just being FWB broke my heart, I began to feel used and wanted us to be official. I eventually broke it off because I thought I deserved better, I told him I wanted to still remain friends but we haven’t spoken since. To this day I still think about him but we both have S/O. I genuinely don’t feel like I can connect with my bf as I did with him. I’ve began to secretly watch his twitch streams just be I wanted to be supportive and I just keep getting reminded of why I began to crush on him. I don’t have the intention of cheating or pursuing anything. I don’t know what to do, I know I need to move on but I just can’t seem to let go.

  So the other day I encountered some B.S. . So my step-dad him and I have never really gotten along, since he married my mom I didn't like him but my mom liked him alot so it wasn't my place to say (or at least thats the way I felt). 

  So we lived together we argued off and on, and usually ended up walking away pissed or I won ( you can't really argue without a point to) like I remember it was in the summer and me and my mom started talking about back to school I was playing call of duty and he had just come back from work and he came in and heard j was talking to my mom and my mom CLEARLY JOKINGLY SAID ""you are going to eat alot more for back to school"" (for context i dont really eat alot I get hungry but don't have anything in particular I want to eat so I just give up) and my step dad walked in and started lecturing em on how to eat properly and that i need to brush my teeth and workout and a bunch of mumbo jumbo that was irrelevant to the conversation at hand so he started saying people aren't going to like you if you look like this or wear these shirts or eat this way so I started saying stuff like well I dont want to end up a glutton like you or your shirts are the same brand as mine like in the sense if your bridging me down your coming with. Looking back it was wrong but he was being a dick so. Anyway we had like a fight like that at least once a week until we just learned if we dont talk to eachother theres no problem.

I was 20 when I met V... he was in the military at the time and we started dating a year later. We met through our parents. He was stationed across the country and so I left my home town to be with him after having a LDR for 6m. Things changed &amp; he didn’t really want to hang out unless we were going to have sex and didn’t really want to work on out relationship.... I was struggling to find a stable place to live and struggling to live in general... 1 month before he was deployed I was not feeling well, come to find out I was 16w pregnant with my first child. I told him and he cut me off &amp; booked it. I was so lonely and heart broken. The last thing he told was that he “didn’t want to be involved” and never spoke to me again. I come from a religious family so going home with a child out of wedlock was a big no no. I was also couch surfing at this time due to losing my job. A nurse at the women’s clinic I went to gave me a few resources and I gave up my son when he was born to a family through closed adoption. I try not to think about it because I still have not forgiven myself. I saved up some cash and took a greyhound buss back home &amp; stayed with my dad until I got back on my feet. 

I have struggled with my decision and was depressed for years. I always tried to make myself feel better by thinking about how broke and immature I was at the time. Years passed and I learned to put it behind me. No one in my town knows about this and that’s how I comfort myself. 


I am now in a better situation. Graduated last year with a BSN, bought a car and just moved into my condo, trying to put myself back into dating after focusing on my career.... I don’t think I’ll ever be able to have children again. 

Yesterday night my Ex’s mom comes to my moms house and tells me V has been struggling with his cancer treatments. I tried to not be rude but left the house to avoid the conversation because I have not seen her and want nothing to do with that. 
Later on my mom texts me to let me know that V was actually in my parents home after I left ASKING ABOUT MY SON. She asked me what he was tAlking about and I broke down. I worked today and picked up a 16h shift to avoid her phone calls. I have never lied to my mom about something like this before and I am so so anxious and terrified about her finding out. I want to disappear and never admit what I did. 

V’s mom left a voicemail about how much she’d like to talk to me and I don’t know how much more I can run. She’d like to sit down with me and V. She doesn’t have any grandchildren and her only son is dying. 

Do I lie to her and my mom? I am so so ashamed of myself. I don’t know how to not break their hearts. I haven’t felt like this for a long time and I don’t know how to handle my emotions. I hate myself right now.",30Aug2020,1
242,"My mother remarried recently after my father passed some years ago.


I was at opposite ends of the continent due to work and now will be moving back to the same state due to a new job. While I'm looking for a new place to rent, I'll be staying with them for a couple months.

I've interacted with my stepfather several times and can tell he is a genuinely a good guy that wants the best for my mom. 

I don't know what to expect/how to act around my new stepbrother. I (mid 20s F) grew up with my older sister and older female cousins only so I am not sure how to act around a new stepbrother (freshman in highschool) or a younger brother/siblings in general.

Hey reddit, so the past few months have been really weird for me lately. Before I begin I am 18M and I am not allergic to anything and I have been to the hospital 10s of times regarding these issues.

Alright so starting off, I have been having very strange dizziness happening every few weeks, were I would be completely normal, laughing, having a good time, and i would then immediately start vomiting and feeling drowsy and having a dizzy mind. No doctors I've seen have been able to pinpoint anything remotely close. They have theories but they all seem to end no where.

I have had MRIs CAT scans X Ray's and so many blood tests. Nothing seems to show up. I've seen specialists and for some reason, even they are stumped. Should I be worried? Mind you I have had 6 concussions but doctors say it  isnt relevant. 

What's weird is after my last concussion(2016), this stuff hasn't happened until recently. (2020)
Any theories of what I could be experiencing here?

Now my other issue is that sometimes I would have headaches, I would go to bed, fall asleep, then I would wake up feeling better. After I'm fully awake however I would be feeling extremely drunk almost. Like I've been drinking 7 or 8 drinks before and just mumbling my words, feeling dizzy, and sometimes feeling wild or like I need to do more shots or something. 

What the f#ck is going on? 

I'm really scared and I'm not sure how I can handle this anymore, I feel like I might have something and I'm going to die. I would love for someone to help me through this, or atleast help me figure out what it is I'm experiencing",30Aug2020,1
245,"Normally, after I spend a few weeks studying hard, I always take a weekend off every other week to fully recharge my batteries.

So for two days, I might lay on the beach, eat pizza, go shopping, etc. What I loved doing most was going on a mini vacation where I’d take the train and go to a local bakery in a farm town two hours away.

In these times, many of those options are no longer available. I have been grinding hard and I need a break. While I did practice problems, it was pretty clear that I’m overworking my brain and that it needs some rest.

So you have any advice on what I can do to rest my brain a day or two, given that I can’t go outside?

247,"Heads up, this may be a bit of a trigger as it mentions cutting/bullying. Not sure if this post constitutes as those, but I figured I would mention it anyway. 

Hi all, this is my first post on this subreddit. There's something that's been conflicting me and idk what to do. I would really appreciate some advice. 

So.... I have a LOT of scars on my legs. Unfortunately, I got into a bad habit of scratching mosquito bites until they would scar. It's something I regret, as they honestly make my legs look horrible. It's something I've always been self conscious about and I find that I put myself down for it a lot. 

Well, where I live, it gets CRAZY hot in the summer (we were under a heat advisory today) and I just did NOT want to be miserable wearing pants in the heat if I didn't have to.

Now, I feel like I need to give context. Just about EVERY time I wear shorts, I constantly get asked about it by not even strangers, but friends.(Someone even went so far as to ask if I mutilate myself at home.... I'm a former cutter) Well, today it was brought up again. Honestly, I felt like it was asked in a kind of nasty way. Maybe I just think it's nasty because I took it harsh, as I'm self conscious about it. But you know what? I'm SO tired of hearing it. I'm so tired of people bringing it up and making me feel like crap. I see it as something that shouldn't stop me from wearing shorts, but it seems like each time I do I always feel worse about myself. 

I'm honestly thinking about writing a post to where all of my friends can see it, telling them that I don't want to hear about it anymore. It's my business, I shouldn't have to talk about it if I don't want to. But I feel like I might ruffle a few feathers. Is there a not rude but direct, firm way to talk about this? Is it unfair to ask people to stop bringing it up? 

It bothers me so much, I just want people to stop bringing it up. It already lowers my self esteem, I don't want/need other people adding onto that. 

I apologize for the long post. Please, I would love to have advice on this as it's been going on for a while now. I'm sick of it and don't want the constant reminder. Thank you.",30Aug2020,1

250,"So it’s my freshman year of college. Things went really well! My orientation group really clicked and they have become my best friends. 
One girl of the group, call her L, is very dependent. She won’t do things on her on, she follows me around everywhere, she wants to do everything I do. Mind you she is literally about to turn 21. I thought this was odd and I had a very bad feeling about her. Like an gut feeling. After a previous incident, I ALWAYS trust my gut. So I stop talking to her. Not like completely, but just stopped telling her my every mood. She got mad at that so I eventually did cut her off. She then starts posting on social media about wanting to hurt herself and stuff. I reached out but was ignored. A couple days later she asks me why I didn’t want to hang out with her, and I gave her a very passive, lengthy about how I felt. There was nothing threatening in that. I just stated that I didn’t want to be friends. 
Because of covid we aren’t allowed in others dorms. L’s roommate went grocery shopping and literally bought the whole store lol. She needed help bring the groceries up. So I helped her. I literally dropped her groceries at her door and left. Never stepped more than a foot in her door.
The next day I get a call from our Housing Director and he asks about the situation and I told him.  He said that there was a verbal confirmation and that L said she felt like I would attack her. I literally have no idea where that came from. He then tells me that the situation is above him now and I have to have a hearing. 
The hearing went great. I was found not responsible for violating my housing addendum ( not being in other persons dorm). But I did get a written warning about not wearing a mask. I don’t know where that came from but I decided not to argue. 
Apparently L had told her mom about the situation and her mom told my aunt (they are in a sorority together). My aunt called me and said some really disrespectful things like “you are probably acting ghetto just like you did back home” (I was a homebody. I have no idea where that came from. I don’t like confrontation. Like I understand I talk loudly but that’s it. I don’t think I’m ghetto.) and “don’t make me come up there and show you a few things. You got the right one”. 
I honestly don’t know what I did, or what to do now. Was I wrong for cutting her out? Do I tell someone else or just wait until it deescalates?",30Aug2020,1
251,"Hey Reddit, I'd like some advice here as I'm going through a little bit of depression. I'd like to say and warn y'all that despite what you may read below, I love and will always love my family no matter what mistakes were made in the past. ***""The past is a place of reference, not a place of residence; the past is a place of learning, not a place of living"" - Roy T. Bennett.***

To start off, my parents are boomers, but also refugees who lived through and escaped a genocide in the 70s. They managed to escape to America and start a better life despite the tragedies that they were forced to endure. They each lost family members during that dark regime. They didn't meet each other until they migrated over to the United States. From there, they managed to build a living for themselves and started a family. My parents aren't the best conversationalist. They don't know how to communicate and start conversations, but I can't blame them because of what they had to live through.

My brother was born in the early 90s (He's a millennial), and I was born in the late 90s, so I'm basically a late millennial/Early Generation Z. There is a five-year gap between my brother and I. Between that gap, my mother struggled to have children so most of her fetuses were aborted. I was also aborted, but somehow survived the abortion experience, but my mother had a near death experience when having me. The doctors told my parents that I might be a tad mentally impaired because of what had occurred, and my parents seemed to believe that ideology for the first few decades of my life. As a result, my brother was always hailed as the prodigy of the family.

Throughout grade school, I was never at the top of my class academically. During my parent-teacher conferences, my teachers would always compare me to my brother who was the superstar of their class from five years ago, and me who was at the bottom-tier of the current class. As a child, this fucking scarred me. I started to believe that I was also not mentally capable of performing well. I am also an Asian American who grew up in one of the hood schools in Los Angeles; therefore, I was also bullied and got into a lot of fights because I was different from the rest of my peers. My father would also physically abuse my brother and I when we didn't perform well academically, which led to a lot of distaste and negativity in our household. However, my father stopped this physically abuse once he was diagnosed with diabetes and he gained a new perspective in life. Because of what I had to endure growing up, I had no motivation to succeed, and this ultimately led to depression where I often contemplated suicide. I had a mentality of a failure since my parents, brother, and even teachers didn't believe in me. I didn't feel loved and absolutely wanted to give up on life. This depression continued all the way until the 12th grade where I was able to flip a switch.

I wasn't popular in high school, nor did I have a girlfriend as I was kind of known as that anti-social kid who didn't perform well academically. As you can imagine, I had pretty shitty grades because of my severe depression, so I obviously didn't get into any universities around SoCAL. My brother was graduating from Cal State Los Angeles with a B.S. in Electrical Engineering, so you could imagine how much of a disappointment I was. I applied for my first job at a movie theater where my brother use to work a couple of years back. There was 16 people in the interview, and 2 people were hired. I was one of them. And honestly, I probably got the job because my brother use to be a supervisor at the movie theater. People at the theater often knew me as the brother of Eric (Not using real names for obvious reasons). Again, I was compared to the legendary Eric, and all eyes were on me. This, however, is where I managed to flip the switch. I decided that I would no longer want to be compared to my brother, and I decided to carve my own path. I managed to make friends at the theater, and work my ass off every day and ultimately got prompted to the lead projectionist/IT person as well as a supervisor during my 2-year tenure there.

I began community college and started the mentality that ""I would love and care for myself. If no one would believe in me, then I would start believing in myself."" I got straight A's throughout my first year of community college. This is also where something crazy happened. I saw a job posting on a bulletin board at my community college that advertised that a top tech company was hiring four interns from community colleges around LA (This Tech company was either Google, Snapchat, or Facebook) - I'm not going to reveal the exact one. I applied to the internship and competed through three different rounds against 1000 community college students, and was hired as an intern at that tech company at the age of 18. I met and networked with a bunch of amazing people, and was mentored by some of the most diligent and intelligent people across the tech industry. I was also hired full-time at that tech company at the age of 19. From there, I was attending 7 community colleges at the same time (to get my classes done faster), driving through LA traffic for \~4.5 hours a day (round-trip), and working a full-time job (9 hours) a day. I was only sleeping like 3-4 hours a day, but what kept me sane was knowing that I had an extraordinary experience and I was carving my future. After 1.5 years in community college, I applied and transferred to a top Cal State. I worked at the tech company for two years until I decided to leave and join the aerospace industry where I was hired as a Systems Administrator at a top company (NASA, NOC, Boeing, SpaceX, Raytheon). I worked at that aerospace company for nine months, and then left for a start-up. That start-up company just went through a major acquisition, where I reside at today. 

I graduated from the top Cal State with my B.S. at the age of 21. I'm 22 years old today. I have over four years of corporate experience. I didn't get financial aid throughout the college because of my parent's income (and my parent's refused to help me with my tuition through college). But it was alright because I made pretty decent money throughout college since I was already working a corporate job. However, I have already paid off my entire college tuition. I was also able to buy a $32,000 car and pay it off completely myself. I'm also an entrepreneur on the side who has made a decent amount of money through investing in the stock market, running a liquidation business, and starting an e-commerce business.

That said, I've been researching the real estate market for over three years. I've read over 20 books and decided that I want to pursue investments in real estate. I have also been actively pursuing my real estate license. I have different real estate ideas and strategies that I want to put in action. However, the housing market in Los Angeles is insane. I would need my parents to co-sign my loan, but they continue to degrade me and think that I'm an idiot for trying to purchase a property during a ""recession"" when I believe that it is a good time to purchase property during any era. The interest rates are at an all-time low, and the housing market is as hot as ever. 

PS: My parents also hate each other, and my brother and I have never seen them be affectionate toward each other once in our lives. Sometimes, we're not even sure how we were born, lol. Anyways, my father's mother passed away on my father's birthday a few years back, and my father hasn't been the same since. During this same time, due to other family drama, his sister and her entire family cut my father out of their lives. As a result, my father retired early and became an alcoholic. And when I tell you alcoholic, he's not an abusive type or anything. He's just a fucking annoying type that falls over, struggles to speak, does dumb shit, and repeats the same shit a million times. He and my mother always argue every fucking day and it drives me crazy. They always threaten to divorce each other. 

In case you were wondering, my brother isn't part of our household because he got married and moved out. And if you're wondering why I don't just move out - I live in Los Angeles, and even though I have a decent job, I look at everything in an investment standpoint. If I'm able to purchase my first property, then I can continue to build wealth and equity through real estate and obtain multiple properties over the next years. And I also want to be in a position where I can take care of my mother because I don't think my father is going to live long with his health and drinking habits (we're in a fucking pandemic for Christ's sakes), but his stubbornness doesn't allow him to realize this or listen to any of us. I tried talking to him a million times and he just tells me to shut up, so I stop listening to him. I told my mother to co-sign my loan, so that I start my investment journey, and be in a position to take care of her for the future, but she thinks that I'm going to fail. So yeah, a lot more to vent about, but super complicated situation. Would appreciate any type of advice here.",30Aug2020,1

253,"Hi, I need advice on this one 
Months ago I received strange friend requests on facebook, none of which seemed that strange at the moment, so I accepted one of them because of his david bowie profile picture. 
After a few days, I noticed some of his posts were written in english and he seemed very upset about something that sounded very familiar to me. 
I realized while reading that he mentioned names and situations very a like to what I was going through at the time, but never crossed my mind that could be about me. 
After a few days, I was responding to a friend of mine on a comment and another random user comes and starts responding to our comments in a very strange way. It seemed like a very specific attempt to interact with me and my friend. It was a girl, 3 pictures from different dates, which seemed to be taken on a single day, no posts and lots of friends.   
I started to suspect the amount of incidence with fake accounts and decided to look for something these two profiles had in common. I found out their where friends with almost the same people, no friends in common with me, but still a surprising amount of friends in common with each other. 
I don't know what I was thinking, but I took some screenshots and DM'd the David Bowie dude. It was an awkward conversation and he said to care a lot about me (wtf?), but denied to know the girl on the other profile. 
I got a bit scared at this point, realizing I shouldn't have DM'd that stranger about him being a fake account and decided to block both of them just in case of my paranoia being true. It worked for a while, but I got the feeling I should be away from Facebook and deleted my account shortly after. 
Today I received a follow request from a girl on instagram, and I swear I saw her post count going from 1 to 15 pictures in a few seconds, one of those pictures I remember seeing on the fake profile on Facebook. 

I'm almost a hundred percent sure it is the same person, but I have no idea of who it is. I need to interact with my friends and family through social networks, its not like I want to be isolated from everybody else. 

Should I delete my accounts and get new email adresses and new accounts with different usernames? 
If not what should I do?",30Aug2020,1
254,"I (20F) was dating this guy (27M) for about a year. Towards the end of our relationship, he got really anxious about not being able to commit to me seriously (marriage) and that really hindered him from spending time with me and truly being ""in the moment"" throughout our time together. I was never asking him for this serious level of commitment, especially because of our age difference. I just wanted to know if he was going to be there with me tomorrow to continue doing what we've been doing: being happy together. 

It took us four excruciating days of talking, crying, and holding each other to finally have him leave my apartment and depart my side. The next day (early July) I decided to get my mind off of him. I woke up crying, had plans to visit my hometown later to celebrate my brother's birthday, and decided to quickly stop by an old coworker's place.

This coworker isn't really a coworker, he's just someone I met at a convention from my old work last year. Him and his wife (they are at least 50 years old) invited me to meet them and their kids (24M and 28F). When I arrived at the apartment, they kept asking me for excessive details regarding all the negative aspects of my relationship with my now ex, details about my sex life, and other uncomfortable topics. The son (24M) specifically was very invasive but also extremely open? He talked about his sex life, why he's not on any social media platforms, and how he's probably single because he's ridiculously ""vain."" The parents (the two that had invited me over) then decided to leave to get ""groceries for dinner"" and the daughter also left ""to quickly grab her laptop from her apartment."" I realized how weird this was since the son is essentially a stranger to me and tried to wrap up our conversation.

The son then tried to make a move on me by leaning in for a kiss but I sucked in my lips and shook my head no. I don't want to go over this part in detail, but he started strangling me and then tried to fuck me (was partially successful but didn't finish because I kept sobbing, screaming, and saying no). Long story short, I was left with hickeys, strangulation marks, and cuts and bruises on my vagina. 

Yes, I got a rape kit done shortly after. Yes, there is a police report. And yes, I do have an attorney and an entire legal team by my side.

Fast forward to a week ago, I took over $160 worth of pregnancy tests (I went a little crazy) and confirmed that I'm pregnant. It's definitely my ex's and he found out from someone else (I'm sad that someone took my choice to share this news away from me as well...). He didn't handle it well and reacted with anger, annoyance, and made me feel dumb and shameful for exploring my options. He's a good guy, but he just doesn't handle stress and difficulty well. 

I am still exploring my options--this includes abortion, the various forms of adoption, and keeping the child. I don't know what to do. The Planned Parenthood's near me don't have any available openings for an abortion until later this week and they've rejected me for the option of aborting via the pills. So if I get an abortion, it'll have to be done surgically.

I'm scared out of my mind. What should I do? I know no one can tell me exactly what to do or anything, but I just need some guidance and some new perspectives.

Here's a little more about me so you know what my life circumstances look like--incase I decide to bring a human into this world:

* I'm a rising junior at a very prestigious university in America. It's one of the top schools in the world. I'm very fortunate to say I get to attend and they offer assistance for pregnant/parenting students (it's geared for graduate students but... I'm sure they'll make an exception). 
* I attend college with a full scholarship (free housing, free food, free everything pretty much). In addition, I get paid roughly $16,000 to attend my college every year for simply studying. I do have full time jobs conducting research, clinical trials, and building ""things."" These jobs, however, only take about 15 hours of my week. Thank God I get paid with a salary so they don't track my hours. My income from working just these jobs is in the upper five figure range. I only work these 15 hours during the summers. During the school year I only work about 5-10 depending on how busy things get. Income stays around the same.
* My family never went to college and we grew up extremely poor. I started studying and working really hard from a young age and am fortunate to end up where I am today. However, I never realized we were that poor until I applied for FAFSA where they literally told me that my family is poor. My parents and brother are amazing people who made sure I felt like I grew up feeling wealthy and abundant with love (so cheesy, I know) and I'm certain they'd be supportive of whatever decision I make (after they get past the shock). They have no idea about anything that's happened so far. My parents don't speak English so I'm the best resource I have in terms of dealing with the rape and pregnancy.
* I live separately from my parents in my own apartment. I send money back home every month (they don't really need it anymore, my dad finally got a great job this year after being unemployed for 2 years!). I do visit them every Sunday to share a meal and hang out with them, they only live 35 minutes away.
* If I have the child, I'm not sure if I would want the father to be involved. I would be living in norCal starting 2021 before the child comes in late March and he lives in soCal. Not sure how this would even work with him at all. I don't want to deprive this life of knowing their father or anything either. What should I do about this?
* Also, if I do decide to keep the child, I'm going to be pursuing my case with the strangler/rapist differently. I would just fight for a settlement rather than going through the turmoil and stress of trying to get him in prison for his actions. His family is extremely wealthy and famous in the industry we work in. If you Google them, SECs and other major successful deals with pop up with their net worth, etc. I'd rather just settle, get a restraining order, and move on to focus on my new life.
* I very much am pro-choice. I'm just scared I won't be able to follow through with the decision of an abortion. Part of it feels like it's from the shame from the Christian community I'm surrounded by back at home. I feel like a large part of it has to do with the fact that I'm already getting attached biologically. And I've already made a game plan on how I can cover the significant bases of keeping a child. 
* I'm scared of keeping the child because of the possibilities of a miscarriage. I've miscarried in the past. I lost my virginity when I was 17 by a group of guys who decided to drug me and rape me behind a food plaza in my neighborhood. I ended up getting pregnant and miscarried shortly before my 18th birthday. Then on my 18th birthday, I dropped out of high school. I still got accepted into various universities and am grateful that my life was able to turn around because of these opportunities. However, this miscarriage scarred me since I wasn't prepared to have sex, I wasn't prepared to get pregnant, and the miscarriage stripped me of another choice on choosing whether or not I should keep or abort the fetus.

Overall, I'm very confused. I've had little-to-no time in terms of processing everything because my body is officially a ticking time bomb. I'm scared of aborting. I'm scared of keeping the child. I'm scared of my rapist. I'm scared of my ex. I'm just scared of a lot of things right now but I'm confident that no matter what decision I choose, I'll be okay. I just am not sure which decision would be the best versus the easiest. I'm looking for all kinds of advice from this community!

259,"Sorry this is long

We are both 18 btw. So a year ago me and this girl worked in this same job and it was great. We would hang out and talk but never officially dated. I knew I was gonna be moving in the future so we didnt want to do that to each other.

I ended up moving and it sucked so much, we would talk still but It was hard. We went a few months where we didnt talk because I was hoping that would make me lose the feeling for her, it didnt.

We had recently started talking again and one time she sent me a pic of a trail we used to walk on saying ""remember this?"" She also had said ""Yeah, Qwerty why did you have to move? Now I've got nobody at (the job we both worked at) to hang out with"" we facetimed the first time a few weeks ago and that was the first time I could see her in over a year. After the call we were talking and she had said ""it was super nice to see you again"". She also had gave me her Snapchat a few days after that call (which she didnt have before because she wasnt too big on social media and didnt have it when I moved). A few days after this we were talking again and we were talking about a past coworker and she said ""maybe they are sick of me"" and I said ""nah I dont think that could happen"" she was like ""everyone gets annoying sometimes"" and I replied ""maybe, to certain people"" she then said ""you're too nice"" and also later called me a ""sweet chile"" in the convo

It sucks because she felt perfect for me and she actually cared for me and I for her. I dont know what to do and I dont even know if she still feels that way about me. She was also the first girl I ever got almost serious with so maybe I'm just being petty and clingy, idk",30Aug2020,1

He has been telling her that he is suicidal and depressed, and wants to try and make things ""work"" again, constantly.

So, ive been with my boyfriend coming up on 5 years. he joined the military back in nov. last year. hes been in training since feburary up until now (aug). Because of COVID, i have not been able to visit. I recently found out he’s been cheating on me from March til around July and contracted an STD (chlamydia). obviously i love him, but I am very hurt and disappointed. We were planning to be married around the sept/oct time frame. Im not sure if i should forgive him or move on. What would you do in my situation? Also, the girl contacted me and told me everything, which is how i found out. I saw messages between them and he seemed to really enjoy her? The girl says she feels like it was a relationship but he claims it was nothing more than sex.  He even told her, he loved her but claims that was a joke too and just “sex talk”. she claims that she never knew he had a girl friend, which makes sense. But obviously he is the one at fault. However, I find it ironic how she could not have known when all they share mutual friends and they knew he had a girl friend. It really hurts to think he would not be apart of my life anymore. Now he says he wants a baby and to get married sooner and that he will pay for me to come visit him very soon..

265,"I recently graduated college and have been home for 6.5 months. I am starting a well-paying but somewhat intense (long hours) job that is WFH at least until January 2021, potentially until August 2021. However, since March when I moved home I have been 100% quarantined (we even order groceries). 

This is unlikely to change since there is no one I know living nearby, we live in a rural-ish area and I cannot drive and don't have a car, and there is nowhere much to go if I did. This has been pretty rough for me, especially as my parents are a bit controlling and often insist on me not taking calls where they can't hear, etc.

An acquaintance (don't know very well but we went to school together and have mutual friends) is looking to move to the city in October, and I could potentially move into a 2BR with them aiming for \~1,500/month. The goal would be to lock in a very good deal for an annual lease given the market is good right now. They are also WFH. 

I'd be spending a lot of money (I live in a large home with land attached for free rn) and the city is (1) potentially dangerous / crime rates have been up (2) likely to be pretty closed. I'd hate to end up paying a ton for an apartment that turns out to be vermin-infested/gross and also have the city completely shut down again in the case of a second wave or realize that actually there's nothing to do there anyway, or even just be so busy with work I don't leave the apartment.

However, I have maybe 5-10 friends in the city, and would feel a bit more free about maybe traveling short distances to see other friends (in a socially responsible way) if I didn't live with my older (at risk) parents. Plus, I would feel more free to take calls/chat comfortably even virtually. Also, I would only really feel comfortable living with someone I knew ahead of time so if I move later I'm more likely to go for a studio instead.

What should I do?",30Aug2020,1
266,"I work at a small pharmacy in my town (for 2 years) and there we have 2 pharmacists ones a 70 year old man who’s a big hard ass and a jerk to me pretty consistently. The other is basically the owner of the store. The one who’s basically the owner doesn’t really like the 70 year old man. 

On Monday I was stocking the shelves as normal and I finished up a crate and had left a couple of the plastic securing strips on the floor. I’m taking more things out from the crate to the shelf and the older pharmacist says “do me favor pick these up and throw them out before someone trips and kills themself” now I had no problem with picking them up I was going to do it anyway once i had finished the order. When he said it I kinda gave him a look like “are you stupid”. He saw this and immediately started scrutinizing me saying I was always questioning him and I better give that up when I get a real job cause that shit don’t fly in a real job. Literally all I was trying to say when I gave him a look was that someone would have to be really stupid to trip and die over this paper thin meter long plastic band. I also went on a very non chalant explanation of how I’m allowed to question him, I wasn’t really serious though I was just trying to rile him up because it’s funny he recognized this and gave up on his tirade against me. Because this getting really long I’ll skip ahead to “the incident” that happened on Saturday, and I’ll just say his yelling at me got progressively worse the other 2 days during the week we worked together. Saturday comes along and over time I’ve grown to hate working Saturday and today was especially bad because the older pharmacist had been a dick to me during the week and I didn’t wanna work a full day with him now on Saturday. We actually got through the day relatively quick and without any yelling until about an hour till close. He tells me to make sure I empty the garbage cans in the store and take it out to the trash. Now sometimes the older guy will do this himself, and when he does the way he does it he just empties the can he doesn’t take the bag out. I find this rather gross because there’s rotten food and liquid and tissue and such in the cans and I don’t want that touching me while I’m trying to pour 3 different cans in a trash bag. So what I usually do when I take out the trash is take out every bag throw it in the dumpster and replace the bag. He doesn’t like when I do this. He actually specifically told me not to replace every bag and to just empty the cans into one bag. Again I find this disgusting so while I was doing it I decided to just replace all the bags. He comes out of the bathroom and sees me replacing the bags and starts to lose it tells me “I’m wasting money” “being ridiculous” I tell him I don’t like simply emptying the trash cans cause its gross. He then proceeds to say “oh you did it your way, you moron” and after the week I had with him I just couldn’t stand in silence and let him say that so I said “you asked me to do it, you don’t like the way I do it then shut up”. He then proceeds to say “I love you, but next week if I can I’m gonna get you fired, that’s no way to talk to your boss” 

now just to be clear I asked the owner when I started working during the week when summer started if the older pharmacist was considered my boss. I asked this because when I came back after school and COVID he wasn’t getting hours at the pharmacy really and he seemed to lose credibility with the owner and the other employees didn’t seem to like him. The owner said no he’s not my boss, and I should do the daily things I have to when he reminds me to but he has no firing power or anything like that over me or anyone else. So basically I told someone who’s considered my coworker who was being a bully to me, to shut up. I am kinda worried I’m gonna get fired, but above all I just want to ask do you think I justifiably stood up for myself or was I out of line? Please tell me if you think I was out of line cause right now I’m proud of myself for standing up to him. If I went over the line though I will fully admit I was in the wrong and apologize.",30Aug2020,1

273,"Hi guys,

I am feeling hella down. I could really use some advice.

At age of 15, I got my first summer job with my grandmother as a legal clerk. My mother would expect me to help out with bills because she was unable to pay them herself. My father was not born here so unfortunately she was the only source of income. If I disobeyed her or argued about it, she considered me selfish and greedy. She would give me the silent treatment and call me bad names. 

I stopped working but every summer job I got she would ask for money and the same cycle continued. 

As I got older and worked on my resume more,  I moved out. She guilt tripped me, told me I was dead to her, and stopped talking to me. The financial burden I was leaving her with was unacceptable. With that, came  disconnection from my sisters and my father. I fell into depression and eventually decided to reach out again and move back home. 

I’ve managed to get my life together alone again and maintain still maintain a good family relationship. 

I bought my first car alone, moved out alone, got into the habit of finishing college alone, and have had no help from family. 

Fast forward to now. My mom has asked me to be a sponsor for my father so that he can get his immigration process going. Keep in mind, I already gave them $7,000 in 2016 to help with a lawyer. Money of which I am unsure what happened to. 

I’ve been reading into the process, it sounds like a huge responsibility. If my dad is unable to support himself, I have to do it otherwise I can get my wages cut by the government. Also, if he gets in trouble with the law I am held accountable for each of his actions. I don’t feel comfortable. 

Upon expressing this and telling her I want to research, she got very aggressive with me. Telling me she needed an answer immediately although I told her I wanted to talk to some lawyers. Also, she also told me “ I hope you have enough balls to let me know”, and also started bashing my bf (saying he controls my choices and who I am) and he has nothing to do with this. She also called me selfish when I told her I have to look out for my future and be responsible about this. 

I’m really hurt. I feel like she uses me more than considers me a daughter who she loves. I told her I loved her and I would do anything for them. It was not enough for her. I’m so upset. What do I do? I don’t know where to even go to get information. And if I do say no, she’ll cut ties with me and make my sisters do the same.",30Aug2020,1
274,"So there’s this girl I really like but probably have no chance with and then this other girl who I also like, she has liked me at one point, but me like going out with her would piss one of my friends off so I’m just not really sure what to do and like which one I should maybe focus on more",30Aug2020,1
275,"Background: from the ages of 14-17, the man(36) my parents hired to give me instrument lessons would get me drunk and molest me. He lived down the road from me, and was very convincing as far as getting me to believe that we were close friends, as well as getting me to question my sexuality. He’d take me on camping trips where he’d get me drunk and perform oral sex on me while I was plastered. He knew what he was doing was wrong and would admit it too. He’d tell me, “you don’t want to see your best friend go to prison, do you?” and things like that. This lasted until I was in college.

I’ve never told my parents about any of this. They’re the type who’d either blame me for being weak and letting him do that, blame me for not telling them sooner, not believe me at all, or just blame themselves for it. My mother would absolutely not handle it well.

I’ve tried online therapy, but it got too expensive. The only other people who know about this are my one close guy friend, and my girlfriend.

My main coping mechanisms used to be drugs and alcohol, but my girlfriend has been super supportive and helpful in my efforts to quit relying on those, and to just stick to the herb.

I’ve entertained the thought of pressing charges against the man, but when it comes to the burden of proof, I don’t really have a leg to stand on. No physical evidence of abuse, and no one that witnessed any of the abuse. That, and it’s been about 10 years since the abuse first occurred.

Back when I was still hanging out with the guy, I’d occasionally see a guy I knew from school at his house as well. We wouldn’t ever all hang out at once, he’d always be leaving. Me and my schoolmate were never really close friends, but we were friendly whenever we saw each other. Which was semi frequently, as he worked at a few local gas stations and pizza places. 

It was through word of mouth that I found out that my schoolmate and his rough home life as a kid. His mother was either absent or deceased, and his father was abusive. His dad died in senior year, and he never had the chance to come out to him as gay. This was also when I found out that my schoolmate was getting more intimate with my rapist, as I’d see his car in front of his house more and more. 

I recently reconnected with my schoolmate on Instagram. I found out that he’s starting to produce his own music and art, and I’m really happy for him, but I also found out that he recently married the man that raped me. 

I guess the advice I’m looking for is, do I tell my old friend about the abuse the man put me through? I’m not looking to ruin a marriage, but I feel like he deserves to know what the guy has done. What if he’s already told my friend and he just doesn’t care? I’d feel like an idiot at that point. 

Sorry for the long winded post, any advice is helpful.",30Aug2020,1
276,"     I am a female, and have been somewhat uncomfortable with that fact for an awful long time. Ever since I hit puberty years back, I’ll get this painful longing feeling whenever I catch sight of certain men, whether it be a favorite celebrity or a dude in the grocery store. 

From a younger age, I confused this feeling for romantic/sexual attraction. I thought that I had some crush on these certain men or something. While I’m definitely into men in general, this longing feeling soon proved to be something that defied an attraction of any sort. 

At some point, can’t quite remember which, it suddenly occurred to me to wonder what it would be like to BE one of those men I had this longing feeling toward. I started crying the minute that thought presented itself. Emotion that seemed to be years’ worth of feelings poured out of me, and in an instant, I understood what all this meant. 

I’ve long since come to the conclusion that if I were born male, I would be much happier that way. I have so much respect for everyone out there who has transitioned, but I don’t think I’m brave enough. I don’t think I’ll ever have what it takes to be the guy I want to be. I’ll never have the bottom half to prove it, nor the chest. I will never have a guy’s voice. I’d just be known as someone who’s transitioned. No one would ever look at me and assume I’m a guy. Anyone would ever call me that just to be nice. Even my looks as a female would not look the best on a male. My personality is too feminine. 

I don’t know if I could keep going the way I am, though. No matter what people tell me about my body, it always disgusts me in some little way with how big my boobs are or how full my thighs are. I wish I grew up as a guy. I think about what I would’ve worn and done as a guy all the time. I think about the school life I would’ve had. The ways I would’ve expressed my feminine side while still being very much a GUY. Life is so uncomfortable. No amount of makeup makes me feel pretty. My inescapable female body, seeing other men I admire just being themselves and being blessed to have been born male. I hate these clothes I wear. I wish I was born with a dick so bad.

So anyway basically lol do you think transitioning in any way would be worth it for me, or should I hold it out a little longer since I’m worried a transition will never fulfill me anyway?",30Aug2020,1

I’ve been on tinder, bumble, and okcupid since last October and I have never gotten a date out of them and I’ve only gotten like 10 matches total between them. It’s made me realize how ugly I am and how much I hate the way I look, I can’t even look in the mirror without ruining my day. I’ve had successful friends look over my profiles, take pictures of me, I’ve remade my bio several times, nothing has helped. I even paid for tinder gold for like 7 months.

I just feel like my mental health is ruined. I don’t remember the last time I felt very happy. I don’t even get extremely depressed anymore, I usually feel numb until I smoke or drink. I have accepted the fact that I will most likely kill myself in the next couple of years because I have nothing to look forward to. I struggle to look people in the eye unless we’re talking, I feel so inferior to everyone else I just don’t want to bother. I don’t use the dating apps really anymore, I’ve given up on ever finding someone. When I hear my Roomate’s hanging out in the living room I try my hardest to make sure I don’t leave my room, I don’t want anyone to see me.

I’ve been going to therapy for 6 months and despite the fact that I have an awesome therapist it hasn’t really helped. I don’t care about being alive anymore, I have no goals or aspirations. I don’t have dreams I want to achieve, when people ask me what my plans are for the future I have to lie. I have none. I live my days one at a time because I know that one day I’m just going to end it anyways.

What do I do? I feel like I’ve accomplished everything I can and I have nothing to look forward to.",30Aug2020,1
291,"So 5 weeks ago I found out my boyfriend of 8 months had been cheating on me, and he is currently still with the girl he cheated on me with. The thing is, miss him. Like, a lot. Believe me, I don't ever want to be with him again because I dont trust him in a relationship...but i miss our connection. I miss his energy and I miss the way he made me feel. So, I was thinking of messaging him. I still want to be friends, but im not sure if it's a good idea. Like, my heart wants me to do it, but my brain says no. Should I text him??",30Aug2020,1

Is that a red flag? For both him, and for myself. This is super duper fresh, so bear with me.

I'm so angry that against my better judgement I went and looked up my ex-husband's recent Reddit history. And I'm mad that he seems happy. Partly because I don't believe he is, partly because I don't want to believe he is. 

It's been nearly two years (still not officially divorced but might as well be) and his voice is still there, screaming in my head that I'm doing everything wrong. Put the dishes away in that way, fold the clothes in that way, why would you go about x that way? etc.

Only one red flag has arised:
He refuses to post about me, even went as far as deleting his Facebook and Instagram (leaving only Snapchat) when we started becoming official..

I was super hurt and upset at first and we talked about why he doesn’t post about me and I chalked it up to being immature

About a month ago I glanced over while he was using his phone and I saw a girl was texting him and I asked who it was and he said his exes friend who wanted them two to connect. He said he ignored her and that was it

Today, I saw him chat another girl who he said was his friend.. but I have a bad feeling.

You know when people say trust your gut? My gut is telling me something isn’t right

He doesn’t post about me, so for all I know she’s under the impression he’s single.

I’ve talked to him about this two times already at by now it feels like I’m beating a dead horse but I just don’t know what to do.. it could be insecurities after all.

One day out of the blue since her health some what improved, she looked for a relationship with a guy even though she was anti men.  Wasted her v on someone on omegle, and after 3 months he lost interest and she looked for someone else. He basically groomed her as he knew her from age 14 or something and prob knew she was a v obviously as she wasnt ready to date at age 16. 
She basically stopped paying much attention to her ex best mate of 6 yrs as she looked for something ""better ""
He prob felt used and saw how self absorbed she became so he blocked her on ALL social media! I also had a small convo with him about this a while ago.

302,"Hi. I will try to keep this short as possible though this is a pretty long story. 

Me (18F) and my friend (19F) have known each other since kindergarten. We have been on and off friends because of school switching and life changes, etc. 

Recently, I have REALLY felt the need to end the friendship. We got super close about 5 years ago. Ever since then, things have seemed to get worse and worse each year. She has become more mentally ill, negative, stubborn, narcissistic, unstable and downright awful to be around. 

She has untreated depression, anxiety and OCD and has used me as her therapist every single day for the past few years. I have asked her to get help to no avail. She never really taking consideration for my needs/issues/or life in general. Anytime she freaks out, I have to be the one to deal with her. But if I ever need her she offers a simple “aw im sorry, I am sure it will be okay”. I feel unheard all the time, but when I do call her out (I have multiple times over the years) I get a “I’m never enough for anyone” card pulled on me. 

I got into a relationship a few months ago and since then, our friendship has taken a turn. My partner has made me realized how unfair she has treated me and how I’m basically in an emotionally abusive relationship. Is he right? Both her and her mother seem to think he is the reason why I feel this way. 

She has had many friends, though they have mostly gone because of her ways and I have always tried to reassure her that they were in the wrong. Now I wish I was one of them. Every time I try to take a break from her, she makes me feel bad and I come back. 

I don’t trust her, as I’ve seen her talk badly about her ex friends and air out their secrets or personal info. She even treats me very coldly if i talk about her ex-friend (they were best friends previously for five years), who is still on good terms with me. I am fearful of her sometimes. Should I get out?

305,"I am having a week- as we all are. My parents got everything ready to evacuate from their home the Santa Cruz mountains and, thankfully, did not have to evacuate. Was still stressful. Work is depressing; I work in Crisis Communications, and we just had massive layoffs. And, on top of that, a good friend suddenly died of Covid on Weds. I'm cranky, I'm sad, and I'm unfocused. Generally I'm positive, but right now it's hard to be optimistic about anything.

Tonight I saw my parents and aunt and uncle for a socially-distance barbecue. I was unfocused and kind of staring off in the distance for the first part of it, until my mom looked at me said ""clearly, you're in a bad mood. what's wrong?"" I wasn't doing anything bad, it's just....hard for me to focus on a lot other than my friend who's passed and how overwhelming everything feels. So I said ""sorry, it's been hard for me to focus. I'm having a hard week. You know, my friend died..."" and my mom interrupts me and says ""You think your week has been tough? I've been scared about my house burning down all week!"" 

Now, this is my issue. I don't need to know that my mother thinks that her pain is worse than mine. It might be. I don't know. What I do know is that I feel like shit, and I'm being open about how I'm feeling because honestly I'd like a little support. When my mom says ""You think your week has been tough? I've been scared about my house burning down all week,"" all I hear is ""you think you've had it bad? I've had it worse!"" I can't really articulate to myself why this is the incorrect response when I bring up the fact that I've been mourning a friend, but I need to. I need my mom to know that this was a completely inappropriate response. I also need her to know that I feel really awful that she's so scared about what she's going through. How do I do both? How do I say ""it really hurt my feelings that you put your pain before mine"" while also acknowledging that her pain is just as valid as mine? And how do I articulate why this was an inappropriate response in the first place?",30Aug2020,1
306,"I have a bad habit of envying and comparing myself to my father. I grew up with the mentality that if your not doing it perfect, your not doing it right. Or, if you have free time you need to be productive. These were all from my mother and father, but my father was the main impact of my childhood. Being a first born to high-school dropouts, I realize my parents had to learn the skills of parenting quickly along the way. But thankfully, my father worked as much as he could, minimum 6-7 days a week at work and would bring work home, just to provide for his family. I grew up with being amazed at how hard he worked and tried to work as hard as him. If I came home from school and tried to relax, (most of the time) they would push me to maintain the house, cutting weeds, watering trees, etc. Which I was fine with since it was the least I could do for them raising me. But when it came time to learn a new skill, my father had zero patience, he would show me once and expect me to get it right away. Frustrated with my lack of gaining perfection at first crack at something, he would just tell me to go put tools away or go inside to where I would be complained at by my mother for not being outside while my father was working hard constantly. That is when I noticed I had started having self-doubt.

 To compensate for this I would try to go above and beyond whenever it came to tasks, such as doing things without them telling me, like helping out with a project my father was working on, or cutting up some branches my father said that he didn't like on trees. But any flaw that was made resulted in complaining. This frustrated me internally because I never felt like I could do anything right, at least around my parents. This occurred during my teen years mostly, when my father decided to become a firefighter. He was able to manage running his own business, go to fire-school, coach sports, and still make time for his family. I always wondered and envied how he managed to do everything that he does. He always puts others before himself and does what needs to be done without asking for help.

But with myself, I feel like I will never reach his level of skill. Even being told this by my mother during my teen years, I saw this as a type of challenge where I prove them wrong and show them there are always to heights to be reached. I did prove to them that going to a university was possible and I could explore new careers. 

Having them always downgrade my achievements or just compare me to my father and his capabilities at my age was a huge part of my childhood. But ever since I came to college, there mentality changed and they are now supportive of me. But I still have my past experiences affecting me and cannot go last them.. I am a 1st gen 3rd year college student majoring in Mechanical Engineering, I am also a Residential Assitant, so this results in a nearly zero free-time schedule. If I'm not working my job, I'm studying, and anything else i do feels like I'm wasting time (including time to myself, like playing some sports outside, or even a couple videogames) I have a mentality where if you aren't exhausted, you need to work harder. I never feel like I'm doing good with my tasks. An example being, if I get a C on an exam I feel disappointed because I think, my father could have done better or he would not be struggling at all, even with more on his plate. No matter what I do in life, I compare myself to my father and if it's not perfect I feel like I did it entirely wrong. This lowers my confidence and motivation with future tasks. I realize this is wrong but can't get it out of my head due to being raised and pushed too hard with certain things.

Then they started smoking weed at age 18
Which I honestly also didn't care about that much since it was like once at first, and then not again until months after

Recently they've been hanging out with people until past midnight and if their parents found out what they were doing, they'd up kill them as they're from a very conservative household




Well last night they literally stayed up all night partying, and they told me that they took a pill twice (or two halves so basically one pill) and that people were telling them not to take it but also urging them to take it, and they ended up just dancing all night and they kissed a guy twice
What kind of upset me is that I know they will regret it since they've never kissed anyone before or even came close




I never tell them any of my concerns because they're a very closed person and I'm the only one they tell any of these things to, and I don't want them to think that I'd be mommying them and end up ruining our friendship
I want them to at least let me know where they are in case something happens


I just told them I'm glad you had fun, which they did, they kept talking about how amazing that night was




I really want to be able to help them, I don't want them to make bad decisions that ruin their life forever
But also I wanna stay in my lane, I don't want to get in their business but I can't help but be concerned..

315,"So the title is a bit... Well, obvious. But I'll explain; my (23m in the UK) grandparents (both about 80, I'll be honest I'm not sure exactly) have been managing quite well on their own. My grandma is basically blind - completely blind in one eye because of a failed cataract surgery, almost completely in the other because of a cataract she refuses to have treated because of the issues with the other eye, but at this point she can't see so I personally don't see any harm in her trying to have it sorted other than she's old and surgery itself is a risk at that age.

My grandad is, mostly, fine. He's got some mobility issues because he had to have his knee and hip replaced a few years ago, but otherwise he appears relatively well for his age.

The issue is, my grandma has started to develop dementia, and while she *can* still do a lot, she lacks confidence to try, relying on my grandad.

The problem is this; while it's great that my grandad does help her, I think he's going too far. Yes, she clearly needs help, but he often doesn't give her a chance to do things herself, so she's becoming dependant on him. And statistically she'll be around for a while longer than him (horrible to think of, but you've got to at a certain point) which means she will *have* to go in a care home if she can't get her confidence up soon.

More worrying thing - they have a caravan by the sea, and me and my other half have been here two days and it's obvious they're not taking care of it properly (mould on the walls, crumbs all over the floor, spiders pretty much everywhere etc etc they'd only been up last week which is why I'm concerned about the mess) which really surprised me because they were so happy to get it, and my grandad is normally well on top of these kinds of things. Again, horrible to say, but I think my grandma being so dependent is taking much of his time that he would normally use to clean and fix things. Not necessarily a bad thing, but she doesn't need him there constantly, a lot of the time when I go round she's just sat listening to the TV or an audio book anyway, she can do that just fine without him being in the same room, but I think he feels a bit guilty in case anything did happen.

My question is this; how do I politely point out that they clearly need help? And what do people think the best idea is? I was thinking doing online shopping for them, getting a cleaner to go round a few times a month (they don't make much mess so anything more regular would be a waste of money imo) and taking them out more (because obviously going shopping is a big part of their week in terms of going out).

I absolutely do not want them to have to move to assisted accommodation, but it's quickly getting to a point where I might not have a choice but to force their hand using the mental health act (I really don't want to do this because I know they'll hate me for it, but if I have to do it to help them, I will)

For a bit of background... My mum died of cancer a few months back, and I think there still grieving, which may be part of the issue. My uncle lives in the US so can't really help with day to day care.

320,"Hey everyone.. I'll try to keep this short.

My boyfriend (31m) and I (27f) have been dating for about a year and a half. Recently hit a rough patch with money, it had caused a couple arguments. It came up in the argument, he says he has no sex drive, no desire. Ok, I get that stress can take a toll on that.

But not twenty minutes later, at the store. He was pretty much oogling every female under the age of forty in the vicinity. He didn't know I saw. He had done this before, it gave me a sick pit in my stomach. But this time it was literally just making me feel sick. Turning his head around to look at girls, looking past me at girls....

I brought it up to him and he said he'll be more ""aware"". Which, honestly, he works at a grocery store, he probably will try to avoid it when I'm around, but oogle every girl that's in his area. The thought of it makes me sick. He said, multiple times before that he doesn't notice other women. Obviously that's a bald faced lie.

When I approached the subject again today, he got mad and said that even though we're dating, it doesn't make the other attractive people disappear. I get that, but I've shut people down hard for trying to hit on me, I can't imagine looking at everyone like a piece of ass like he does. He said he's going to work on it, but I don't really trust it yet, for obvious reasons.

I told him I'm going to be guarded for a while until I can actually see the change, and to not take it personally, too which he replied that he would take it personally but he has to get over it.

I've been in relationships where I'm cheated on. I think a wandering eye (especially after saying his sex drive is dead) is pretty disrespectful. He says he understands but also tries to defend the behavior and act like I need to get over it before the problems gone?!

What do I do? I'm obviously not going to be all happy go lucky about this, and I don't want to be in psycho girlfriend mode, that's not fair to have to waste energy. When do I know I can trust him? Any words of advice for me, or him? 

Tl;dr: my boyfriend was checking out every female with a heartbeat while we were shopping right after he said he had no sex drive. He also seems miffed I can't just get over it.",30Aug2020,1

Our office building had a barbecue and we all had a few drinks. I remember laughing and still enjoying the evening. Not even feeling drunk or tipsy at all. 

The next thing I remember is being dropped off at home by one of the workers in our office building much later in the evening. I will call him Frank. 

After that again nothing until i woke up the next morning 


I feel horrible that i can't remember. I genuinely only remember being fine 

I don't know what I did, what i said. 
I have bruises all over and a swollen foot so 
I must have fell down at some stage 

I went to the office and asked Frank what happened and if I embarrassed myself 

He said I was loud and laughing like someone who had to much too drink. Slurring my words 
He also said (and this broke my heart) that we had intercourse and then he drove me home because i wasn't capable of driving 

I am mortified, ashamed and disgusted with myself
I have been wishing, begging, praying that i could remember anything.
But nothing comes

I just cry and cry
How do i face everybody again 
How do i face him 

I can't just quit, i will try looking for other work so that i can get away 
I feel like they probably all think I'm this drunk slutty person 
Which i really am not 

What can i do to feel better 
I am crushed with self hate and disgust

322,"Back when I was in 4th grade I was in a club about a math board game, we did meetings I think every other day. But this one time I remember the teacher who ran the club told me to come for a meeting on a not normal meeting day. So I went to their classroom where we do meetings but she wasn’t there and there was not meeting, I immediately started panicking and running to the front of the school to try a find my moms, which thankfully she was still their picking up my brother. And now I always think about it and I think I have a fear of school clubs because I think I will be left behind even though I have a phone I can call or text. And now I’m only a year away from high school and I know clubs can help get me into collage but I need help forgetting the memory because I tried doing a robot club last year but I quit halfway because I didn’t know if there was a meeting.

To those who feel the same, what do you guys do to cope at work?

And to all those who have experienced this, how did you overcome all of these?

I'm really scared. I got a new job which requires leadership skills and with lots of work to do. My past job didn't require formal trainings. I started working from the same day I was interviewed and hired. The work didn't need leadership skills and I guess my bosses are just kind enough to not let go of me. 

I actually experienced being a leader back when I was in elementary and high school because I needed to. I thought I was smart back then because I was a consistent honor student. But, I was wrong. I got to study in a university by not actually passing the entrance exam, but just being on the ""waiting list"" even though the exam was easy according to a lot of people including my classmates. So, when I go to school, I always felt so small and dumb around my classmates who all seem very smart and capable except me. I graduated in college with little (only if required) to no participation in classes except for written exams/quizzes. 

Now that I'm working, I still feel the same. I actually feel worse than before. I feel so inadequate in all the aspects of my life. I feel so overwhelmed. I don't know what to do. Posting this even took me a lot of time just to check if what I'm saying makes sense. 

I accepted the job offer because I feel like in order to overcome my social anxiety, I need to get out of my comfort zone. But, I'm really really really scared of what might happen. I feel like I won't even pass the 3 mos. training period in order to be a regular employee. Should I back out?

324,"I was looking in the mirror tonight and I definitely need a haircut I’m getting a little long (hair touches the beginning of my nose when I stretch it) I know it’s kinda lame but my mom has ALWAYS cut my hair and she’s always cut it the same way, short on the sides and longer on the top and I brush it to the right (brush as in I use my fingers lol) 

Anyways my wife mentioned that my hairs getting a bit long and she’s debating on trying to cut it  herself (I think she’s nervous about messing it up)
So I was thinking I would get a nice haircut tomorrow and take her out for a dinner date! 

So my big question is, do I get my normal short cut on the sides and have them slightly trim it? Or do I look for a different type of haircut? And what kind of haircut can I even get? Are haircut options limited to the type of hair you have?

325,So I'm a male 19 and I have a female friend who is also 19. My friend has been going through a rough situation these past weeks. And I've been her shoulder to cry on until a few days ago. I've always had an interest in her but it seems like now everything is ruined. We work at the same job different departments. So we've been getting close since she got hired. Anyways one day she went through a bad situation and decided to stay the night with me. But some events took place and she got herself hospitalized for a week. I heard about everything from one of her friends and a friend of mine who knows her heard everything. A group of us were smoking at my house and he brought her up and I explained the situation. I made sure nobody was gonna say anything. Then after a week of hearing nothing or seeing her she shows back up from work. Ignoring my messages and attempts at talking to her. Apparently the whole place heard about her situation and said they heard it from me. How do I fix something like this?

I also tried stuff that none of my friends even like just to see if I might like them. But again none of these activitys sparked this passion. I enjoy many things thats not the problem.

329," Sorry if this post is a bit of a mess, it's kind of a reflection of my mental state right now. I wasn't even intending to post this but everything seems to be going to hell and I don't know who to turn to for help.

Just to give a bit of a background, I (23F) much to my embarrassment, have only recently finished my first year of university in China. My family is not financially well-off and we were sent here under the condition that we would be able to win a scholarship every year. By my second semester here, the virus had already made its presence known and all our classes were online, causing our professors to pretty much stop giving a shit and the semester was turned into a very expensive self-study session. But I managed to pull through, somewhat confident that I'll at least be able to snag a partial scholarship. After the exams, thanks to a reckless friend of mine who decided that jumping out of my dorm room's balcony to sneak out of campus would be a wonderful idea (she ended up with broken bones), the school ended up taking disciplinary action against me and I lost any shot at a scholarship. 

Now, the only way a person could potentially support themselves in this situation is by working illegally which I'm not inclined to do no matter how many people say it's safe as long as you keep quiet about it. From what I can see, there's no other way to stay here unless my parents get a loan which I'm also disinclined towards because I don't think this university is worth it and it had been confirmed that the next semester will be much of the same. To me, it seems best to return home and continue in a university there but I still haven't heard back from the university I applied to. And here's the best part: I can't find an affordable flight back sooner than the expiry of my visa and I'm currently staying in the campus dorm which I'll have to leave once I leave the university. And if I find a flight and it gets cancelled, I'll have pretty much no where to go. I'm pretty determined to leave the university at this point, I just lack the means to do so, and soon.

I know we did and I know he knows we did but nobody wanted to ask each other out, he asked his parents if he could date me but they said no and to wait for the future. We talked to eachother like we were in a relationship. Did things couples did. But never said it’s official. Like i was some 30 day trail. I liked him, he liked me. Boom let’s secretly date.

But I keep coming back. He ends up telling me he never wanted to date me. He didn’t like me, telling me I was so annoying. Everytime I’m having fun with him he would question why I’m so exaggerated. He told me everything he did wasn’t to date me. Yet he asked his parents. Sometimes I think he tries to deny all the   things he’s done with me or for me.

340,"I am going to admit something that has been eating me up for just the past week, I have been feeling guilty and ashamed for what I have done in the past when I was 11 and 12. 

that is, when I was younger I used to trace big artists with really good drawings art. at the time I thought it was gonna help me draw better and not fully understanding that tracing other artists' art is terrible. I actually thought that maybe it would help me improve.

And the time my friends were showing their art to me and it looked amazing, and I honestly thought it looked better than mine and for some reason it made me think that I would never achieve something like that and I started to have self-esteem and insecurities about my art. So I started tracing more in order to just feel validation from my friends and congratulating ""my work"" that ""I've done"". 

And I know now that is not the case and no one should ever trace over someone's art and call it ""theirs"". Ever since I turned 13 I fully understood that tracing others' art is bad and it actually doesn't help you improve it just makes you look like an asshole.

Ever since then I started to work pass my insecurities and started to actually put effort into my art and start improving myself without tracing. Instead, I would look up lessons on YouTube and start searching for people's references on Pinterest and start practicing without tracing any art. 

I've come very far and my art has gotten better ever since and I can say that I am very proud of myself that I came over tracing and actually started to put effort into my artwork. 

But lately, I just have been thinking about how I used to trace art when I was young and It just has been eating me up.. and I am still friends with the friends I showed my art too when I was younger. They don't know that the art I showed them at the time was traced and they were hyping me up for basically nothing. 

I don't know if I should confront them about this or not, I just feel like a terrible person. I sort of don't want to and just move on from it but I feel like that might be unfair for my friends on not knowing the truth. I'm just afraid of how they will see me now if I tell them the truth.

353,"hey!! i’m from the uk (16F) and i’m starting college in a couple of days and i’m so unbelievably scared. i don’t really know how people can help but just reassure me. i’ve never changed school besides when we were 11 moving up to secondary. i’m literally so so anxious and it’s making me just mot even want to live to avoid the situation so much. i don’t know many people going besides 2/3 of my friends but i might not even see me them. everytime i think of that first day, i just instantly think of killing myself because of how badly i don’t want to go. school used to stress me out so unbelievably bad and i used to spend a lot of time in my schools office with support workers or just to get away from people. i feel super overwhelmed and i can’t avoid the topic. we have to wear “business attire” and that makes me feel really self conscious incase people don’t like my clothes, atleast at school we all had to wear the same uniform. i hate the way i look in blazers and trousers but we have to wear them, the other night i tried it on and got so scared and worked up about it that i self harmed. i just need people to calm me down and tell me about their experiences good or bad to be honest &lt;3",30Aug2020,1

359,"Hey folks, this is a bit of a long one. Sorry if my english is a bit weird, I'm not a native speaker.
So a few years ago my parents had a, let's just say ""not so peaceful"" divorce. I woke up with screaming and shouting and also went to bed with it for several years. It hit my brother worse than me since my father always stressed him about school and when he brought home a bad grade he would get screamed at by my dad until my mom found out and intervened. My dad was almost unable to notice how he was hurting my brother mentally all this time.

 He was also never actually there when we were little since he was working so my mother raised us alone (thank god for that). Things got worse but I don't want to get into detail. I also found out that my father had an affair during their marriage and actively flirted with other women. Anyway today I live with my mom. My brother moved out a few months ago and broke off contact with my dad after the marriage. My life is way better now but I'm afraid that my mental health worsened during these years. Some time after the divorce I tried to build up a new relationship with my dad since he said he changed. And he did...atleast I thought so.

 We got along really well for the last 2-3 years. He even met with my brother again to do the same thing. But everything was just a facade. He is unable to recognize his own mistakes. If something doesn't go his way he gets mad. If he makes mistakes he just makes excuses. My brother tried to tell him the mistakes he makes but my dad called him pathetic. It got to the point where my brother, his own son, asks me why he hates him and if hes that bad of a son. He gets angry at me for the simplest mistakes when he's stressed and he's stressed all the time. And even though I wanted to repress it, my dad is also a racist and an asshole. He's also showing signs of sociopathy. 

The thing that really shocked me and I don't know if I should be saying this...I found 50 handgun rounds in his room while searching for a charging cable (I live in a country where that is illegal and could be punished with jail time). There were 13 missing rounds. I haven't found a gun yet. All of that combined wants to make me break off contact with him but I'm not sure since he is still my father. I don't think that he is a good influence for anyone, I can't tolerate how he treats and talks about other people, especially my family and the thing that I would never do is to put them in danger through this man. Any advice on what I should do?",30Aug2020,1
360,"I'm an 18 year old female and I've always been curious about such things, considering I've never done anything. In the past I've been confused about my sexuality and it still confuses me to this day. However I think with an experience like this I would feel a bit more sure of what I really like. But the guilt is eating me up. On one side I really want to do it, but the other part of me is having second thoughts, I'm a bit unsure and afraid. What if I regret it? I always thought I'd lose my virginity to someone I really really care about but then again the opportunity just appeared. Again my curiosity is just eating me up.

364,"Ok here’s the basics- online friend who I’ll call sam. Sam and I have known each other for maybe a month or two, and about a week ago we were texting late at night and the conversation turned pretty sexual as I tried to make him uncomfortable as a joke. It got out of hand and we ending up sexting, essentially making up a story and I listened to him masturbate to me (I failed in making him uncomfortable and he was the one who pushed it into a sexual territory to be clear). I asked him before we went to bed if this would happen again and he said “perhaps” and at the time I thought it was pretty clear to both of us that yes, it was. 

My theory on this was confirmed when he texted me in my maths class (he’s in quarantine, I’m not. Also don’t worry, I’m a senior) and basically started to tell me about another sexual fantasy, trying to turn me on. It took him a few times but he eventually got the message that I wasn’t interested and stopped. 

Since then there’s been nothing, and when I briefly mentioned it today he responded really immediately saying “no”. He sounded embarrassed, and I’m not sure if it was because he was walking around in public and there were people near and I didn’t realise or if his second attempt embarrassed him, or if he just wasn’t interested. It’s just strange to me that his attitude changed so much, even if there was a few days in between.

373,"Me and this girl met each other at the beginning of high school, and we have been best friends with each other for 3 years now. Only problem is that on this 3rd year we have gotten so close and we have told each other many things, things that I shouldn’t say for privacy and we have helped each other through certain dark times, we have developed great chemistry and we like the same things, share common interests and we have often told each other that we love each other because of how deep our relationship is. The thing is that my best friend developed a crush on her the same time I did this year, and he ended up starting to date this girl. 

I was going through a bad time last term of school and had a deep depression from a lot of things and as a result of her helping me and being the only one that cared about me the way I needed it, I developed that crush and I did tell her that I used to have one on her and I don’t have a crush on her anymore (which is a lie.)

The massive problem is that I still care about her in a romantic way and I don’t know what to do. We often touch each other physically (not sexually) just hugging, hold hands for a bit, touch each other playfully or I may put my arm around her, and she tells me she feels the most comfortable and the most like herself around me, we say to each other “I love you”, we call each other pet names and sometimes go out with each other for walks or just talk to each other almost everyday. 

A lot of things changed when I took a 3 week break from our relationship because I just felt so stressed of certain things and when I told her I was ready to come back she always told me that she missed me and however long I would take to be ready she would always be waiting for me to be back with her again. We relate to each other so well but it’s just I don’t know what to do when my best friend is dating her and they always hang around with each other and he obviously loves her and she obviously loves him a lot.

I’ve come to a couple of conclusions but I just feel so much stress on what to do and what’s the best thing to do.

I either tell her what i feel and give her time to think about it, keep it in and try to let the feelings pass even though it’s so hard to do that when I think of her everyday or completely end our relationship.

377,"Hello, yesterday I had a pretty rough day. My gf messaged me in the morning and said we can’t be friends and blocked me on everything without giving me the option to speak. 

We had a difficult time during lockdown, we had to put things on hold but she didn’t want to be in a long distance relationship with me as she has been no one in the past. We live 2 hours away. I was very upset about the blocking that I drank a bottle of iron supplements and swallowed 21 Kalms pills. I felt fine though. My dad took me out to calm me down but it just made me feel worse. I went home and the girl messaged me again giving me reasons why she blocked me. 

 But this morning I woke up again and swallowed 21 more Kalms pills. My parents don’t know about it. I just tried to throw up, but I can’t. I can’t eat or drink. I’m not upset about the girl as much. But that’s what triggered this situation, I am also in a bit of a pickle with university related stuff. But I went over my head yesterday and felt like ending it all was the only option.

378,"**TL;DR at the end!** + I’m on a throwaway account

A bit of background, my girlfriend and I play a multiplayer game together pretty frequently. The game uses a quick message pinging system, and one of the messages is a “Thank you” message. It’s sweet, but often used in a toxic way (pinging it sarcastically when someone messes up to make them feel bad)

Personally, I think those who use it sarcastically no matter what the error is are being extremely rude and shouldn’t be on a multiplayer team based game matching with random people if they’re going to be mad at every screw up a person could do. It’s immature and takes the fun out for everyone else, especially if the other players aren’t trying to become ranking pros or anything (such as myself)

I thought my girlfriend and I agreed that the game was just a game and being rude is just pointless, but in a game a teammate messed up and they caused me to (almost) be killed in game. I didn’t care personally (yet again, just playing for fun), I was confused when the mess up happened but it was whatever, we’d manage a tie even if I lost.

But my girlfriend began to say the “thank you!” sarcastic message at the other player. This made me really upset with her because I don’t tolerate that kind of behaviour.

We argued about it for a while. Her defence was that she didn’t use it for people making mistakes, she used it when the person was just stupid and that there’s things she’d tolerate and things she wouldn’t and call it a flaw but she doesn’t find anything wrong with it. She also said that she does it to let them know they “f*cked up” and so they won’t do it again.

I of course countered that it was just a game and people are just trying to have fun. Win or loss shouldn’t matter (we were not playing in a ranked match at the time, and she said herself that she doesn’t care about her wins and loss rates) and playing with humans will obviously mean mistakes are made. That, and shaming them will make them lose confidence and often play worse.

She said that she would like to keep her opinion as I keep mine. The argument “ended” when she said “I’m too tired to argue”, sent a screenshot of someone on reddit sharing her opinion and left me on read. I ended off said I was sorry if I made it seem like I was attacking her and that we could discuss it when she was less tired.

Usually I would leave it at that but I feel like I’m worried less about her being mean to a rando on a game and more about her being fine with shaming people when they’ve barely done anything wrong, and then thinking it’s totally fine to dip out of the discussion without any promise of settling things. She hasn’t talked to me since (was about 2 days ago and we don’t see each other in person because COVID) and I haven’t texted her (though I’m planning to real soon, hence this long post)

I... don’t think I’m wrong honestly. I stand by everything I said and didn’t say anything passive aggressive or rude to my knowledge. But I just want her to see that it’s not worth hurting people when you’re mad in a game and that there are much healthier ways of expressing your anger to yourself. Vent about it to friends, complain about losses but don’t attack your teammates mid game, you know? 

First, am I in the wrong here? And second, how can I explain this to her without sounding condescending and holier-than-thou? My current plan is to text her and ask to discuss it openly and address the underlying issue. I’m not upset anymore, I just don’t want our relationship to sour over a game.

**TL;DR**: My girlfriend was being toxic on a game and left the conversation after I called her out for it. I don’t care about her being toxic on the game as much as I care about her trying to defend being rude to people with “it’s okay if you think they’re stupid because then you’re just letting them know they should do better”. I don’t think I am in the wrong here, so how can I settle this without being condescending or backing down?

(I’m aware that this is a hefty order that may not have a solution. Some differences can’t be settled, but I want to try before I give up. She means a lot to me, but I can’t agree with being unnecessarily cruel for temporary personal satisfaction)",30Aug2020,1
379,"So, I’m a high schooler about to be in my senior year. The thing is, the summer wasn’t exactly a smooth sail. I got into a augment with my family or rather my dad and my grandma but also my girlfriend. At the time all of the stuff made me pretty much all over the place with emotions, since then me and my family made up as in my dad and my grandma. Me and my grandma talked and the decision led to me moving in with my mom since I felt like I’ve been stagnated with my life and really motivation. I ended up moving to moms and my grandma helped me, but now I’m in a new city with leaving the small amount of friends I had but also my girlfriend. 

The thing that’s been troubling me is how I’m going to graduate and whether I should end the relationship. I’ll start of with the schooling, I skipped a lot and this made me either fail my classes or pass with marks that barely will get me by. I’m also missing classes I’ll need to pass. So the new city and new school just seems like a lot to try and do. The problem with my relationship with my girlfriend is that when we had the augment we both didn’t handle the situation well, and I noticed since then I’ve been drifting away. I’m no longer super happy to get her texts, or even during phone calls I don’t feel as much excitement. I can’t see myself being with her in the future at least not right now. The augment was caused by my own insecurities and problems which I believe I should try and fix.  I know I’ve left out a lot of detail which might make me sound cold in this but I do care about her. I just don’t want to keep playing along with her feelings and pretend that I’m happy when I’m not. Part of me is scared to do anything since it’ll break her heart, since I know she cares dearly for me way more than I do for her. I know this.

I just don’t really know what to do. I’ve been pretty blank whenever I think how everything’s unfolded and on how I feel about everything. I also don’t feel a hint of motivation to try and pass school but I’d like to try the best I can. Any advice would help really, I just don’t know really what to do. I don’t feel anything about everything and it feels like I’m going back into when I was numb to everything. I just reacted to things happening me, and it feels like I’m going to relapse into that.

381,"Hi guys,

I’m going through some stuff at the moment and I’m struggling with it quite badly. Please do not judge me for what I’m about to say, try and be empathetic because I know what I’m thinking is morally incorrect and stupid. 

For context: I live in Australia, I am gay, and nobody knows about my current relationship 

I’ve been seeing this guy for the last 6-8 months. We have never officially labeled it, however we did recently sign a lease and move in together. When we first started talking, I could honestly see myself being with him forever. I never imagined myself liking anyone else and it would only ever be him. However now that we live together, I am CONSTANTLY wanting my own space and just be alone sometimes. Sometimes the thought of even coming home makes me create plans on the spot so I don’t have to go back. I’ve realised now however that it is because I like someone else AS WELL as him.

Last year I saw this guy on and off for awhile, however it was always really awkward because we never really knew what to talk about or do. Nothing really happened, he slept over once and we talked occasionally before I broke it off. This year I started to talk to him again (we’re in the same classes, so we’re always around each other) and there’s always been a bit of sexual tension and energy between us. The current guy  I’m seeing and I have a rule that if you kiss someone when you’re drunk, it doesn’t count. However - I kissed this old fling when I was drunk last week, and I got butterflies and feelings for him almost instantly. I know it’s not cheating because we’re not in a relationship and we have this “policy”. I’ve been thinking about him non stop, and without going into to much detail about my thoughts I can see myself with this guy. All of his friends have been trying to get us together for AGES, and we’ve always been scared to do it. However I can feel the vibes creeping along, and I think he senses them too, because things have been really good between us and now all I want to do is see him.

Can anyone offer me advice on my thoughts? I really don’t know what to do. I’m stuck in a lease, I don’t want to literally break the current guy I’m seeing. I feel like no matter what I do I will be an asshole to someone, and I don’t want to lose both of them at once. I just don’t know how I’m going to get myself out of this situation and I really need some help.",30Aug2020,1

384,"As the title states, I have recently gotten the need to have feelings for a female and perhaps get into a relationship. Now, relationships seem great. They seem fun and loving. I sometimes find myself envious of couples. However all those positive thoughts disappear when I think of the negative outcomes such as heartbreaks. I'm very well aware of what I'm capable of when my mind gets in a unstable state. I'm not talking about anger or anything of the sort, but more on the depressed side. I feel as if I were to get into a relationship with a female I obviously love very much and she went and cheated on me I wouldn't know what to do with myself. I've never experienced anything of the sort but just thinking about it crushes me. 


Something I also fear that may lead to a heartbreak is the generation of kids surrounding me. You see, in this ridiculous generation kids my age see relationships as games. They'll want you for a week and trash you the next. It's pathetic. I feel as if I'm one of the only ones in this generation that would actually take a relationship seriously. I have a strong feeling that I'll end up falling for a girl and we'll one day get into a relationship then I see a picture of her seducing another man. And that alone is enough to flip the switch in my head.


Now I sometimes ask myself, would I make a good boyfriend? I mostly think I would. I'm a generous, considerate, easy going guy. But that leads me to thinking, just because I have good traits doesn't mean I can get into a relationship with a female I desire and expect to be together forever. It's like saying, ""My driving skills are perfect, I'll never get into a car accident."" Wrong. You could be the best driver in the world but all it takes is one guy to run a red light and smash into your car. Do you see where I'm going with this? It's not about just me alone making a good boyfriend, it's the female being able to also be a loyal girlfriend with good traits as well. 


I simply find it hard to believe I can get into a serious relationship because of my fear of being heartbroken. The way I see it is like a tree. The whole tree is labeled ""heartbroken"". And what branches off are the endless negative possibilities.


Any advice on how to make my situation better would be greatly appreciated. Also, before I make my leave, I am also considering the possibility that maybe I'm not yet ready to enter a relationship yet.",30Aug2020,1
385,"I'm currently in high school, and last year, I almost didn't make it and I almost had to do sophomore year over again. But then lockdown came, which forced me to make my own planning because otherwise, there'd be no structure at all. I started doing all my homework and actually think about what I'm doing, without just putting something on paper and calling it a day. I started making planners for when I'd have to start studying for a test. And I did it! I was forced to work on my own and it was so good for me. I almost didn't make it but at the last second I did it, all because of covid-19. This year, the schools have opened up again and now we can go back to school and follow classes. All I'm thinking about now is; 'tomorrow I have to be there at 8.30, better wake up early.' or 'fuck there's a south-western wind, cycling to school is gonna suck today,' 'ugh I have three free hours today in which I'm not allowed to leave the school,' 'what if that bitch L is gonna be mean to me again?'

I get so physically tired from school nowadays; having to cycle there 30 minutes in the morning with the wind holding me back and then sit there in the first class pretending like I'm not at all out of breath and that my butt isn't sweating like crazy and that I am not afraid that that butt sweat isn't going to leave a stupid looking stain on my pants. I'm so totally not at all focusing on school work and tbh I don't give a fuck about school work anymore. All I care about is getting to school, surviving the day and then getting home and finally being able to relax but oH NO WAIT HAHA FUCK ME THERE'S HOMEWORK. When I get home, I don't want to do shit for school anymore. But I have to otherwise I'm not going to make it and I won't be able to study psychology at a university. How do I find that motivation I had during lockdown? How do I find the motivation to do anything other than sleeping after school? Please help me, because my future is on the line.",30Aug2020,1

She recently mentioned she had a child, a whole ass baby....i want to be a bigger person and stick around, but then again, if the dad didn't stick around, why should I be her hero.

Im 20 years old, I get paid very very well, money is not an issue. But I hate the idea of supporting someone elses child, or having a child at all, since I feel im still young.

Friends have given me advice. The most common advice is to ""stay in the moment"" but even when I do that all I see is the fact that she isn't here. My counselor says to try to fill my mind with other things but I can't find anything more important.

394,"I’m terrified for my friends life. Her husband is an abusive, manipulative coward who used to get drunk and beat her. He’s given her more serious injuries than all of her 4 horses she’s had most of her life. He is a fucking disgrace of a human. 

After they had a child together he stopped but she never ever feels safe when he drinks or even gets mad. She says they’ve never been happy together and they always argue and scream at each other. He makes life a living hell for this woman, even with the menial things like making mess when getting food or leaving shit lying around the house and then shouting at her for being a terrible wife and mother. His financial decisions are horrifying, he has no savings and spends any money he has (including borrowed money) on the first bit of expensive crap he lays his eyes on. He tells their daughter that she doesn’t love her and manipulates their child all the time to make him seem like the perfect dad. It’s sickening to listen to. 
She even likens sex to him to what others would describe as rape.

Well things got turned up to 11 when I came into her life. I met her ages ago but a couple years back I found out that she owns a horse yard and I came along one time and got hooked, now I come all the time and work as a ranch hand and help break in one of their horses. At first everything was fine but the more time I spent with them the worse he got. He hates me that I make her happy and calm when I’m there and always uses me as an excuse to argue ‘cause It’s always my fault when things happen’. He now goes to the pub more than 2 times a week and gets black out drunk and when I am in the house he doesn’t even look at me or speak to me or acknowledge my existence. He is jealous that I make his wife feel safe in her own home. He doesn’t put in the effort to try and save their marriage and just expects her to change the way she feels about him.

I fear that this man genuinely believes that he is a good husband, and that the abuse is okay because he doesn’t remember doing it. Disgusting. 

Now here’s the bit where I don’t know what to do. My friend has reached the limit. When she went to her parents house last week her husband had called her mum and asked her to have a chat with her to ‘sort her out’ (which he apparently calls her mum a lot to whine about her) and she just broke down. Apart from me and a select others she hadn’t told anyone about the abuse and she just let it all out. She told her parents everything, the abuse, the manipulation, the financial burden, the fact that being in the same room as him makes her feel sick. 

She has finally come to the decision of divorce but she hasn’t done anything yet. She doesn’t know what to do because of her daughter as she wants to stay to give her a secure family as she grows up, but that is the only thing keeping her there. She is hesitant to do anything in case he hits her again, she genuinely fears he would actually kill her. 

I need some advice, how can I protect her without having to get too close to it as I think me getting involved may enrage him more? And any suggestions on how she can move forward with the divorce as she has hardly any money?

Sorry it’s long I’m just extremely worried :(",30Aug2020,1
395,"Hi. I have a weird problem that's kinda bothering me since a while. I've been watching a lot of movies and shows, reading a lot of books, listening to a lot of music and in general reading blogs, articles and stuff over the Internet over the last five months.

Whenever I run into something awesome, an enthusiastic zeal sort of fills me! That art(music/media/book) makes me feel something I lovingly want someone I like to feel that too! I want them to have the amazing experience I just had. I want to share the beauty and awesomeness of this song I just heard with them.

Unfortunately... I don't really have any friends(please don't suggest that I make friends, during quarantine that's just not possible), my family isn't remotely into anything I'm in and there's always a huge age and generation gap. I have a boyfriend I'm pretty close to, but he just doesn't show the enthusiasm I'm kind of looking for! He'll sometimes maybe try that song or that book excerpt out just for me to feel acknowledged... But he isn't into anything I'm into. This isn't a compatibility issue... We just like really different things.

And so I'm often left feeling really frustrated and dissappointed that I have no one to share all this awesomeness I'm experiencing. I feel really despaired that no one else is here with me to experience how beautiful this song is... How amazingly written this book is... Or what a masterpiece this movie is.

I'm trying to understand why I feel this way. Like, why can't I just experience all those things for myself and be haply and content with it? Why do I feel this irresistible urge to share it with someone!!? 

Where is this feeling coming from and how can I address it?",30Aug2020,1

399,"BF and I are 21, have been together 2 years. He really loves and cares about me.  He overthinks and doubts *everything*. He seems to have OCD and a therapist I made him see for a few weeks agreed. I know it's cos he's mentally unwell but it hurts so bad to hear his OCD thoughts like ""I worried I didn't find you attractive/hot  anymore, just cute"" or ""I had a few thoughts like if we ever break up a could have sex with Tara"". He will always apologise and make it clear he doesn't mean it and it's only OCD.  I may have made his OCD/uncertainty, worse because I asked questions about what his type is to reassure myself and he said ""growing up, I always thought I'd end up with a really skinny, tall woman but I have no real preference"" (5ft1 woman with BMI 23, so def neither of those things). To reassure me, he'll even make a point to say ""she's hot"" if we see a curvy celeb on TV or on Instagram, just to prove he likes my shape too. 

He has doubted if he loves me cos he finds some other women hotter (fine?) and cos I'm 3 months older (he thought when he was younger the man always had to be older/better to date a year or 2 younger). Or saying ""sometimes when we hang out I want to see my friends/play video games more and I'm really sorry about that"". 

My family *adore* him. I've mentioned some of the hurtful things he's said to my mom. She sympathises but will always tell me I just need to set boundaries and it's clear he loves me so not to take it to heart. He tells me he loves me, texts me throughout the day, calls me every night, visits me when he's off work, surprises me with gifts. I I've felt off for the last 3 months, as I've been thinking maybe this isn't it? Maybe he isn't right? Sometimes he strikes me as lacking ambition. He dresses badly in sweatpants and Adidas sketchers and shaves every 4+ days despite getting stubble within a day. He's gained weight while I've actually lost it since we met. He leaves college work and study to the last minute. I'm the reason he passed a few of his law exams- I listened more in lectures and started studying a weel before, as opposed to the night before.

I do feel bad writing this, I sound so horrible and I hope this is just a phase. I still love him despite this and he has been a great BF 80% of the time- he always bought me amazing presents, never blows me off and made it clear he loves me. I just can't imagine spending the rest of my life with him anymore, not after all the things he's said and I wonder if I'm just picky? I feel guilty if this is all caused by OCD and he's a good dude.

404,"Hi there,

I am a 21F and have been in a relationship with my now fiancée (22F) for almost a year now. However, we have been doing the long distance thing for about 4 months now and it seems like I’m beginning to second guess our future together. When we were together, nothing could bring me more joy and happiness than spending time with her, but now I can’t help but start to wonder if we’ll last past even to the end of this year. 

It’s my first real relationship so I’m not sure if this is something that’s considered “normal” but these days I can’t help but feel super insecure about us and I even start second guessing when she says she loves me. Our conversation has started to become infrequent, and to be honest is quite dry (we live in opposite time zones so it’s hard to hold a conversation for long). 

I have opened up to her about this, and she has apologized for making me feel “not loved” even though I can see that she is trying, but it’s been like this for over a month and I don’t know if I’m doing something wrong or should I just ride this out until this phase ends.

I understand that in relationships, if your partner is not able to emotionally hold the ship together it’s my job to hold it down for the both of us, and vice versa. But I just feel extremely depressed about our future, perhaps that is stemming from my own insecurities or because maybe this is a sign that we’re not meant to be..

412," 

Greetings, to whom it might concern!

I am a 26-year-old male with a Master's degree on Biology.

My story begins with the cruel notion that my childhood as psychologist said were absent. I was beaten, yelled at quite often for no reason. Being constantly worried how should I behave was extremely stressful and the outcomes of my father doings were unpredictable.

School was the same. I was constantly bullied and I asked help from my teachers. I mostly I got a subtle reply of I should stop whining or that they also have impossible dreams as wanting to be ""the queen of England"".

Thus, I started to play computer games early on as an escape from reality. I played many online games and found friends. It was awesome because I always felt like I was useful - finding novel strategies and telling people what to do and how.

I graduated high school with good grades by not studying anything at the class room, I was just sleeping and before a test or an exam I just forced myself to study something within 10 to 20 minutes. I spend my time reading book and not talking to anyone, I havent even spoken to most of my classmates for 12 years.

Off to university, I was happy because I got to live alone with a scholorship. I only slept and studied everyday and not doing anything else. The only problem is that year by year, my memory, energy levels and motivation started to decline rapidly. As an example, going to store to buy food, I needed to rest for 5 to 10 minutes. Needing frequent naps during the daytime and sleeping 12 to 15 hours per day.

I went to a see a doctor asking about my problem, since I saw the other students had the energy to socialize, to study, to party, to work part time and were over all satisfied with their lives. My doctor told me that ""university is not for everyone"" and that her husband dropped out of university in the 5th year of studies. As depressing as it sounded, I went home and continued with my life.

I forced myself to exercise, eat more, take vitamins, fish oil and tried to socialize. I promised that I would run everyday for 3-5 km, eat 2000 cal and go to sleep around 10pm. Forced myself to wake up and make myself some breakfast and go take a shower. I collapsed after 3 months of trying to this. I was really angry since the only thing that the internet says in trying to learn how to be happy is by exercising, healthy foods and socializing, apparently this is for people who have most of the things under control.

Fast forward, I finished my bachelor and started to work in Finland for 1,5 years to gather money for abroad studies. I went to work at 6 am in the morning and left 2 pm. Everyday after work I went to sleep (I was 22 at the time). After 1,5 years my boss told me that I work really good but he is really worried about my overall health - that I am too tired all the time and also I am not talking to anyone. After work, I always went to sleep and slept to the next day. On the weekends I just ate and binged youtube.

24, I went to see a doctor (another one) with the same issue, who concluded that I have depression. She did all the blood tests, checked my lungs and kidneys and for any vitamin deficiency. Everything was good. So, before me going to sweden, she gave me SSRI. It gave me psychosis within the first day. I was scared to take other antidepressants.

My studies in Sweden were even harsher, I was more tired than ever before and I was sent to a psychiatrist in Sweden. I was full of hopes that maybe a country that supposedly I more caring about their own citizens and should be smarted than most of other countries in the world, should know what they are doing. They gave me an SNRI that within 1 weeks gave me severe psychosis. For what ever the reason, they did not allow me to get in to the hospital for any treatment. I was hallucinating and delusion for 1 month and desperate for help, I flew back to Finland for a private psychiatrist, who gave me an antipsychotic. The medicine now just made me more sleepy and as disgusting as it might be, I peed in my bed since I couldnt hold it in due to the drugs relaxing effects.

I stopped taking all other medicines and went back to studing. I was hopeless and wanted to be normal like everyone else. I went to the classes, and there I was looked weirdly, since I didnt have energy to shave or take showers sometimes, I was also asked how does it feel to not have friends from my classmates or that how can a person like myself get into a masters program.

I finished, suprisingly if it wasnt for my supervisor, but as she noticed my memory was really bad, my focus was almost absent and the only thing that saved me was that I already knew a lot.

I now ask you guys, why shouldnt I do suicide? I have not had a normal day in my life ever since I was child, I do not know how to be happy, I desperately looking for options from the internet but NOTHING no advice for my condition except FIND A DOCTOR. The doctors so far who I have a lot in my life havent done anything. I want to work with my doctors, I am willing to cooperate and be as friendly as possible to fix this, but no one wants to help...

Everyday ever since I was 8 has been painful - headaches, fatigue, chest pain, chronic fatigue and no enjoyment of nothing. I kept on going with the idea that ""IT WILL GET BETTER"" idea, obviously it won't. I can not go to work nor socialize since I do not even have energy to go the toilet. Nobody has not taken me seriously and I am deemed as a ""loser"" and ""lazy"".

Why should I continue ?

P.S - I do not answeres like ""pls continues"", ""life is precious"" etc.

I want an answer that explicitly tell me that why should I and people like me continue and what should we do to get help or help ourselves (tips etc).",30Aug2020,1

I’m a male (17) and I’ve liked this girl for a while , she’s nice , sweet , cute , and an overall amazing person , it’s been about 2 years since our friend group has formed and I’ve been super shy and loving her from a far , our whole friend group was also 17 , just for context.


So around 1 month ago , this guy named Jay moved into our neighborhood and class , he befriended my friend Matt and soon after Matt introduced Jay to the 
Friend group , now I was already very insecure , I’ve always viewed me being white as a huge disadvantage when it came to getting girls , so when Jay comes he is taller than me , he is charismatic , lightskin , and a gentleman as well , he immediately charmed everyone in the friend group , the worst part is he is only 16.


A few days later , my crush who I will call Diamond , asks to hang out with him , she’s never ever asked me to hang out before , she’s dodged me every time I bring some occasion up , but her she is asking this new kid to a date , now I take this as just her introducing him to the city or something , but that same day I saw her riding with him on a motorcycle , she was holding tight onto him and was smiling like I’ve never seen her smile , this crushed me , I couldn’t believe this guy really got her to ride with him.


After this came the final straw , we were all hanging out when suddenly Jay comes in a fucking black lambo , to pick up diamond , and I saw her actually kiss him on the lips.


Let me be honest  , he has been nothing but nice to me and he doesn’t know my feelings for her but , I hate him , I’ve been trying to get with diamond for years now , but he just comes along and gets her with minimal effort , sure I understand he’s cool , and charming but that hurt my ego badly.


A few weeks later we had a conversation that was getting heated , he wasn’t saying anything back but I was bashing him , I said that he had something to hide and that he was a bad influence, I never wanted someone to leave so badly like I did that day , it ended up with me pushing him , he didn’t fight back and told everyone else not to fight me for pushing him , he punked me , he embarrassed me majorly , I left in anger , it’s been 2 days since then , my friends are contacting me and Jay even apologized even though I was the aggressor and he wasn’t even saying anything back or fighting back , I haven’t texted everyone and I’m feeling very insecure.


TLDR : I’ve liked this girl for a long time but the new kid is dating her and he is in my friend group as well.


How do I get over her?? Me liking her isn’t gonna work anymore , she has a boyfriend and he is in my friend group , I just don’t know what to do or how to handle the situation, please help.",30Aug2020,1
421,"One of my good friends broke up with his girlfriend a couple weeks ago and had been having a really hard time. I have been trying to support him but he wont talk about how he is feeling and insists he is fine. The last week he has seemed to be getting better.

Last night he got really drunk and said to me and another friend that he has been thinking about killing himself and that he knows how he would. I was really scared when he said this but he tried to play it off as a joke when we got worried.

Today he wont speak to me at all and just keeps saying I made it up. What can I do to help him. I have told his parents that he is struggling a lot. Should I tell them that he has said he wants to kill himself, i don't want to scare them or be overdramatic if it was something he said without thinking.

Any advice would be really appreciated. I'm not sure who to speak to about this and I don't want to feel like I have to be there watching him all the time.",30Aug2020,1
422,"So my fiance and I had fights for few days now that escalated and well he basically told me that if I don't do something connected with money for our future he will dump me. Currently I am blocked from him on hangouts but yesterday he 3 times blocked and unblocked me it was crazy. I only talk with him on gmail now and yesterday he was veeery mean calling me slut/bitch. To illustrate i am coping message from him:

You sure know how to piss me off bitch but I I promise you, no more attention until you fucking do as instructed once.

If my reaction is paining you, change your ways damn it.

Thing is that I have no means to do what he wants. .. I genuinely love him still but his behaviour escalates. He called me bitch more than 4 times. Anyways something weird happened yesterday too. I messaged his nephew and at some point I told my bf of that and he told me he has zero idea who the motherf....er is even if he iis my boyfriend or no. I was shocked be talked like that.

423,"To premise this, I had a rough day. I was meant to have a birthday party, and I tried too, but as soon as it started my family member kneed my dog into a table. So, the party started out with my crying in my room with my dog and it only got kinda worse from there. 

My friend texted me later about how she was upset about some things (I had told her earlier about my day and she mentioned she was stressed, so we talked about it). Me and her like to do roleplays with characters but one particular coping rp that she wanted to do made me uncomfortable and she started getting upset. Saying things like ""I wanted to the scenario, but I can't. So whatever. Said and done."" And we moved on. I suggested meditation to help with stress since she suggested that to me earlier. At this point, she was knocking down everything and I got progressively more upset due to my stress from the day so I told her that I essentially may not be able to support her best tonight. And she said ""I'm not saying this to make you feel guilty, but I'm used to giving people support and not getting any back."" And I responded and told her that she knows I try my best despite everything and that that ""really hurts"". She has since apologized profusely but I just need advice on how to properly navigate this situation and talk to her about it without it seeming like I'm making her feel bad? I don't want to hurt her but this situation was painful and really set off a crying fit that lasted for like an hour.

426,"Hi really need someone to talk to. I come from a small family my father left my mother when my sister and I were young, later my mother met a guy and they had my younger brother. The problem is that he was very abusive towards my mother I still have emotional scars from that toxic relationship but my sister reacted badly towards it. She just became wild and rebellious, I think she was looking for love in all the wrong places. She eventually died of AIDS when she was just 19 years old. My mother left her abusive boyfriend and life got so much better. My younger brother has no idea what we went through because no one talks about it. My problem is that my brother is often time rude and disrespectful especially towards my mother. Maybe he is just a moody teenager but I can't take it. They way he speaks to my mother triggers me, when he shouts at her I often hear his father's voice. I know its wrong but sometimes I hate him. It sometimes gets to a point where we have physical fights and I don't want to do this anymore. I have tried to have a genuine conversation with him I just ask that he respects my mother and appreciate the things she does for him but I feel like all the efforts have been in vain.

430,"I was at work until about 2 hours ago from working overnight.  I got home to find out I had to take a detour to my house because there was *do not cross* tape across the road, two ambulances and 5 - 7 cop cars. 

My area is generally very tame so when this lady came down the block from that way as I was getting out of the car, she looked shaken and started explaining to my mom (who was outside as well as she was my ride home) that she saw the woman on the ground,  male on top of her, stabbing her.  The woman said ""Her guts were on the ground, like hanging out of her! I popped my head out of my door, asked what was going on and the guy turned to me and started running at me with his knife!""

My mom said that like an hour before, she heard someone screaming ""it's after me!""  As I think about it now, the lady was probably gelling ""*he's* after me!""  It chills me to the bone and mortifies me that this happened and how different it might have been if my mom had called the cops.  We have a lot of crazies in our area that are always screaming things, so she might have thought it was something like that but I personally could never take that chance and always have my phone nearby in case something is going on because our neighbors across the street are druggies and always yelling and fighting,, and they get physical..  I'm glad I didn't see the body myself but... I just don't know how I feel right now. I don't know if they caught the guy. It makes me wonder if it's even safe to step outside. I just... i didn't know the lady that got stabbed or the woman that saw her.  

I'm definitely not as mortified as the woman who saw the dead body, but it makes my stomach hurt to think about and it makes me super sad.

Secondly, she cooks unhealthy food and regularly buys takeout, she said you eat what you get given even when I've had health issues because of it.

439,"I (14F) have an older sister (16F).

Ever since she got her first phone at around primary four-five (10-11 years old), she started using it so much and neglected her studies.

So she somehow managed to score a mark which got her into her current secondary school.

There, she met a couple of friends. She started cursing and using her phone even MORE obsessively. She downloaded games and social media apps on her phone even though it was disallowed by our parents because they were concerned for our eyesight.

She introduced me to games and social media apps and I still feel guilty that I still keep these apps despite our parents' concern.

Thing is, our curfew at usually from 9-10pm and my sister texts me separately to ask me to go over to her room to watch a kdrama or cartoon or TV series she finds at a certain time.

I hate this so much because I feel like I don't have my freedom and she always makes me watch with her until about 12am or 2am in the morning.

Then, my school starts at 7:25am and I have to wake up at 6am to get ready and I'm always tired.

I've asked her why I can't watch on my own at my own time but she never gave a solid reason to it.

Also, that's not the only problem I have with her. Once, on a night she got me to go over, she couldn't find her earphones and asked me to help find it.

I didn't know where to start so I just sat on the floor and turned my head to maybe somehow spot it. Then she got mad and told me to stand up and help her find.

Then I got mad and told her that it wasn't my problem that she lost her stupid earphones (one of the rare times I actually blow up at her). She then scratched me (no injuries though) and called me a ""stupid fucking bitch.""

All because I refused to help her find her earphones ONCE.

Also, I get hurt easily so that insult really stung but I kept my mouth shut because I have this fear of her but I also hate her and love her.

She also still neglects her studies (lesser than before but still) and this year she's taking her O Levels (an important exam for all secondary four and five students in my country).

Is it bad that I sometimes wish that when she grows up, she doesn't get a good job and when she comes asking me for help, I'll refuse and shut the door in her face?

What disturbs me is why I even had that thought in the first place. She's MY sister. How could I even think of that as much as I'm annoyed by her??

Anyway... I would like to ask if that's something wrong to be thinking of.

I always get so envious when I see how some other sisters are always so close and don't really pressure each other into doing things. Like, take Charli D'amelio and Dixie D'amelio for example.

441,"This a very long and complicated story, I'll try to be as concise as possible. 
 
I 22F was abused by my grandfather from ages 11-13. I was visiting my grandparents during the summer one year (they live in a different country). My parents would usually send either me alone or my brother (25M) and I to visit them for a couple of months at a time. Since there wasn't much space in the house I had to sleep with my grandparents in their bed. That's when it first started. I didn't know how to react since I was only a child and in a foreign town without anywhere to go. Even though I knew the abuse wasn't okay, I didn't tell anyone because my parents were never emotionaly available for me and I was scared they wouldn't believe me. I also grew up in a family where talking about sexual abuse is a taboo. 

A couple of years later, my parents sent me and my grandfather alone to vacation by the sea side. We shared a room. That's where the abuse started to intensify. After a couple of nights I finally decided to call my mother (grandfathers daughter) and tell her about everything. My mother was furious over the phone and called my grandfather immediately to yell at him. I was afraid and alone and called her in hopes that she'll pick me up and take me home (it would take her 4h by car). She didn't. She called me back in a couple of minutes and told me that he will not be bothering me anyomore (spoiler alert: he continued). That night my grandfather asked me why I called my mother. When he saw how horrified I was, he told me not to be afraid of him and gave me 20 euros to basically keep my mouth shut.

After I finally returned home, my mother and I never spoke of the incident(s). She pretended that it never happened and I was positive she didn't tell my father. I felt betrayed, scared and alone but above all I was a child and didn't know how to respond to this situation. Her reaction indicated to me that I should keep my mouth shut and that what has happened is not a big deal.

During the next 10 years my mother insisted I keep visiting my grandparents alone. When I would visit alone I was constatly in fear of my grandfather. When I would visit with her, she would insist that I kiss and hug him everytime we greet (this has continued until I was 21 and finally put my foot down). I could not understand why she did this when she knew the horrible things he did to me. The only reasoning I could find in my head was that she didn't quite understand the abuse and its aftermath and impact. 

Then, when I was 16, during one of the fights between my mother and I, I blurted out something about how she betrayed me during the vacation situation and she broke down crying. She told me that she knew exactly how I was feeling because ""I wasn't the only person he abused"". I was bafffled. Clearly he had abused her (and probably my grandmother) during her childhood and she is still insisting on keeping this tight relationship with him? When I asked her why she wouldn't do anything about it she listed my grandmother and her brother (he has special needs) as reasons. She told me that my grandmother had a really tough life and my mom wouldn't want to cause her any more harm by confronting my grandfather.

That's more or less everything. The abuse and my mothers reaction have marked my childhood and had impacted me in more ways than I could ever imagine. As years go by I realize how fucked up I am because of it and I'm currently saving up money to seek help. My mother is actively trying to have a perfect mother-daughter relationship with me. We talk everyday even though we live 1000 kilometers apart. When we're together we fight multiple times a day. She is a very angry person with short temper. Until I met my now boyfriend I thought that yelling and screaming on members of your family was completely normal and everyday thing. I realize now that I will never be able to forgive her and I don't know if she deserves my forgivness. She never made an effort to address the situation and help when her child needed her. I realize that she probably recieved the same treatment from her mother and now she's just continuing the cycle of mistreatment.

My grandfather is old and sick and my mother still insists that I visit him and my grandmother and take care of them. I don't know if I can live this lie anyomore and I want to confront her about everything in front of my father because I think he deserves to know. I also want to completely cut ties with my grandfather. I would be perfectly okay with not seeing him ever again or even go to his funeral. I don't know what to do. Is it worth to open this old wound again? Is maintaining a good family Image more important than cutting ties with pedophill?",30Aug2020,1

443,"first of all, i’m sorry if this post is messy, i’m panicked and typing on mobile. i’ll try my best to make my recollection of it unbiased. 

last month one of my [18f] friends, leslie [18f], stopped chatting for a few weeks and finally came back but when she did, she would chat weird spiritual stuff about meditation and messages she sees in her dreams, angel numbers, signs, stuff like that. she was asserting that she knows the truth and the future. i was also weirded out but there were times she’d act normal and say that she was taking meds, so i assumed that she’s probably going to therapy and didn’t think much of it. 

while we were chatting today she suddenly started chatting weird stuff on the group chat again and i just didn’t pay too much attention to it. i left to take a bath and when i came back i saw that two of my friends, carl [18m] and igna [17f] left the group chat. i also saw that leslie’s best friend, lucy [17f] messaged me asking if we can talk. i found out that leslie had been going to therapy and taking meds and that she had gone through pretty terrible stuff that we didn’t know about. 

i talked to igna and carl on a separate group chat and they said they just couldnt handle the spiritual messages anymore. i told them that it was insensitive and selfish to just leave without talking to leslie and actually telling her what was going on. igna and carl told me that they also have their own problems and that leslie’s weird private and group messages were getting in their head and carl added that she should deal with it by herself. igna said that they just can’t be selfless anymore and its hard to be nice all the time. i told them that if this was a visible illness, they wouldn’t even think about doing what they did right now. carl replied saying that i can’t compare their problems to each other because each one takes it differently. (im so sorry this part is so messy) 

i don’t know what to do. i have a sister who was also diagnosed with depression and i know how bad mental illness eats inside of you and even ruins your relationships. igna and carl are normally good and understanding people so i don’t get why they cant understand it. i also don’t want to downplay their problems. i don’t know what to do.",30Aug2020,1
444,"This has been going on for a long time and I really don’t know what to do. Anytime I do anything, and I mean anything, I will get everyone else’s unwanted comments and input then usually have to explain myself. For reference I am 20, can’t afford to move out and am dealing with medical problems after leaving the military which makes finding work very difficult.

Some of the examples are going to sound like I’m making something out of nothing, being petty, or whatever (the things I get told a lot) but I’m going to give as many examples as I can think of to try to give the best picture of how I feel.

My mum is the worst for so i will be using her as the main example but shes not the only one and my older brother is the same just not quite as bad. 

If I decide to bake some cookies (I enjoy baking) my mum will come I to the kitchen and start asking what im baking and why. 

If I decide to wear shorts I will immediately get questions of “why are you wearing shorts?” or just comments like “you haven’t worn shorts in a while” or “wearing shorts are we?” And even or the simplest comment that doesn’t require a response, if I don’t acknowledge it she will get annoyed with me.

If I go out I have to explain where im going, what im doing, who im with, when I will be back etc, or she will refuse to move her car which she uses to block the garage I store my motorcycle in. 

A little background on this one. She does all of the laundry despite me asking to do my own since I only get my stuff back after a week or sometimes two, and I need my stuff washed sooner than that as I don’t have enough clothes to last me that long usually. She refuses to let me do so and will leave dirty washing in the washing machine and wet washing in the dryer so I can’t use them. Every now and then I will see an opening to quickly wash some stuff that I need more often like gym clothes and underwear or a couple shirts if im out. When I do, I will get told im wasting water (costs about 10p a wash) and then will get the usual questioning, what am I washing, why am I washing it, why couldn’t I wait a week to get it back etc.

If I get something in the post I have to explain what it is, despite being none of their business.

If I have to go in for tests or treatment at the hospital my mum needs to know everything. 

If I even have a phone call, as soon as I hang up I will be asked who I was talking to and then they will start bringing up points I was talking about because they were listening in.

If I dare to watch something on the tv in the living room, I will have to explain what I am watching and why. (I know, a lot of these “why” questions don’t make sense by try telling them that)

Sometimes I don’t even have to do anything, if I decide to be in the living room instead of my room and my mums in there, sooner or later she will start interrogating me about stuff she couldn’t before.

If I am talking to friends and they want to do something but I am busy its never enough to say im busy that day or I have plans. There will almost always be a back-and-forth of “im busy” “busy doing what” “I have plans that day” “what plans” and it goes on and on until I either tell them or make up something so they stop asking. 

This always seems to lead to my words being used against me, say for example I say im going or for dinner with x person that day but when I comes to it they or I cancel or something. If I don’t give an update to everyone (whether my plans effected them or not) I will usually get “called out” by my friends if they see or hear that I did something other than what I said. Or if its my mum and she knows im meant to be going out at some point she will keep coming into my room asking why I haven’t left yet, and if I say im not going out anymore of course I have to explain why etc.

This is made worse by the fact that my mum is a massive gossip and tells people I don’t even know, the ins and outs of my life and my business, even if she barely knows them herself and will use me, my personal medical information, my business and anything about me as small talk to complete strangers, sometimes even right in front of me.

I really don’t know what to do, I feel like I can’t have a single thought of my own anymore. And I am afraid to do anything that might make me stand out in the slightest. I try to just stick to staying in my room (which still gives me privacy as my door has to be open 24/7) and if I do go out I try to hide the fact that I am getting ready and they quickly leave before someone says anything or has a chance to ask questions. I feel like I have to be really secretive to get just the smallest amount of privacy. 

By this point I try to give out as little information as possible, especially to my mum because of what she is like. This has the down side of making me feel pretty secluded and alone since I can’t talk to anyone about anything. But I think thats better than the alternative.

Please just any advice on anything I can do or say either when I get questioned about anything or to stop people asking questions. I have tried talking to my mum but she doesn’t listen and sees no wrong in what she does so thats not an option.

Sorry if I have written this poorly, I have done my best to explain express it in a way that actually represents what its like since I don’t think “people ask too many questions” really gives it justice.",30Aug2020,1
445,"Hey! I’m new to reddit but I need some advice. I recently started dating this guy (we’ll call him B) and I’ve known him for 6 years, we’ve been together 3 days haha. His ex (we’ll call her M) had an issue when me and him used to hang out as friends (after they broke up I might add). I’ve known M 5 months in comparison. 
B and M were together 3 months and broke up in March. 

For context, about a month or so ago M messaged me and asked if I was getting with B and I promised her I wasn’t because that was the honest truth, she got really mad and called me disrespectful and broke the girl code, we sorted it out but a few weeks later she distanced herself from me. Me and M have hung out a few times but we aren’t close. Also, we live on an island with a population about 50,000 which a very small amount of are people our age. So people are bound to date and get with each others ex’s. 

B makes me really happy, we’ve been really good friends for years and my other closer friends say I should just go through with the relationship and not listen to M. However they also all think (including B) I should tell her we’re together. (M hates B and they don’t talk). I agree I should tell her I just don’t know how to tell her. Sorry for the really long context/explanation but can anyone tell me how I should tell M?",30Aug2020,1
446,"So my first semester at community college officially starts tomorrow and unfortunately, it will be completely online for the rest of 2020.

I'm pretty much stuck in a house with a mom who's an alcoholic (in denial) and a step dad constantly enables it. When my mom is drunk, she gets extremely loud and obnoxious. She'll randomly shout, try to start fights with me or my step dad for no reason and blast her stupid music on full volume. For example, it's almost 9am and she's already drunk (it's pathetic)

Another thing is that I have ADHD. I already struggle with concentrating in a quit/peaceful environment, when I'm in a loud environment, it's pretty much impossible. 

The public library in my area is still closed for studying. My friend told that it's ok if I come over to her house and study but her home life isn't much better than mine. 

I've thought about going to the park to study and am not unwilling to try it out but it might be too distracting. I've spoken with my mom but it's no good, she denies she has a problem and gets pissed off at me for even suggesting it. My step dad is an idiot and will blame everyone but himself, so talking to him is no good either. 

Is there anything else I can do? Thanks.",30Aug2020,1
447,"So I have, maybe stupidly, developed feelings for someone. Said someone is daughter of my mums good friend, but we dont see them all that often cuz they live far away.

I dont often get people showing me much compassion so maybe im reading all of it wrong, but when we stayed at theirs she hugged me as we left, and sane when they stayed a week later. I get vibes that feel like maybe they could be interest but idk.

448,"TLDR i’m an 18 yr old living with mom and verbally abusive dad in rented house. i want to move away from him with my mom near the college i’m soon to be attending but i don’t know how to plan that and i’m feeling a little hopeless. she’s not able to have a job that’d keep us in a decent place and i’ve never had a job before. i guess i’d like advice on what to make our game plan, either that or a way to get him to change for the better. 

i don’t want to report him. i also still care about him, and even feel somewhat guilty for deciding to leave like this. however, he’s tough to live with and i really don’t want me and especially my mom to go through the stress he puts us under anymore. i’ve told him to get therapy but he’s refused. i would like to get him help cause he’s not some horrible villain of a guy, but he is stupid and doesn’t know how to treat people decently. i could go on for hours about all the crap he’s pulled but he has shown he cares for us and would probably go crazy if we just up and left.

about the roommate situation- i doubt many would be willing to live with a freshman in college and her mom in the same apartment. i mean, i don’t really know but i feel pretty intimidated about asking about something like that on the college facebook. i guess people would be kinder about it if i gave the reason(though i wouldn’t go into so much detail), it’s just weird. this whole situation is weird. i’ve already deferred this semester (put my attendance on hold) due to classes being online, so now i have to choose between going, not going at all, deferring again, or community college. and my only skill is art, so i will have to freelance until someplace hires me. also, i’m not yet good enough to get a job in art, which is the only thing i can get significant income from. 

i am open to solutions other than moving out with my mom. if we could get my dad to realize how not okay it is for him to act the way he does, and if he would consequently work on stopping or stop completely that would be for the best. maybe a staged intervention by friends and family? not family from his side though. they have previously antagonized my mom and never criticize him for his blatantly poor behavior. maybe people from church and his friends? they all do know he isn’t great and my ma said his friends even cheered me on when she told them i was trying to “fix” him. ((i did try but people don’t change unless they want to and he doesn’t even think people can change. 

i can’t support myself alone as i’ve come out of high school just this year. i’m an unpopular artist and don’t have a lot of options. my mom has a job but it’s under his name (for reasons i would rather not say) not to mention it would only pay rent at a small place for a few months. there’s a chance two of my mom’s sisters would help her, or give us a place to stay. if we could stay with one of them, i would eventually have to move into a college apartment and leave my mom behind. im still her baby at heart though and should probably live apart from her or else i might not properly grow up as an adult. i would sacrifice that if she still had no options after staying with one of her sisters. 

i owe her my life. i’m a pretty bad daughter and i don’t do enough for her but if i figured this out i could at least pay her back a decent bit for all the love and care she’s shown me. my dad... he’s not a good guy. he cares but this family needs to split. none of us are good to each other except me and my mom. we all are at our worsts around him and if it means not seeing his sorry face for awhile he will have to accept that. 

i dont know how exactly it would work but it would be nice if we could just plan together with my dad to live apart instead of me and mom running away. again i feel bad for leaving him behind and want him to have options as well. 

i would explain the things he’s done but i’ve written them down for myself out of pain pretty often now and need a break. 

we should probably just leave him and never look back. probably. i might just not do anything about it.

sorry for any badly written parts or repetition, i’ve forgotten some grammar since elementary and am very stressed out from all this. also sorry for lack of capitalization, i have gotten used to texting like this. feel free to ask for specifics.",30Aug2020,1
449,"I work in a small company. One of my colleagues is going on maternity leave soon, but my boss doesn't want to hire a replacement and expects me and my other colleagues to do her job as well as our own, even though we are already understaffed. He just told us he expects us to work every day (including saturdays and sundays), but he's not going to pay for overtime work. His idea is that if you work an extra day, you can take a day off later. That would be fine if we could actually take days off, but we can't because if you take a day off there is no one to replace you, and now that one of us is leaving, the situation will be even worse. My boss knows we are understaffed but won't listen to us. He's the type of boss that always complains, even when things are going fine. Do you have any advice on how to deal with this situation?

450,"Very long story but it's getting to a boiling point where I'm worried for my friend's future. So I'm 23, a lesbian, and I grew up in a place where my parents beat me and kicked me out for being gay at 14 and I've faced a lot of struggles for it. When I first realized I was gay I spent all that time up until I was 20 self harming and being suicidal about it. I finally became okay with myself before I scrounged up enough money to go to community college.

That's where I met this girl (she is now 25) in 2017. I would see her in the halls all the time we were both in the art wing. She was really handsome and always wore a snapback, basketball shorts, lots of piercings. Would smile warmly at me and linger watching me when I went by. I was too shy to talk to her and didn't know if she even spoke English because I'd never seen her talk (she's Mizrahim so I assumed she spoke a Euro language if anything). There would be times she'd lean in the door of my class with her arms crossed and smile at me while I made art. We accidentally crossed paths one day while she was setting up the school's spring art show and we talked for over an hour and I missed my workshift but I didn't care because I finally got to talk to her. After that we'd talk to each other on the phone until we fell asleep about the silliest of things like the geese that attack you in the mall parking lot. She was a really sweet flirt and one day pulled up next to me in her car with her head out the window squinting at my feet pretending she was trying oh-so hard to not tiptoe her wheels over them then asked me if I'd come to the graphic design exhibit that night because she had to be there but ""it's the junior varsity of art"" and she would rather be looking at me. Flash forward to that summer, we go on a fun day together out of state, wind up kissing. But she had to fly out of the country to visit grandparents after that. And after she came back everything changed.

I mention all of the above as a baseline for the type of person she is. This girl's adopted, spent years of her life in a shoddy orphanage until she was adopted by deeply Catholic parents who wanted the perfect Catholic daughter. Having lived for a long time in the orphanage she always had abandonment issues and was very worried that anything she would ever do would rock the boat and she'd never have a family again. When she was in high school she fell in love with her female best friend and they had a relationship until her parents found out and laid into her so hard she went back in the closet and repressed everything until she met me years later.

So after our summer kiss, it was known we couldn't be together because of her fears inflicted by her parents. That's okay with me because I just loved talking to her and her worth to me was so much more than just having a relationship.

She had graduated community college and went on to state school that fall. We talked a lot, but things got different tipping into winter. She'd gotten in with the school's Catholic girls group and they immediately took issue with how she dressed, talked about her friend (me). And she was still struggling with her ""sins"" of being attracted to me that summer. She started trying to get me into Catholicism with her but I kindly declined many times. At first it wasn't at all about my homosexuality and she was okay with my statements that I would one day find a great wife and be a happy gay person. But she was still pushy about forcing her religion on me.

I saw her again and her new friends from the school's Catholic group had bullied her into stopping wearing shorts, hats, and piercings. She had to be more gender-conforming. She stopped having bright and random conversations with me like about the geese or making art jokes. All of her words always somehow came back to being plastic sounding remarks about God's love. She got more pushy with her religion. From fall to spring 2018 she got progressively covered in fresh cutting scars and had a suicide attempt over being gay.

In summer 2018 we kind of dropped off from talking to each other. I got way too stressed over the forced religious stuff and the suicide attempt made me suicidal because I couldn't help her. I always felt bad about it and wanted her in my life but she'd lost a lot of her personality and was swimming in self hatred. I picked back up with her in March 2019 and she was excited as ever to talk to me. But it was even worse and things since then have only ever been about Christ, Christ, Christ and how I need to stop being gay and convert to Catholicism, preachings of hellfire. There was no sign of her ever having a personality or happiness outside of religion in her words. She would go on about how she is gay and how she is born that way, and still is attracted to me, but it's not okay for her to ever act on that or she is evil. So she's not that type to deny she is gay. But still not okay.

Yesterday I was told she's moving into a monastery or something down South to commit her life to Christ as an appeasement to her parents for being gay and because she cannot make herself marry a man, nor is she allowed to have a job and support herself under the rules of her religion as a single woman. So we will never see each other again because she cannot have outside contact, and my last time to see her is this Tuesday.

I'm so upset watching one of my only friends fall into this self hatred and use religion as a tool of hiding behind a cookie cutter ideal set of roles so she doesn't rock the boat or lose her parents. I want her to be happy and that her religion should bring her happiness, but this is all so sad watching the life leave her while she tries not to ever encounter conflict again. I've tried talking to her about how this is a facade to keep her from abandonment, but she doesn't want to hear it.

What do I do to help my friend have better emotional health? I'm at a loss. I want to support her and I don't think she should have to leave her religion or get into same sex relationships just because she feels the attraction. But watching her sign her life away to something like this out of self hatred and abandonment is too much. Or do I spend Tuesday with her just trying to make one last good memory? I really don't know. It hurts a lot. There aren't many people in my life and I was grateful to meet someone who didn't treat me like a sex object and was calm, warm, and didn't engage in drugs and alcohol and hookup sex so I could relate. I don't want to lose her but I don't want to control her either.",30Aug2020,1

He knew that it had been 1 year since my grandfather passed. He just ignored my texts and left them on read.

I met someone online that changed my life for the better and our relationship transformed over with highs and lows over the past year. Now, we’ve parted ways and have not been speaking for weeks.

I have reached out a few times over the past two/three months we haven’t been speaking and it is clear they’re not interested.

458,"Dad comments on Instagram porn and I want to die

Throwaway account for obvious reasons. The other night I was scrolling Instagram and a suggested user popped up. I did some investigating and Long story short I figure out that my dad made a second Instagram account about showing off different beer he likes to drink The only reason I knew it was him was because of some pretty identifiable factors with the background of the beer can picture. The account followed mostly porn accounts and I started looking more and he commented wow you are so pretty on one of the accounts. It looked like one of those fake Instagram porn robot accounts with two pictures. 

I stopped looking because I was cringing so hard and really hurt and upset by this. 

My dad is 60 and I’ve known my dad looks at porn for years. I’ve stumbled across it in various formats over the years accidentally. I never touch his computer because I’m always afraid of stumbling on something because I think he just doesn’t understand the idea of incognito browsing or whatever. 

I ended up confronting him and telling him that I could see the account and everything he comments and everything that he posts and follows and explained how Instagram is not really private. And to look at porn in private. ( that was a truly embarrassing text message conversation) He didn’t admit at first but then he fessed up and said I didn’t know it was public I don’t understand the technology or something to that extent. 

Ever since this has happened I just feel awful. I have very bad anxiety so my brain just takes pieces of info and spirals out of control. The commenting on Instagram models is what really bothers me not the porn. Everybody looks at porn 

I think what if my dad is taking to people online what if he has a secret relationship. What if he is unfaithful to my mother.  They have been married for over 30 years and have their bickering moments but seem ok. They do lots of outdoor activities together go out to dinner with their friends complete projects around the house work in the garden. Everything seems fine on the outside. My dad will go to the bar after work and have two drinks and come home but he’s done this for years. 

My brain always thinks the worst and I know I definitely have my own issues that I need to address with anxiety. 

Is my dad just being an idiot on the internet or should I be worried about other things?",30Aug2020,1
459,"This has been going on for a while and I'm just really stumped with what the right thing to do is. 

I live in a neighbourhood filled with lots of townhouses. This means people have small backyards. Our neighbours own a pet dog. He's a bigger dog (looks like a golden retriever).

More often than not this dog is left outside overnight by himself regardless of the weather conditions. Right now as I type this post the dog is in the backyard while we are having heavy rain and gale force winds. 

We can see into about 70% of their backyard and it doesn't look like the dog has any shelter however there could be a kennel or dog bed somewhere else in the backyard that we just cannot see. The dog however always seems to sit outside their back door waiting for someone to let him in. Quite often he will start barking for attention and more often than not be told to 'shut up'. 

Now they're a larger family living in a smaller size house so it is possible that there is just not very much room and their attention is often elsewhere with their children.

I reported it to our local animal shelter around 3 weeks ago however nothing seems to have changed. 

What else can I really do? Does this even count as a form of neglect or am I just being a nosy neighbour and should mind my own business?",30Aug2020,1
460,"Hi! this is only like my second post so apologies for any mistakes. 

I am not sure if this is entirely possible or completely crazy, so reddit, please read and impart your wisdom.

Background: I've done a lot of sitting around during quarantine (haven't we all?) and even more sitting on the internet. I found this post that said the average American walks around 4Km a day. So 1460km a year, or 116800km over their (80yr) lifetime. This seems like a big number, but when i thought about it, 80 years to walk that distance is kind of scary slow. This cued off a small existential crisis about how far i had left to walk, some serious thoughts about how physically fit i was and wether or not i should invest in some very well marketed fitness technology, but then i asked myself; Could i walk that distance? Could i set out to double my daily distance and intentionally increase how far i will walk in my lifetime? Probably. But how would i make up for the years of sloth behind me?

So i played with the thought and came up with my idea; what about travelling 30,000km intentionally (under my own power, no trains or cars, etc) before i'm 30? Like not the steps to the store or the distance running to the bus, but actually taking the time out of my day to log a run, walk or cycle every day for the rest of my 20s.

This didn't seem like too longer distance if i started on my 24th birthday in a couple weeks. 6yrs would give me 2191 days to do that (i think, apologies about math errors), meaning i would have to intentionally travel 13.7km every day until i am 30. 13km cycle doesn't sound too bad i thought, and hey i could even do some of it swimming or canoeing! Then i thought about it in the long term. 6 years is a long time. Travel back 6yrs and i would be a completely different person, travel forward 6yrs and i will be too, hell i might not even be here in 6 years. It's a long time and anything can happen. I started thinking about all the days i could be ill, or too busy, or on holiday; the daily km to make up for this started to increase and i began wondering if it was even possible. We're designed to live an active life, but would i even be able to make it to the end, physically and mentally? This leads me to the font of all knowledge and advice, Reddit.

So reddit, do you think i have any chance of attempting this successfully? Or is it too long a commitment, too much to handle on top of work, too much \*insert any other worry here\*? Am i just plain crazy for even thinking of this?",30Aug2020,1

462,"&gt;Long story short- my life is falling apart and I need a friend, I wasted my savings for a house on a new car to live in because rentals won't accept me and my family

&gt;~bonus chapter~ bff stops talking to me find out why at the end... sorry 

&gt;&gt;I'm a 19 year old living in our van with my significant other and our 3 dogs.. we had a house with some roommates, 4 beautiful dogs 7 tarantulas and had just bought our (realistic) dream van along with owning a daily driver. Things seemed like they'd only go up but they've only gown down and smashed to go down further and fit more shit on top.

&gt;&gt;We got kicked out so we have temporarily rehoused our tarantulas (we still feed them and see em often) my mom was watching 2 of the 4 but had to get some house work done and so she's just been watching my one pup and I miss her so dang much she's only a hour away, but my daily driver car has been red flagged for a suspended driver and we are missing the back bumper (got it that way) so we get pulled over alot...making it harder to pay for a license. I just paid mine off, before getting kicked out around march, so I could go take the test but I havent been able to Physically get it because of covid and because our cars aren't in TIP TOP shape.. Well getting our van we thought I could use it for 1) the test, 2) we figured there's enough room to live in there for a while, and 3) there's KILLER AC and ROOM for the pups... WRONG a month after buying the van the fuel system is fucked up an done for along with cylinders misfiring. but to top it off another driver at a gas station and I barely tapped each other while my back sliding door open and the whole door came off.. but thats what we are sleeping in for now...and I can hardly fxckin sleep but im so damn tired

&gt;&gt;We keep getting denied for housing applications and rentals so we dipped into savings and bought a DIFFERENT DAMN CAR, suv really, with more room and stuff, but now its giving us trouble too( Radiator and Wiring?) It over heated on us today and we had to fix the back when we got it because it got hit and im just bawling daily at this point. Im now broke, have 2 POS cars an 1 Im chancing driving every day, literally no friends to talk to about it besides my boyfriend but he is right there with me.. i just want a fucking house, i want someone to talk to, i want to be able to help myself and I wish this was the most of it, everything is falling apart and I dont know what to do...

465,"So, I’ve (16M) recently gotten a job and am working my ass off to get a PS5. It’s the first real job I’ve had, and I’ve made money already. Point is, the PS5 preorder might come up before I have the money, and then I’ll never be able to get one if I miss that chance. My brother (19M) said I can borrow the money and pay him back cause he’s in college and doesn’t need it for the time being. I’ll definitely be able to pay him back if I work overtime.

Now here’s where the problems come in. First off, we bank at completely different places. Can he direct transfer money to me even if I bank somewhere else?

Second, I have what you callus call a ""baby savings account"". I have my money saved up but I only have an ATM card, so I can only have physical cash. Does that put a kink in my plans? I’ve never preordered something, so can I preorder at a local store?

Finally, I have no idea when the preorder will go live, thanks to Sony being so secretive. Even if he agrees to give me the money as a loan, I may not receive it in time to preorder. This is because the supplies are first come first serve and extremely limited. I just don’t know what to do in this situation. Thanks for any help!",30Aug2020,1

This is a fairly recent thing, although all thing considered I’ve never seen myself as even been close to pretty. Normally I just don’t give a shit because looks are fleeting, I won’t look how I look now in ten years so fuck it right? I have had acne since I was 14 and nothing I have tried has fixed it. And currently I am working on losing weight and toning up but these have never really caused me too many insecurities. 

Lately though every time I look in the mirror I just hate how I look, like I really hate it. For three days straight I’ve been planning on doing this sexy little get up and surprising my boyfriend but every time I try I just think I look too ugly to be do something like that. So I just end up changing into my pjs and going to bed or having a shower to try and ‘wash away’ the ugly. 

I feel so stupid for it because this is something I normally don’t give a shot about and I don’t know why all of a sudden I’m feeling like this. I haven’t nor will I be discussing this with my boyfriend because I feel like this is just so stupid to ‘fish for compliments’ from him just to feel better. 

So I’m sorry for it being so ranty but what I want to know is how do I deal with this? Should I look into more drastic measure for my acne and weight? Has anyone had these issues before and fixed them? 

I just really need advice before my partner figures out why my sex drive has been so low lately. Thank you for any help.",30Aug2020,1
468,"A little backstory. I’m 14 years old and in a family of 4 with my brother, mother and little sister. Our grandma lives just up the road, and she’s around 68 years old. Coincidentally, my grandma and mother needed Invisalign around the same time.

My mum is fine with them. She takes them out three times a day to eat, which is what you should be doing, and has been living fine.
My grandma, on the other hand, has started to eat much less. She skips breakfast and lunch because she says she ‘can’t be bothered to take them out’. We went to a zoo yesterday, and all she had to eat/drink was 2 sips of water. We were there from 9am until 4pm, while the rest of my family and me had a picnic consisting of lots of food.

I can’t tell if she’s become anorexic, and if she has, how do we stage an intervention?

TL;DR: My family think my 68 year old grandma has become anorexic due to Invisalign, and skips breakfast and lunch usually.",30Aug2020,1

472,"\[sorry this is long, can jump to the 2nd paragraph\] 8 months ago I had an awesome roommate (Jane), she was my age \[28/F\] and we had similar personalities and we got along well. A couple of months in, my landlord \[39/F\] decided to have her friend \[55/F\] move in and be a third roommate and boy what a disaster. long story short: she didn't like Jane so she managed to turn Jane and my landlord against each other and Jane ended up leaving. She did it in such a slimy and manipulative way that both my landlord and Jane are still friends with her because they are too stupid to realize how she played them. To be fair, shes overly nice and knows how to put up an act but for some reason, I see through all that fakeness. ( through all this drama I didn't say anything and just observed the whole thing from a distance). I was crushed to see Jane leave and her thinking the old lady was a friend and the landlord the enemy. Her behavior was baffling to me.

Now here comes the problem. I obviously never trusted her since that day, really didn't like her but I've stayed cordial. I have a pretty laidback personality, don't talk much so it's hard to know what's going through my head. This drove her nuts because wondered if I knew what she did and she desperately wanted to know what I thought of her. Now last weekend she sent me a text and said she had a friend coming over for dinner, I'm like that's fine. I get home, its three friends, alcohol everywhere its a whole party. I'm pissed but I let it go. I wake up in the morning and the friends slept over. so I'm annoyed but didn't have the energy to start a conversation but she could tell I was pissed. She never apologized or anything so I just avoided her that day. didn't see her for a week after that. she came back and of course, I'm over everything at this point so I say hi pleasantly and she mumbles something and wouldn't even look at me. so the next day I didn't bother talking to her I just did my own thing and ignored her too and boy the rage came! she has been EXTREMELY passive-aggressive. 

**slamming doors, speaking super loud on the phone ( put my AirPods on which drove her even crazier), took my laundry basket with my clothes from the laundry room and put it in the basement, crazy I know. she bought pillows in the living room: she removed the one on the particular couch I usually sit on.  she put her outdoor furniture upside down so I don't sit on it, vacuuming by my door. I texted her and asked if she had a problem and she told me to never text her phone again and blocked me!!,** BIZZARE behavior, this person is 55 years old. Now, I researched her behavior and she fits the narcissistic traits like a glove, it blew my mind, every-single-thing!! People at my job are telling me how dangerous and vindictive Narcissists can be, now I'm really scared. I don't know how to handle this kind of behavior. I could speak to my landlord but shes her friend and still under the spell, I'm afraid it may ruin our relationship. I have 3 more months before I can leave. I think she's also trying to get me to leave like she did Jane because she wants the whole house to herself...she is back in a week, I don't know how to handle this. please help",30Aug2020,1

Recently I've seemed to hit a really rough spot in life and It's getting increasingly hard to deal with. At least alone. There's always something going on like my mom going to the emergency room, troubles at work, constant friend drama when I've done nothing wrong, money problems. It's all stacking up and really starting to take a toll on my already bad mental health. I know it may be toxic of myself to not get help, but at the same time, I'd have to wait 3 months to see a psych. Which is way too long in my opinion.

478,"Okay this is extremely difficult for me, I don't even know if this is the appropriate subreddit...but so far the only people I've talked to about this are my mother, my best friend and my therapist. It's been a long enough amount of time that I really just need to speak to people who may have experienced this themselves or know people who've shared a similar experience, so here goes. I've been a relationship person my whole life and I don't generally date a lot or hook up a lot, but last year I met someone on a dating app and we actually just ended up becoming friends. We hung out in groups with our friends, went to bars together, attended parties, etc. Long story short, one night I was extremely drunk and he convinced me to crash at his place. I had enough trust in him at that point, and even though I said repeatedly ""I'm going to go home now"" he kept saying that he'd feel safer if I stayed there and took an uber home in the morning, etc etc. I fell asleep there, I woke up around 3:00 am and he was having sex with me, I ran out of there crying and waited outside in the cold for my uber to take me home (mind you, I live in Toronto and this was like mid-march). I went to my therapist the next day who immediately cabbed me to a hospital where my parents met me and took me home to stay with them for the night. BTW, never got my coat back, and I loved that coat. 

Fast-forward to now. It's been almost a year and a half. I just turned 26 and I haven't had sex since then and honestly have had absolutely zero desire to. But I really want a relationship still, and now I just have insane trust issues. I've been on a couple dates, but for the most part I'll get close to someone, plan a date, and then come up with a million excuses to cancel the day of. My excuses are anything from ""I'm really not feeling well"" or ""I unexpectedly got a call from my boss and have to complete xyz project by the morning"" or ""my best friend just got dumped and I need to be there for her."" I'm terrified of dating anyone because in the back of my mind I'm thinking they just want sex and they'll be done with me after that. 

So where do I go from here? What can I do to stop myself from bailing on dates with perfectly nice people and making these excuses?",30Aug2020,1

480,"soo firstly to some this might not be a big thing but believe me when i say that i feel like shit.

For some background, I grew up in your typical old-school Asian family which means that I've always been told that true men don't show their feelings, which ended up in me bottling up my feelings for YEARS people say crying helps you reduce stress and i haven't cried in months and that doesn't mean I'm happy with my life.

time went by and now i have become quicker to anger, frustrated more than half of the day

i seriously like to stay alone in a room and not talk to anyone but my family(particularly my dad)have made it their prime goal to change that they do everything they can to get me to come out and talk with people and that's one thing i really don't wanna do,yesterday they ended up locking my room some wouldn't be able to go in and be forced to stay outside cuz they locked other rooms too 

and i like art i wanna be a mangaka and one day i showed one of the drawings i was most proud of and told them of what i wanted to do cuz they just wont stop bugging me about telling them my plans 

they just said that this is'nt real art and i should draw something like portraits and realistic stuff(Ummm WHAT?)

  i regularly get angry or frustrated while I'm around them but I still   wouldn't say that my parents are bad cuz im pretty sure they have my best interest in mind  

k so now the advice part

a few days back i found out that i have the sucky hater personality 

like most of the time im pretty ok,not giving a crap, minding my own business but when it comes to the people i stan like as a fanboy, i can be shitty

not gonna go into much detail here but as it turned out that if i stan someone with all my heart i will start hating on people or the competitors of the people i stan 

i realized i that i can be straight-up TOXIC when im defending them, i.e if i end up on a discord server with their haters and they say some clear nonsense about them i go into full kill mode and say things i don't really mean which end up really toxic and most probably can be categorized under verbal abuse 

also you know what i do to calm myself down with out breaking something or hitting someone-i bang my freaking head on the wall along with punching the wall and the walls are made fully out of concrete i havent hurt mysef bad enough bad enough to get blood out but im pretty sure this is not the best way to handle anger

im trying to change my personality and become a person worth standing by, right now i don't know what to do 

am i in the wrong here? am i being stupid?

or maybe I'm overreacting or maybe overthinking things

i don't know what to do

i really don't wanna turn into a toxic fan or a hater right now, there's no one in my family that will understand this cuz I'm the only one who can speak English and the only one who keeps up with the internet soo i cant really ask my family for much mental help either cuz they dont belive mental problems exists and they'll just tell me to man up even though im not legally a man yet (15)  , i wanna change myself 

again i dont know if im being stupid

So in my leisure time, instead of playing golf, drinking, or watching TV, I like to play video games. Do I play them a little more than I should? Maybe. I’m making an effort to try and do things more “inclusive” with my family, though being a college student, it’s not like I have all the time in the world with them.

So, as the title states, my family bought me a t-shirt with that exact caption on my birthday. I think they thought of it as a joke, but they could tell I was less than thrilled to receive it. They’re not anti-gaming per se, but the fact that they thought getting me this t-shirt was a good idea doesn’t sit well with me.

My question is: what should I do with it? I’m never going to wear it, and although I don’t like that my family got it for me, it was still a gift. It feels wrong to just throw it, though I doubt they’d notice right away. I need some outside perspective on this.",30Aug2020,1

I’ve never really understood why people asked for trigger warnings for different things on the internet tbh.

Lately I’ve been feeling pretty down and getting high a lot. It’s not that I’m depressed, but more like experiencing a depressive episode? Reminds me a lot of when I was diagnosed with depression at least.

Anyway, I was just reading some fanfiction, first one in a while I’ve liked. Somewhere around halfway through self harm is mentioned and although it’s not directly happening in the book, the cuts, blood and covering it up with bracelets are mentioned quite a bit. It’s not even the main character or anything.

I reached that part a couple of days ago and ever since then I’ve wanted to do it myself? I’ve done it before like 5-7 years ago, just a little bit. I never felt addicted to it or anything. Now I keep thinking about it, places I could do it and how do cover it up afterwards.

Is that why people ask for trigger warnings? Because something like this will happen?

My aunt has a birthday today and I seem to be the only person that did not go with her out to IKEA and then for a pizza. I did not even buy her a flower much less a present.

I did not go out, because when I had to take a shower today, I ended up not having a single clean underwear. My mom just seems to have a lot of bad feelings for me and barely wants to talk to me, not to mention that she deliberately does not want to place my clothing in the washing machine.

I live with my aunt and mother at the age of 21. From time to time my mom's boyfriend will come to our place and on Saturdays she will go to his place to have sex with him. I have multiple times caught them to have sex in the same bed that my aunt sleeps on.

I don't even know what to do anymore...
I have been to some sessions with therapists and psychiatrists, but no improvement was made...
I have made quite a lot of posts on Reddit about my life in general on SuicideWatch, Depression and Advice, but nothing helpful was ever said to me other than basic ""NPC"" responses.

I have been a recluse for over 2 years now, living on the charity of my mother and aunt. We are foreigners living abroad in London, where they have to work to pay for rent. But unfortunately all I am is a pacifist who is too anxious to build up the will and courage to go back to education and get a job. I don't even know how to be liked by others, much less to know how to not hurt other people with my apathy.

At this point if I am thrown out on the streets, I will just not care at all and most likely commit suicide, because fuck it... I hate everything and everyone, including myself

I couldn't find one so I simultaneously started applying for a job in her country (over the last two months).

I like to think I’m above average when it comes to socializing. I have several groups of people I hang out with, I’m always invited to go out places when there isn’t a global pandemic going on, most of the people I hang out with consider me a really funny guy, so I don’t think my personality is an issue.

I’ve been on tinder, bumble, and okcupid since last October and I have never gotten a date out of them and I’ve only gotten like 10 matches total between them.

I’ve had successful friends look over my profiles, take pictures of me, I’ve remade my bio several times, nothing has helped. I even paid for tinder gold for like 7 months.

This was the first time I have ever felt hopeless enough to call a suicide hotline 5 times in two days (I am okay right now), and it really set me back that at a last-resort moment when I called my parents they asked me why I would call them if I wouldn't take their advice and was going to be upset with them. For context, my mother was trying to tell me that I had a problem being patient about seeing a doctor and I was trying to explain that it isn't easy to be patient when you have anxiety. My mother asked why I would even call her if I wasn't going to listen, and I explained that it wasn't because I wanted to, but because I had nobody to call and this was my last attempt at getting help since I had already called the suicide hotline a handful of times.

I am feeling guilty right now but I'm not sure if it's because I have been conditioned through years of manipulation to feel bad for putting my foot down or if I actually did a bad thing. Currently very confused. Any advice would be highly appreciated.",30Aug2020,1
498,"So on the 5th of this month, I got my first tattoo. It's a pretty big piece, from the crook of my elbow to my wrist. It's a night sky &amp; ocean with palm trees and a moon. I have a touch-up appointment on Wednesday, and I was telling a couple family members what I wanted to mention in the touch-up (some patchy areas &amp; maybe adding highlights), and they were saying that a tattoo isn't supposed to look like that after a month. I started getting scared and asked ""when I see the artist on Wednesday, is she gonna freak out?"" and they said yeah probably. Now, I had a weeklong vacation to the beach basically right after I got the tattoo but I wore long sleeves as much as possible (the sun was uncomfortable on the tattoo anyway) and didn't swim, and I kept saniderm on for a week and a half and thought I did a really diligent job with moisturizing (cause it was uncomfortable if I didn't). My parents and all my coworkers love the tattoo, no one has said anything bad about it until now. My family in general (I think it's a cultural thing) has a reputation for never having anything good to say, but I don't want the artist to be mad at me. Either way, she got her money so it is what it is now. I guess I'm asking, how do other people deal with it when people say their tattoo looks bad?",30Aug2020,1

501,"I used to work for a small company along with my friend. We live in a poor country and the company is remote so we were thrilled to get $1000 salary since it was a bit higher than what we could get locally. After some years the company started to do very badly, and so everyone got a 10% pay cut. That is not so bad I guess, but I managed to quit and find a different career path during this time. However my friend stayed. This was 4 years ago.

Last year, my friend told me they are now only being paid $280 per month. For fulltime work 40 hours a week. That is $1.75 per hr. Even in our country, that's a low entry level rate, and my friend has nearly a decade of experience.

She complains a lot about this but does not do anything about it.

I've been trying to help her by job hunting for her and encouraging her to set up her website and resume. But she keeps putting it off and making excuses. She wants to grovel at her toxic boss's feet instead. I think she believes that she is not good enough to demand better pay or find better work, as if this is the best she can ever find. I think this is something that is common in people from less developed countries.

Everyone left in the company is being told that this paycut is a sacrifice everybody is making so that they can bring the company back up. To me, seems like the owner did some very bad business decisions, and is making the employees pay for it.

However, i am worried maybe I am speaking from a place of priviledge, since I am lucky to have stable income and not everyone has that opportunity. Maybe during this time of pandemic, $280 is better than $0. But then, I just can't help but feel sad for my friend, and i feel like the company chose to exploit the desperation of third world people during the pandemic. (Btw all this started before the pandemic, and our industry is not affected much by the pandemic.)

I want to be able to help my friend realize that her time is worth more than $280. She is talented and experienced, and deserves to be compensated and treated better. I have tried many things from offering job leads to heart-to-heart talks about self worth. Nothing seems to help. Sometimes I want to give up listening to her complain about it.

(I left out the nature of our work intentionally, but it's a professional computer-related job.)

Tldr: My friend has no confidence in the quality of her work, so she is stuck in a dead end job making $280/month fulltime. I would like to be able to lift her up so that she knows her value and is confident enough to demand more. But I don't know if I'm speaking out of place since I'm priviledged with a stable good income job and jobs are hard to come by these days.",30Aug2020,1

I don't know where to start, but i'll give it a try.
first of all sorry for my english. I'll try to explain how i feel.

During the quarantine i started to feel more anxious, sad, incapable, more insecure than i already am and i can't concentrate myself. In fact, it's difficult for me to study.
Everything i do i feel like it's not enough, so i just want to lay in my bed and do nothing or just sleeping, cause i don't want to see my friends' or parents' disappointed faces.

During this period i had problems with university online exams, i had little family issues and i argued with my best friend. I'm just fed up, I can't stand it anymore. I'm fed up of listening ""that's not good. You always do it bad, look at the others. They're better than you"", i'm fed up feeling like this. 

I feel like i've changed for bad and i can't be like before. I've tried to talk about it with friends and boyfriend but most of them just said ""everything is gonna be good, don't worry"", but that doesn't make me feel better. 
One of my friend thinks that i could be depressed maybe, so he suggested to do everyday something new or i like, to keep me busy with my mind.

What should i do?",30Aug2020,1
505,"Hey, all, I need some serious advice because I don't know where else to turn honestly. I live in the state of Washington if that helps. Anyways, long story short, my mother is in a really bad way (essentially homeless, and very soon to be) and I'm incapable of taking her in due to being on the other side of the state. My mother had all of her identification stolen - Social Security, Birth Certificate, Driver's License... literally everything - and due to financial fallout no longer has a bank, vehicle insurance, a vehicle, etc. The only form of ID she has is a state medical card and, now because I ordered it, a marriage certificate with hopefully her birth certificate coming in a week or two. My question is this:

What resources are available to help my mother at least get her Driver's License back without her knowing her Driver's License Number? She'll only have her medical card, a marriage certificate, and maybe a birth certificate (maybe) and have no photo identification. During COVID the DMV's are by appointment only and the roadblock I'm running into is she needs her ID number, which is not possible.

What resources are available to keep her from going homeless? She says she's checked all the homeless areas with the phone I bought her, but the issue she's having is that she has a dog which, at this point, is the only thing keeping her going. She admitted to me that she tried to kill herself the last time I saw her.

506,"Hello.

In a week I'll be 1st grade of high school and I'm in desperate need of few advice.

1.  A very usual problem 

Simply put, how do I make friends with people that I don't know yet?
How do I approach ""befriending"" a classmate?
How to make a fist move?
etc.

Some of my good friends from 1st- 8th grade will go to the same school as I will, but they will not go to the  class as me.
So, pretty much, I won't know anyone the first day.


2. Something that I had never needed, and hopefully will never need to know.

How to avoid being bullied?

For an 14 year old, I am quite short, somwhere about 165 cm (5'6) and not very ""strong"" (although I am working on it) and I would like to avoid being bullied.
Thankfully, I never experienced bullying and don't even know anyone who has, but it's good  to know how to deal with it.
But, if that unfortunately does happen, how to deal with it?
Do I ignore? (I'm not really that type of guy)
Do I fight back? (Not a big fan of that either)

3. 

My new school is 20ish kilometers form my home (12 miles) and I will most likey have to take a bus to school and probably back.
What is, shortly, a bus etiquette?
If we exclude all school field trips, the last time I took a bus ride was some 10 years ago when I was a kid.

NOTE: I'm not sure if that's even a thing arond the world, but I have seen it on movies, so just you know:
The bus I'll take won't be a school bus, it will be a bus for everyone, and everyone can take it, form children to the elderly.

4.  Studying

My school is notorious for its good, but demanding teachers. It's also know for being a 2nd best high school in Croatia some 4 years ago (that time has passed, tho).
I was always a great student, but I never liked studying things that didn't interest me.
I picked a course that minimalizes the ""boring subjects"", but there still are some.

How to make myself study?
How to know when I actually am very well prepared for the exam?
...and some similar stuff.

5. Unrelated to the first 3

I have a ""hobby"" which  has become an extremely important part of my life, chess.
I'm not playing chess on the level of ""knowing how the pieces move"", but rather in a level of a very strong competetive player.
I go to a chess club, play in most tournaments that I can go to...

How to save some times for chess (at home)?

How to get a permission from the school to go to chess lessons with my coach and to travel to tournaments that last few days (usually 5-7 days)




If you read all of this, and have an advice for at least some of my problems, thank You very much :)


Thanks in advance!",30Aug2020,1

510,"Hello I have been browsing the reddit community for months now without an actual account.  Lately I have been reading some specific posts on an issue i’m dealing with.  I decided to make an account to get more opinions.  I have done a lot of research on here so I already know I may or may not receive backlash for this.  Try to hear me out though.  I’m 19  (F) and have been in a relationship with my girlfriend for over a year now. I recently just found out that my girlfriend has been masturbating for our whole relationship. Now we have a REALLY good sex life. I mean like every day to every other day at the least.  I am in no way trying to control her and I understand that it’s her body and she can do as she pleases.  However, I still cannot get over that she does and I don’t know exactly why. The idea of her being turned on is so hot to me and if she touches herself while we do stuff that’s also so hot, but it’s so upsetting that she masturbates to the point I can’t stand being at her house due to knowing what she’s done in her bed or like at her grandmas house.  I also cannot listen to any of the songs on our sex playlist because during her masturbation confession she told me she has to listen to music to do so. Well in my mind all i can rhink is “wow  so every time she showed me a song she wanted added she masturbated” so now I cannot enjoy those songs anymore and feel sick. I also couldn’t look at her without wanting to burst into tears for 4 days after she told me because i was, for some unknown reason, so upset. I can’t really explain why I’m feeling the way I’m feeling. I do know 2 reasons as to why i’m upset though.  1. Why doesn’t she just tell me so we can do stuff? I have a very high sex drive and just her telling me she’s in the mood is enough to get me going.  2. She lied about it so long to the point she was making jokes about it. Like she would make jokes about how she could never get herself off because her vagina sees her hand and instantly shrivels up.  

Has anyone else ever had this problem? and if so how’d you overcome it? It’s not that i’m trying to control her.  I don’t know exactly why it makes me feel so gross and icky and upset on the inside.

515,"Let me start off by explaining that I don't personally think I'm a sociopath, but then again, that's probably the mindset of other sociopaths.

A friend told me she thinks I'm sociopathic. She wasn't being horrible about it, but it's made me look a bit closer at myself, and how I act, but I don't really see it.

I admit I'm not an overly emphatic person, I --as my friend said-- care in a broader sense (I'm pro women's rights, pro choice,  supporter of LGBT rights and BLM) but not much about individuals. I know for a fact that seeing a hurt animal will have me feeling more empathy and anger than for a hurt person.

I will admit that I'm very much a 'my way or the highway' type of person. I'm comfortable splitting off from groups to do my own thing if what they want to do is something I'm uninterested in. I typically don't care if people are offended by this. I guess my reasoning is that if a friend told me 'hey, I don't want to do this thing with you guys so I'm gonna go do something else for a while.' My own reaction would be 'Cool, see you after.'

I am endlessly frustrated and short with hysterical people, even if their reason for being hysterical is valid. Looking at a person sobbing and keening will typically send me in the other direction because I have no patience for it. For this reason I have chosen to never have children as I don't think I'd be a good parent (and have no desire to be one).

I will also admit that while I am not a violent person, I believe that violence is okay in more than a defence situation. I was sexually abused as a child and thinking about my abuser being hurt in the most horrific of ways does nothing but make me smile and bring me joy (this was the fact that caused my friend to say she thinks I might be sociopathic).

I'm trying to think of other examples about myself that might lean that way, but I think that's it.

I've tried to look definitions up online, and while I may have some points in common with a sociopath, the vast majority of them don't fit at all.


TL;DR: I don't have a whole lot of empathy and thinking of my abuser being hurt brings me unending joy. Friend thinks I'm sociopathic.",30Aug2020,1

519,"TL;DR at bottom.

I'm a 23F college student who has been working with Company A for a little over a year. This past spring and summer semester, I didn't work with Company A at all due to school, but I'm still in their system. Now that Fall semester is starting, my school is completely online and I wanted to work full time to start saving money to move out.

I contacted Company A asking if they had any full time work, and my boss said she didn't. So, I applied with another company, B. I actually applied for a part time position with Company B, but during the interview she said she liked me so much that she wanted me there full time and would pay me my asking price. Sweet. I told her I could start next week, and she said to call her next week and we'd get it set up a day for me to come in and do paperwork.

Here's where it gets tricky.

Company A boss calls me and says she found me some full time work. It's essentially the same exact job as Company B. Same duties, same pay, same amount of hours. My gut feeling was, ""it's going to look better if I stay with Company A"" so I told her sure, and made mental note to call Company B to tell them I'd have to decline their offer. It felt easy in the moment, but the more time that passed, I'm becoming unsure. Here are the differences:

&amp;#x200B;

Company A:

* Company A is ""ran"" by a miserable woman. She wasn't usually ever around, which is cool - but when she was, she created a very tense environment. Example: I had to print and sign my name on something for her once, and she goes on to lecture me about how horrible looking my signature is, and says that she would have never hired me had she known my signature was that awful.
* Because Company A boss was usually not around, she wasn't ever aware how understaffed we were. When I would bring up these concerns, she'd tell me I was wrong and we weren't understaffed...then she'd turn around and ask me to fill in for \[position\] I had no experience or knowledge of.
* Boss is always telling me how good my resume is going to look because of the time she has kept me on even when I wasn't working for a semester to do school, and because of the skills I've learned from positions I'd filled in for. I do appreciate her always working with my school schedule and I guess I feel like I owe her in a sense.

&amp;#x200B;

Company B:

* Boss and staff seemed happy - they were all cutting up and getting along when I was being interviewed. So that was cool.
* Though it's the same amount of hours, the hours are shifted a couple hours later in the day. Pro: I won't have to wake up as early. Con: I'll be coming home later. This could put a damper on getting my school work done + other hobbies (going to gym)
* I had brought up during my interview all the different things I did with Company A, and the boss assured me I would have one role and not have to wear many hats.
* **Their philosophy and values within this field match mine much better than Company A's.**

&amp;#x200B;

Also possibly worth considering? A handful of coworkers I had at Company A had came from Company B...half of them quit Company A within in a couple weeks, the other half went back to Company B.

&amp;#x200B;

So, to sum it up:

TL;DR: I have two job offers. Same pay, same amount of hours. One offer is from a company that I have worked on and off with during my college career, I feel like I owe the boss for being so accommodating with my school schedule, and I think it'd look better on a resume to say that I stuck with her. However, she riddles me with anxiety and makes me do a lot of things outside of my job description because she's always understaffed. The other company seems great, only con I can see is that I'd be getting home later in the day, and I worry it could interfere with my school work.

H tried to be in D's life and D even stayed with H a lot when Ex would get high on meth (even when D was a newborn/infant Ex would get high in front of her.) So about 2-3 years ago, D contacted H's mom for something that went down. H's mom didn't tell us until later. I work overnight so we didn't see the message until like 2 AM. H didn't want Ex to have his number, so we messaged D on my phone. She got mad that H didn't respond fast enough, even though in the initial message we informed her we messaged as soon as we saw the message from his mom. We messaged instead of calling in case she was asleep.
D: If he loved me, he wouldve called immideatley. Texted me, something. But no. Instead he has you text me at 2 in the morning. How do you think that makes me feel? To not have spoken to my father for 4 years, and then when he gets the chance, he doesn't even jump on it. (he doesn't know where they live, they have both blocked his number &amp; on FB)
D then talks shit to H (using my phone) &amp; won't even tell him what she wants him to do (cops were supposed to be involved with what happened so even if H wanted to do something, he might go to jail if he did something.)
She has since blocked my number as well.
Fast forward to 8 months ago. H &amp; I had a baby (B). B is D's half sister. I grew up with 2 sisters, H was pretty much an only child. To me, it's important that D should at least know she has a little sister &amp; I want B to know that she has a big sister. I want to give D the opportunity to get to know her little sister, but H doesn't think it's a big deal. Any advice on what I should do?",30Aug2020,1

The worst thing though is my study habits and mentality towards school is suffering heavily because of my mental state - laziness, basically endless procrastination, not depression but I feel like I’m living in a dream. It’s gotten to the point where I haven’t done any work for school for a few weeks now, and it’s catching up with me. My grades have fallen, I’m getting digitally scolded by my teachers every class and even subjects that I would usually do well in are becoming hard for me.

526,"While I'm not for spreading hate, pain, and negative energy, I believe that everyone is entitled to liking and not liking certain kinds of people, and that's because we don't have the power to strictly change anyone other than ourselves. In other words, if a person happens to be a certain way, and we don't agree with their lifestyle, beliefs, etc., we should just agree to disagree and respectfully move on. My younger cousin happens to be the kind of person whose lifestyle and personality I don't really align with.

Long story short, he has very low self confidence but a huge ego. This often leads to him acting like the crowd, rather than developing his own individuality, yet, despite this, if someone does something that goes against him as a person, he gets irked. For example, if I were to tell him that he's bad at something, it hurts his ego and takes it really personally. I guess what I'm trying to say is that he's not very good at taking criticism. This is just one of many issues he has.

But he's my younger cousin - my family - so I've tried my very best to help him out because I cared. I've been there for him, I've pointed out and helped him with his flaws, and I've always been his ally in his toughest times. As a person who's lived longer than him, it's easy for me to see if he's going to do something stupid, and if I had the opportunity to nip those stupid decisions in the bud and help him stay safe &amp; grow properly as a good person, it brought me a sense relief. I wanted to be like a father figure to him, so I've been doing this for him for nearly a decade, and I have to say, I'm so tired. I'm just fed up with his attitude towards life and the fact that everything I do is nearly for naught.

Again, the criticism issue he has that I mentioned earlier is just one dimension to his multi-dimensional issues. I'm not going to go into too much detail because this post is already long as it is, but I will say that two of his biggest issues is that, one, he always compliments others, whether he believes that they deserve the compliments or not, because it helps him to manipulate them into liking him (or he at least seems to believe that it's that easy to get everyone on his side), and two, he always creates excuses for any bad deeds he's done, so he's basically not open to improving himself as a person.

He's done some really terrible things in the past, like stealing money from his mother or stealing her cigarettes. He doesn't help her around the house and leaves all of the dirty work to her, even though she's old and gets physically tired really easily. He takes her immense love for him for granted, and when I see him acting like the doofus he is, I just can't help but feel so much pain in my heart for his mother. To see an old, emaciated woman who just loves her son to death / only wants the best for him to be treated like garbage by a grown adult just screams immaturity, blindness, and self entitlement, which is so disgusting and toxic to see. As painful as it is for me to admit, whenever I see his face, I just can't help but get angry. Hell, if I were to just *imagine* his face, I feel a torrent of anger well up. I might even hate him.

I've done so much to try and help him to become a better person, but I just don't want to trouble myself with him anymore. He's kind, but he's also a huge fucking asshole riddled with issues he's not willing to fix. He's only been getting worse over the years, and I can imagine him becoming a monster later down the line. But I don't want to deal with this shit anymore. I want to just let go and stop feeling like I'm responsible for him becoming who he is, because I'm not. Is it alright for me to just... let go? Is it alright for me to finally just get some rest from his man-child? Or should I continue to try to help him, despite how futile it may seem?",30Aug2020,1
527,"Hey guys,

I am a 37 year old female who is happily married. But we don't have children of our own. We are good friends with my husband's college roommate, who got married young and has a 14 year old boy, and a 12 year old daughter. I've always known the friend to be strict (waking up kids early, and forcing them to run with him, and doing chores a lot). I personally would be a bit more gentle, but who am I to meddle in the methods of how one raises their children if they aren't hitting them. I personally love having the kids over since I don't have any of my own. Allows me to have all the fun without any of the liabilities. Last week, I had the kids over without their parents for the first time, and we had a lot of fun. The 14 year old was really goofy but sweet, and loved to bake. He reminded me a lot of my younger brother, and how we had fun growing up. So when we were cooking, a bowl accidentally slipped off the counter, and the kid got frantic and tried to clean it up as if I would kill him if I found out. I asked him what is going on, and he said nothing. I didn't say anything more, and calmly cleaned it up. Later thst night, my husband and I went into his room privately, and asked if everything was okay at home because we honestly didn't know if a kid being that scared of an adult was okay. The kid said that if he did something like thst at home, his dad would smack him, and showed a few scars. My husband said the kid told him this in private, so until necessary, we will keep this private, but we will also make sure he can spend some more time with us to give the kid some relaxation. I would never treat a child like that, and it seriously offends me that one found it necessary to beat a kid to the point of leaving scars to instill discipline. So we called the friend, and told him thst we love having the kids around, and that since they got a few more weeks of holidays, we would love to have them over for another week. During this week, I want to see how I can help the kids. How should I go about this?",30Aug2020,1

However, I am not comfortable around her boyfriend. I know he’s a good guy, but men make me anxious (don’t go off on me about this, it’s something I’m working on). He spends every. single. weekend. here. Like, he will be here from Friday morning-Sunday evening. He doesn’t refill our Britta after filling up his GIANT water bottle, he leaves the toilet seat up, and they leave all of their dishes in the sink the entire weekend until eventually I can’t take the sight of that many dishes in the sink at once and end up doing them all myself.

I don’t know how to ask her to maybe spend more time at his place? I get that our place is a lot quieter bc he has like 4 roommates, but I don’t feel comfortable in my own home when he’s here. They always take over the living room and I end up spending the entire weekend hiding in my room which sucks.

531,"Some background before going into the story. My (24F) brother (18) is a person who is always hanging out and is never home. Our parents have given us all the privileges in life. He has been given a lot of freedom. Always stays over at his friends house, paid for college, everyday expense, musical instruments etc. He’s always aggressive and we are actually scared to scold him because we fear it may turn violent. I understand this because even I’ve been a teen. And in Indian households we kids tend to get angered a lot by parents (especially during teens). 

Now for the problem. We have renovations going on and I have another brother (27) who is seeing to this work. My uncle (41) has also been supervising this work and sacrificing his time too. He travels everyday for like 30-45 minutes to our house. He would ask where my teen brother will be. We would say he is out. My uncle would get angry that he’s hanging out the entire day or many days instead of being a support during this messed up time. Now it’s not that we don’t let him free. He is free af but sometimes it’s helpful to have another member here. My uncle called him and asked why he was out (this is after many days of asking him to stay). It got louder and my brother back answered. My uncle was hurt and now he’s decided not to talk to him anymore nor come to our house. But the argument continued and I intervened and told my uncle to give the phone to me. I didn’t talk much. I just wanted to stop the argument. Later after my uncle left, i called and spoke to him calmly and broke down. 

Now I would like advice on how to talk to him so that I respect his teen feelings and also my uncle. My uncle isn’t in the wrong but we agree that he was harsh. My brother should know that when he’s taken care of and still dependent on his family, he can atleast stay and be of support for some. We never ask him about who he hangs out with or what he does. We have let him free.

Can I get some advise from Indian folks on how to talk and what to say to him so that he realizes what we are trying to say? I ask Indians specifically because I feel only they would understand the family dynamics.",30Aug2020,1

536,"My anxiety has been getting gradually worse as I've started my job hunt after being out of work for a few months. I experienced workplace bullying at my last job and because of it had to take some sick leave after starting to experience some serious symptoms like daily panic attacks and suicidal thoughts. My boss, who was the one bullying me alongside his wife (it's a small company), decided to take advantage of the situation and fired me via e-mail while I was on sick leave. I was still on my trial period during that time so even though what he did was shitty it was still legal. I had a hard time applying for benefits because of Covid so I spent most of my summer worried about my finances and crippled by the anxiety the workplace bullying made me have. Now I'm scared to apply to new jobs in the fear of getting myself in a situation like the one I had at my previous workplace. I've started to feel like wherever I go I'll get bullied or harassed or left outside of the group because it has been happening in my two last jobs and between those jobs when I was in school getting my degree in business. I've been thinking about maybe getting a job where I can have a very limited contact with other people to make sure I won't have to experience these horrible things anymore. The problem is I have little work experience and my studies focused mostly on customer service and sales so to get a job I'm pretty much relying on my degree but even thinking about working in customer service at the moment is making my anxiety worse. I should probably also mention that I have a history with depression and panic attacks that I've been trying to overcome for years. I have medication for the panic attacks but that's all I can afford right now financially so therapy is out of the question.

537,"I \[22/F\] recently graduated college and have been home for 6.5 months. I am starting a well-paying but somewhat intense (long hours) job that is WFH at least until January 2021, potentially until August 2021. However, since March when I moved home I have been 100% quarantined (we even order groceries).

This is unlikely to change since there is no one I know living nearby, we live in a rural-ish area and I cannot drive and don't have a car, and there is nowhere much to go if I did. This has been pretty rough for me, especially as my parents are a bit controlling and often insist on me not taking calls where they can't hear, etc.

An acquaintance (don't know very well but we went to school together and have mutual friends) is looking to move to the city in October, and I could potentially move into a 2BR with them aiming for \~1,500/month. The goal would be to lock in a very good deal for an annual lease given the market is good right now. They are also WFH.

I'd be spending a lot of money (I live in a large home with land attached for free rn) and the city is (1) potentially dangerous / crime rates have been up (2) likely to be pretty closed. I'd hate to end up paying a ton for an apartment that turns out to be vermin-infested/gross and also have the city completely shut down again in the case of a second wave or realize that actually there's nothing to do there anyway, or even just be so busy with work I don't leave the apartment.

However, I have maybe 5-10 friends in the city, and would feel a bit more free about maybe traveling short distances to see other friends (in a socially responsible way) if I didn't live with my older (at risk) parents. Plus, I would feel more free to take calls/chat comfortably even virtually. Also, I would only really feel comfortable living with someone I knew ahead of time so if I move later I'm more likely to go for a studio instead.

For what it's worth, I'm a 32 year old guy, and I've never really been able to date or connect with women romantically, so I'm not surprised I've become infatuated with someone I have a good bond with.

550," recently rejoined the work force after having been out of work for several months due to the pandemic.

I was hired at a security company, after a brief “orientation” (it was meant to run several hours but the company owner and instructor cut it short to an hour and a half so his employees could sleep) I was immediately scheduled to work 12hrs a night—beginning that night—seven consecutive days.

I received a uniform but never boots, my utility belt, nightstick and mace. After finally getting off for two days I reached out to my manager to see my upcoming schedule.

My manager said her boss had been trying to reach me over the weekend and called several times only to find my phone was off. This past weekend was my girlfriends birthday so my phone has been charged the entire time as I’ve been using it to drive from place to place, not that I traditionally often have my phone off for any reason but I know with certainty it has been on and I have received no calls.

After playing phone tag with both managers they finally stated they would remove from my current job post since they were unable to get in contact with me and change me to another. When I asked what my upcoming schedule for this week would be they said they’d have to discuss it internally.

So now I’m waiting to figure out when I’m going to be working and at this point the management is so disorganized I am not certain I am working a real job/will be paid. Lol I’ve reiterated my general availability and I am hoping for the best, but I am going to start looking for different work.

Is it at all unusual to start a security job without most any of your gear, no or brief training, and be left unsupervised in your first week of work for a nonstop 80 hours or is the sleep depravation making me paranoid? I have had this just overwhelming feeling of “this is weird” since I started.

It’s also unusual to me they are arguing with me that my phone was turned off but did not attempt to contact me through email or text message. I “clock in” through text to one of these managers so it seems sketch they wouldn’t message me for the purpose of contacting me if they were panicked attempting to get into contact with me.

Tl;dr Started security job, no training did not receive all of my gear. Worked 7 days straight starting the day of my orientation 12 hours each night. Management is super disorganized and unable to tell me the day of whether or not I will be working tonight or even this week.

555,"I live in an rv park, so there's no exact lease. The lot rent is $475 plus however much electric I use between the last time they check to the time when they check (which will most likely be either the day I move out or the day after - they seem to be more focused on expanding than actually helping tenants) and then I have to pay water separately which is always the same price since I don't use a lot as I live by myself.

They check the water and electric amounts between the 15th-17th and post it around that time. Since I am leaving halfway through the month, I assume I'll have to pay the leftover water and electric, but rent? I'm not sure. Plus, if I pay late, I'll be charged a $50 late fee, but I don't know when my new paycheck will come out (I'm moving to a new city and trying to pay bills and then on top of that previous water and electric?) and I do plan to try asking them if they can waive the late fee until I get paid.

There where some complications with the surgery so instead of having 8 stitches total I had 28 (14 on each hand) and it’s taking a while to recover. 

I was cleared for work weeks ago but my boss won’t let me back unless I can lift 20lb right off the bat. I’m already functional enough to do most of my regular duties. I can’t wait another month to get back to work, I have no medical pay and -6,000 in debt now

My mother cosigned for me when I and both of my parents went to get a car in early 2020. I didn’t know what car I really wanted in first place and I was just looking at a Honda dealership closer to my location. I talked to her the other day and she said I should trade it in.

Last night I was looking to see how much my car would go for a trade in and wasn’t sure how process works if I take it to same dealership/ or another one. 

Kelly Blue Book: (2018Trax) $13,202-15,000( estimate? Could be higher?)

Used Honda Civics : (where I got my car from): they have a 2017 Hatchback Sport ($19,400 and 36,600miles)/ 2019 Hatchback Ed FWD ($23,326, and 9,085miles)

568,"For the past few months, I've (M31) been speaking with this woman (F28) whom I've known for a couple of years, but lives on the opposite side of the world. I don't think it's turning into a relationship at all given the distance, but I really enjoy talking with her.

It all seemed to be going so great, both of us got along well and have tons in common, spoke a lot via texts and calls almost daily, until recently she told me her schedule had turned hectic and started responding less. She told me everything's fine between us, but it's just her hectic schedule. There were a few things that I texted her, which I expected a response, but she didn't reply to them.

I know I said I wasn't expecting anything, but a part of me is a little hurt, especially as I've been having a difficult time (I didn't tell her this) and would really love to speak with her, even as a friend. I was always there with her through thick and thin, and it hurt me that now she's rather difficult to reach when I kind of need her.

We talk a lot through facetime and stuff since she lives an hour and a half away now. I trust her completely and have told her a lot of secrets and personal things. But there is one thing she does that genuinely hurts my feelings. She is always laughing at me. When I am trying to be funny, it is fine but she just does it all the time. I will just be simply talking about something or doing something and she will just break out laughing and I am not trying to make her laugh. She does this all the time. Sometimes when I am trying to be serious and talk to her about something that is bothering me, she will start laughing saying that I saying it weird or talking about it funny and it's annoying. I have talked to her several times that I don't like when she constantly is laughing at me when I am trying to be serious. It feels like she is always making fun of me. Whenever I talk to her about how it hurts my feelings, she just laughs it off and says it's because I am so funny. But there is a difference between someone who is always trying to funny and someone who you just laugh at because you think they are a joke. I don't try to be funny all the time. I feel like a joke to her. It just really hurts my feelings because I feel like she doesn't think she is doing anything wrong. It just comes to a point where I am over constantly being laughed at after I told her several times how it makes me feel. I just don't know what to do.

570,"At the start of college I [M21] joined a pretty small club on campus. I met a lot of really cool people and right off the bat I took interest in one of the girls [F21] in the group. She’s super talented, pretty, funny, everything. I felt like we had a lot in common for sure. It took me a lot of effort, but I asked her out to get food (didn’t specifically say a date though) pretty early in the semester

We had a great time, and later that night I asked if she wanted to go on a real date, but got rejected. College was pretty sucky at first for me, and this just added to it. It took me a while to get over it, especially since I had to see her all the time because of the club, but I moved on. Throughout college we would interact a good amount, see each other at parties and get along well in the club, but we weren’t great friends or anything.

Well now it’s our Junior year, and things are a little different obviously. Quarantine hit everyone hard, and a bunch of my friends made a group chat that we talked in constantly over the Summer. Because of mutual friends, this girl was added to our group. Because of this I’ve ended up talking to her a lot more, albeit in a group setting

This past weekend our friend group decided to get together to have the equivalent of a party (We had all tested negative for COVID and were being safe, it was only a few people over at one of our houses). Things felt kinda different, like we were laughing together a bunch, talking more, singing along to songs together. It was so much fun. The group also got into some deep conversations, where she talked about being rejected multiple times by someone she liked

After that party I just kinda started crushing again. I feel like we know each other a lot better now, and it’s not just freshman year “Oh I kinda know you” In reality she probably isn’t into me, and I don’t wanna go through the awkwardness of this again (especially now that she’s in my friend group). And it’s not like I text her one on one or anything, but I’m just catching the feels again. Any advice? I don’t know if I should start trying to talk to her more

We've been living together for several months and like. I cannot stand this dude. Even if we werent living together he's the sort of person that I absolutely would not hang out with. He does not bathe with any regularity (several of his washrags grew mold), take out the trash, or pay for any common cleaning supplies/tp/whatever.  Also he leaves literal ass prints on the toilet and refuses to clean them despite being asked by myself and my partner. Like as a fellow magic player and gamer, he is the kind of person that makes me not feel comfortable going to game shops or having team chat on.

576,"I just got this great apartment. I have my own kitchen and bathroom that I don’t have to share, it’s amazing. It’s a place I can go to get away from my family and see my college friends. (I love my family but quarantine with them was oof) So with the new apartment, there became problems.

Problem #1
The door that leads from the living room to my bedroom has a gap underneath the door. This isn’t even a small gap. I can slide my foot easily underneath it. I’ve been trying to find something to put in the gap because I’ve realized that gap makes it sounds like I’m right next to someone in the kitchen. I’ve been trying to find something without screwing anything into the door as I’m only renting this place. But I’ve found nothing.

Problem #2
It seems that our front door is too small for its frame. (I worry our door would be easy to break into cuz any pull shows the mechanisms in the door). Any gust of wind or someone on the floor shakes the wall, it will sound like someone is knocking on our door. I’ve tried shoving padding in the mechanism to maybe soften the impact but nothing. I’ve started shoving a cardboard cereal box in between the door which helps a little bit but not a lot. I’ve even told maintenance in the building but it’s been a week since I put in the request. At this point the door is annoying and I don’t know what to do about it.

Problem #3
This is the fun one, my upstairs neighbors sound like a pack of elephants walking around. They’ll be stomping around till 3 am on weekdays when there’s classes. I’ve already had a run in with one of the upstairs neighbors. We had only just moved in and me being me I trust my roommates. I left my door wide open and unlocked as I went to work out downstairs. I wasn’t going to be gone long anyways. Two of my roommates text me an hour after I left that a girl claimed she lived in the room we did. And that she lived in the room I did. So they let her walk into my room and look at damages that she was charged for. To be fair they did watch her but it still makes me uncomfy. The damages would have been replaced before I got there so I don’t know what she was thinking. When I got this text I immediately stopped what I was doing and ran upstairs. I kind of went off on them saying that should have never happened, we don’t know them and they could have been scoping things out. Management was called and they confirmed that she did live there before and talked to her about never doing that again. And I found out that my one roommate had the girls number and was texting her. All in all not an ideal situation but like now they are unnecessarily loud at all hours at night. They’ve woken up my roommates because they started vacuuming at 5 am. 

I’ve been googling a lot trying to find an answer but I don’t know what I’m doing lol.
Any advice helps!",30Aug2020,1
577,"I am a 16-year-old boy, who has dyspraxia, meaning I am mildly on the autistic spectrum.

Just a few hours earlier, I had an outburst directed to my mother for her continuously repeating that ""put the washing here, put that there, etc."" and I asked her nicely for her to put a note next to the washing machine displaying the instructions so I could read over them and remember. She refused, and I started shouting at her. Her boyfriend was in the bathroom, eavesdropping on every single word spoken, and when he came out of the bathroom, he immediately turned on me. 

I went into lockdown, not saying a word, not even eye contact with him, because if I did, I would become roadkill. I tried to ignore him, but he stood on the pile of washing I was trying to put in the washing machine, intimidating me by being in my face, going ""Look at me. Apologize to your mother, now."". I hissed angrily, and said nothing, prompting him to keep going. But what enraged me most was my mother, grinning with glee as she watched her boyfriend shout at me, in plain sight, as if to say ""Haha, that'll teach you!!"" A very faint grin, but meant for me to see. At that moment, I simply exploded. Exploded in a storm of emotion. A feeling of pure hatred seeped into my brain, engulfing every single sense.

I fought back, saying that ""The only reason she brought you here is because you are her personal henchman, an enforcer to carry out the sentence. I can see that now, I CAN SEE!! Yes, I know now. "" He quickly rushed toward me, making me flinch, making me fear and hate him more. He said, ""Why is it, that every time fucking time we have this conversation, it turns into a philosophical debate? You are a child, and children listen to their parents."", due to me saying ""How do you know that you are right? How do you know that, hmm?""

I stalked up the stairs afterwards, staring into space, unblinking, mind blank. I went to my brother's bedroom, closed the door behind me, walked to the side of the bed next to the wall where a space was, and curled up into a ball. I began to cry and cry and cry, weeping quietly to myself, my liquid mucus coating the floor as it dripped from my nose. I couldn't take it all in. My feelings of safety, security, and power, all shattered. I felt more lonely than every before.

My mother and her boyfriend noticed the door was closed, and opened it, suspecting I was in there. They came over to me, my mother stepping over me like I was discarded trash. I whispered ""You do not understand, no you don't. You never understood."" The boyfriend spoke, saying ""Get up, and do what you're told."" I screamed back at him, screaming ""STAY AWAY FROM ME!! STAY AWAY!"" Every time they tried to speak, I told them to stay away. The boyfriend kept telling me in a monotone voice; ""You're overreacting."" I screamed at him again and again, until he ended with ""Or what? Stay away or what?"" I screamed the same thing over and over again, until he left. And I resumed crying. 

After that, I went to my room again, and punched the wall, then punching my curtains. I felt so alone, so unsure of myself, my mind telling me that I've officially gone mentally insane. I started worrying that these arguments and confrontations were shaping me, moulding me into a person I didn't want to be but couldn't prevent. I began to seek power over others, then, like I am now. To feel safe and secure, I feel like I must have power to achieve that goal, yet I am scared of what will become of me. I don't want to do it, I am sensitive to others' emotions, and yet I fear it is the only solution I have.

I only wanted them to hear me, I only wanted them to maintain the balance of safety, and they did not. Now I feel dead. I'm currently waging a war inside my mind, one side going ""They're your parents, they're only doing this to help you and protect you. They give you clothes, food, materialistic items. They clearly care about you. You're just overreacting and being stupid."" The other side, not wanting to back down, is saying ""If your parents are doing this, they clearly are not helping you. Don't listen to them, they are bad, you must rebel against your oppressors. Though you don't have the confidence nor the strength to fight for yourself, you need to find a way."" 

I have to type this in a hurry though. I took an unofficial bipolar test, and scored positive, and suddenly my behaviour finally made sense to me. My mind would have already sped past this topic, no longer interested in it. It has already forgotten what happened, and that is what I fear. If this keeps happening to me, each fight and argument will turn me into more of a monster. Farewell, people of this subreddit.",30Aug2020,1

Before B moved in we told them that in order for A and I to be able to live in our home with a cat that B would need to do a few things. 1. Vacuum and change the litter box every day 2. Buy air filters for the house. Both of these were so that dander wouldn’t be as bad in the house. A and I didn’t want to ask someone to get rid of their pet so we tried very hard to accommodate them. B has not kept up their end. They have no bought air filters so no room in the house has any kind of system to pull allergens from the air. They don’t vacuum or change litter unless A and I tell them to. And it’s always an argument to get B to do anything for the cat. B doesn’t spend time with the cat either. It spends all day locked in B’s bedroom with no other animals or people to interact with. When B gets home from work they don’t go spend time with the cat, they never spend time with it. I feel so terrible for this poor animal. It’s literally spent the last 6 months locked in a bedroom with no one to play with because B won’t buy the things they promised and A and I can’t breathe in our own home. I’m so mad at B for the neglect. I’ve talked to them about it many times and B always has some excuse for why they haven’t bought the filters. It took me 4 months of yelling at B about the cat peeing on everything before B took the cat to get fixed. I don’t know what to do.

584,"In November of 2019 I was officially diagnosed with major depressive disorder and adhd, along with my anxiety diagnosis I got when I was 10. I’ve been dealing with those issues since before a diagnoses, but I fear my mental illnesses where caught too late. I’m 16 now, have no friends, work 25 hours a week at a job I’m miserable at, have failing grades and have been in and out of mental hospitals for the past 6 months of my life. I’m miserable and lonely and I have nothing to live for at this point. I feel so empty and alone every day. Everything has turned gray and I can no longer foster meaningful relationships due to mental issues that polarize me from relating to people my age. I used to have friends that I would hang out with almost every day, but they slowly stopped talking to me, which I can’t blame them for, and eventually I just cut them out of my life so I could be done with having to worry about others. Our friendships became toxic. I also verbally abused my ex-girlfriend and took out my underlying misery on her. She didn’t deserve it and looking back, I feel like a total piece of shit for even involving her in my life in the first place. It’s not to say she didn’t also have issues, but at least she was kind, caring and just a sweet person overall. I know that I can’t blame everything on my mental issues, but I play the victim and use my mental illnesses to avoid guilt over messed up stuff I’ve done in the past like that. 

I’ve tried impatient, I’ve had a therapist for a couple of years now, I did group therapy for a couple months, nothing helps. All I want is to be happy and have at least a friend who I can trust and rely on. I wanna be able to hang out with a group of people like I used to and be close with and emotionally connect with. I want a girlfriend I can spoil and protect and treat right to prove that what I did to my ex-girlfriend isn’t what I truly am. I want to be happy.

This guy and I were friends but we weren't close friends - we'd just hang out in a large group once in a while. When I moved back August last year, he and I started getting closer. Around November, I had passing thoughts that I liked him. I tried to push these thoughts away because of my friend. They never dated but I knew she liked him even if it was two years ago. Since then, she has moved on and she currently likes someone else (who happens to also be seeing another girl, and is aware that my friend likes him). 

Fast forward to April with Covid-19 happening (my city is not badly hit) we spent a lot of time hanging out in each other's houses. My friend not as much with us, because she had to self quarantine because her parents live with her (they're at risk and her building had a covid-19 case). 

One night, he kisses me. I kissed him back, and a second later I said, we can't do this to our friend. We spoke about it, and we both said that we should talk to her about it. But before we ruined our friend group we wanted to see if this was something. In his previous relationship, his girlfriend cheated on him. In my previous relationship, I was emotionally abused by my boyfriend. Both of our previous relationships ended two years ago and we personally took a lot of time to deal with the ripples. We were scared from our past experiences but wanted to see if there was something between us. So we said we'd try and then we'd talk to our friend. This all happened while our friend was self-isolating for three weeks. 

She comes out of those three weeks and is stressed. She's having a shitty time because she recently lost a loved one. Her family moved to this city suddenly because of covid-19 (they were living elsewhere and moved because cases were bad there and then had visa problems, so they've officially shifted here). She packed up her old house virtually, and moved to a new place here with her whole family (this is common in Asia). The first time the four of them are living together after 6 years. It was an adjustment to say the least. On top of it all, she lost her dog who was in the previous city that she couldn't visit due to covid lockdown rules. 

I wanted to tell her about my feelings to this guy but I didn't want to pile on to her 100 problems. She told me that she's been crying every other day and she doesn't know why. I've tried talking to her about her feelings but it's just a pile up of so many changes that are stressful. I wanted to be there for her instead of making it worse. And this guy and I are still figuring things out. We're still unsure and we like each other but there are so many underlying insecurities to deal with. So this guy and I decided to wait. 

Come my birthday, I celebrate with my now secret boyfriend, my best friend (who hasn't seen me for two weeks before this because she has a lot to deal with and that's okay) and my boyfriends roommate. My boyfriends roommate gets super duper irresponsibly drunk and we have to call an ambulance. My best friend freaks, she is crying, anxious and hyper, and says she can't be around medical personnel because of the covid risk. I give her the keys to my apartment and my boyfriend and I take care of his roommate and spend the night at A&amp;E. 

The morning after, my friend finds at my place. She meets me and my boyfriend and another friend as it's my birthday and everything seems okay. The next night, we have dinner together as well. As she walks with us after dinner and we reach below my building she suddenly turns full of rage and says ""it took a pandemic and our drunk friend for me to realize you two are sleeping together"". She was so angry that I automatically said no (I know I shouldn't have but it was an automatic reaction), which I then follow up with ""calm down"" because she was furious (again probably not the right thing to say) and then said ""let's talk about this"". She says the one thing I can be sure of this new year for me is that she won't be in it. 

I understand her anger that I didn't tell her because she liked this guy.  I decided to give her some time (but I didn't want her to keep building up a version in her head without knowing the truth) and about 24hs later I texted her saying we should talk about it. She comes over and she listens to my side, and I apologized a lot. To which then she says that, I should've told her first when I liked him or when it happened and then given her time to process it before doing anything. She said I was selfish for doing it this way. She also said she was feeling left out and was blaming herself for it because she felt he was giving me a certain level of attention that she wasn't getting. I don't deny that all her feelings were valid and I apologized that she felt this way. But there are a few things to this:

1. With how our previous relationships went, I needed to know there was something of substance to tell my friends about without the pressure. The relationship ultimately is between the two of us (is it so selfish to think that way?) 
2. With all the things she was going through, I didn't want to add to it especially if it was still something we were figuring out 
3. As for the left out part, she was feeling that more from him than me and I told her that she should've communicated that. She said things like ""no matter how many job applications I helped with or how many dishes I did he still behaved differently to you"" which makes me wonder if she was helping as a friend or doing it to get attention in return? I also did my best to let them hang out without me. We'd often spend nights in each others places and twice I cancelled on overnights to let them have space as friends without me around. I didn't want her to feel that way ever and tried to make sure (as did he) that their relationship wouldn't be affected by mine. She has had a lot going on and in general wasn't able to spend as much time with us but that's life. That happens with all of us in phases.

She also said some other hurtful things like she didn't video call her dog the last time before she passed because she wanted to go for dinner with us because she was feeling like she had to meet us or she wanted to be included because she had spent so much time in quarantine. Something else she said was that she could've thought that if it was any other friend that there might be a possible relationship between her and him, but not with me. She clarified as she has previously in the past year that she doesn't have feelings for him (she does currently like someone else and has for the past year). She did also say that ""I used to think and say that there's nothing you could do to break this friendship but that's like saying you'd have an affair with my husband and I'd forgive you"". 

He spoke to her privately as well and said that she seemed to have more anger towards me and not him. She said she knows eventually we will be friends again but it won't be soon and it won't be the same. She also said she doesn't need us. 

I understand the anger to an extent, but we are not children. I know there's other things happening in her life and this is a trigger but I still find her response even though some of it understandable, some of it very hurtful.  I feel like she's using this to blame the way she felt the past four months. 

I am sad I hurt my friend. My boyfriend and I spoke about telling her multiple times. There never was a right time to tell her I suppose, but there in our opinion was a better time. She has every right to be angry but at the same time I wish she would understand that this (even though she may not agree with it) was what we saw was the best way to deal with the situation. I wish I had the opportunity to tell her myself. But I am also hurt that she's decided at least for the foreseeable future to cut me out of her life. I understand I can't force her to stay in my life.

Just feeling heavy about the whole situation and wanted someone out of this circle's perspective. How would you handle the situation from now on? I'm not sure what to do - I want to give her space but I also want to tell her that I'm hurt. But do I not have a right to share that given how I've hurt her? Am I such an asshole?",30Aug2020,1

587,"I'm 15M and have had quite extreme suicidal thoughts for about 2 years. It first started when my cat Zim died back in 2018 and I found it really hard and struggled pretty much all of that school year because it happened right at the start. 

Not long after we got 2 cats called Zeus and Djin. I was really excited at first and they helped me out a lot but unfortunately last hear Zeus passed away after drinking anti freeze. 

This started to make things worse for me. I dont socialize with anyone anymore and stay alone in my room most of the day.

I kinda got over it but still miss both of then very much and last night everything just crashed. 

Djin came home with a broken leg we thought would heal so we took him to a vet. After 2 hours my Dad and Sister came home and he was unfortunately put down after we discovered he had been hit by a car, completely shattered his leg and would have to wait 2 days before he could get surgery and wasnt likely to survive the night or surgery. So the difficult decision was made to put him down.

I'm in a really low point and honestly cant deal with anything anymore.

592,"Good god I’ve been tormented by this for months and I just want it to stop but I can’t allow myself to make a decision simply for the sake of making one.

There’s nothing in this world I love more than running. I have a really deep connection with the sport and the friends I’ve made along the way and the friends I’ll undoubtedly make in the future...it means the world to me, but now I have to choose.

In December I started feeling a dull pain in my right hip. 9 months, 3 xrays an MRI, 6 months off, and 8 weeks of PT later, I am simply one phone call away from scheduling surgery to fix an anterior labral tear along with CAM impingement.

Doing nothing will accelerate arthritis in the joint and continue to be a mechanical irritant, but doing surgery runs the risk of the same. I’m not in as much pain as I was before the PT and I can run basically pain free but I know it will return and I won’t be able to get through a lot of high intensity training. Becoming a casual runner and finding a different sport are not options. I just can’t bring myself to pull the trigger. It could be the greatest mistake I’ll ever make if it goes wrong and I lose the ability to run permanently, then I’ll need the other kind of therapy and even then I don’t think it would be bearable.

Hey! As my username says, I'm a very stupid dickhead. I've been talking to this girl for not more than 1 month now and I think I'm into her. We've only been texting each other on instagram and WhatsApp, and we never talked to each other on phone till yesterday. Yesterday, she called me for the first time and we were having a conversation. Now what do I say about my conversation skills? I'm an introvert and I'm really really awkward and shy in real life, since we both were only having text conversations till now, it was alright for me, but yesterday we have a voice conversation for the first time and I was really really shy and I was super super awkward! Words weren't coming out of my mouth and I was just blabbering some bullshit. Just bullshit came out of my mouth and nothing else! Also, I have problems paying attention and whenever I have a conversation with someone, I sometimes just get drifted away and I don't even listen to what they say. I'm physically there, but mentally somewhere else all together. 

As we were having the conversation, she was telling me something and I drifted away and I didn't listen to her at all. When she finished the sentence, I didn't know what she was talking about, so I just stayed silent. There was awkward silence for over minute and she probably got pissed or angry, I don't know, but she said she remembered some work and cut the call. 

I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP    I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP    I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP I FUCKED UP!!!!!!!      

Look, I know that I fucked up, okay? It was very rude and disrespectful to just not listen to what she's saying, I know that, and now I regret that, and I want to apologise to her, but we both haven't talked since yesterday at all! Not even texting. The next time I call her, I'll apologise to her, but I don't know what else to say. I'm very bad at having conversations and I don't know what to say at all. Words don't come out of my mouth at all.

I request you to please help me out here. I want to know how to un-fuck up yesterday's fuck up. I want to know if it's even possible, and if it is, then please tell me how. And I also want to know how to have more and better conversations with her. I'm really really really really into her and I can do absolutely anything for her. Please help. Thank you.",30Aug2020,1

598,"I live in Thailand. I’m white male. In our town there are some expats from a dozen or so countries and a variety of ethnicities. There is no majority in our little group. And we’re all residents of Thailand so, here, we’re all the vast minority. And that’s kinda something that bonds us together - that we’re all experiencing this unique place as outsiders. Most of our time outside this group is lived as the only non-Thai in the room/group/area and it’s very beneficial to better understand how that feels. 

Anyhow, we all hang out pretty regularly and really enjoy the cultural interchange. We’ve gotten quite close. A lot of the time we play board games and just hang out and talk. Today, one of our group of expats (black female) decided to have a party at her house. She texted our group and said that this is a party for “Asian, brown, and black people. No whites allowed.“ It really hurt my feelings because there’s only a couple white people in the group (and we’re from like 3 countries) and we’ve never had any issues related to race. To be excluded simply because of our skin color feels wrong and mean. 

My questions are: 

Why would our friend do this? 

Does this count as a “safe space” when there is no majority in our group and there is no clear oppressor/oppressed relationship between the groups (Russian, American, Jewish, Chinese, Indonesian, Arab, Indian, Korean, Brazilian, etc.) when we’re all minorities in this land, when the majority people (Thais) are invited, and when the only people not invited are white people?

Is this racist?

Who is included in this “non-white” group (our white Hispanic friend doesn’t know where he falls)

And, what should I say or do, if anything? I want to be friends with her but this really feels like a targeted effort to exclude us based solely on our skin color...and from a friend this hurts.

So I really like reading books and every morning I went to school I would pick up a book so I read a lot of books.

The hallway was packed and I'm trying to squeeze through the crowd to get through the library. Just like normal I return the book and I chit chat with the librarian while the crowd dies down and then pick out a book and leave.

L: Hey you haven't returned Harry Potter yet

OP: Umm... I returned it last week

OP: That's not possible because I literally turned it in last week

Because of my circumstances, I'm not able to comfortably get a second job at the moment. Because she has the extra money, she literally doesn't care what the energy bills are, and she gets really upset if I suggest turning up the AC to save money.

We initially agreed upon 70 degrees for the AC, but a week ago, I asked if she would be okay with raising it to 75 degrees to save money on electric. She instead insulted me, told me that she doesn't understand why I worry about bills, told me to get a job (despite having a full-time job), accused me of not listening to her, and told me that I need to ""track my finances"" better. 

For the sake of keeping peace, I dropped the subject, but that was when it was 90+ degrees outside everyday. For the first couple days of next week, it's only supposed to get up to 80 degrees, and I want to suggest turning the AC off and opening the windows, but knowing her response to a five-degree change, I'm a bit scared to ask.

611,"I(24m) have been dating “Rosa”(26f) since November. We met on Tinder and had Skype dates. We met up in person a few times. I’ve been to her house but I’ve never been invited inside.
She’s from South America and mostly speaks Portuguese. Her English is ok but she doesn’t use her English much. She never went to school and lives in a mostly Portuguese speaking area. She moved to America when she’s was 17 with her parents. 

Anyway, Rosa has two little girls ages 4 and 6. I’ve never met them. She described them but told me she doesn’t want to send me pictures them to respect their privacy. Fair enough. Rosa told me she lost custody of them 3 years ago to the girls father. Rosa told me that since she’s not an American citizen the courts gave the kids to him.
Rosa also mentioned that she only sees them when he allows it. Sometimes ,it can be for one hour, other times for whole months. She mentioned that he calls her last minute to get the kids and she willingly drops what’s she’s doing to get them.

About 6 weeks ago Rosa called me and said that she would have the girls for 2 or 3 months straight( I don’t know why) and asked me not to call or expect to see her. That she would call me when the girls were sleeping.

I’m a bit suspicious of her behavior. I’m starting to believe the kids don’t exist and maybe she’s married or has a boyfriend. When we Skyped I asked her for a tour of her home. She rents a room and apparently when the girls visit they all share a bed. Which also seem strange. 

Should I confront her about this? Should I ask for proof of the children? Or should I just leave things as they are?

We're currently in quarantine and can't leave campus in order to ensure we don't have a COVID outbreak and have to go home, which means I'm unable to work and had to set up a gofundme and a venmo for my mom's friends to donate to- so essentially, others have paid for almost my entire tuition thus far, which I'm super grateful for but I feel horrible for not being able to save up enough.

This college is 1400 miles away from my home. I've lived in the same region of my home state and never been more than 50 miles away from where I was born except for family trips. A friend of mine drove me, so I haven't seen my family since the day I left, and it's been a little over two weeks now. I should also add that I have a child (2m) and I've never been away from him for more than a weekend when he's gone to his dad's family.

I feel like this has made a huge impact on my mental health, I'm alone in a single room and we're not allowed to visit each other in the dorms, we're only allowed about an hour of outside time a day plus leaving the dorms to get meals. I know that this is all to make sure we're safe so we don't have an outbreak, but being alone 23 hours a day and barely being able to call my family because of the time difference and my mom's work schedule is taking its toll on me.

My mom wants me to finish my AA if not stay for my BA, but I know it's probably going to be the same routine next year and I don't think I can handle it. I don't want to be this far away from my family any longer than I have to. I've also already bummed $40,000 off of people and I feel horrible about having to borrow more money, but at the same time I'd feel horrible about leaving because they're all rooting for me and helping me out so much so I can afford to be here.

Initially I was excited to go to this school, but it's been such a letdown since I got here, everything's so disorganized, everyone tells us conflicting information, and I, along with a few other students, seem to have been forgotten about entirely on a few occasions.

I know that college is important, but I hate being this far away from home and I feel so isolated here. My friends are worried about me. My son's been acting out the whole time I've been gone because he's realizing that I won't be home for a while (I come home the end of November and finish the semester online, then go back in January). I'd rather go to a cheaper college, closer to home, where I can stay close to my family and be able to have a job and not be stuck in one room the majority of my time.

I'm going to finish out the school year here either way, but am I wrong for wanting to transfer to a cheaper, closer college?

(addition before I post- reading back on this I feel like I'm being whiny and I should be more grateful- please let me know if you agree. I really don't know if this is something worth being conflicted over or if I should just stop complaining and be grateful that I'm able to be here.)",30Aug2020,1
613,"Hi.  A little background for context.  My parents don't get along at all, they have deep-rooted issues that trace back to the beginning of their relationship/marriage.  It's escalated to the point where verbal fights involve intense cursing and screaming, and physical altercations.  This is all ""cushioned"" by periods of regular life and semi-odd communication. 

I'm a man in my late 20s, I have a protrusion in the back of my skull.  I have done some tests, but this is not what I'm asking about.

Dealing with a potentially life threatening situation is complicated enough as is, I'm not a coward person but I do worry how they will take the news.  

Is it a good idea to not tell them about it at all, regardless of how things turn out?

621,"When I was in college, none of my two brothers decided to visit me. They didn’t know who I was friends with, where I lived, etc. They didn’t even come to my graduation, which I consider to be a significant milestone in my life. Only one sent me a text offering his congratulations. It wasn’t like I was crazy far away either, I was still in state and only an hour away. When you see photos of people’s graduation, typically it’s their whole family, sometimes even their extended family. But for me, it was just my parents. Is my anger toward them justified? 

To be honest, I feel like I barely know them now and I don’t feel motivated to contact them. My anger manifests itself acting quiet and barely speaking when around them, thus showing them the same indifference they show me. Furthermore, my siblings are closer then I with them. I am sure when my brother 1’s graduation comes around, brother 2 will attend and of course I will be forced to as well.

Note that we were actually close, atleast thats what I thought but obviously I was hurt so I didn't gave him those chocolates ( ate it myself 😈) But yh I never questioned him about this, he behaved as if everything was normal. So with time I forgot about it and forgave him.

Today was my birthday, yesterday(mid night) he forgot to wish me (he knew today was my birthday, he just slept) today in the morning he sent me a picture of us together with some birthday messages and told me that he actually did it yesterday but slept before mid night.
It was kind of weird as he is kind of popular and knows alot of ppl and HE ALWAYS WISHES THEM AT MID NIGHT but he slept on my bday? His ""best friend's"" bday?

Anyway then put up a status wishing me only to delete it after 15 minutes!? And I couldn't have noticed but he put up another story which made me realize that he deleted his previous statuses. I confronted him, asked that he deleted them already then he was like aww you felt bad? I didn't mean to and then tried texting me normally as if nothing happened and I left him on seen

This was one of the incidents. He always SAYS that we are close friends and comes to me when he got problems and everytime when I need him, he makes me feel unimportant. I decided it was enough and decided to cut him off. Did I overreact?  Please help. Thank you💕",30Aug2020,1

628,"I will try and keep it short and succinct. 

I am estranged from most members in my family with the exception of my younger brother so I've been financially independent since I was 18 and if I end up failing, I fail, I have no sort of family or anything to fall back on. 

My current situation: I have lived in W. Europe as an American citizen for the past two years. I first came to au pair and found myself as a student in an MSc program in Anthropology. I soon realised though that anthropology is not what I want and sporadically decided to drop out a few weeks ago. Multiple things influenced the decision, I wasn't happy with the subject nor the city I was doing it in. However, the student visa ensured that I could stay in Europe (which is what I thought I wanted) and now that it's over I either need to return home to NYC or find another way to stay in Europe. I don't actually mind going back to NYC, but considering the virus and how much of a sh\*t show it is, all of my friends there are telling me to stay here. 

However, due to my field in the social sciences, I can't really attain a proper work visa here and the easiest way that I can possibly stay in Europe would be to au pair again. I don't mind au pairing, but I'm 26 and feel like I should start getting my career off the ground, or at least start making some real money. I have not even begun to establilsh myself in any real career path and I wouldn't even know how to go about doing it. Going to NYC could enable that, au pairing wouldn't. Au pairing however would give me the freedom to teach myself the necessary skills to transition to data science within a year or so while also enabling me to achieve fluency in a language that I would like to be fluent in. 

I honestly don't know which would be best for me considering current world circumstances and I really do not know where to start or how to even make this decision. Can anyone give me their objective/honest opinion? Thanks a lot.",30Aug2020,1

He slept all day and would sleep through his alarms for hours. My mom and dad constantly would yell at him. My mom told him that he won’t even make it into the military. My one sister is so mean to him. She says he looks like a lizard, and it pisses me off. 

His room is pretty much in closet. He has a loft bed in there and shelves for clothes so he has space, but its not ideal. His room is disgusting. He sleeps with no sheets and his bed is covered in stains. He has hundreds of soda cans in there and crumbs. He won’t clean it, even when offered help. 

I’m worried that he is depressed and thats why his room is like that. He is yelled at a lot, so that could also be why. Now disclaimer, my parents are abusive or anything, so please don’t comment on their parenting skills. My brother is their first teenage boy and my dad is gone a lot because he’s in the army.

I had never had any intimate relationships or any very close friendships at this time so I had no idea how much my choice would effect me in the future.

638,"So, obviously I know that this isn't by-far the worst home to live in as people go through much worse but it's really taking a toll on my mental health and I need advice.
I'm a 17-year-old girl, who's about to turn 18 in circa 3 months. I've been depressed for the last 4 years and around 6 months ago I told my family and we've been trying to find help with it. Currently I'm seeing a psychiatrist, psychologist, and I'm on antidepressants. So far so good right? Family who's supportive about depression etc etc.

About 5 days ago I cut myself while I was alone in our second house (we rent it out but there were no guests at the time), I don't remember why or it even happening. Three days ago I was in a driving lesson and my parents decided to suddenly pick me up after it. I had wrapped a bandage around my arm so the instructor wouldn't see it on accident but I forgot to take it off when I got into the car with my parents. My mom obviously noticed and she told me to take it off because she didn't believe me when I said that it's there to support my wrist. 
When she saw the cut marks, she immediately started yelling at me. 

""WHY WOULD YOU DO SUCH AN IDIOTIC THING?!""
""I'VE NEVER BEEN SO DISAPPOINTED AND INSULTED IN MY ENTIRE LIFE""
""NO COMPUTER FOR YOU FOR THE ENTIRETY OF
SEPTEMBER, WE'RE TAKING AWAY YOUR SWITCH AND LAPTOP (both of which I bought with my own damn money)""
""YOU'RE GROUNDED FOR TWO MONTHS""
""(JAMES) ISN'T ALLOWED TO COME HERE EVER AGAIN. DO YOU KNOW WHAT WE'VE BEEN ASSUMING? ALL OF THIS SHIT STARTED WHEN YOU STARTED DATING HIM. YOU PROBABLY CUT YOURSELF BECAUSE YOU ONCE TOLD HIM
YOU'RE GOING TO SO YOU ACTUALLY DID IT. I NEVER WANT TO SEE HIS FACE HERE AGAIN.""
([James) is my boyfriend who I've been together with for 8 months. We live around 4 hour drive from each other and he's currently in time service which is mandatory army. -Name has been changed.)
""YOU CUT YOURSELF ONLY FOR ATTENTION!! DO YOU NEED ATTENTION THAT BAD?!""

So, yeah. I also got berated about 3 hours later for 20
minutes straight while I was driving home with mom. But |
won't go into much detail on that because most important
things I brought up there ^.

She refused to speak to me at home, made me do chores
and shit. In the evening, I was forced to go outside because it
was actually my little brother's birthday and they cancelled
his birthday party because of that??

They started it out by asking how they can help and so on.
But soon the conversation turned to how much I hurt them
and how they've been trying to do everything, how I've ruined
our family and they don't know how to fix it. Honestly they
were acting like I actually murdered someone.
I didn't say much and kept replying with ""I don't know""
because I really wasn't in the mood after crying the entire day
and contemplating how to run away from home. Eventually
they said that (James) can come after all. Fair - I decided that things might be going well and decided to not run away after all.

Nothing really happened when he was here as we really
didn't want to be around my parents. I felt a lot happier and
actually peaceful when he was here but today he had to go.

Today I had to take care of my sick brother the entire day
while my parents were supposedly working. I didn't even get
to clean my room because I had to watch him. Around noon |
put him to bed and fell asleep with him and we woke up
around 5 pm. Only thing my father did was yell at him to stop crying which really didn't help.
Mom was incredibly pissed off because I ruined my bedtime
schedule and didn't do some chores. When I was trying to
wake up she told me to go and pick up some weeds she took
out with my grandparents and put them in the cart. And that
it had to be done before sunset. Fair, fair.
Worst thing about that was that my parents, brother, and
grandparents just watched me work and none of them
helped me. They were all just playing with my brother or drinking tea.

Now, back to the title of this post.
* Talking to them about how I feel wouldn't work at all.
About a month ago, they made me for a week straight 7-14
hours every day and because it made me so tired I couldn't
bottle up my feelings. I yelled to my mother how I had been
feeling for the past 3-4 years but I don't remember what |
said anymore. At first she actually changed herself but about
2 weeks later, she continued acting the same way she had
been before and now whenever she brings it up, it's to say
how bad of a daughter I am and how insulted she felt.
* Maybe ask my psychologist or psychiatrist to talk to her
you would say.
No - my psychiatrist tried it and sure she may have come off
as rude. ""You should take a good look in the mirror to figure
out why your daughter has been depressed for so long."" All it
did was piss off my mother and now she refuses to talk to
anyone and brings it up to point out how badly I speak of our
family because to her, our family is perfect. Lol.
* Even (James) has tried talking to her but my mother pushed him away like he was a stranger because ""he had no right to interfere in our family business, who does he think he is?""

I'm honestly lost as to what to do. My depression just keeps
getting worse and worse, especially since I'm not allowed on
my computer and that was my main way of coping with my
mother's bullshit.

At this point, I genuinely want to run away. I've got a plan how
to do it, I've got multiple plans how my future would work
out. Sure, going to university would be much harder without
their support but at the same time, being free of depression
would make that all worth it.

If anyone could also explain my parents' logic of taking away the things I love, and expecting it to help me. Please, please, please tell me.

Another piece of info to consider is that she filed a restraining order on the guy last night. 

I would love to file with CPS so her kids might have the chance to go to better homes and such. But I wanted it to remain anonymous.

About 12 years ago my Dad met a woman and 2 years later married her and had a kid with her. Ever since she has a kid she was awful to us. I remember even when we were little, like ages 7 we would have to do their dishes, their laundry, clean the bathrooms and toilets, emphasis on ‘THEIR’. None of it was our stuff the second we walked in the door we had to do things that no 8 and 6 year old kids should do. Basically be their Cinderellas. My brother has slight anxiety and my Dad’s wife used to literally bully him, and still does. Years go on, now, present day they have 2 girls. 

Recently my Dads been a massive dick to me whenever he gets the chance then acts like its all fine 5 minutes later. He’ll be really fun to be around then all of a sudden he’ll get mad and yell and curse at us. So this summer they offered to pay me for babysitting their kids. Before i turned 17 i had no car so i had to sleep here nights before and basically spend the whole summer here, for sure the majority. So I’ve been coming up with excuses for us not to go because we hate it here so much, but at the end of the day their family so i feel guilty just thinking about never going but i want to so bad. 

Today our Dad’s wife came downstairs while he was outside (went behind his back to yell at us as she does all the time) and ripped into us because We’re still minors and still have to come. (Among many other things) She says every Saturday we dont come she will call the police and “win an Oscar for her performance and make us come here.” Those were here words. Then she told me that side of the family is all we have and we’re nothing without them. 

I’m so over it. She has verbally abused us for years but i never really complain about it because i know there are kids in much tougher spots that me.

A little background on them, me and A started dating first and I introduced my best guy friend (D) to my now best girl friend (S) and they started dating soon after. Me and A just broke up after a long time so recently it just became the three of us and I can often be a third wheel lol. Here’s where the problem is, we’ve all just started college and me and D are sticking to online school at home and his girlfriend S has gone off to another state far from here. Me and her have gone to talking everyday to only once every two-three days and I miss her like crazy. I know D feels the same way as they dont talk much either. Anyways, It’s hard enough to be in online school and not get to meet so many new people and S has been going out every night always talking about her new group of 10+ friends. While it does make me a little jealous that she’s found new friends so fast, I am happy for her because she needs that there. I’ve recently tried hanging out with D alone because all our other friends left to college and we had so much fun together but the entire time S was on the phone with us just in the background, not really doing anything? She told me multiple times for “no funny business” to my face and I think she wanted to make it seem like a joke but it seemed much more serious. I asked her later on if she felt uncomfortable that me and D were hanging out together and she said it had made her feel hurt and insecure because she was afraid we would start catching feelings and leave her out. Let me clear, D is like a brother to me and i would NEVER and i mean EVER go for him, I can definitely say he feels the same about me lol. So i apologized and left her alone about it but i told the both of them that I’m not the one in the relationship and that i cant be the one to decide if it’s okay or not. But now, D has texted me saying that we cant hang out anymore until S gets back from her state which is Mid- December :( I know we would miss his birthday and Halloween together which we were so excited about. He said we could hang out one last time this week but he doesn’t want to make our friend S jealous and have it a strain on her mind. I know it’s not my place, but I honestly feel really upset. She’s there in another state hanging out with 10+ people everynight and me and D have almost no one here except for eachother to talk to. I don’t want to lose one of my best friends and I’m afraid if i say something I’ll lose them both. What should I do?",30Aug2020,1

They say that my parents give everything to me but they didnt gave anything to them , I have no respect I do everything wrong, Im a special child etc. My oldest sibling didnt even wanted that my dad gifting me a ps4 for my 16. birthday. They arent successful , they couldnt do anything in their life and they are frustrated ,very toxic and jealous etc.I think thats why they are like this.But today my sister crossed the line and (33) walked on me to hit me , my question here is what can/should i do when she hits me ? Asked my parents they said “ofc you do nothing,you cant do anything “because i should be “respectful” I wouldnt care hitting them to defense myself but I would never hit anybody/anything who is weaker than me and we are siblings.I don’t mind the pain when they hit me because I’m a boxer so im used to get hit but all the fights the quarrels pulls my mood down .I have important exams to take within 4 days .We didnt had a sibling relationship my lifetime they are like foreigners to me and I dont even care, I just want them to leave me alone.I realised very late but they are the reason that im introverted and shy.I would do a mistake and everybody was ranting.So time by time I came to the point that I couldnt even say my opinion on something.I really had thoughts that Im adopted because of them and Im totally sick of them trying to push me down for no reason .I will not participate to exam bc Im very distracted from all of it and dont want to fail.I literally dont know what to do and need some help.",30Aug2020,1

651,"When coming out of the bathroom (next to her room) I hear an older mans voice, and decided to listen in for just a sec to make sure she was being safe. (Preferably talking to a relative). Instead I heard someone with an accent, who didn’t sound like anyone I know. I then thought I heard “When was the last time you masturbated” but I didn’t want to jump to conclusions, so I listened a bit more. Until she opened the door to let one of our dogs out of the room, I asked who she was talking to and she said a friend. I asked why her friend sounds older, and why I thought I heard him ask inappropriate questions, to which she said “because he’s weird”. I asked if I really did hear what he asked her. She nodded and said he asked multiple times so she hung up (presumably right before she opened the door). At first she told me he was a friend so I wanted to make sure she hadn’t talked to him prior to now, she said she hadn’t, so... she lied about him being a friend. I now don’t know if she’s lying or not.

654,"note: Please be aware that I am a furry, and I post furry artwork. If you don't like furry artwork, then that's fine, but I'm just gonna totally ignore any comments that go ""well maybe it's because you're a furry"" because there are plenty of famous artists who are furries, and I don't think me being a furry is the reason why my art isn't very popular. Also please don't come here if you're just going to tell me to ""stop worrying about getting likes"" on the internet, I don't care I would just like advice on how to get more attention for my work. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been doing artwork for a few years now, but no matter how many times I've posted I've never been able to garner fans or even a decent amount of followers. I tried a lot of things, like signing up for places to post my artwork such as DeviantArt or Furaffinity, I made an Instagram to post art on, I post all my art on twitter, etc.

And I always use tags that will let people find my artwork, but no matter where I post or what I post it never seems to ""blow up"" even a little bit, and I don't really know what else to do about it :/ I even shilled money out to buy ad space on a website hoping people would click on it and come see my art, but I'm afraid that maybe it might have all been a waste of time and money, and no one will click to see my art anywhere. 

I've tried drawing fanart for things people like, but I don't even like some of the things that are ""popular"" that everyone is making fan art for, and I get unmotivated real fast. The only time my art ever really ""blew up"" was this one time months ago when I posted on the furry subreddit and my post got more than 100 upvotes. 

Other than that I only ever get about 20-40 likes average on all the places I post, sometimes not even that much if it's someplace like twitter or Instagram. Any advice on how to reach a wider audience, or maybe how to make your art more popular? Is there something I am missing that every other artist seems to be doing?",30Aug2020,1
655,"My roommate has a foxhound and a chihuahua. The foxhound recently very viciously attacked the chihuahua and bit it on the face and back without any provocation from the chihuahua. There was no food involved and the chihuahua was on the opposite side of the room when the foxhound got up, raced over to the chihuahua and bit the ever living crap out of the thing. I witnessed the entire thing take place, as did the dog’s owner and her boyfriend.

The roommate and her boyfriend just sort of watched it happen and didn’t make any movement to stop the foxhound from attacking the chihuahua until I had gotten up from the entryway of the house and passed through the kitchen and the dining room into the living room. The floor plan is very open, so although that sounds like a large distance, it’s really not. I happened to be looking into the living room because my roommate had asked me a question about my work schedule, when it witnessed it.

My roommate and her boyfriend were sitting a couple feet away on the couch and hadn’t moved until I was in the living room and said to stop the dog. Finally, she got up, smacked the foxhound haphazardly while lazily saying, “Bad dog.” and then scooped up the chihuahua and sat back down like nothing had happened. The chihuahua seemed to be in a state of shock and started to seize (it has frequent seizures) in her arms as she sat back down to watch tv.

Now, the foxhound has horrible food aggressive problems and has attacked her cat before because it strayed too close while the foxhound was eating. The dog also plays very rough with her cat and puts it’s jaws around the cat’s neck and head often. I’ve raised concerns that the foxhound could easily snap the cat’s neck like this, but she says he’s just playing and would not harm any of the cats or the chihuahua. This was before the incident mentioned above.

Also, my boyfriend and I have 2 cats that stay in our bedroom. We only have ever allowed them out into the house with supervision and don’t leave them out when we aren’t home or when we go to bed. They stay in our bedroom to play with their toys and climb on all of their perches and trees so that they don’t get restless. They’ve never had an issue with wanting to be let out before so we only really let them out if we decide to cook or watch tv in the living room.

Now, this morning I was woken up to the foxhound barking and shook my boyfriend awake to ask him where the cats where. He had been out in the living room watching tv because I decided to turn in early and he didn’t want to bother me. My boyfriend had taken the cats out into the living room with him and never brought them back into the bedroom when he crawled into bed this morning. I told him to go get the cats right away as I started to dress myself and he left the bedroom, returning with both cats uninvited in hand shortly after. The foxhound was barking at something else, apparently.

Now, my roommate is angry and says we’re overreacting about this and that her dog won’t harm our cats. She said we’re painting her dog to be some vicious animal and are being overprotective of our cats, but we tried to counter that even the nicest of dogs can turn on a cat when left unsupervised or even completely supervised and would be more comfortable or having our cats around the dog anymore. She insists we’re being hurtful and ridiculous about the entire situation and is making her opinion very obvious to us by acting rudely to us openly.

What can we do to make her understand that this isn’t something we want to take lightly? I’m not going to ask her to get rid of her dog, but I’d like to make her understand that our decision to protect our cats from potentially being killed isn’t simply to spite her. Her dog may never hurt our cats, but I want it to be clear that it’s not a chance I’m willing to take and that I’m not going to personally attack her dog or anything. I just want her to respect my choice while we’re here.

How can I convey this to her?

Additional Information: The chihuahua is alive, just injured and afraid. She did not take the chihuahua to the vet or administer any sort of first aid to the dog. We are looking to leave as soon as possible.",30Aug2020,1
656,"Hello, 

I live in a college town and the internet provider I have to have is horrendous. This company is the only one my apartment complex has. The company almost has a monopoly on the internet here as they cover the majority of the city as there are no other options. 

To give you the gist, the internet constantly goes out. Time can vary from 5 minutes to six hours. 

When I'm not using my computer for homework, I am gaming with my buddies. The internet is somewhat stable I guess, I do get lag spikes but it's not the end of the world. 

My issue is 1) I pay $65 a month for the most basic plan (the speeds were ok and it's just me in my apartment).The internet goes from the router to my computer via ethernet. 

2) as said before, the internet constantly goes out, time varying. I'd say it goes out for 5 to 10 minutes at least 4 times a week, and the massive outages that happen 2 to 3 times a month, lasting for at minimum 6 hours. 

I was wondering how to approach the service provider as this has been going on for about a year now and I am really starting to get fed up with it. The only redeeming quality the company has is their consumer service on the phone.

He  says that i will never study abroad (i live in a country that doesn't  have good education institutes/universities). whenever i try to talk  about my feelings he calls me crazy again and  just ignores me the whole  time.

662,"

About a year ago me and my girlfriend started an open relationship. We wanted to experiment with our sex life. It went well for a good amount of time. We had rules and communicated with each other.
However about 6 months ago I met a girl, (we'll call her Alice) and started sleeping with her. She started to get close to me, I felt uncomfortable on how this was evolving and my girlfriend agreed I need to break it off. I promised her I would. I still wanted to be friends with Alice since she felt like she didn't connect with many people. Bad choice. I ended up seeing Alice with then intent of playing video gsmes with her. She ended up kissing me and I just let one thing to another happen and we slept with eachother agian. After I left I felt so sick and disgusted with myself I called my girlfriend and told her what happened. Obviously she was upset and had every right to end things with me right then and there. But after about 2 months of talking and a bit of therapy we ended up staying together. We are now exclusively monogamous and our relationship has been stronger since. 

I asked my girlfriend if she was still angry about what happened and she insists that she's not and for the most part I believe her. I did a lot to change after that day for both her and my sake.

669,"Hello reddit, 

19 year old male here originally from India but grew up in Dubai my entire life, and now studying in an American university on the East coast. (Sophomore year) 

So today, during dinner, I told my parents the kind of college experience I would like to have. The standard: partying, drinking( but always responsibly), relationships and so on, but assuring them that academics always stays on top. (I've been in college for two semesters and have an overall GPA of 3.67, plan to maintain a 3.5+ throughout all my semesters) 

I want to live life in an enjoyable way, and realize that this is the only time I'm surrounded by people my age(both same and opposite sex), but my parents strongly disapprove. They think that these matters are only ""extra"" and can distract you from academics. They panicked when I said I want to start dating, and I'm fucking 19. They say I should wait until I get my first job, and find someone in the work place. (which is at 24 lmao)

Majority of my friends are having the time of their lives, including my Asian friends, but they don't tell shit to their parents. Now since I love my parents and hate lying to them, I wanted to have this conversation upfront. They said they would be very hurt if I did anything of such sorts, and my dad said he might cut funding to sustain myself abroad, I highly doubt he'd go to such extents though. 

I must say, my parents have been very supportive of all my other endeavors, in the sense I can hangout with friends(regardless of their gender) whenever I want, and they've also given me complete liberty to chose my academic field. They also eagerly buy good clothes and whatever else I need, so I'm very very grateful.

I have been going to my school for my whole life and have a pretty good friend group, however I always thought about how things would be if I didn't have those friends.
This year I am a senior and I am being forced to take art class because I'm an idiot and during my high school time I didn't really remember my credits and stuff like that.
Art class is a predominantly Freshman class and I don't know any of them. I remember my freshman year I knew this really cool senior in one of my classes who got along with every freshman and sophomore, but his fellow seniors and juniors didn't really feel one way or another about him. But I'm not really sure how he became so cool with us. 
One thing I'm afraid of in my art class is that it's gonna be awkward for me. Extremely. Considering I checked around and no one has this class with me. Everytime I try to make conversation or fit in, I feel like I am just a leech who somehow was given permission to attach to a group of people and do nothing but take up space and be slightly annoying.
Really what I'm asking is how do I fit in? I'm not a social butterfly and it's hard for me to make friends on my own. If anyone could help that would be greatly appreciated!

She told me to get my license, and I knew something was up. I worried, but tried to reassure myself that she wouldn't actually make me drive her car. Anyways she takes me an hour away, still refusing to tell me why. She asked how I felt about getting a motorcycle for my younger sibling, i told her it was an awful idea because we have no money right now, and no one would use it. She asked if i would be mad if thats what we were doing and I said yes. And I was. She's has no money to pay the bills, and has been taking money out from her retirement this month to help pay for needless renovations. She says she's doing it so I would be happy, but I'm not. I don't need any of it, and I tell her that every day but she doesn't listen.

I don't want it, I don't need it. She tries to buy my happiness. I had to drive home by following her, I got home first and went straight to bed. Still haven't spoken with her, but she spoke to my dad. He called me and said she was crying, and told me to explain. I did, and he said he told her what i was saying. It wasn't that I didn't appreciate it, but no one asked me if this was what I wanted. I haven't driven a car in 7 months but now I have two cars to manage. My mom went off at him, told him he was a bad father, that he was never around and that he spends all of his time with his girlfriend and doesn't know me or my siblings. She didn't believe him when he gave a reason for me to be upset. He said she was going to give the car to my older brother, who, the last time had a car purposefully wrecked it as a suicide attempt. She's emotionally abusive and I'm afraid she's going to hurt me. The last time we got into an argument she threw me down. I don't have anywhere to go, I don't have a job, and I'm a full-time student. When my dad called, he said in a perfect world he would still be living with me, married to my mom, and that just broke me. 

I am grateful, but she bought it to use against me later. That's what she does. ""You are so ungrateful! I buy you everything you could ever want and you still don't appreciate me."" ""You're going to regret this when i die."" I don't need anything, I need my mom.",30Aug2020,1
679,"So im at a fork in life, much like the Robert Frost version. I'm doing my final year of high school, and I need to pick something to get a bachelor's degree in. I picked science subjects for high school, and although I've always liked science and it fascinated me... I just find myself hating everything. It's confusing because I don't know if it's the subject or if it's the school atmosphere (I'd changed schools for high school). 

Because of this dislike... I'd started to come to the mentality that maybe this is a sign that things aren't what they seemed and I need to look outside of this side for my future. Because I clearly wasn't enjoying myself in this path, and also because things like photography, videos, music and more... arts subjects, I figured id do a degree in media studies/mass communication. My goal is to do something musically(music director/artist if you can call it that). Media isn't music, but hey, it's in the same sphere of things, I won't lose the spirit in me.

This seemed promising because even if I didn't know what the future would be like, I felt I'd be happy. And that's all that mattered to me.


But recently I got to meet a relative who I really respect, and his view was that I do something environmental or renewable resource related(he works in the oil sector currently). He said there's a future there and not a lot of professionals in the field currently. He also said a lot of things that honestly made sense, like all the people in my family circle being in the energy field(which would mean I had more contacts, hence more job opportunities) and he himself guaranteed me a good salary. The interesting thing about this choice is that I get to earn a pretty good amount by my mid twenties and I can pursue whatever passions I have because I'll have the money to, and I can do so with no questions from my family. Because it's my choice, my risk, not my dad's.


This is the fork im at; one path is certain to bring me money, ""happiness"", and potentially a path to come to my passion. I'll be pretty well off by an early age, I'll be free of the initial responsibilities, and I'll be in control of my life. 

The other path... I honestly don't know what I'll do after the degree. I don't even know what side of the media industry I'll work in. Picking science for high school meant I couldn't get a taste of the subjects media has to offer. The path is clear up until I pick media, but the rest is uncertain.

680,"so there’s this girl that i love talking to everyday. we would facetime and talk for hours. and since she’s 6 hours ahead, she stays up until she sleeps off. a couple days ago, she got really sick and i’ve been sitting on the phone with her, taking care of her and making sure she’s okay. i’m not always the one to come up with something to talk about, since i never know what exactly to talk about. lately, we would get on the phone and not say anything the whole time. she would get on her laptop and watch endless shows. i’m used to her always bringing something up. her life is was more interesting than mine. when i do talk, it’s either the same shit or she doesn’t keep up with the conversation. she’s just been super quiet and refuses to talk. and my anxiety won’t allow me to start up a conversation cause i know she won’t be interested in it. idk what to do or say. i really like her and the feeling is mutual with her but i feel like she’s starting to get tired of me. and maybe bored of me.

684,"To put this into perspective I’m 18. I moved to this small town for this girl. Moved here with my mom and my brother years ago but I had the most pull in choosing where we lived and I chose this town because we had a good house deal and the girl I’d been dating long distance for a year was here. Long story short we aren’t together any more. 5 year journey ended 4 days ago now. I’m thinking there’s no point in me staying here now. I was here pretty much just for her.

685,"Hi. I;ve been struggling lately with the reality of the hole I put myself in. I'm 30 years old and have spent most of my adult life alone. Never had a gf, still a virgin, and don't really have a social life. I won't go into the details on how I ended up this way, just know that I put myself in this situation. I had BDD and thought things about myself that no one else saw. 

I'm back in school finishing my degree this fall, and that's the one positive change I'm making in my life. I live alone and have lived alone my entire adult life, and not socializing much while being alone all the time can drive you crazy. I live close to my family, but not close to them bc I go through periods where I don't want to be around anyone due to low self-esteem/confidence. That has made it impossible to get close to anyone cause I'm not reliable enough and never take the first step. 

I just hate how much of my life I've wasted and it feels too late to start now. Creating a social life at 30 is not just not possible. I do have a few good friends I see occasionally, but they have their own big social circle that I'm not part of. I have no social media and that places me at a disadvantage for meeting women. I'm not ugly and do take care of myself, but I constantly say to myself whats the point. 

On days I feel good about myself and ready to get out there, I literally have no options to socialize/meet up with people. I would kill to have a girl I could call/text to get dinner with or just hang out. But I feel in order to do that, I first need a social life. I've been alone for so many years and accepted that as my reality, but I'm tired of it and honestly can't do this anymore. I need a life as not having one is driving me insane. I can't live this way anymore",30Aug2020,1

688,"I am starting a new course tomorrow and I got an e-mail from my professor (which was sent out to every person in class obviously) which stated that we exclusively need to have our videos on during classes and whoever doesn’t will be targeted with “tougher” questions.

My reasons for not wanting to have my camera on are mostly because I’m insecure and the thought of 60 people staring at me gives me mad anxiety and I don’t know how i’ll be able to focus and absorb any knowledge. I know it doesn’t seem like a valid reason, but I have been bullied through all of high school and mostly made fun of my looks, so the fact that anybody can take a screenshot of me makes me feel really uncomfortable, especially due to the fact that there is a group of people I for sure know don’t like me and would do something like this (which I cannot really disclose to my professor as it is an evident-less accusation of what might sound very superficial to a 60 year old man). 

Another reason is that I had an oral examination through zoom (in a different subject), was completely prepared and ready to ace it, but once it was my turn, my mind went completely blank and i could not say a thing - literal sweat was dripping down my forehead. I was too nervous which my professor noticed and thankfully asked everyone else to leave and let me complete. 

I know all of this might probably sound very unreasonable to everyone that reads this, but ever since i got that e-mail i have been anxious and nervous about tomorrow.

690,"I was at a birthday party with my friend named Bo( my best friend) Bailey(his birthday) and brock which idk why we invited brock because we barely know him, we smoked a lot and all that really happened was brock being very annoying, then, i’m sitting on the couch with Bo when i bump his arm because he kept chewing his hot ramen in my ear, he did it like 6 times before that and eventually i gave him a very light, but blind shoulder bump on his arm, he splattered a very small but painful amount of soup/ ramen on him, which burned him. i said sorry because when i shouldered him, i didn’t look over to see the cup of ramen was still very full.



sorry if i’m getting off track, but next thing happens, i go did that really burn you lemme feel how hot it is, so i stick my finger out to feel it a little bit, and instead of him holding it out for me, he puts the cup upside over my lap and gives me 2nd/3rd degree burns on my stomach, i haven’t cried in a year or so, but this was so painful i couldn’t hold it in, instead of him saying sorry, he randomly started bringing up how the whole day i’ve been annoying, and brought up that i kept trying to wrestle him earlier, which i was but he was laughing super hard and fighting back. he also brought up how i’m so clumsy and i leave stuff at his house, even though he always leaves things at my house, and why would he care if i left stuff at his house, at this point he was clearly grabbing for an excuse for acting out on his clear anger problems, He usually doesn’t use things against me but he also brought up things about my insecurities since he’s the only one i talk to about them.

The girlfriend of my best friend texted me telling the police went to the party and as i know that my girlfriend has panic attacks i called her (the gf of my bff) because my girlfriend didn't have battery on her phone.
Everything was alright, the police just went because of the loud music and told them to be More quiet because we live in a small city in Argentina.
My girlfriend told me to keep awake because she was coming home, so i did.
It was 4:30 AM when she told me that, but she didn't come so i called the gf of my bff again at 5:20 and my bff answered telling me that ""it's everything alright, i am being toxic and that i should let my gf have fun"", then he cut the call, but i heard my gf at the back telling him to give her the phone.
Something was not alright but i thought ""it's everything okay probably i should go to sleep"", but i couldn't, so at 8:00 AM i called again and told my gf to come back, i already called a taxi for her AND again, my bff was telling me ""oh come on man you are an asshole you made your gf sad"" and more blablabla for making me feel bad for it, when she came she was drugged and drunk, crying, and told me if that it wasn't for me they would have raped her.
There were only 4 people including my gf in there, my gf, my bff, my bff's gf, and another friend of mine.
She told me that both of them AND THE GIRL, told her to put the clothes out and that he was telling her to suck his dick, she refused, but he kept touching her on her vagina so she felt really bad, she tried to avoid him but he kept doing that with the other guy, and they forced her to kiss the girl and my bff, then i called and the taxi arrived so she came.
So, this is it, my bff Is like a ""gangster"" in our city so he has friends with guns and a lot of guys who just love to fight, while i am only me by myself, what can i do?
I already told his dad, who lives in another city, and told me that they will kick him out of his home, but i want more, and i don't have any proof of the abuse, only the panic attack that my girlfriend had when she came home, crying and telling me to please don't end our relationship, i honestly believe her at 99% because i know my bff is like that, but i don't know what to do, i really don't, and i feel useless.

698,"I'll try to keep this short.  My (32) sister's (Gina,  37) boyfriend (Jim 43) is awful.  He is very abrasive and makes rude comments all the time.  It seems he's one of those people who thrives on making others uncomfortable.  I dislike what he says most of the time, but I try and just ignore it as does the rest of my family.   I know my husband (Ron, 35) is dying to tell him off, but I've asked him not to simply to keep the peace at family gatherings.  Ron agrees, but it's not easy... for any of us.  Most of the things Jim says are shitty, but whatever.   The thing that really bothers me the most is when he makes fun of my mom (63).  She has multiple sclerosis, which has left her disabled.  She doesn't walk well, has issues with memory, and shakes when standing still.  For her whole life, our family and her sometimes joke and make light of her disability, in Mom's view laughing about it is better than crying about it.  The jokes we've always made are things like, ""uh oh, don't make her laugh or we'll have to carry her"" if she starts laughing while walking, lighthearted silliness that always gets her laughing more.    

The problem with Jim is that his jokes aren't lighthearted, and it feels like he's just being mean.  He's said things to me that are just gross, he once said something sexual about her shaking and it was disgusting.  I started crying and told him I didn't like it when he said things like that and to please stop.  It was just Gina, Jim, and me in this instance and neither of them see a problem with this.  I explained how upset that kind of thing makes me, but he's the kind to have an answer for anything when you disagree with him.  There's no making him understand anything!  He says that nothing is offensive, and people need to grow a thinker skin. 

Gina and Jim were at my Mom's house yesterday.  He was being his normal self, and mom was ignoring it and trying to make the best of it.  At the end of the visit, my mom said she was standing by the table and doing the shaking thing that she does which is a relatively recent worsening of her condition that she feels embarrassed about.  He asked her if she was trying to dance for him.  Mom said to me today that she really hates it when he talks like that.  I apologised and told her that I once did try and talk to him but of course he brushed it off.  She said to just let it go, but I'm getting to the point where I feel like I have to try to say something again.  I spoke with Ron, and he agrees but we're both worried that it'll turn bad if we do.  I don't want to ruin my relationship with Gina.  She's annoying, but a good person and I love her.    

I just don't know what to do!  Anything I say to him doesn't matter, he doesn't care.  I asked him how he would feel if the tables were turned, and he said he'd be fine with it.  He apparently makes fun of everyone, and has gotten punched in the face before even, but it doesn't faze him in the slightest.

 I could go to an art college because I love art but I really wanna keep art as a hobby. My ideal job would be to live off YouTube but that's probably not gonna happen.

700,"\*Sigh\* Where to start... I have a boyfriend, and I love him very much. We've been LDR for quite some time now. Lately he's been reciprocating negately to certain feelings.  For example, if he notices I'm not ok, he'll ask, I'll answer that I am in fact alright (Most of the times I am) - He'll proceed to not believe me and act cold, as if he doesn't ""care"". He'll start liking left and right lewd pictures (hentai). My guess with this last part is that he knows it will show up on my feed, I don't use twitter that much, therefore I don't follow a lot of accounts, maybe that's why likes of other users will usually appear on my feed. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've told him before that this affects me a bit. I always felt weird since last time I told him, because he asked me if it was an ultimatum, to which I replied that I wasn't. He assured me that it was just art, and that he isn't liking irl pics so it's different. I kinda get it, because it didn't bother me before, I actually watch hentai myself, but with my current self-steem it was affecting me to see what my boyfriend likes. In the end I told him to just tone it down a bit, that I didn't wanted him to stop following things on twitter, specially fucking **drawings**. For me this is something I have to improve with my self-steem.

&amp;#x200B;

But, why is it that lately every time he's cold-distant for whatever reason he has to search the most lewds pictures? The other day a cosplayer and a fully hentai pic showed up, I just closed my twitter account to avoid seeing those pics and ""help him"". I feel like he is doing this on purpose. I don't know how to help, and this attitute is starting to get to me. Am I ""Stealing"" his happiness? He is so happy with his friends; I am more serious, and I just don't feel adequate or good enough. 

&amp;#x200B;

He used to have a friend, who he thought was hot. They went out until 2.30 am one day, and when he came back he was legitimately happy. I don't think he's like that with me... I am not that fun to hangout with, not that chatty, not that energetic. My body type is... not good. My legs have cellulitis, and I know I'm not his body type; when we were only friends he told me he liked asian-type, and short-haired girls with ass. I am, honestly nowhere close to that.

&amp;#x200B;

Last month or so he hasn't been wanting to be intimate (phone sex, folks). I've even wondered if he's interested in someone new at his work. There's this new friend he mentions everynow and then that pulls pranks on him.

702," 

I met a guy on this discord, we are basically brothers. We treat each other like it, we love each other and we even met irl when we found out we're from the same country. But here's the thing:

He got a new PC, and started to get into the PCMR comunity, spending all day playing games (and working when he has to) and talking and laughing with his friends, and doesn't give me any attention (or rather, rarely does so.)

I really feel sad because we used to be so close and now I feel like I'm less important than a random ass game. As well as his friends. I'm supposed to be his closest friend and brother, yet he spends more time with other people (that are his friends).

I really feel like I did something wrong even though he says I didn't, I really miss the times where we'd meet and talk everyday all day, instead of me messaging him ""Morning!"" (he doesn't live with me) and him just being already awake for 2 hours playing games with his friends and me waiting 5 hours until he takes a break just for a ""Hello""

""Why don't you play games with him?""

Whenever I invite him, he just DM's me in game ""sry im with friends""

I know I am also wrong. He has a life, a stressful one indeed, and games are his ""escape"". But before his PC, ***I*** used to be his escape, and I really mis those times... I also get extremely angry and have a mix of feelings I can't describe when he's with someone else other than me.

And that specifically is what I want to fix about myself... Anyone that had this problem can tell me how they worked it out? I don't feel like this mix of bad feelings I get is not good, at all.

PS: If you could give me tips on how to work around this relationship I'd also appreciate it!

&amp;#x200B;

Some common stuff people tell me:

""Ur being clingy""

 I also asked him about that. I asked him ""hey am I too clingy? I feel like I'm annoying u"" he said ""No don't worry! U're not ckingy. even if u were, i'd love u anyway!"" Either way I toned down my activity with him, just to make sure, and it's all the same. 

""he has life other than u and urself""

 I did talk about that in the post. I know about that, and I accept it. I just hate the side of my personality that doesnt, and I want to fix it.

706,"Hello. My Aunt has been a small business owner for her entire life. She's a freelance artist that mainly does restorations, but also customizes logos for t-shirts and other merchandise. A year ago, our hometown was becoming overrun with gang violence and grief as many children were being lost to violence and substance abuse. She created a logo utilizing the HS's logo (has no copyright) and customized it. She created a symbolic design to represent the unity within our community. I do not believe she ever patented the design since she was not really using it for profit. Come now, someone stole her exact design because there's no trademark to it, and has been selling it on t-shirts and other merchandise for extremely high prices. His reasoning being ""Since she used the HS's logo, then I should be able to use her logo. I'll take it down if she takes it down"". Which is extremely frustrating. She used a free, public logo, and designed it herself for a positive purpose. She hasn't just copied and pasted their logo for profit. And this guy is using it for profit. Since she has no copyright to it, is there anything we can do? Its terrible. She is so distraught, seeing her work being sold  by someone else. Do we have any options? Is there any way to report his business?",30Aug2020,1
707,"(Also posted in r/mentalhealth )

My mom never took me to the doctor growing up, due to expenses. She wasn't my biological mother, and i never knew my bio mom so i know nothing about her family and what their medical history is. My bio dad only has epilepsy.

Growing up, I always had difficulties keeping my attention on anything and this caused me to struggle through school. I had and still have an overactive imagination (i'm a cartoonist after all, i'm constantly thinking of new ideas), but even when i tried my best to focus on something the information would go in one ear and out the other, i struggle to retain information. This is still plaguing me now, as i was let go from a job due to ""listening problems"". I'd constantly forget what i was told to do or how to do something and come back to my manager asking how to do something again despite being shown how to do it plenty of times. 

I've had diagnosed depression throughout my life (and thankfully its gotten much better), and i always thought that was to blame for my shortcomings. I'm highly disorganized and always messy, i'm extremely shy and get overwhelmed by crowds, and i cannot keep my attention on a single task without getting distracted. Hell, even when i'm drawing i often will start coloring the drawing before having even finished sketching it out because i can't stay focused on one thing. Some days i'm just not motivated to do anything at all, and i don't. Then i grow angry with myself later for not doing anything and wasting time.

I don't want to screw up another job and i'm tired of feeling like i've had some sort of disorder my whole life thats prevented me from living my life to the fullest. Does anyone know what this might be? Yeah i could just google it, but my symptoms coincide with quite a few mental disorders.",30Aug2020,1
708,"I broke up with him thinking that the problems we had weren’t able to be solved. I really thought all the differences we had were deal breakers. Then I realized it was just a lot of miscommunication on both ends and that our differences are what make us so special. He taught me things I never would have learned without him. I wake up everyday missing him. But i didn’t tell him that. I said I needed time, but we were each other’s best friend so we continued to text. I’ve been taking this time to take care of myself and work on my own issues. I was going to wait until I was completely better mentally before telling him I wanted to work things out. 

He’s been having an incredibly hard time without me. I feel so guilty. He has been so sad everyday since the break up. I know it. And I feel so selfish for pushing him away to work on myself. 

Like I said, I do want to work things out, but I was giving it time. Then last night he called me sobbing and told me that our kitten got run over by a car. He was everything to us. We got him as a one week old. We raised him from the very beginning and watched him grow up. He was 16 weeks old. I have a pic on my profile if you want to see him. We fell in love with him. It gives me comfort to know that he passed immediately. 

What breaks me up inside is knowing how much pain he’s in. I told him last night over the phone that I wanted to be there for him, that I wanted to work things out eventually, but of course he didn’t want to hear it. It was all just too much for him and he said he’s the one who needs space for now which I’m going to respect. 

There are a lot of feelings of guilt on my end. Shame for how I handled our breakup. Guilt for breaking up with him and not considering his feelings. But I really thought it was best in the moment. Guilt for not telling him I wanted to work things out sooner. Now he’s dealing with the loss of our pet alone. I hope he can use this time to heal himself and work on his feelings, but he tends to bottle things up which concerns me. And the loss of our kitten really hurts right now.

714,"So every year for my siblings birthday we all hide each others gifts and make some sort of scavenger hunt, it’s sort of become tradition for us to do at this point. 

I spent 3 hours making clues and planning out where to hide things, learning different ciphers and codes so my little sister could solve them. I gave her the clues today which is the day before her birthday so that she would have time to solve them and wouldn’t feel pressured to do it quickly.

I’m in a really shitty mental state at the moment and it took a lot out of me to do it as I would much rather lay in bed and fucking cry and worry about the many anxiety’s in my life at the moment (the most overwhelming being that a really good friend of mine has just gone ghost for 5 days straight without telling anyone, it’s really really unlike her)

And when my little sister started complaining saying it was too hard or it was stupid and she didn’t wanna do it, I just felt absolutely broken. And when I tried to tell her this was something I worked really hard on and tried to make fun she only replied with “I didn’t make you spend 3 hours on it, so it’s your fault”

We stopped halfway through the clues and she decided she wanted to do them “later” I’m not too sure when later is. There were only 10 clues and I didn’t think any of them where super hard or anything like that.

So now I’m sitting in my room, crying and feeling like an absolute failure. I tried my best at something and really pushed myself and all I got in return is sobbing and wanting to hurt myself. I’ve already been on edge of a breakdown for awhile and this is just another thing piling on top of it.

715,"So, I’ve (22F) been going through a rough patch recently with my depression. I have a friend (24M) who has the best of intentions but often doesn’t seem to have a clue about how to act or what to say to someone struggling with depression. I’ve tried voicing my needs, when he says something unhelpful I speak up and let him know, but I always always do my best to address it calmly and in a way that won’t make him feel attacked or defensive. I’ll explicitly say things like, “I’m not mad at you, it’s not your fault, you did nothing wrong, just wanting to let you know for the future, this is a learning curve for both of us.” And yet he still gets defensive and upset and he’s telling me he feels like he can’t do anything right with me and he’s always walking on eggshells. Now I also feel like I’m walking on eggshells when I want to voice my needs because it’ll make him upset.

It’s also draining me to be his sole educator on how to support someone with depression. I want to help each other through this but I also feel like it’s not my job to educate him, especially when I’m already drained as a baseline from the depression.

Then he started saying how he’s always tried his best, he’s always had good intentions, he’s always been there for me. He’s defending his character as if I called these things into question, which I NEVER did and always tried to be extremely clear that I wasn’t. I feel like it changes the conversation, makes it about him, and puts me in the position of having to reassure him, and makes me feel like I should apologize to him even when I know I have nothing to apologize for.

He’s the person I talk to the least about this stuff because I know he’s not well suited to help me, and I’ve told him several times I don’t want his advice but he still gives his unsolicited advice anyways. He finally said he won’t give advice anymore but he was very defensive as if he was offended that someone could possibly not want his advice.

This is someone who is very close to me and I never thought of him as a manipulative person. But now I’m feeling manipulated and questioning how emotionally mature of a person he really is. Thoughts?",30Aug2020,1

A player in our D&amp;D group has come out as trans (mtf), and we've all been very supportive of this change. That said, we've noticed that she now refuses to play any male characters, going so far as to change the gender of male characters she has made previously.

On the one hand it doesn't really matter what gender her characters are but it does feel somewhat immersion breaking that all of her characters are either retconned as females or spontaneously transitioning along with her, especially since there are plenty of instances of people playing characters of different gender than the player.

Is this something we should just let go? I do get not wanting to pretend to be male after finally making the decision to stop doing that in real life but it is sad to see some of these iconic characters of hers being abandoned or changed.",30Aug2020,1
720,"I moved to a city in the south west of england when I was 18 to study at a university, I moved back to my hometown 2 years later to start all over again, I visited the city weekly to see my now ex. 

We broke up a day before lockdown so I couldn’t visit the city which i had done for the last 2/3 years, I couldn’t even leave home to soothe the heartbreak just had to stay at home and wallow so i don’t know if i miss my old city or i miss him. 

Due to COVID, my university lectures are solely online for the next year, so this would be a great time to live in the city for a year. I used to really enjoy being in one city for half the week and the other for the other half (usually 60%/40%).

I have already secured a job in both cities, same company but I don’t know if I should just stay in my hometown and visit the other city whenever I can or take the job in the other city just because I genuinely love the city and really miss being there.

I don’t want this to be long so I compiled a list of pros and cons of moving to the other city (120 miles from my hometown).

Pros 
- I’ll feel happy again 
- I’d live within walking distance of the job
- It’d be Very easy to stick with the job (due to certain issues i’ve had, because i’d be living alone for the work days, it’d be 10x easier for me to actually go to the job than if there were other people in the house)
- Id get to travel each week between the two cities (i ABSOLUTELY LOVED the 3 hour journeys coach journeys, even more than the one hour train journey)
- When would I ever get to do this (this pandemic has made it possible)

**Cons**
1. Might miss ex and feel super sad
2. I’d Spend an extra £400 on air bnb a month from £1400/1500(part time job in the morning, id study in the evening) 
3. I wouldn’t be able to adopt a dog with my family like how I really wanted to(the dog might even help me get over my ex quicker)
4. I’d feel like i wouldve abandoned mum and sister even though i’d visit them for the other half of the week

**TLDR; My university is going to be fully online this year so is it worth me accepting a job in a city i used to live in just to be happy again and visit my family on the weekends or should i just accept a job in the city i live in (where my family are) Also i don’t know if me wanting to move back is low key me wanting to be closer to my ex**",30Aug2020,1
721,"My life has changed so much since 8th grade. My mother (39F) are so rude to me (15F) every day, but is so nice to my brother (9M) and she thinks it's normal. My dad (45M) always stands up to me when my mom is mean or rude to me, but nice to my brother. If my father stands up for me, and my mom knows she was wrong, she wil get a story from the past of me, and use it against me. My brother comes away with anything he wants, but if it was me, I'll be dead by my mother. I do a lit in the house, like clean the house, fold up washing, do the dishes, and help my brother with homework or if he struggles with something.

My mom complains 24/7 that she does al the work in the house and she's so tired, but she's al day long on her phone busy with ""Work"", but she talks all day with her friends, then she gets rude to me and my dad for no reason at all. If she gets rude like this, I go and do everything she complains about. I can't even visit my boyfriend (17M) for a weekend without hearing about the house that I should clean, and go home, or something. Every time I go to my boyfriend, sge keeps saying sge misses me so much and wants me at home. But I know she doesn't mean it, she just wants me to clean the house or something.

I was this weekend at my boyfriend to celebrate his mother's birthday (28 August, Friday) , I couldn't even sleep the whole weekend at my boyfriend, because I had to come home to clean the house, but I came home on 29 August, Saturday, and I didn't even do the house. The moment I came home Saturday, my mom was very mean and I cried in front of her and she said she's sorry and that she knows she's fucked up and wil leace me alone because she makes everyone negative and every thing. I didn't reply my mother, I just went and sit outside alone and cried. My dad came and gave me a hug and said everything will be ok. I felt better after that hug from my dad. But my mom is the same again today (30 August, Sunday).

My mom is also that type of person who will tell everyone the negative stuff about me, like I'm lazy and likes to sleep and never want to spend time with the family and I never help in the house or stuff like that. And that breaks me when she tells people that behind my back. She will tell me I'm stupid or I should use my brain when I make a mistake or did something wrong. She is always mean to me and it's getting worse by the day, and I just can't take it anymore.

Can someone please give me advise on what to do on this situation, I would appreciate it. Thank you &lt;3",30Aug2020,1

I went online to see what the number was and stumbled upon who easy and I typed the number in and a global map popped up and started to pinpoint location of the number with a bar going to 100 to specify it was done.

726,"This post is going to be long as I will try to provide all the issues that I felt were there in our three months long friendship. 

We both bonded over talking about the abuse we faced in our previous relationships. In fact I helped her break up with her toxic ex of almost 10 years. After her breakup we started talking daily as she needed a lot of support and I wanted to provide it for her but there were some things which she used to do that made me uncomfortable. She would want me to text her good morning every day otherwise she would get upset, expected me to keep her in sync regarding what I am doing, once she got upset and asked me to placate her in a cute way and voice (like one would to their SO), gave me too much info regarding her and her ex's sex life when she was horny, sent me suggestive pics, would say things like ""you're so nice I can't get enough of you"" with A LOT of heart and kiss emojis. Twice or thrice she said ""If you were bi we would have had sex"" (she's bi) which made me really uncomfortable so I decided to talk to her. She said that she was only being friendly as she is learning to be ""openly bi in her friendhips"" but if all of this is making me uncomfortable she will stop and she did except for the good morning texts and her wanting talk to me every day and knowing beforehand whether I will be available or not (which she hardly respected and constantly texted me even after knowing I am busy for which I had to had another talk).

After this conversation she soon started talking about how she feels she wants to die and once when I told her I was missing my mother (my mother died last December) she sent me a very disturbing text saying ""And for mom related issues, if you physically see me tying a knot on my throat and going to hang myself on the fan, still reach out. I'll delay suicide okay?"" I asked her if she is doing okay as she has talked like this more than once and I can even help her find professional help. She said no she was just exaggerating and if she really felt suicidal she would definitely seek help. 

I felt like she was completely emotionally dependent on me. I tried helping her in any way I could. On her request I used to call her every morning to wake her up because she couldn't do it herself, I suggested and even helped in making a to-do list so that she could feel a little productive as she repeatedly told me she can't do anything, listened to her rant about how she was the victim of her circumstances, how she can't do anything, how every one she met in her life including friends were abusive to her, or anything she wanted to get off her chest. These conversations would happen every second day and soon became boring for me as I never got the chance to say anything except ""hmmm, yes, I understand, okay etc."" Even when I called her because of some issue I was facing it would turn into her telling me what I should do with my feelings instead of listening to me. 

One day she was again telling me on texts how she can't do anything and doesn't even feel like talking and how she doesn't have any friends, the guy she trusted the most gaslighted her till the end and how she is alone. I sent her a text saying she should try to do something about it instead of always succumbing to the feeling of being the victim and suggested her some things that she can do. I was very polite in my message but she took great offense and became very rude to me. I was very upset as I've never been rude to her even if her actions made me angry. I always took time to collect my thoughts before talking to her about any issue as I was sympathetic to her condition and didn't want to cause her any more stress. I'd like to accept that when I read her message I was't emotionally stable as I had just comforted my father who crying thinking he couldn't save our mother. She didn't know about this but she knew what I had been dealing with at home and I expected her to be understanding. I told her that I understand I could've been wrong in saying that and I apologise but I won't accept her rude behavior. She then went on accusing me of gaslighting her and being homophobic (she's bi) among other things. I told her that she should think about why all her friendships fail. She's the common denominator and not every person she meets is a piece of trash. Then I went completely no contact with her and blocked her from everywhere. 

She's trying to reach out to me again and has been apologising. Yesterday she mailed me saying what I did was emotionally abusive as I knew she was going through immense emotional pain and I let her be attached to myself by saying things she could call me whenever she felt like callng her ex and provided her support which she didn't ask for. (She obviously didn't outrigtly ask for support but said things like how she doesn't have a support system at all and seeing her alone made me empathetic and I offered my support to her). She further said that I gave more chances to my abusive ex than her and coldly withdrew my support in her most difficult period over a single fight. (For me it wasn't on a single fight. She accused me of a lot of terrible stuff and I don't want to be friends with someone who thinks of me like that especially someone with whom I've been nothing but kind and supportive). But after reading all of this I am feeling guilty. I want to knw if I was an a**hole in this situation and if yes was it justified? And if I was wrong should I reach out to her and apologise for how I handled the fight?

727,"Let's say a man is below average in all three to the same extent. ie. 3-4/10 face if 5/10 is average, \~5'7"" which is bottom 30% height, and Indian/Asian race. Which of these is the biggest problem, and if you are getting no matches or likes on dating apps, what should you focus on fixing most?

Here are my thoughts:

**1) Race**

I think this is the #1 most important to women because one Tinder experiment found a top global Asian male model gets only 1/3 as many messages as an average white guy. So if even the best looking guy of a given race on earth can't outperform an average white guy it shows pretty clearly it's #1 and nothing can beat it.

**Solution:** The only solution for this though is the hardest. You have to learn a new language and move to a country with very few white men or high poverty rates. Not easy to uproot your life and start over somewhere else. But likely the only way to really fix it.

**2) Face**

I think face comes second because online dating apps are also all about your face. If they don't like your face you get no right swipe and no chance.

**Solutions:** This one is easier to fix but still hard. Good surgeries for men include nose jobs, jaw (mandibular angle) implants, hair transplants, forehead reductions, jaw surgery, chin surgery (implant/genioplasty). I've had some plastic surgery for example, and while I still struggle, it did definitely improve my outcomes.

**3) Height**

Between 5'7"" and even 5'10"" or so it will not necessarily be obvious how tall you are in your pics. That's why I think this is least important. Yes it's true many women will be disgusted if you show up to a date short, but at least you got to the date which is almost impossible if you fail #1 &amp; #2, so I still think this is least important.

**Solutions:** Leg lengthening surgery. Need to be off work 3-6 months and pay $100-200K so not easy either. Probably same difficulty overall as #2 to fix.

I think other things like physique don't matter. Most women say they don't care if men are muscular or not. I've not noticed any difference. Money doesn't seem to matter either (try listing a fancy job title and see if anything changes - it won't). Personality doesn't actually matter since you can't show it off in 3-5 pictures and everyone has the same 3-5 pictures now.

I think it also goes without saying if you do any of these things you can't tell women, since women say they find any man who openly does any of these things unattractive. They want you to be tall, beautiful, and desirable naturally with no effort, so if you have to work for it, you just have to keep it  to yourself.

Weve been ""dating"" for a bit over a month and we are extremely intimate and comfortable with one another. The problem arises with the fact that it doesnt seem like she really cares about me more than one of her dozens of friends. She says she loves me, we have sex, and genuinely have a good time just hanging out but she still gives me empty answers about beginning a relationship. She goes as far as telling other people she is absolutely not in a relationship even though she knows I really want to be in one and it hurts.

Before all of this happened I was able to at least enjoy my hobbies and be relatively care free, but now nothing in life gives me even the slightest enjoyment except being with her, and I know full well shes only going to hurt me in the end.

734,"First for a little bit of backstory, at my college I work for a pre-orientation program for incoming freshmen, so it's often my job to be kind to freshman (of course) and to answer any questions or concerns they may have about college. Normally it's great, but our most recent program has just ended and me and this freshman from the program have been talking over Snapchat ever since. It started out fine: he was really nice, asked me about myself, and was overall a really good conversationalist. 

But recently, today in fact, he's been getting more and more pushy. By that I mean he's being more and more adamant about us chatting over discord or on the phone (I imagine he'd rather it be in person, but I am learning remotely this semester), and it's making me uncomfortable. I know that is not in any way his intention, my best guess is that he's just lonely and nervous about making new friends, which I totally understand! But I have my own group of friends that I have much more fun talking too. I also have my own set of responsibilities, and I just can't afford to be talking with him every weekend for 3-4 hours at a time. I know that sounds really mean, and that's why I don't want to tell him that because he's only a freshmen and I know that I would be devastated if an upperclassmen I've only just started talking to suddenly told me to leave them alone.

Another reason why I don't want to tell him that is that I'm worried what other people will say. This also requires a bit of backstory. During the second semester of my freshmen year, me and two friends of mine had a bit of an altercation that resulted in us no longer speaking. The details don't really matter seeing as we've both gotten over it for the most part. But later in the semester me and other one of my friends that I have been talking to since I first arrived on campus stopped speaking to me out of nowhere. It was so sudden and so unexpected. I am not sure what I did and I am afraid to ask them why they no longer wish to speak to me (if any of you have an opinion about what I should do concerning that situation, please let me know). But I am worried that if I told the freshmen all of this, they would stop speaking to me as well. I like to think that I am a nice and caring person, but I don't think I would be able to handle loosing that many close friends in such a short period of time. 

I guess I'm just trying to ask what I should do, and if I am being too mean. Am I being hysterical or is he being creepy? I am supposed to be nice to freshmen and do not wish to anger any more people than I already have. I want to be nice to everyone, but at the same time I want to look after myself. Let me know your thoughts! Thank you so much everyone, and sorry for such a long post.",30Aug2020,1

I need some advice on how to get stronger bones on an advanced level. I am not sure if I should go to the doctor, because I don't want to get a random injection for stronger bones.

He appeared to be homosexuel, but then after he left I got pretty intoxicsted and said super homophobic shit to my friend about his brother. Immediately after I said the things I said, I realized immediately after that I said sum fucked up shit, and then my friend kicked me out. 

Note: I'm really not homophobic, I have lgbqt friends and I respect them a lot, its just stuff pops into my head a lot and I impulsively say it out loud weather its a good thing or a bad thing.

739,"So my parents and I have never really had a good relationship. When I was young, it was just yelling and physical fights. As I have gotten older, it is name calling and yelling and screaming as well as being threatened to get kicked out. I have been told no one will ever love me. That I will never be able to make it on my own. Any terrible thing you could think of has probably been said. As well as my mom basically losing her mind and being scared for my life for years. She has moved out a few years ago but I still live with my dad. From all of this, I have been diagnosed with PTSD and go to therapy.

My mental health has been depleting more lately. I am not sure how I get out. I have looked at apartments and they are all slightly more than I can realistically afford. 

I feel terrible because my boyfriend feels like it is his fault that he can’t help me get out. He has a part time internship which should hopefully turn into a full time job.

My boyfriend has suggested that I live with him and his parents, but I am afraid of the problems it might cause. I don’t want anyone to feel sorry for me or give me handouts. I am also just scared to leave and somehow be forced to come back. I know my dad will be angry and berate me and I am scared I will lose my health insurance because of this.

740,"Hold on, guys, this is a long rant. TL;DR at bottom. I know this isn't a scandal or otherwise dramatic post, I just really feel like I need to vent because this pisses me off and I need some outside advice.

My ex best friend (let's call him Eli) and I have known each other for a long time. We went to middle and high school together, and though I moved to another country for 4 years during middle and the start of high school, he remembered me when I came back and we immediately became close again.


We would go to each other's place and did homework together, and once he got a car, he would pick me up to drive to school together. Eli more than once lied to me about where he was during the drive to school, resulting in me having to at one point wait in minus temperatures for 45 minutes before he turned up. This was mainly due to him either oversleeping or waiting for another school colleague whom he had a crush on, who would also catch a ride with us on multiple occasions (who by the way would also oversleep relatively often). 


So yes, you may say, why did you keep relying on Eli even though you knew he would turn up late? Well quite frankly, it was so that I didn't hurt his feelings, and at that point in time, turning up late to class wasn't my biggest worry.


Eli would often copy my homework, and when I would ask whether I could do the same he would make the excuse that I ""can't forge homework as well"" as he could, and would refuse. Quite often I felt as if my charity was being abused, but then I remembered the times he gave me a ride and I would forget about it again. 


Then Eli started stacking up debt with me. He would ask to borrow money for things such as lunch (even though his mother gave him lunch money, which he spent on cigarettes and weed) or petrol, claiming that it ""wouldn't hurt"" if I gave him something in return for the ""taxi service"" (which by the way was maybe 1.5 kilometres a day IF THAT). He would also bring the ""taxi service"" up if I ever dared to ask for my money back. All in all I estimate that by now he owes me over €200 (about 240 USD) for various things. 


About a year ago he made a BIG mistake. The person he had a crush on (let's call them Riley) became interested in Eli, and even though Eli was in a relationship at that time, he legitimised his behaviour  with Riley by referencing his apparently ""failing relationship"" and that he needed ""some proper love again"". He told me he would never get sexual with Riley, because he respected them too much, but would proceed to tell me how he kissed Riley the following weekend. This didn't really bother me as he has gone back on his word multiple times.


What DID bother me was that I went to Eli's (by now) ex a few months after and asked what had happened, and discovered that they had broken up because of ""differences"". When I asked what differences, I was told everything: how Eli had cheated with his crush (had sex etc) and only 3 weeks later informed his now ex of what he did. I was shocked and saddened that he had once again lied to me about something, but this time it was serious.


I refused to communicate with Eli after that for about half a year, after which he hit me up once day and asked whether he could apologise because he finally realised what he did. I said yes and he proceeded to give every excuse under the sun for what he did and cried dramatically to top it off, expecting me to take it as an apology as usual. And by this point I thought, fuck it, it doesn't matter anyway. So we were good again, and he came around often, mostly to smoke a joint with me, and then leave again. He would do this and nothing else, and by the start of 2020 I was sick of it, and quite glad that Covid would give me a break from him.


At the end of quarantine (End of April in my country) we met up again, and he told me he wanted me to have his iPad, as he thought I would be able to be more productive with it than him (i.e. drawing etc.). He was very attached to the iPad and I was surprised by this, but I agreed. And I've had the iPad since then. I've had lots of fun with it and have enjoyed drawing on it a lot more than traditional paper.


Now, that's not the end of it. Because I have been in a bad family relationship with my father since March, I was in quite a bad place until about the middle of August, where I managed to pull myself out of it. During that time, I pretty much relied on my partner and doing art for support and found both were comforting. However there was one thing that wasn't. Eli. I told him I was in a bad place, yet he would spam me with calls and messages at the worst hours about when we could meet up next (presumably to smoke weed and nothing else) and when I did agree to him coming around he would stare at his phone. I felt like I was talking to a brick wall.


Then I stopped answering his texts. He would ring my brother while my brother was at work, asking for weed and wanting to know why I wouldn't reply. My brother started hating him for it because he wouldn't stop doing this, even after pleading. He would accuse me of abusing our friendship just to have the iPad, how I was hurting him by not communicating with him, and many other things I don't think need to be mentioned as they are just too absurd.


After I heard of these accusations, I addressed them and told him we could make a day to meet up, as I was moving house at the time and didn't have much time. That day was supposed to be yesterday. He didn't ring or text. I waited all day for an answer because he said he would get in touch. I was going to give him the iPad back then as well. I feel like I could've done more a lot sooner, so I accept criticism against my own behaviour as well.



TL;DR: my ex best friend lent me his iPad, he and I have a conflicted past, he owes me money and he accused me of certain things, some of which are frankly untrue and unfair, and that at a time when I was feeling really down. Should I cut contact with him entirely or give him another chance? Or is there something else I could do?",30Aug2020,1
741,I’ve had a crush on this dude for about 7-8 years now and I don’t know what to do.

742,"Me and my ex broke up quite a while ago, ultimately she said that she didn't feel the same as when we first met and that she couldn't deal with the stress of a relationship at the time.

I figured over time I would get over her and life would go back to normal but that never happened, I still think about her all the time, I dream about her every other night, and I feel really guilty about it. We started talking again recently over text, I told myself that we're just friends but I'm completely hung up on her.

744, Hey. Something weird is happening. Around a week ago i was at a resturant I had a pepsi and I drank it a bit too fast. I felt sick and needed to throw up. (im 10 btw) but we were outside for a hour and the closest i got to throwing up was gagging and then gas coming out. After that i went in the car and i suddenly felt better when we started driving. And the next day i felt sick in the hotel but i went in the car and it stopped. We went home and now for the past week i keep feeling sick and then it goes away (most times after eating or drinking) and theres 2 ways to stop it 1. sitting on the toilet 2. driving in a car (we dont have a car anymore because it was a rental) so can someone tell me what this is and how to stop it and how long will it take to go away.,30Aug2020,1

746,"My ex (M 20) and I (F 20) broke up about a week ago, I broke up with him, and surprisingly it went amicably based on our past. 
We decided to stay close after our breakup. We were very, very codependent and so were having a hard time detaching. Up until last night we were still spending the night with each other. 

We’ve grown so much together the past 7 months. He has extreme mental health disorders (schizoaffective, borderline, bipolar 1) and I myself have borderline. He recently started medications which has been very taxing, and I think he was taking the breakup harder than he led on. Last night he completely broke down after having seemed totally fine the entire day, and I mean he ASKED ME TO HIT HIM WITH HIS CAR. He was so, so down. He kept saying “this time feels different”, but also he once faked a suicide attempt to manipulate me in the past. At the same time I’m NOT writing him off because I know this is an extremely serious matter.

Today his dad made me leave his house because I’m preventing him from being able to get better (I do agree with that). I’m so scared though because I’m afraid he was being serious about the suicide idealizations and now that he doesn’t have me around, the chances would be SIGNIFICANTLY higher that he’d follow through. 

Seeing his teary face as I drove out of the driveway, his dad standing between us telling me to leave and for him to go inside, broke my fucking heart. Now I’m left in the dark, I have no idea how he’s doing. How the actual fuck do I cope with this. I can’t get that last image of him crying out of my mind as I left on such a sad note literally just being ripped away from him as I’m trying to tell him he’s going to be ok.

748,"Hey guys,

So my girlfriend and I have been together for over 3 years now. I’ve known for a while that my mom suffers from Huntington’s disease (A hereditary disease that affects the nervous system, causing you to deteriorate slowly and basically end up with the cognitive ability of a baby again) this means that I have a 50% chance of inheriting the disease later in my life. 
I’m told my girlfriend about it a few months ago (I waited this long as it’s something sensitive that I don’t usually tell people). She’s been rather overwhelmed ever since. She said she’s finding it hard to cope with the fact that she might lose me and that’s making her vision of the future blurry. She’s since been trying really hard to come to terms with this and get over it. I can always take a test to check if I actually have it. But we both agreed that wouldn’t be the best way. We want to come to terms with whatever awaits. 
In the midst of all this, I find our relationship balance has been thrown off. Do you guys have any advise on how we can deal with this? I’m totally fine with giving her all the space she needs to come to terms with this.

753,"Hello guys! I would like your opinion in this situation. I got married 2 years ago, because of financial situation we had lived in my mother's house for 1 year until we moved out and the relationship between my family and wife had got really bad in that year. Before that we were bf and GF for 5 years and everything was fine but now is worse. Both of us had been working from M-F since 5:45 am (wake up time) to 5 Pm (arrival to home time), when we get home of course we are really tired and on weekends we do laundry, cleaning, cooking, meal planning and some relaxing time but my mother and family they gets together almost every weekend and they are always asking us to go, every single weekends 

I had told them that we can go once or twice a month to visit them (30 min away) but they always have some kind of activities (birthdays, festival days...etc). We have tried to explain to them that now we have our own responsibilities and we don't have enough free time to visit then weekly because we also want our own time. They just tells us that that's no excuse for example one cousin told us that her husband works really hard from 5am to 6pm and he always had time to visit her daughter...etc. but when I visit my mother for 3 hours for example she said that that visit is too short and she is ""hungry"" to see me and I should spend a least one whole day with her. 

Now with the covid situation, things has been getting worse, I haven't visit them for 3-4 months already because me and my wife havent stopped working and we deal with different people and since we don't know when we could carry the virus  we haven't paid a visit to them. They haven't stopped to meet, they tell me that using a mask is enough that they separate 6 feet away...etc, but I'm just worried about me having a possibility of getting them infected, what they told me is that I can a least visit them and see them from my car at the parking lot. Which for me it doesn't make sense, but all of them says the same and it makes us feel like we are in the wrong. I tell them we can just video chat, why we have to travel there to see them from the outside it doesn't make sense to me. 
In the year we have been living apart, we have told them several times they can visit us any time they want just to let us know, they haven't visited us once but we always to to visit them.

My family is basically 3 houses, mother, one cousins and another. My mother and my cousins doesn't work, only their husbands. They love to gossip but lately they have been telling me that if I really love them I should a least go to visit them from the parking lot. I have been feeling really bad due to this. Any advice?

754,"My parents are very strict and won’t let me move in with my gf unless we’re married. I don’t want to marry her just for the sake of moving in together! They help with my student debt so I feel obligated to listen to them. I even clean their house every weekend giving up my fridays saturdays and Sundays (I live in a dorm). I have a good relationship with them now and scared to risk it. I could say I live with my friends elsewhere and hide the condo that I will be moving in to with my gf. But I bet my parents will do random check ups on me (random FaceTimes, stopping by, etc) but my friends live like 10 mins away. BTW I have already sign lease for the condo. Or I lie and say I live alone. If I say I live alone, they will suspect my gf will stay with me and I’m worried they will try to come over and see her stuff). I’m not even sure they will let me live alone in the first place (will say it’s waste of money, not safe, etc) I don’t actually want to live alone either bc it will be a waste of money for my gf and it’s too expensive for me pay rent alone.

Why can’t they just let me be happy and do what I want. I’m an adult (21) and shouldn’t have to stress so much about where I’m living that I’m paying for myself!!

755,"I am taking two elective classes, but I only need one, so I'm planning to drop one. But I don't know which one to drop.

Class 1 is about 1-3 hours of work a week, and is practically an easy A with a very nice professor. However, lectures aren't recorded so I have to spend additional time in the class for another 3 hours per week (divided into two days)

Class 2 is comparatively less work. Two 5 pg essays and one final exam where the professor said he'd give us all the answers beforehand on a study sheet. I don't like writing essays, but I like how all the work in concentrated into just a few assignments instead of an assignment every week. About 70 percent of people get As in class by comparison of 95 percent for Class 1.

I would pick class 2 over class 1 besides one small issue. The professor is very right wing and very angry. The right wing thing I could deal with if he wasn't so angry.

757,"I suspect my girlfriend of 2.5 years to have borderline personality disorder (BPD). She was diagnosed with C-PTSD, but - after I told her - she says herself that she shows 4 of the 9 PBD traits. Most prominently abandonment issues and anger issues.

&amp;#x200B;

The first year of our relationship was mostly amazing. After that she had to moved across country to another city due to a job. Things got more difficult then because she can't really handle being alone. She insisted on me moving to her city and looking for a job there. My previous contract ended a few months ago, so I wouldn't have to quit a job at least. In my current city (my hometown) however, there is my family and friends, so I was hesitant to move. Moving is scary for me, definitely a problem I have. Also due to my research, there are some more attractive jobs for me in my city. I didn't get a job in either city so far, but also didn't apply to many.

Due to my hesitancy, she got less happy in the relationship, which I can understand.

We had some fights and short breakups before, however one week ago, it escalated. She found out that I was writing somewhat negatively about her to a friend on WhatsApp (she searched my messages). I mostly complained that she was stressing me out. I understand now that this is not a good thing to do in a relationship.  

This triggered a rage. She ran away with my phone and - when I caught up with her, she smashed it completely. After that she went to her appartment and started throwing out my stuff, kicking me out and telling me to get lost and that she never wanted to see me again. 

I talked to her and asked her if we could talk calmly about it. After a while, she agreed, but demanded to search my laptop for messages where I speak badly about her. She searched all folders and unfortunately found some porn. She considers watching porn cheating, so this blew everything up more and starte an even worse rage. She wanted to break my laptop - I managed to take it away from her before she managed to do. She then hit me and managed to grab and destroy my glasses. I then went away with my stuff and slept in a hotel. I was very shocked. The next day I went home with the train.

&amp;#x200B;

I am very sad that things went this way. I understand that she got upset, but am shocked by the violence. I still love her and can't really imagine a future without her. 

We since got back to talking (after I had to apologize several times). She says she still loves me, but thinks we should stop talking and seeing each other since I'm not willing to move to her city.

I don't know what to do. Moving seems very risky, since our relationship is in a bad place at the moment. Also her friends probably don't like me, because she told some about this episode. On the other hand staying in my city will make me leave with a broken heart. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone have advice? Do you recognize any patterns? Do you think this relationship is still salvagable? Or is the current somewhat better state just a short phase before it goes down again?

tl;dr: I messed up recently, causing a rage. Does it make sense to try and fix things?",30Aug2020,1
758,"Hi,

My father is a paranoid schizophrenic man in his 50s and has had the condition since I was 11 years old, having irregular stints of employment when he was still medicated. The current situation is that he lives a foreign country (spain) and is still a citizen of my home country (northern europe) meaning that it is not possible to have him put into involuntary treatment. I have no idea how he survives as he is probably not employed, but he does seem to have some kind of permanent place where he is living. The only real way that he is interrupting my daily life is through emails that he sends, but other than that he is/has never been of any real harm and he does not have violent tendencies. The real question here is what should I do in this kind of situation? I feel obligated to help my father in some way but it is really hard to come up with a long-term game plan.",30Aug2020,1
759,"First for a little bit of backstory, at my college I work for a pre-orientation program for incoming freshmen, so it's often my job to be kind to freshman (of course) and to answer any questions or concerns they may have about college. Normally it's great, but our most recent program has just ended and me and this freshman from the program have been talking over Snapchat ever since. It started out fine: he was really nice, asked me about myself, and was overall a really good conversationalist.

But recently, today in fact, he's been getting more and more pushy. By that I mean he's being more and more adamant about us chatting over discord or on the phone (I imagine he'd rather it be in person, but I am learning remotely this semester), and it's making me uncomfortable. I know that is not in any way his intention, my best guess is that he's just lonely and nervous about making new friends, which I totally understand! But I have my own group of friends that I have much more fun talking too. I also have my own set of responsibilities, and I just can't afford to be talking with him every weekend for 3-4 hours at a time. I know that sounds really mean, and that's why I don't want to tell him that because he's only a freshmen and I know that I would be devastated if an upperclassmen I've only just started talking to suddenly told me to leave them alone.

Another reason why I don't want to tell him that is that I'm worried what other people will say. This also requires a bit of backstory. During the second semester of my freshmen year, me and two friends of mine had a bit of an altercation that resulted in us no longer speaking. The details don't really matter seeing as we've both gotten over it for the most part. But later in the semester me and other one of my friends that I have been talking to since I first arrived on campus stopped speaking to me out of nowhere. It was so sudden and so unexpected. I am not sure what I did and I am afraid to ask them why they no longer wish to speak to me (if any of you have an opinion about what I should do concerning that situation, please let me know). But I am worried that if I told the freshmen all of this, they would stop speaking to me as well. I like to think that I am a nice and caring person, but I don't think I would be able to handle loosing that many close friends in such a short period of time.

I guess I'm just trying to ask what I should do, and if I am being too mean. I am supposed to be nice to freshmen and do not wish to anger any more people than I already have. I want to be nice to everyone, but at the same time I want to look after myself. Am I being mean or is this freshman being creepy? Let me know your thoughts! Thank you so much everyone, and sorry for such a long post.",30Aug2020,1
760,"Just an FYI. I've never had a girlfriend and because of that, I don't know how relationships work. At work my manager who's also my friend started dating a co-worker who's also my friend.

I'm not into girls that are taken and while I admit that she is pretty, I'd never ever do that.

I got there and it’s the smallest thing ever, looks like a 3 week old kitten. I take him home, feed him, bathe him, and he just fell into me, even though he was so fearful of the new place and people, slept together, and had a great day. 

Fast forward the next morning, I’m laying with him and he just starts to die. He took a poop and laid in it, vomited everything I’ve given him since the day before, and just went still. I held him crying and he just started howling in pain. I rushed him to the vet where we found out he was so small from being malnourished, he was actually 8 weeks old, he was septic, anemic, and had barely a chance- I was devastated. 

Some random lady with a rescue from Facebook paid his vet bill in full, we were in contact about the kitten as soon as I got it, as I immediately wanted to give it a home. An absolute angel. He survived and I’m medicating him, hoping he’ll make it, but I’m so attached to him that I cry every time thinking that he’ll eventually have to go. Because I can’t keep anymore pets. I wish I was in a better financial situation because I just felt like I met my best friend, he’s always sleeping on my face and cries when I leave and it just rips me up.

768,"I (27m), my Sister (30f) , and my brother(31m) inherited our childhood home in northern Kentucky from our father who passed in 2014. We all three inherited even 1/3rd shares of the home, thus we are all responsible for 1/3rd of the cost and upkeep of said home. The three of us live in the home together. My sister and I get along and communicate well, but our brother has extremely volatile issues with anger, and he has basically zero ability to communicate with anyone that disagrees with him. He sees himself as very much superior to everyone else in his life, and is very demeaning to my sister and I. 

That would be manageable for us, as he has always had these issues. However, in recent years, he has taken to the idea that he doesn't need, or want a job. He relies on our mother for food and transportation. He refuses to help us with bills, maintenance costs, yard-work, or cleaning. When he is approached about these issues, regardless of the tact used, he instantly becomes furious, and becomes dangerous to be around. He has 5 cats that he leaves for me or my sister to care for, often times going days without buying them food. Two of these cats are female, and not fixed, and he insists that the go outside where they have each been impregnated twice. 

The house is completely paid off, and is in an area that we all enjoy. We do not want to sell if he is the main issue causing us to consider that option. We either want him to pull his own weight by getting a job, and helping us when the need arises, or to move out on his own. The home offers him a security net he cannot get anywhere else. 

We love him dearly, but drastic changes need to happen, and with his anger he is very volatile to have serious conversations with. What would you think is the best course of action for us to consider?

In a chat he let us know he had taken the cat home. Our Vice-President, and the one who is the leader for the day camps and runs a lot of programs for the kids, said in a work group chat:

770,"Sorry for any grammar mistakes that happened. I typed this very fast before having to pretend nothing is wrong. 

For a while my family hasn't felt like a family. We were never a perfect family but its never been this ""broken"" before. My dad(46) is a very 'men work women clean' kind of guy and my mom(46) has always taught us kids that is correct. My mom has had serious neck issues. She takes strong medication for this and because of this she doesn't act the same. 

My parents have always started they didn't want to end up like their own moms because one is super ditzy and hard to talk to and the other is full of hate and actually cut out of our lives because of it.(she mentally abused my mother for years till my dad came in and took her away). 

It seems like my mother is turning into both, dizty and mean. My sister(26) and I(23) have learned to keep our heads down and do what we are told when told. My brother(17) is very head strong and will call them out on things that he doesn't find right. Now that my sister has moved out on her own for 5 years. When I ask her for advice she agrees that some of the stuff we have learned are toxic traits that became normal for her and I. 

My father is also seeing how different she has changed. He has tried talking to her but she just starts being hateful. Even now my dad has started to help clean and go more out of his way so she doesn't pick a fight. Everyoje comes to me when alone and talks to me. But im not sure what my next step it. My mom for the last 3 years have talked about how unhappy she is with my father. I've told her this whole time that she needs to talk to him and if it comes down to it. She can get divorce since she is so unhappy. My father not once has mentioned about divorce.

The last 4 months my mom has not ate a proper meal. She has been eating gallons of ice cream and cereal. We all have told her she needs to eat a balanced meal and stop eating so bad. She tells us she's an adult and can do what she wants. My mother has stopped picking up. To the point where we are cleaning up 4 gallons of ice cream buckets off the counter because she doesn't throw it away every few days. She has been even more mean and hateful and we now can't even have a conversation without her going off about something. 

Shes also been very paranoid where she pops up out of nowhere accusing us of talking about her. The last few days I was staying with my sister since we had things to do this weekend. My brother had sent me a message last night telling me how much he hates when I'm gone because then she yells at him and doesn't know when to stop. I let him rant and had talked to my older sister about it and had decided we needed to talk to her soon about it. Especially because ill be leaving out of the country for school the beginning of next year. 

This morning I woke up to my phone being blown up from my mom saying that she's going to clean the house and she's going to leave for a while. My father and brother came to my sisters because we play dnd every sunday. They told us that she started fighting again and my brother told her things that she has been doing that bothers him. My father had backed my brother up and because of this she told them that she was going to go to California and will be gone for a couple of weeks. She asked if I wanted to go. Even though we have family plans this next month to go to California and a camping trip. 

When my father got here. He had mentioned that if she leaves he thinks hes going to file for divorce. I told him that maybe we should have a counselor check on her and her medication. Its the first time he has metioned divorce and even though he mentioned it. He expressed that he's worried about what will happen since she doesn't work. I understand where he is coming from since she has been this way for a long time. Im a person that runs on emotions a lot and im trying to look at it in a better perspective. 

My sister and brother had took me to the side before starting dnd to tell me not to do anything rash.

772,"I’m trying to figure out if this is abuse or not. Right now my parents are separated and mom is living a few hours away with friends so I’m living with my dad. I now can figure out why she left. 

My dad refuses to clean at all. My sisters and I do all the cooking, cleaning, caring for the pets, and grocery shopping (although we had to beg him to let us do this or else he’d buy the same things every week and make dinner difficult to cook). Sometimes he’ll say we’re lazy if we don’t clean the house for a day (but we usually do the next day) and ungrateful. He’s taken to saying he won’t buy us groceries or give us money unless we do this extensive list of chores. He literally said “I won’t buy you food if your stuff isn’t done.”

We ask him to at least do the dishes while we are with our mother and he won’t. Once we were gone for a week and we came back and the pet bowls had maggots in them and another time we were gone for the weekend, came back and there were maggots in the sink. Sometimes he doesn’t come home or come homes super late. We ask him where he’s been and he yells at us saying it’s none of our business. 

A few days ago we got into a fight because we asked him to at least help us clean and to respect us. He said: he doesn’t have to respect us, our relationship will never work if we don’t listen to him, manipulation is fine if it’s a bartering tactic, we’re attacking him, we’re all emotional so he can’t talk to us (which we weren’t but if our voices raised, he’d mock us), we need to work harder, and we’re the kids and he’s the parent. 

Other times it feels like he’s our roommate. He gets home, goes to his room and won’t really interact with us or just have dinner with us then go in his room for the rest of the night. It’s not like we don’t make an effort, I do ask him to play games but he’ll say “maybe later” or that he’s not feeling it. 

TLDR: My dad expects us to do all the cooking and cleaning and refuses to help, insults us when we don’t, says he won’t respect us, manipulates us by saying he won’t buy groceries if we don’t clean, and otherwise doesn’t really talk to us too much.",30Aug2020,1

774,"This is kinda tricky to explain so I'll try to keep it to the point and brief, but this will most likely be lengthy so I can properly explain everything and vent it... Thank you so much for your patience in reading this.

Some names and genders have been swapped for privacy.

I apologize so much ahead of time. I know this will come off incredibly melodramatic, but it's an experience that hurt me so much that it almost took my life from me, so I hope you can excuse this.

**In 2016 I joined Twitter.**

I was new to Twitter, making new friends. Before this, I was mostly alone, had one friend, I was quiet and too depressed to do anything social beforehand. I wanted to force myself to branch out and meet new people.

**I then met someone incredibly special to me.** We'll call him ""Jake"", I followed him one day on Twitter. Deciding to message him, we became good friends pretty quick. We found out that we lived just an hour from each other. As we kept talking, we found out that we were very similar and got along super well. It wasn't long before crushes developed. Unfortunately, things didn't work out. Something was happening that I didn't know about at the time. **I'll get back to that later... (Labeled with \*\*\*)**

Being friends with Jake, I met a ton of new super cool people. I was finally talking to people! This was so huge for me; I was finally acting normal. One day, one of Jake's friends **Ryan** sent me a private message.

Looking back on it, I should have known his intentions even from the beginning were not genuine...

He started slow, he would come into my DMs, ask how I was, then slip in some sexual remark.

Me, being desperate and horny at the time, I reluctantly went along with it. A lot of times not knowing how to respond, I'd reply back with vague statements.

It escalated. It went from a statement here and there to full on sexual talk. He'd come into my DMs telling me he was ""about to ejaculate"" and that ""I was such a sexy bitch"" almost every day.

He started initiating roleplay. The whole time I did it I felt sick to my stomach. I knew to some extent he was using me, but I didn't fight it, I wanted to be like by someone.

He would slip in sly compliments to me, in retrospect almost in a grooming way. Like, ""oh you're so beautiful"" with ""I want to fuck your obese ass"" shortly after.

This continued for awhile.

Eventually he started trying to **press me into a relationship**. I was stern in telling him no, but he kept persisting no matter what I did or said. He would keep typing out long paragraphs professing his love for me and how much he needed me. I tried to lay out that I was just interested in being his friend, but he kept trying to push it.

During the time we spoke, he would keep pressuring me for pictures of my body. I ashamedly sent a few. Later, I discovered that he was saving these pictures, and when he invited myself and another mutual twitter friend into a private chat, **I had discovered he shared at least one picture with this guy, so I could never be certain how many people saw.**

One thing that has made it incredibly hard to come out about anything, is that he also admitted multiple times **he would save every bit of our conversations**, and he would say things like, ""see, look what you said here, I should show everyone this"" so I've been incredibly scared to come out about this experience.

**Ryan would get angry with me if I was doing what I wanted and not doing what he wanted** to be doing with me. Even though I kept inviting him to play games and talk to him every day, he would guilt me over doing what I wanted and start fights.

Jake and I kept drifting further apart. I wasn't sure what was going on, but he was no longer interested, it seemed. What was once really sweet, us having comfy game time and silly talks, no longer existed. It was like a rift had been created somehow.

One day, while venting to Ryan about feeling so sad about Jake, Ryan said to me, **""you want the truth? I don't think he's interested in you anymore. he doesn't seem to care about you at all anymore. Sorry if that hurts""** to which I replied ""why would you say that?"" with him responding **""he used to reply to you all the time, he used to want to be part of your life, it seems like he lost interest in you entirely"".**

This devastated me. I was already suffering from massive clinical depression, but being told this, it crushed me. **I became suicidal. I stopped getting online, I stayed in bed for days without eating and I nearly died.** I was severely dehydrated, somehow developed kidney stones, and ended up in the ER after days of not showering. I felt the lowest I ever had.

I then decided it was time for a break. I was deeply unhappy on Twitter, I was convinced Jake wanted nothing to do with me anymore, and I felt physically nauseous around Ryan.

After about 2 months, I came back. I explained to everyone that I had suffered a mental breakdown and couldn't be around. Ryan, was back in my private messages.

One of the first things he did was send me a picture of himself ejaculating on my pictures.

I had another female friend, we'll call her ""Ana"". Ryan confessed to me that he was initiating lewd RP with her. This bothered me on a level I couldn't describe. So not only was he using me, he was doing it to others as well. **He would request pictures from Ana, and she would fulfill them. At times, he would say things like, ""she shared this, why haven't you?""**

**Awhile later, a mutual friend of ours that had blocked Ryan came to me in private messages telling me that Ryan had been telling him to leave me alone and instructing him on how to talk to me.**

I confronted Ryan, and through his own admission discovered he had been doing this. I stopped responding to him for a few days, before he confessed something awful.

\*\*\* He came into my DMs apologizing profusely, so naturally I asked him what was going on. He had confessed that... he had told Jake, **""I'm very interested in her. I'm sorry. I'm going to attempt to get her, I love her. I know this will ruin our friendship, but I need her.""** He showed me screenshots of their conversation, so there was no denying it. Jake responded upset, saying ""I don't want to stop going for her, this is the closest I've ever been to something successful, and I don't want to screw it up."" to which Ryan responded, **""Well, I guess it's a competition then"".** Ryan then went to Ana before me to ask if he should apologize to me about what he had done, and Ana said to him, ""this is disgusting, she's not a prize, she's a human adult that can make her own choices"". **Ana never came to me to tell me what Ryan had done.**

So Jake never stopped being interested in me. He convinced Jake he was going after me, and convinced me that Jake hated me. He completely isolated me.

A lot of time passed, and eventually, I severed emotional ties with both of them. I tried to leave this whole thing behind.

\---

**2 years later.**

Jake and I rarely speak, the divide between us is monumental. All we have left is friendship, however slight that is.

About 5 months ago, having mostly left that life behind, I got a peculiar message. It was from Ryan on Discord... I hate, hate, hate what I did.

He came to me to apologize. He wanted to apologize for how he had treated me back during that whole year of friendship.

Me, being the person I am, I absolved his guilt. Even though he had hurt me SO much, I didn't wanted him to suffer, so I told him, ""it's okay, I hope we can move past this"".

After 1 or 2 conversations, be began to mostly ignore me.

When I pressed him about this, he would respond to me with things like, ""Sorry, it's pretty hard to talk to 15+ people a day, so I often times forget to reply"" -or- ""I haven't been feeling it"".

After some soul searching, I discovered what the intention of apologizing to me was. It wasn't about me at all, it was nothing but an excuse to absolve his own guilt. Once he had, he tossed me aside again.

I then blocked him, ready to finally be done with him for good.

\---

**Now**

I've blocked him on nearly every platform. I'm sure by now he's noticed he's fully blocked on my Twitter accounts.

I *thought* this would be the end of it, but it wasn't. See, Ryan is still friends with every person in my friend group. Specifically, three of my closest friends are all close to him.

Every day, I watch as they compliment him, try to help him with his ""depression"". I've watched Ryan manipulate one of them into buying him game systems and other various items. Ryan keeps being a part of everything.

At times, Ryan will flirt with Jake, and I swear... I swear he does it to rub me the wrong way.

It's got to the point where I've just wanted to leave everyone behind. I've had thoughts of just abandoning it all and starting over, but... that just isn't fair.

So it's not all bad news! I eventually met a wonderful guy through the same group. We care about each other so much, and he has made me happier than words can describe, so I'm no longer lonely. I've tried to take back a part of myself I felt I had lost, and I've really been doing super well growing. I can't wait to meet him one day soon, we're so excited. But back to the matter at hand...

I tried to talk to one of our close mutual friends, we'll call him ""Vergil"". I vaguely told Vergil I could no longer have Ryan in my life, and that I blocked him. Vergil's only responses to me was, ""you've made this very awkward, because now I'm holding a secret from Ryan and I'm part of it."" followed by ""you've got your reasons, I won't pry but I respect them.

**Vergil wasn't willing to hear me out.**

\---

So here I sit, not knowing where to go. Whether I should abandon my friends entirely, or call Ryan out for the things he's done. I absolutely loathe him. Seeing him mentioned, seeing him weasel his way through my friend's fingers. Wondering how many girls he's done this to, I don't know what to do.

**So finally, my question is what I should do? Where should I go to feel alright? I don't know how to anymore.**",30Aug2020,1
776,"So, I'm kinda desperate right now. I've been having problems with my family for so many years now, but basically I feel like I reached my limit.
I'm 22, which means two years left of college but I'm stressed and depressed all the time. My dad is abusive, not only towards me (physically and emotional) but towards my mom (emotionally).
And it all begin with his drug addiction, then the alcohol and finally the side women, which I found and told my mother. Since he makes the big money, all my life is controlled by him, if I don't answer how he wants he cuts my college funding, he kicks me out of the house, he breaks my stuff all the time, till the point where I had to call the police and make a complaint. However, I can never go away with it because my grandmother (his mom) freaks out about him potentially losing his job, and what the rest of the family will think, and what would Jesus do and that kinda stuff. I'm to be honest I'm so sick of this bullshit. 
I don't have anywhere to go, nor my mom, because due to a financial problem my mom had to put everything into his name like 10 years ago, and when they decided to divorce he never passed them to her again, so we don't have a house, a car, nor any possessions in our name. 
I'm freaking out because I don't want to live with him anymore, but I don't have any possibility to rent or buy a house, nor paying for my college without having to drop out. On top of it I'm living with my grandmother now, another abusive human being that treats my dad like he's the gold baby and controls everything we do so we don't ruin her reputation.
I'm reaching my limit, I don't know what to do or where to turn to, I had like 700€ on the side for emergencies that he stole, and my hands are tied basically and I don't see how my life will turn out. I just want to be free.",30Aug2020,1
777,"I hope this is the right sub; open to recommendations to others. 

I am having a very difficult time maintaining friendships due to politics. Or, *wanting* to maintain those relationships. From extremist views, to ""ignorance is bliss"", I am struggling with rationalizing their behaviors or lack thereof. Yes, I am aware that it's probably best to find a new social circle with people who share my world views, but one of these people I'm referring to is a very dear and longtime friend of mine, the latter is my younger sister. 

I have been getting some great advice on another sub on how to cope with my friend who's seemed to adopt cultist views. I cherish our friendship and it's worth the fight for me. I am also accepting the potential loss. The main concern for me right now is my sister. 

She's never really been interested in, or had much motivation for academics. Of course, I love her regardless and admire her other abilities. We are definitely very different people, but have developed a great friendship as we've entered our 30's. Things between us have been awesome for the past 5 years, but due to current events, we are no longer on speaking terms (on both our parts). 

Below are the ""quick-and-dirty"" bullet points regarding the relationship with my sister and my own issues along with info I think is important. I know long posts can be annoying to read and I am desperate for advice, so I hope this is helpful. I am totally willing to elaborate or clarify on anything. I feel like a total asshole for some of the points made, but I also felt them necessary to get a better picture of my circumstance. Again, I love and respect my sister. Maybe I am playing the big sister role too hard. IDK. I am losing patience and want to find a way to alleviate my anger. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Barely graduated high school; no further education. Primary occupation has been in the service industry. 
* Has one child fathered by a proud Trump supporter. **I hope this does not trigger a conversation on Trump vs Biden. That is not my main intent.** 
* She is separated from her child's father for about 4 years now. She has since then made fun of him for being uninformed, obsessed with idolizing politicians, not to mention his sexist views and multiple DV arrests. **AGAIN I am NOT saying Trump supporters are all violent. I am just saying my sister has made fun of him for his undying love for the Rep party and it has been a comedic topic within my immediate family.** 
* She has made many, many, complaints about the current presidency. 
* She has never voted. 
* Not registered to vote. 
* Does not plan on voting. 
* Is not at all informed about current events or politics. Prefers SnapChat to anything else online.
* Computer illiterate. 
* Is a single mother on government funded programs (ie: Food Stamps). 
* Enrolling her child in school this year amidst COVID and has many concerns, as most all parents do. 

...So why the fuck doesn't she vote? I can't grasp this. She is totally opposed to any new information whether it be a new job, scientific discoveries, social movements, etc. If you live in a bubble, fine, live in that bubble. But how can you be a struggling, single mother, who vocally opposes the POC, yet you have absolutely NO motivation whatsoever to cast a vote? I sent her a link to register to vote and her response was, ""I don't want to vote for any clown I'm good"". Which, yeah, is kind of funny (one of her admirable traits I referred to earlier). But at what point is humor a good excuse for being intentionally uninformed and part of the silent majority? I watched her try to fill out a vaccination exemption form for her child the other day (ANOTHER issue between us...again dealing with in other subs), and not only did she chicken-peck her way through that form on the keyboard, she also clicked on a scam AD link to change her address for $60 instead of going to the official site which costs only $5. 

I try my hardest to provide as much useful information as possible, and have offered several times to give her an internet rundown, but she declines. 

Ugh. I feel sick. I am trying my best to understand her, but I can't. I don't even want to speak to her or see her. Please feel free to post any advice you may have; it is all appreciated. 

TL;DR My 33 yo sister refuses to register to vote and I am having a hard time coping. Can I convince her or is this a lost cause? Am I wrong for not wanting to speak to her?",30Aug2020,1
778,"For context: I (21F) have a disability that I'm trying to push through my doctor's to have more help with and get a further diagnosis. I've had chronic pain for 7 years and I literally can't live my life how I want to. I had to cut off a bunch of my hair, can't cook or clean for more than a few minutes, have to 'budget' my day as to what I can do like shower and leave enough time to rest. I even have to get my boyfriend to help me sometimes because I literally got to a point this year where I could not brush my hair or hold a fork without crying in pain.

Now onto the gritty. I'm not legally disabled. I'm fighting tooth and claw to get it registered so I can get the help, but without it being classed as a disability I have no ground. Thus, disability purgatory.

I'm 21, I love working, and due to my health issues my A Levels were weak as I was sick during exam period and decided university wasn't for me as long periods of writing kills me. I have been out of work for A little over 2 years now, and was actually told by my physiotherapist to stop working in the beginning while I got transferred to a specialist physiotherapist. That was 2 years ago, and back in November I felt up to starting to look again. I have looked into the job centre but they have requirements for aid that I can't meet, however if I'm classed as disabled I can, thus the fighting. Don't want benefits, just want to work.

My problem: I'm being very VERY selective as to what I apply for. I'm not capable of a lot and thus my resume is very slim. I'm a very hard worker and I volunteer weekly but I have to be so careful or I end up in a flare-up. I can't do care work, most retail, heavy lifting jobs, shelf stacking, restaurant work or barista work (was a barista/ hospitality assistant for a few months, it's what killed me in the end). I also can't work full time, so 20 hours a week with plenty of breaks/ short shifts is kinda my physical limit. I also can't drive, which limits me down to what I can apply to. Due to my health and not being able to work I haven't been able to afford to learn.


The advice I want: I want my independence back, and I want to contribute to the household more than just chores. How do I make myself marketable, even with my limitations? Are there any jobs I should look into that may be more forgiving? Am I looking at work the wrong way, and would shifting my mindset help? I've had 3 or 4 interviews, dozens of applications, but zero offers in the past 9-10 months. I know it's Covid and lots of people are applying for jobs so I want advice on how to stand out. Thanks. 

TL;DR : disabled but not legally (fighting it), want advice on how to make myself more employable. Great GCSEs, okay-ish a level (B, and an A in the epq/ mini dissertation project), but limited on what I can physically do. UK based.",30Aug2020,1
779,"Long story short. I'm 19 years old (Female), and I met this person (Non binary) somewhere around late March. They were 17 when I met them but I was STILL 18. I really liked them and they liked me back. We didn't date but we became friends with benefits. We did get intimate but it was 100% consensual. I remember one time I made it clear that if they ever felt uncomfortable, to let me know and I will stop. They were flirty and wanting to get intimate with me. In May, I turned 19. They didn't mind. In fact, they wanted to do some stuff with me on my birthday. Again, consensual. Late july is when they suddenly block me everywhere. They made alot of posts about me, trying to say that I ""groomed"" them, ""took advantage of"" them, and that I'm a ""predator"". They even leaked out a personal Instagram that I had. Ever since then my mental health has been declining alot. I feel like my life is ruined. I deleted alot of my social media. Sometimes I ask myself ""what if they're right? What if I did mess up?""
I've been feeling very suicidal. I've lost hope. I feel like people are out to get me. I don't think I can ever go back om social media because if I do, I fear that they're waiting for me just to make more allegations and ruin my life even more.
Idk what to do anymore.
I do have evidence of them flirting back, wanting to do things with me, and calling me pet names. However I'm too scared to speak up with proof when I come back because I'm worried that it could make things worse. The person can retaliate, and/or people will still blame me even with proof, being like ""well you shouldn't have done this"" you shouldn't have done that"".

I really don't know how to deal with this and recover.

NOTE: THERE WAS NO LEGAL ACTION INVOLVED NOR DO I PLAN ON IT DUE TO THE POSSIBILITY OF RETALIATION",30Aug2020,1
780,"As the title says, I’m freaking out that I may be pregnant. I can’t exactly remember when my last period was, all I know it was mid to end of July and thinking that I’ll be clear before I go on vacation in August. 

A week prior to the trip I had some spotting and it lasted until the day we left for vacation, which was August 8th. I knew that I normally would have my period a week or so after returning from the trip (the 15th). It’s now the 30th and I’m really starting to worry. 

I did have my normal hormonal breakout along my chin. I’ve taken 4 tests and all came back negative, however I know false negative tests are common and can happen when testing early. For about a week my nipples have been sensitive to the touch and I noticed today they turned white in the center (which I found out could be a result of my boobs getting ready to breastfeed). 

My boyfriend and I aren’t the most careful (no condom or birth control with pull out), so trust me I’m already beating myself up for not being more careful. He thinks I’m not pregnant and I’m just stressed out so much that it’s fucking up my cycle, as well as the traveling from the vacation could have played a part as well as that spotting I had prior to the trip. We’re gonna try to get an appointment with planned parenthood to see what the fuck is going on. Every article I have read on symptoms have been like “yeah it could be a symptom of pregnancy....or your period good luck telling which.” It’s frustrating and all I wanna do is cry. 

Am I crazy? Am I stressing myself out too much? What do I even do if I am pregnant? I’m scared of other people finding out, especially my mother because she’ll be so mad. Any mothers out there that could give me advice of what else to look out for to truly know I am other than the obvious missed period?",30Aug2020,1
781,"I (21m) am currently living at home for the next 3 weeks before I move in to a flat in a different city.

My parents have been constantly arguing in the evening. The arguments sometimes seem quite emotionally abusive, and sometimes sound as if they involve physical abuse. I know it seems obvious to report this to the police, but in my house I cannot get mobile (cell) connection to call a relevant service, and every time I start an online form, I start to freak and cancel it.
I don't know what to do in this situation, part of me wants to move locally to my grandmother for the few weeks, and minimise as much contact as possible. Part of me feels like I should report the situation, but I start to feel like an anxiety attack whenever I start to. I'm also wondering whether to wait it out, and just block it all out, and perhaps contact authorities when I move away in 3 weeks.
I feel like I can't tell anyone, I don't know why that is, but I physically can't.

793,"So this is a problem I've been having for a while now and I want to know if I should adress it or if it's normal.

To keep it short and sweet - I tend to daze off in pretty much random moments throughout the day. It does tend to happen whenever I feel bored, if I'm doing something mundane or if something in particular has been on my mind. I'm really forgetful and I tend to sometimes forget stuff only for it to hit me later on during the day.

The problem is whenever it happens while I'm talking to or just around others in general. It has caused a ""scolding"" and a displeased look more than once. All in all - an uncomfortable situation to be in.

It gets somewhat weirder though - most of the time my dazing off is pretty much me talking to someone in my head. Usually in those I zone out literally everything. Even moreso - if let's say I'm thinking about a conversation I've already had or imagining having, I always mimic the facial expressions I'd make. 

I needn't say this usually results in pretty uncomfortable situations.

To which I replied yeah straight ahead. He continued to ""coincidentally"" cross paths with me in different aisles, I didn't take much from it, and he exited with me and as I was walking back, he catches up with me and asks for sanitizer and I said no. 

He followed me till my house and just before it asked if a particular atm was nearby (he named that particular atm as if he knew the neighborhood well) 
And it infact was straight ahead!

Again stupid me didn't realise that this dude was a creep. Then as I started to head towards my home. He stops me and asks me what do I do ? To which I bluntly replied I don't, He then asks okay what's your phone number ? I then started getting a whiff that he was upto no good. I tried my best to be as strong and bold as I could be and asked what do you want ? I don't have a phone now what ? 

And tried to give him a stare and tried to show that I am not scared.

He said, we can talk and tried putting his hand on my back.

I said No! And then I headed towards my home and turned around to see if he had left. He did.

A little something about me. 

I am a pretty short dude around 5'4, never been in a fight ever. 

I live in a country, and here I have heard about a lot of molestation and groping cases from my friends they target children mostly.

And calling the cops on him is of no practical help cuz I am an immigrant here and the law is very very partial towards their citizens.

My younger brother involves himself in everyone's business. If I'm fighting with someone he says stuff like ""oh is (my name) sad? Is (my name) gonna cry? Wah wah wah..""

It's childish, stupid, and so infuriating. He says my nickname too all the time and I keep telling him to stop, but to no avail.

Then I have my older brother. He's usually fine but I fricking hate him sometimes. If I get into the smallest argument or whatever with him, he starts talking sht about me and my room is right beside his so of course I hear it all. Heck, he says it under his breathe RIGHT BESIDE YOU.

I've told him countless times that I can hear him clearly and to stop talking about others when I can hear him perfectly fine because it interupts my work and I can't even stay in my room because he's sooo loud about it.

My parents do nothing about it, just say to ""ignore it"" or they just laugh at the situation.

I don't mean to get too graphic here but the way they act (specifically my little brother) makes me feel so violent. I have a fit of rage where I want to just snap their finger or something so they learn to stop messing with me and others. 

God even right now, my older brother is talking about me and I've gone DOWNSTAIRS. I can hear him in the basement, while he's up on the top floor (3 floors).

No, I don't intend on snapping anyone's fingers or harming them in a massive way, but I wish I could figure out how to deal with all of this.

I don't have anger issues, but I'm just so sick of it all. My younger brother tells me to kill myself, says to rot in hell/etc. My older brother cusses 24/7, talks badly about me often.

I try my best to be nice person, honest. I don't do bad things, I don't act rude and I try to befriend everyone. I rarely cause fights with people/family members. I still try to get along with my brothers.

Which is why I'm kind of concerned about these thoughts I'm having. I just want to hurt them (again, specifically my younger brother) for being so frustrating, for hurting other people with their words, for just being an awful person.

But I know I wouldn't do anything too bad. I might punch them, but I'd never do any more harm than that. I just wish they could realize how awful they are.

I don't quite know how to deal with my situation, how to make them stop, how to make them leave me alone?

805,"Hi everyone, how do I start... Well, I currently live in a small town called Villingen-Schwenningen, in Germany. I used to live in London, England a couple years ago. I am 29 years old now. The reason I moved from England to Germany was major depression, due to childhood trauma and addiction. I figured if I changed my environment and take on new challenges I'll be able to overcome my issues, and I did to a certain degree. I can honestly say that am a much better, smarter person now. 

However I didn't come here in Germany with the intention to live here forever... Now that I've lived here for 4 years, am contemplating whether I should go back to England back to my family. Back to my mother's house, until I can find a place I can call my own. I really miss my siblings, I have no relatives over here, no friends. I have fallen out with my friends since they started doing drugs, am all on my own now with no job. I lost my job because of the coronavirus disease, been unemployed for 4 months now.

I really need advice, I've talked to my family in England but the only answer I got was ""It's up to you"". I was thinking about going back to college in England and learn a new profession, but at the same time am kind of embarrassed to go back to my mom at 29 years old. I also like this area where I live in right now, it's really nice. So am divided, I can't make up my mind. I am really confused... What's the right thing to do? Do I stay or do I go?

**Also, I tried to post to the covid support subreddit but it said I wasn't allowed to post there, so I've come here.**

But as the title would suggest, I'm (16x) having insane brain fog right now and I can't really focus. My concern is, I have a dissociative disorder already, and so there's a possibility that may just be getting worse for some reason.

But the main thing is, I've been being forced to go to in-person schooling with no masks required for the last two weeks. Considering my dissociation has never been this bad in my life, combined with the fact I've been in a corona-smoothie for weeks, makes me really wonder if this is the Covid brain fog symptom I've been hearing about.

But I'm asymptomatic, besides that (if it is a symptom). I know its relatively common for teenagers to be asymtompatic too, so is it possible to have only one symptom? Maybe my pre-existing dissosiative disorder was boosted by covid's brainfog? Idk.

Lost my first-ever job:

I recently lost my first-ever job fresh out of school. For where I’m from, it is extremely competitive in the working society without a university (or college) degree. I was fortunate enough to get a a job with a high-school equivalent diploma. Decided on this route instead of completing my education, didn’t want to incur a truckton of student debt from university. Wanted some relevant working experience too, before jumping back into studying. 

However a month back, things got bad at work and I chose to terminate my contract. I wasn’t laid off due to Covid-19, but there were constant conflict between myself &amp; my direct superiors. It became so bad that I couldn’t focus at work/over-stressed when I’m at home and even during the weekends. Chose to leave for a better mental well-being, but I’m not too sure if that’s the right move now. It’s close to impossible to find a new job given the current situation, and I can’t go back to university until at least mid-2021.

Lost my relationship: 

I’ve been together with my ex (22F) for a year, most amazing girl I’ve ever met. Things happened because we started growing apart when life got busier for both parties. I’m constantly occupied with my work and she is occupied with her school. Because of this, we couldn’t communicate with each other well and the typical constant bickering happened. 

Took a break from each other a month back (right about the time when I left my job), and she decided to end things with me last weekend. It was by no means a bad break up (no matter how unfortunate break-ups are), we both just had different expectations from our relationship and we were just focused on very different things at the moment. It’s a huge pity to me because I really wanted to continue working things out. We had a very mature relationship, but I guess it’s best for her to completely focus on her school for now. 


Been a long-time lurker on most advice-related subs, I’ve been reading through a lot of related situations but I don’t know how to go on from here. I understand the usuals of ‘things will get better’, ‘everything happens for a reason’, etc., but it really sucks feeling I’ve hit rock bottom in my life. I also know that things will eventually get better, but how do I get over this period? Days seem aimless with no work/school, and I lost my closest friend in the process.

Always has, always will be. Idc if he loves me or if my mom pretends he’s better he and her are both toxic as fuck.

Living at home is stressful on so many levels which isn’t helpful because I have several long-term health conditions and my parents force my animals to live outside or in the basement.

So in order to get out of this situation I have to rehome all my animals so I can afford to rent a place (which probably wouldn’t let me have them all anyway) 

Which I have spent probably thousands at this point on extremely high quality food, cages, toys, and vet care.

Sure shame me for getting animals in a bad situation but they are the only things that prevented me from commiting suicide for the 23 years I’ve lived at home and I have done nothing but try to make sure they live the best lives they can given the circumstances; plus I’ve already shamed myself enough.

In any case I have choose between my animals and living with my toxic piece of shit father and mother. Or rehome all the animals I love and move far, far away.

I have the worst self esteem and zero confidence in anything i do because im balding at 18 and am already aging in the face. Im attempting to instill positivity in my mindset and thoughts but i always think “but im not a good person or smart or likable or hard working so why do i tell myself this?”. I just feel too pathetic and mentally weak to commit to any life changing practice without giving into depression and never picking it back up again. I have no real purpose either, i have no crazy skills or good personality. Im socially withdrawn and almost always hate talking to others unless they are close to me. My dreams and goals depend on me being social but i just hate that shit so much. Ive had so many negative experiences with others to where i really do not care to meet any other new people because i know how itll end. When thinking about this too it just brings up all the memories where i fucked up and ruined relationships, which creates the thought loop in my head where im a piece of shit and dont deserve to reap rewards or good experiences. I hate comparing myself to others but i always do it anyway, my friends all had their “glo ups” per say and are already fucking a bunch of girls while i dont talk to a single one, they of course use this as leverage to feel superior to me. The problem is i know all of this is my fault as well. All of my issues are because of me and when i realize this it only makes me more depressed and angry because i know im so mentally weak that i wont take steps to fix it. Ive attempted to eat good and it helps but i always fall back in to unhealthy habits. At times i barely feel like a male and thats one of the hardest things to admit. Again i hate comparing myself to others but i see close people around me being continually blessed even when they dont put in any work. Socializing just comes easy to them and i have to either be off drugs or be forced to talk to a new person in order for it to be successful. Even now as im writing this im angry with myself because i know i have to resort to online anonymity to express how i feel cuz id be too bitch to admit it in real life. I know if i was physically confronted right now i would back down like a bitch, i know if things got tough right now id back down like a bitch and go back to drugs. The worst feeling on earth is where in your mind you can pick out all the habits and issues in your life and assign blame to yourself but are too lazy to actually fix it.

Every week its a new issue with whatever i did or some stupid shit i said. Im not well liked or thought of as a good person. I just feel like im the ultimate piece of shit and at the end of the day just a massive pussy who doesn’t have a spine. Im always the submissive bitch in a social situation and i fucking hate it, i try to be confident but when i raise my voice or become assertive all the negative thoughts about my self come back. If you guys have any experiences like this where you were able to dig yourself out and change id love to hear your story about it.

832,"My BF (26M) and I (24F) have been together for almost two years now. For context, we are both second generation South Asian. Dating before marriage is discouraged in our culture, so we had to keep our relationship a secret from our families for a while. Recently we have been discussing taking the next steps in our relationship so we decided to tell our parents. My parents were initially happy because my BF is from the same background as us, but then they learned about his father. My BF’s dad is an alcoholic who seriously injured someone in a DUI and as a result has been in prison for the past few years. He was released from prison early, started drinking again, and then was sent back. He has about a month left in his sentence. 

I figured it would be best to tell my parents about this up front, so I did, and it did not go well. They found the articles written about my BF’s dad (including pictures, which I admit were rather shocking) and it tainted their whole view of my BF and his family. Our culture is very communal and very much believes that marrying someone = marrying their family too. My parents started saying that having an alcoholic member of the family will be a huge burden for me and that we will likely have to support my BF’s father forever. Especially because my BF is an only child and wants to continue supporting his mom, who refuses to leave his dad. My BF has made it clear to me that although he does not want to cut off connections with his father completely, he doesn’t expect his dad to play a big role in our lives in the future (ie his dad will never live with us, etc). 

I tried explaining all of this to my parents. On one hand, I do understand that my BF’s father is a toxic person and that if I marry my BF, we will have to deal with a lot of challenges related to that. On the other hand, I think that my BF and I can overcome those challenges, and my BF has assured me that his father will never be my responsibility.  At the same time, my BF is an only child so I know that he will likely have to be the primary caretaker for his parents as they get older. I just don’t know how to navigate this or how to get my parents onboard. I feel stuck. 

TL;DR: my BF has a troubled father with a criminal history. My family recently learned about this and are therefore apprehensive about our relationship.",30Aug2020,1

I have been watching a lot of news and spending a lot of time on social media. People tend to be self-centered, thoughtless, rude, unpleasant, and just generally awful. And I think the news and social media outlets have uncovered the true nature of humans. I hate people. Whenever I hear of a school shooting for instance, I don't really feel sad, since people are awful. I internally rejoice in a way. I honestly don't feel bad at all. I understand public mass shootings now. Don't condone it but I at least understand it.

How can someone ever like people or have anything to do with them? How can you stand people at all? I'm afraid of my first job that I have to deal with people because I'm afraid 95 percent of my customers on any given day will be rude and unpleasant. 

This hasn't been good for me mentally obviously. It's just an uncomfortable truth I suppose. It's interesting how my perception of other people changed. I was looking at a picture of two girls on Instagram the other day. They were just looking at the camera and smiling but immediately I thought to myself that they're most likely rude, egotistical, fake bitches. I'm serious. I don't know them but that's a safe assumption. I just have to accept that people are shit (vast majority at least). So this has left me in a very unhealthy place mentally. I need healthy opposition to my view. I might need help before I really hurt people. Because I've been thinking about that.

In short, the news and the internet/social media has proven that people are terrible in general and I have noticed that my perception of others has completely changed.  This has affected my mental health and I give NOONE the benefit of the doubt anymore. I have noticed I am generally a lot less happy like this. I guess this is a call out for help.

843,"So, one day, earlier this year, my nephew and niece were watching The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water (which, I've never seen yet, so I don't know if it's good or not) on Netflix, and I walked into the living seeing how they were doing. 

And there's a scene in the movie where SpongeBob and Plankton went back in time and met there earlier selves, and that's when my niece was asking ""Which one's the real SpongeBob?"", to which I reply with ""Well, they're both the real SpongeBobs, just from different time periods"", and she was confused as hell and doesn't understand time travel at work.

And I don't really blame her, she was 6 after all, all kids tends to not understand stuff 'til they're older. But is there like a possible way to explain time travel much simply to a young child, or should I wait til they're old enough to understand it better?",30Aug2020,1

846,"I am taking two elective classes, but I only need one, so I'm planning to drop one. But I don't know which one to drop.

Class 1 is about 1-3 hours of work a week, and is practically an easy A with a very nice professor. However, lectures aren't recorded so I have to spend additional time in the class for another 3 hours per week (divided into two days)

Class 2 is comparatively less work. Two 5 pg essays and one final exam where the professor said he'd give us all the answers beforehand on a study sheet. I don't like writing essays, but I like how all the work in concentrated into just a few assignments instead of an assignment every week. About 70 percent of people get As in class by comparison of 95 percent for Class 1.

I would pick class 2 over class 1 besides one small issue. The professor is very right wing and very angry. The right wing thing I could deal with if he wasn't so angry. But sometimes during class he'll talk in a very aggressive tone and it freaks me out because it reminds of my parents who are really abusive towards me, and I feel like I have to pause the recorded lectures for the class a couple times because I feel really panicked and can't handle it. 

However, I also need all the free time I can get because I have a part time job and am asking for more hours after having financial difficulties.

On average,  I'm nice to these kids because they just dont resond when I'm to strict. My number one goal is to get them to play for themselves and not their parents. I've had many successful students, that are now professionals, but then, I have these little ones that never practice.  I'm okay with that because I think it's kids being kids, but then tiger parents get impatient and start getting on my case.   
I set a new policy banning parents from the lessons because these kids are not themselves, and it's quite distracting for me as well. Once I get to know the child, they seem to loosen up and enjoy playing.   
I have two girls,  and they seem to like me a lot, but they never practice. One is getting better with 3 lessons a week, but the other one that takes one lesson a week is finding another teacher after three years, because the parents think I'm too nice? 

I use to work with tiger parents and do everything they asked, the results would come, but then these kids would just quit after they finish a grade 10 exam which is the highest level.

851,"Hi all,

for some quick context, me and 3 other friends went to a house for the weekend (and 2 other friends came the second day), and on the second day the friend (let's call her J) got the info that her personal trainer has tested positive. J was with her trainer last about 6 days ago, and during trainings I know they aren't always standing in safe distance and wearing masks, and perhaps the trainer needs to touch J lightly for proper positioning, increasing physical contact and potential spread of COVID. J and her friend (let's call her A) who were both with us, are very close and have been together almost every day the past week. I am currently seeing A, and needless to say have gotten physically close with her this weekend, putting me at heightened risk.

I am bound to start my internship tomorrow, but am very hesitant about it due to the possibility of me potentially having COVID. If I can begin my internship online, that would be great, but I doubt it's a possibility due to the material and environment required to work.

That being said, I messaged J asking her when she is planning on getting tested so I can plan my situation with my internship, yet she refuses to get a test as she said she feels fine (we are all young people and the chances of asymptomatic progression is quite high). Of all of us 6 people, we all have a busy program (with 2 of them flying overseas in the next week!) .I would highly prefer herself to get tested and save the trouble for the 5 of us, and our respective families and close circles. Otherwise, we would *each* need to get tested next week (not this week due to chance of an insufficient incubation period) when instead she could get tested alone (she is already 6 days after potential exposure).

I feel that it is her obligation to get tested for the safety of our careers and families, but she says she won't. How do I continue from here, and keep our families and careers safe?",30Aug2020,1

853,The title says it all I’ve been in a relationship with 19 F for over 2 and a half years and am starting to have doubts on continuing the relationship. I have been dating her since high school and we currently go to the same college together. These past few weeks I feel like our relationship has taken a downward spiral and am starting to wondering if it’s even worth it to continue on with the relationship. One reason is I feel like we just don’t have fun with each other anymore and she is constantly hanging with her friends. I understood at first why she hung out with her friends a lot because we were out of college for 5 months because of covid and she never saw her friends in those 5 months. However it’s been 2 weeks now since we came back and I feel like we just haven’t hung around a lot and just don’t have the energy that we used to have when we first started dating. We also never really argue which I think is a good thing because we communicate well when we think something is wrong but sometimes I feel like we don’t communicate well enough and the tension just starts building up. Last semester she had a very rough semester and later in may she got diagnosed with a eating disorder. I have been supportive of her for getting better and eating more but not only has it taken a toll on her but it has taken a toll on me mentally. Everytime we are tougher she complains about thinking she’s eating to much or she’s to fat and I keep telling her that’s not the case at all and she’s been doing a great job at eating and getting involved more on campus and hanging with friends. I’m getting tired of her complaining about eating to much and it’s really frustrating when you see her not eat enough then complain how she didn’t get enough food an hour after we cooked supper together. I’m just really confused on how she’s feeling and whether or not out relationship is toxic and should just come to and end or if we should take a break from each other. PLEASE HELP ME!,30Aug2020,1
854,"More on this situation:

My mom was never a critical, unpleasant person until she fell into depression and that I can understand. The problem is, she also won’t listen to me assuming that I’m the child and she’s the mother, so she knows best. She’s always criticizing my actions, choices, friends, you name it. And it’s not very constructive. She also compares me to my younger self and other people from movies, my own friends, herself, the whole ordeal. But if you try to tell her that, have fun, she’ll portray you as an idiot.

Examples:

1. This morning I was feeling really moody and wanted to just talk to my best friend to help me feel better. My mom wanted to go walk and asked if I wanted to walk with her. I declined but then she guilt-tripped me and I agreed. The second we got in the car, she started ranting about how lazy and boring I am and how I never want to get out of the house. While yes, I admit I can be quite lazy when my mood drops, I most certainly won’t do it if I’m feeling okay, but she doesn’t believe me and compares me to my dad, who also doesn’t like leaving the house because he’s a workaholic. Somewhere in the conversation, she just straight up assumed “All of your friends sit at home on the computer, just like you do.” I was so upset! She’s never met all of my friends yet alone knows them!

2. My mom always tells me “Jasmine, you need to befriend smart people.” The problem is, smart people at my schools are always so difficult and arrogant that it’s almost impossible to socialize with nor befriend them. However, she turns the tables and blames it on me for not being “smart enough” or “up to their level” or even “out of their league.” And then she questions me why I’m so pessimistic and overly sensitive.

3. She assumes she knows what kind of people I befriend and why. She stereotypes my friends, so they’re either “dumb” “gamers” or “lively.” And the “lively” label has only been given to one girl named Maika who is my friend, but has drifted away (guess what? That was pinned on me too.) She always assumes my friends are low-life and have no other life outside of playing games. (I game with my best friend often, but we both have very good grades and stay on top of school.)

4. She finds a way to paint me as the problem. Once, I told her I was friendless and that the whole school was really complicated. I had just moved to a new school and it was killing me. The kids were mean, the teachers didn’t trust or like me, and she literally forbade me to talk to my bestie, so I was desperate. You know what she did? She told me that I was “weird” and that I was “needy” and “always trying to get people to like me.” Can you offer me emotional support BEFORE the criticism? Please?

5. When I cry, she thinks I’m delusional. My mom yells at me almost daily for relatively minor things, and then belittles me when I let a tear or two escape. It’s gotten so bad I’m immune to crying in public or in front of people because I’m so scared. She threatens to (and sometimes does) beat me when I cry so I bottle up my emotions. And then when I snap at her because I’ve been so stressed and angry when I’m not allowed to express my emotions, I’m disrespecting her and am therefore a bad kid.

6. When I forget something, I’m in for a lot of criticism as well. I forgot my water bottle today, and my mom did too. But when I told her I forgot, she was all “You always forget things” and “It’s because of those damn devices.” I’m literally suffering because the second I open up my phone to check the time, I’m accused of listening to music, playing video games, or surfing the internet.

F has only ever been close with V, but she felt comfortable for S pretty much instantly, which isn’t normal for her as it usually takes her a while, and her and L have developed a pretty strong relationship over time as wel. 

Me and V used to talk her enough every day but tahst stopped now and we still talk just in group chats with everyone else when it was just in DM’s. 

L and S aren’t particularly close but they’re still friends, I feel like more than I am with either of them. 

F and I are going through a bit to a rough patch atm as I did some stuff that made her uncomfortable and turn out she doesn’t even like me rn, but I’m trying to change that and I still consider her a friend. I said sorry for it and I’m trying to change but it’s just hard yk.

859," 

Hi everyone! This is something that has been eating me up for a few hours now so I thought I should see what others think to see if what I did was right or wrong. By the way, to put things in perspective I am in high school, and am very passionate about gardening. Also, I have a lot of experience gardening.

So I am doing this community garden, and in this garden, there are multiple different slots for people to take and use. Over the summer where I live, right now its been super hot (typically in the 80-90 degree Fahrenheit range). 

Every day I have been going to my garden to water it and over the past few weeks, I had noticed that his plot was not doing so well. Some of his vegetables were over ripped or extremely dried out. I thought he would eventually come to water his garden. But eventually, it didn't seem like he had for quite a while. I saw how dry his soil was in his plot and thought it wouldn't hurt to give the plants some water. 

Also I had figured he hadn’t come for quite some time since his garden looked exactly the same for quite a while. None of the rotting vegetables were removed, nor did the soil look moist. It was literally as dry as sand. In addition, he had some sunflower plants which had fallen over in a storm, and had never moved them or cleaned up. Just to make sure one final time, I came several times to the garden to check and asked many of the other gardeners as well if they had come. 

So seeing how he didn’t come, and that so many of the other Gardners also noticed how sad and dead his garden looked, I thought it wouldn’t hurt to water his garden as well. So I did, but just lightly. And within the past two weeks I only watered his garden 2 or 3 times because I didn’t want to over water it as well. 

Anyways, today I also thought to water his garden and while I was he came too. So then, I just explained to him everything how his garden looked so sad, so we thought to help out a bit. Although he didn’t get mad at us, it seemed quite obvious he wasn’t that happy. So while he was talking with us he was trying to give us some like gardening tips and stuff that he was using, but it was quite obvious his tips were bogus since his main problem was that his garden was underwater. 

Also, he claimed that he had come multiple times to the garden, but only today when he did he FINALLY moved his sunflowers. To give you some perspective theses sunflowers have been here fallen over in the middle of the path for slightly over a month now. To be honest, if he did come, there was no reason for him to clean up his dead sunflowers until today because there is an area for him to neatly dispose of it. Not even that, he could have just moved his sunflowers over neatly to the side, but they were just laying there on the ground for over several days. So I had to move them over to the side because they were blocking my path from the hose to try garden, and before moving them (because I thought he would move them) when I went to get the hose to my garden, I would get several scratches from the stems of the flowers, because they have spikes on them. After waiting a week I just decided to move them myself, because at this point it was getting very hard and frustrating to deal with them, and I was constantly getting hurt. 

So I had a feeling he was lying about coming. 

But either way, after seeing how unhappy he was I felt really bad because I didn’t mean any harm. I just wanted to help a garden in need, after so many gardeners saw how sad it looked.  I did apologize many times though just in case many times. In my mind, it was as if I was helping a child in need. If they said they were hungry and had no money, I would just immediately go help them out, not say “oh sorry I need to get permission to help you, so till then you’ll have to starve”. The same way is how I treated the garden. I felt really bad that all their hard work was going to waste, so I thought to help a little. 

Anyways, after talking to him, I felt really bad because I never thought trying to do something good would backfire so badly. I just want to get some feedback to see if I was in the wrong, or if what I did was ok? 

Thank you for reading! Sorry about ranting on so much lol.",30Aug2020,1

861,"I'm not looking for hate on my roomie, I love her a lot and I'm just trying to find a way through an issue without it becoming a massive conflict. I know the simple answer is ""just talk to her"" but I'd love some advice on how to approach it without her feeling attacked or belittled. Effective communication in this regard isn't my strong suite; I was raised by someone who's tact is non-existent so I tend toward saying nothing unless I'm 100% comfortable that my brusque approach won't be taken the wrong way.

Background: Roomie's been living with us (my partner and myself) for almost a year. She's got ADHD, depression, anxiety, and dysphoria. She's living with us financial contribution free; we're comfortable enough that this isn't an issue and I'm not interested in making it one. She's been trying to get a job so she can contribute financially but thus far that hasn't worked out. So she's home pretty much all the time, but she keeps \*very much\* to herself only coming downstairs to grab water or make herself food. Initially when she moved in my partner was elsewhere, he came back about three months after she moved in. She was really good about helping with the dishes at first. I do the bulk of the cooking, if I haven't cooked she will make herself something, but I cook for all three of us several times a week.

Over the last several months, her participation in keeping the common area (really just the kitchen, she doesn't much use the rest of the house) clean has dipped considerably. She leaves pots/pans on the stove, she's not cleaned the stove even once she's she's been here, she habitually cooks everything on such a high temperature that more than once I thought something was on fire in the kitchen when I didn't realize she was there, she gets food splatter all over the stove, she often keeps dishes/bowls/etc up in her room for quite a while before bringing them down, when they do make it down she just piles them in the sink then goes back upstairs, often with food bits still in them which is problematic b/c we don't have a disposal, and now she isn't even emptying the dishwasher or clearing out the sink. WRT the dishes it might be because she doesn't get up or come out of her room until WELL past noon most days, my partner and I are typically up before then so we just end up being the ones to deal with it so we can get breakfast made for ourselves. However, this obviously means that in addition to our own dishes (which are not few, granted) we're also doing all of hers. My final straw, so to speak, came when I was away from home for two weeks; my partner came to see me and mentioned while we were having lunch that the dishes had been sitting in the sink for over a week getting slimy and disgusting but Roomie didn't once touch them or the dishwasher. Obviously my partner is equally responsible for the situation, but I'm more frustrated because this has developed into pattern with Roomie.

My partner thinks we need to be understanding because of her mental health issues, and while I'm usually the first person to bring that up when it's relevant I feel like there's still a line where it's less about the dishes or cleaning and more about the absolute lack of contribution to the house. We don't need rent or food money, but helping to keep the areas we all use moderately clean so that they CAN be used (without needing to spend 20 minutes cleaning them up first) seems like a fair expectation for three adults sharing a house. I really need some ideas about how to approach this without making her feel cornered or attacked. I know what it's like to struggle with many of the issues she has; I have ADHD, anxiety, and deal with bouts of depression. I also know that along with ADHD is rejection sensitivity, which can cause all kinds of hateful self-flagellation about what an awful person one is.

I've gotten some suggestions from friends, but they all mostly amount to just tell her she needs to help out more, that you want the kitchen to be a bit cleaner on a regular basis, make a chore chart that everyone's on, ask her to do X chore at a given time, etc. I see potential problems with nearly all of this. It's possible (even likely) that it's my own anxiety and conflict avoidance talking; if it was my partner I'd just be like ""look, the kitchen is becoming a source of stress for me because you're not helping out enough, so i really need you to do more wrt cleaning up in there"" or ""i cooked, you need to do the dishes"". But a) I see him more than I see her (literally, she comes downstairs like twice a day when we're awake), b) my communication style isn't an issue because I'm perfectly comfortable that I'm not going to hurt his feelings or upset him by talking to him the way I do, and c) I can't use the stress card because it's not valid here, there are two of us keeping the kitchen mostly cleaned up, I just think she needs to help out more out of fairness.

Roomie already experiences a great deal of guilt for not being able to financially contribute and I don't want to make it worse, I don't want to hold over her head that she's living with us for ""free"", I don't want to exacerbate any of her mental health issues, and I don't want to treat her like a child or be parentalized myself. How can I deal with this as delicately as possible?",30Aug2020,1
863,"Hey, 

For the last couple weeks I've had crazy itching whenever I enclose my small studio apartment. I was fine for the entirety of the summer until a couple weeks ago while my AC unit was occupying my window space. But starting a couple weeks ago I was getting incredibly itchy. 

I went to see a doctor and it isn't bed bugs or scabies. He was quite confident it was that my skin was just irritable/dry and that using softer skin products like dove soap would help. Perhaps I should be using them more frequently, but it's been about 1.5 weeks and so long as my window is open I am perfectly fine. But within a couple hours of closing the window/reinstalling the AC unit I will get wicked itching again. 

My room does not have much/any air circulation. I've tried to vacuum as much dust as possible. I've gotten rid of some moldy potatoes that I had for a month too long, but I've seen no improvement. I have some suspicion that it might be something in my mattress, because I was admittedly quite lazy in reapplying the sheets for a while, so I was sleeping on a ""nude"" mattress for a little while. 

I'm just simple asking for any advice. I'm a bit at a loss as to what to do, and starting to get a bit concerned because it's going to start getting too chilly to keep my window open.",30Aug2020,1

866,"There are a few variables at play here. First off, I'm very tight. I've had trouble having intercourse with prior boyfriends and therefore never technically popped my cherry. Secondly, I have a very demanding career and work about 80 hours a week. I had to go back to work two days after our wedding. Thirdly, my husband has a low sex drive. He has a hard time getting it up and when it does come up, it doesn't stay up long enough to make any meaningful progress in terms of penetration. 

I'm not unattractive. Prior boyfriends would get hard for me all the time and I could get them to cum in various ways without a problem. Despite this, I've tried my best to be more attractive for my husband in hopes of fixing this problem. I started wearing my contact lenses again, try wearing makeup in the morning, wear nice clothes around him. I've touching him, expressing how attracted I am to him. All I get in return is him telling me how pretty he thinks I am, maybe giving me a love poke, and then getting back to what he was doing. 

We enjoy spending time together. I married him because I love him. We have fun together, we laugh, we listen to one another, we care for one another. We have a great life honestly. 

He isn't gay. Out of desperation, I went so far as to try watching porn with him and the only thing that somewhat turned him one was girl on girl action. The moment a man comes in the shit, he gets soft. He's denied being gay even when I told him I wouldn't judge or leave him if he were. Honestly, I believe him. He is definitely heterosexual. 

I've tried dilators to help loosen myself up. I'm trying to convince him to see a doctor but he insists that since I'm a doctor, he doesn't need to see someone else (the logic here is terrible).

867,"i got into a fight w my family because my 30 year old brother kept saying the n word. my mother defended him so i left the house and went to my apartment (20f). i hate getting into arguments with my brother because he has serious anger issues and always flips a switch and becomes a foaming at the mouth animal over any small thing, so i left because already i knew i had caused too much trouble. i wrote to them later to express exactly how i felt about their casual racism and my brother asked me to come back and speak to him, so i did. immediately he started arguing with me about how when im mad im overly emotional and i acknowledged it and said ""okay yes noted lets move on to what im actually mad about now"" and he brought it back 3 times to the fact that im overly emotional instead of actually talking about the fact that he refuses to stop saying the n word. i decided to leave because i knew he was still too angry and this wasnt going to go anywhere. i went to the door and he shoved me out of the way and went up against the fence so i couldnt open it and get out. i kept begging him please let me leave but he was just screaming at me saying how im overly emotional and insulting me, saying how our dead father would laugh in my face if he saw me now getting mad at him. i started screaming over him telling him to let me go let me leave but he kept getting in my face. my mom brought me to the other exit and i ran away. this is not the first time this has happened, he regularly uses his size and strength against me, hes pushed me, trapped me in rooms many times just so he can yell at me, in front of people too it doesnt matter to him. hes forced my bedroom door open to scream at me repeatedly, thrown things at me, thrown water on my laptop accidentally while trying to throw a mug of water at my head. i was once so scared while he was yelling at me i threw up and he started laughing and making fun of me for having vomited saying that i was being ""dramatic"" i dont know what to do, my mom says she doesnt want to be involved but i dont understand how she can watch him do this repeatedly? for now im sure i cant have my brother in my life but my mother is mad at me now saying its insulting id think shes racist...",30Aug2020,1

869,"So it's a bit strange and a long story but I really need to see what someone else has to say about this . 
(Sorry for my english)

So almost a year ago I (F19)was going to my local market and I saw a new guy(M25) and I fell head first.  He was the cashier and I was looking at his hand tattoo that wasn't finish trying to figure it out.  He saw me and we started laughing out of nothing. After a month I found his Instagram and we started talking and he was so nice not flirty or anything. 

I was flirting with him in a playful way even if he told me that he had a fiance. I got that and I told myself I would be his friend. Some time passes and we both found each other flirting . The first time that we got to go out to get some coffee he kissed me and I didn't understand why . We barely saw each other alone and I didn't pushed it . 

I knew he loved her fiance but I saw how much they were fighting and my heart was breaking every time he would come to our place or calling me to tell me that she was controlling his life and he didn't have any friends (besides me but I was a secret) because of her. I think in a year they fought like 20 + times. And not the cute tiny fight. No . The types that made him want to kill himself most of the time. 

Last month they had a fought one night that he came at my door (he never wanted to came at my house cz it was too risky) and began to cry (I never saw him crying till then). That night I just put a movie for us and got us some beers to calm him down. We stayed there him at my chest while I was petting his hair and whispering sweet nothings to him till he fell asleep there hugging me and holding me for dear life. That morning I woke him out cz he had to go to his job and he was thanking me for saving his life because before he came at my house he was thinking to jump off a building.  

After a week they got together and that destro6me seeing him go back to the one that broke him so much. But I didn't show him that. I want him to be happy. 

Today I saw the photos from his wedding and trying to find a photo were he was really smiling,not faking it but didn't find one . And this night he called me and I told (crying)him I was happy for him and to be truelly happy and what he told me just made me go numb. He told me that he was happy cz he was thinking about me and how happy I seemed last time that he saw me (I was faking it )and he told me that his heart has no place for anyone besides me and he just wanted to hug me at the moment.

870,"Hi. I really need your advice. In quarantine I had online lessons, everyone does. But we didn't have Physics lessons. The teacher just sent us the material.

THE PROBLEM:
The classification was about to end, so we had last chances to get better grades. I was trying to get better results, but my mental health is getting really bad. I felt and still feel depressed all the time and I wasn't able to focus. So I didn't make it and got C from Physics. 
My dad take qualification really seriously.  So I told him that the teacher didn't give us chance to get better grades and that it's her fault. But now since we have to go back to school (in Europe) he wants to confront her. And I don't know what to do. I am to afraid to tell him the truth.

873,"First, I read the rules and I'm not asking for money.

I've had an expensive past few months, moving, paying rent and deposit for my new house, driving lessons and much more, and now I'm 300 euros short for this month. Last month I lent some money from a friend and I said I'd pay it back somewhere around the end of this month because I genuinely thought I could pay them back, but some other stuff came along and now I'm fucked. I know I could just ask them if it's ok to pay them back next month but I really don't want to break my promise, so I'd rather go through some trouble to make sure I can pay them back this week.

The thing is though, I have no idea where I'm gonna get 300 euros from and I have not been able to get it off my mind. It really makes me feel like a failure.

So I have 2 things I need advice on:

First is, how can I make 300 euros by the end of this week? My payday is the 24th so I can't wait for that.

Second is, how can I better manage my money in the future? I started working fulltime after highschool and I'm getting payed pretty well, especially for 19 years old.

Let’s start with the story. 
A few days ago I went to a friend’s and we had some drinks at a bar. After we finished our 2nd one, one had the idea to go into a strip club.

888,"My (m24) fiancé (f25) and I are thinking about moving to Portugal. We're currently living in Czech Republic. I'm Czech and she's Ukrainian. I know all the legal things my concern is something different.

Reasons to move in there are: I suffer from atopic eczema and sea and warm climate makes it go away, my fiancé doesn't feel comfortable in the Czech society since a lot of people here are xenophobic. And we feel that now is the moment to decide whether to stay here or move elsewhere because we want to decide that before children come. All my life I've been moving around the country because my mother kept marrying and divorcing so I really don't have a home other than grandma's house which has already been sold. Nothing holds us here.

I'm originally an electrician but I've studied linguistics and I actually make my living teaching Czech to foreigners. I know English, German, Ukrainian (some Polish, Turkish, French, Spanish) and I'm planning to learn Portuguese as well. I have experience in automotive as well.

My fiancé works in chemical laboratory but she studied bachelor in food industry and meat production. She's worked in restaurants, managed a whole café chain. She speaks Ukrainian, Czech, Russian, not so good English. She'll learn Portuguese too.

Our goals in Portugal is to get a job for start but later open a crêpes and coffee place. I'd like to focus on writing (I'm doing that half of my life now and I've been published a few times in magazines).

So the questions:
Considering our ""CV"" above, is it a good choice? What type of job could we get and should look for? Which is a better place Lisboa or Porto? Or is it better elsewhere? How hard is it to start a business there? Are people welcoming? Should we know something else before doing this? It's there a Czech or Ukrainian community?

I don't feel motivated at all to get friends. The adrenaline rush you get while talking to someone is gone.

This makes my life really hard. And I know that the solution is to become completely independent. But how? I just can't see how achieving anything is good. I don't find anything fun.

892,"I wanted to preface this by saying, yes, I'm taking counseling and have been for the past years with the same Dr. I'm 18, an only child, and both my parents are in their 40s.

Awhile back I caught my mom crying by herself in her room. Later in the day she just cried and told me that things were hard between her and dad. She said she didn't want to leave me in the dark.

The following week, she left for a few days out of town. Then my dad told me what was going on, although still vague on what had happened. He told me, things were hard... it was his fault and he was going to counseling... mom is going to leave later (late Sept-early Oct) to another town with her family... and that mom has suggested for a divorce. I thanked dad, told him I was proud for telling me and left. My dad and I never really talked in the past, I know it must've been hard for him.

Mom came back and also had a talk with me. She told me that she was sad and dad had said something that hurt her... she realized she wasn't living for herself but other people... something like this had happened before but I was too young... that she realized it was going to be hard to leave if she did. We cried, of course, and I told her it's going to be hard... that dad wasn't going to ask her to stay anymore... that I wasn't going to ask her to stay... that if she does decide to stay, she will have to work through a lot of mental baggage and that's something she has to decide for herself. I told her that I'm proud of her for deciding to better her life and not settle after 25 years of marriage if that meant having to leave dad -- even if it meant having to leave me.

Last week, I talked with my counselor about what was going on. I told her I felt alone... I'm an only child so I have no one to relate this to. I have my boyfriend who went through a similar experience but he had siblings to go through this experience with. They had pain to share. I told her what I said to my parents those nights. What their responses were. I told her I was upset at mom for being cold to me at times and that I felt like I was also being punished. Also upset at mom for turning her back on me and leaving me confused and ""out of touch"" when the situation started happening. Mom said she didn't want to leave me in the dark about what was going on but that was exactly what she'd done. We used to be so close.
My counselor told me she was proud of me for ""being the bigger man"" and beginning the slow process of letting go. She was happy I was busying myself between then and now (the time of the call.) and worried about my stress/sleep/eating habits. Etc.

This weekend, my parents, my boyfriend and I went on a trip to the beach for my birthday. (It's during the week.) Although I was really glad and loved spending time with my boyfriend... everytime I looked at my parents, it was just cold. They used to love going to the beach together as a family and it felt like they weren't ""there"". Overall it felt like it was a time they could watch over me as their little girl one more time to see if it could respark a joy as a family they once had when things were better. It felt like they were going through the motions of what we used to do. It felt like they were just trying to emulate what once was. It felt cold.
I cried to my boyfriend a bit when they were away.

It's the day after and I just feel... disappointed. It didn't feel like a birthday trip. Not that I wanted them to fawn over me or anything like that. Just the warmth and love that was usually there, wasn't. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't feel like I can talk to either of my parents about this because I don't want to add to their guilt. My boyfriend tries to relate to me and tells me things could come out better, as his parents went through the same and didn't divorce. But it just doesn't feel *right*. It doesn't feel the *same*. My family is very important to me and always has been. But right now, it doesn't feel like family, it feels like two roommates who have on/off often one-sided tension. I know it's selfish to say, but it makes me wish my brother were alive so he could go through this pain with me. I know things are hard right now but I'm just so tired. I don't mind if my parents do or don't stay together, I just want this entire experience to end already. I don't want to be feeling this way anymore.

**Is there any advice for getting through this?** My counselor suggests hanging out with friends more but I've graduated already... My friends have moved away for college and I'm not currently taking any classes. All I have left is my boyfriend who at any unknown time will be leaving for the Marines. I'm afraid he'll leave around the same time mom does. **What can I do? I feel lost and alone.**

894,"I have an LDR girlfriend. We spend close to all our free time together. Whenever I’m not in school I am talking to her on the phone. We plan fun things to do most days and we love each other very much.

Whenever I go out she wants me to give her a time when I will be back and she will wait for me to get back so we can spend more time together. I have a history of not keeping that time and it has made her very upset. I have tried to keep times better and if I say so myself I’ve gotten better at it.

Now I have started at a new school three weeks ago and I’m still trying to get friendly and closer to my classmates. During these three weeks I’ve felt that they have started making friends among each other and I feel abit left out. I am also extroverted and this has made me feel pretty bad. This weekend there has been no plans in the class chat and I have just assumed they have been hanging out without me in each of their friend groups.

Today there came up plans about going on a bost trip to a close island about 25min away. I naturally was into the idea and told my girlfriend that I’m going. She hates that I make plans the same day to go out but since she saw that I really wanted to she was ok with it. I told her it will be a short trip and that I will be back within 2h so we can watch the movie we wanted to.

When I get to the island with my classmates I realise that the island is way bigger than I imagined and that there is so much to explore. We go and have some lunch and I realise the time is running off. We had just eaten up and I was supposed to head back without having explored anything.

I text my girlfriend that I will stay for two more hours and she does not take it well. She says that I have disrespected her and disregarded the time I had given her and I have not even considered that she is waiting for me to get back to watch the movie. Mind you I would still be home in time to watch a movie today.

Now this is not just a one time thing. Me and my girlfriend constantly struggle with time when going out. When she goes out I usually dont care if shes late as long as she tells me as soon as she knows the time will change. But for her it is a very big deal if I change the time I will be home by. This is because she plans the day and waits for me.

What should I do about this? Does she have the right to be mad at me? I feel like I was wrongfully treated when I updated the time. Do I have the right to feel upset about that?

896,"I opened FB on my phone the other day and for whatever reason a profile pic caught my attention in ""people you may know."" I wasn't even looking for anything. I tapped on it and to my great surprise it was full face pictures of a male coworker with full, female makeup and wig. The name on the profile is some other female name. The profile name in the link is slightly different but it includes the person's real last name. The profile has been there for about a year judging from the sparse activity viewable by me. I can't see much due to privacy settings. There are only 3 profile pictures and no other photos. The bio says they are a cross dresser starting to come out of the closet after a long time. Can't see if there are any friends or mutual friends. The profile ""follows"" several cross dressing FB pages.

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do, if anything? At first I figured it must be a joke or hack. I was in pure disbelief. It was one of those ""no way!"" moments. But the pictures look extremely real with specific poses this person wouldn't do otherwise so it's probably not photoshopped. The profile has been around long enough with activity spread over several months so it doesn't look like a one time joke for Halloween or anything, but I suppose it could be, maybe he thinks it's funny to update the profile picture periodically. But the first visible activity is nowhere near Halloween, though.

&amp;#x200B;

There is probably nothing to do but now I won't look at this person the same way. We have always gotten along and see eye-to-eye on things related to our job. I feel like I need to tell somebody but I don't want it to come back to me or ruin this person's job. I don't necessarily want it to be known to everyone but I just want to tell someone I trust and see what they think about it, get their reaction, see if they knew about it. The problem is people tend to engage in gossip and rumor at this place and it spreads like wildfire. So much so that the CEO has warned against it or face discipline. There have been prior personnel/HR incidents we have been forbidden to talk about or be terminated (Unrelated to my post, someone even got fired for nearly revealing private info on some higher up administrative people that would irreparably damage the company, their personal reputation, and family.)

&amp;#x200B;

You have to understand this person is quite masculine in ""normal"" life, former military, enthusiastic about it, married to a woman, grown children etc. Our job is also full of fairly conservative people and I'm not sure how they would take it but at the same time we have heard strange (to me) and scandalous rumors over the years involving the higher ups. Maybe I'm just naive.

&amp;#x200B;

This is quite strange and shocking to me. Has anyone encountered a similar situation and if so, what did they do, if anything? I understand this is someone's private life even if I don't agree with it. They don't bring it to work. However, at the same time, they put it on Facebook for the world to see, but I wonder if maybe their privacy settings got inadvertently changed to allow me to see it, like Facebook is notorious for doing when they change the site.

897,We don't have zoom calls like some but we have work. I would just skip it. And mark it as done. I'm going back to school soon and think I will be crucified by teachers and parents. Please help. Can I avoid it or make it not as bad. I fucked up big time boys.,30Aug2020,1
898,"So in I (f19) got some glasses bc my eyesight started to get a little foggy in Nov. 2018 . In Feb. of 2019 I was diagnosed with t1 diabetes and found out that the diabetes was a reason why my eyesight got foggy bc I had fine eyesight before that. Ever since I only used my glasses in school when I couldn’t see the white board and now when I do HW. 

I know I have to wear them at all times but I just can’t get used to them and idk what to do to get over that and just accept it! I also can’t afford contacts right now so that’s not an option atm. How can I adjust to it even after two years of inconsistent wearing them?",30Aug2020,1
899,"I don't remember the last time I was content with my life, scratch that I think it was when I was in 9th grade (At my country 1-9th grade is spent with one class and high school is 10-12th). When I went into high school my social life went to shit, to top it off it took me a lot of time to even figure out I had a problem since after school I'd be working/learning (intern) at an small local software company. I always was with near failing grades, slept (mostly pretended) through most of my classes, I had mild acne and didn't want anyone to see them, which contributed to not being approached (the sleeping part). The only two friends I had were from 9th grade which ended up in the same class as me in high school, I call them friends but it's not like we had anything in common we just knew each other for 9 years.

2 years later, entering 12th i'm addicted to cigarettes, smoked probably \~5 times in a year and recently 5 times in a week (in total \~15 my whole life but here it's got a really bad rep), my social life is still shit but probably will change since a lot of stuff I was insecure about no longer effect me and while I faked not caring for 2 years (how I got by without being considered emotionally bullied), after some stuff happened I realized that I really shouldn't care and learned that I should stand up to some assholes. I didn't have this problem in 1-9th grade since fights were physically not emotionally, and I didn't let anyone mess with me without getting some fists in even if beaten in the end they wouldn't dare again.

&amp;#x200B;

This got like a life summary but the reason I'm making this post is, I'm never content, right now I don't have any friend I really connect to but I have some, I worked on an outsourced project while being in a  poor country, making my wage slightly above average for 4 months, which is enough of an achievement on it's own but if my boss lands two other projects he said he would assign me on both which would triple my paycheck, making it bigger than both of my parents combined (and we're middle-class). As I went through this, I actually am grateful for this part of my life, but after I post this, I'll forget about it (aka short-lived happiness).

My dad recently went to work in &lt;insert dangerous western country filled with terrorists&gt; (don't wanna make myself identifiable), and the only thing that makes me sad is that he went there to get paid 4x more, I wouldn't actually care if he died, he used to beat my mom when I was maybe 12 or 13 years old, calmed down but never quit on beer (liters/day), before he left and he hugged me all the time when he was drunk, a lot of times I'd say ""fuck you"" in my head while remembering either the time he used to make me cry when hearing the arguing and knowing he probably hit her, or the more recent reason I took up to hate him when he told my mom in an argument completely unrelated to me   to make tests if ""insert my name"" is actually my child, he most likely didn't mean it as he was drunk but I don't care as long as it doesn't let me forget of what he's done a few years ago. (I'd hate if we all actually forgave him)

907,"This is my first time properly posting on reddit and I Earley use this app but I need some advice from aoneone else on what to do.

When I was way way younger, my dad attempted to heat on my mother. It ultimately failed my mother found out, they got sorted out, I was only 6 months old at this point. And other than a few bits of arguing at times it was pretty calm.

Then in 2015 my mother found out my dad tried to do the same thing again. Only this time it was much worse. He didn't actually cheat on her as far as we know. (It's likely he didn't he's not exactly an attractive man) but my mum was pissed.

This led to constant arguments, if my dad was more than 3 minutes late home she'd go ballistic. She'd scream, shout, make his life a real hell. Which eventually ended up to both of them drinking.

But the problem was, she took a lot of her anger out on her kids. I'm only 14 right now. And this has been going on since late 2015.

It was usually just a few kinda slaps or hits. But over time, as their marriage has carried on, it's gotten worse and worse.

It isn't exactly she'll just randomly come up to me and starting beating me. It's more if I look at her funny, I do something wrong, I don't do something fast enough. Just a few weeks ago she punched me in the back ofthe neck multiple times, because I didn't get a peice of paper quick enough, when the paper in question was actually in a whole different room then she told me it was in.

And I have to be careful also, she really likes the house to be tidy, so if I make something a mess, like a spill, or a mark on a carpet she goes absolutely apeshit. Calling me a ""stupid little bastard, and"" it's always you isn't it you dicksplash""

But with the years. It's gotten worse, and so has the verbal abuse. I'm pretty certain, she broke my sisters arm, she twisted it very far and my sister was crying for a lot oft he night, my sister tried to say she fell down the stairs to my mum but I knew it was most Likely my mum who actually broke it.

In the past few months, wwther this has been the stress of the covid, she's starting to really pitch it up a bit, and maybe ti's also because I've been fighting back a little, with a bit of backchat, I use to just sit there and take it so I didn't cause an argument, but recently she's been calling me gay, a loner, no frei ds werido. Faggot, fuck face, just many things that I'm not and that hurt me.

And it may seem like I'm bitching on but, this woman has ruined most of my childhood, she wouldn't let me. Play with other kids, so this led to me being horrible at being social.

And it just hurts so much too, because I actually respect and love my dad, regardless if he initially started all this, and I see why, my mother's a total bitch who jsut can't leave things, and she drove my dad away, and she's also driving her kids away now, I hate her, so so much, and I can't wait to cut all contact with her, I've tried to find many ways to fix it, and find a reason to stick up with her, but I can't find any, she Cries about how my dad hits her, and he dies, but my mother starts it. She can't leave fucking anything at all. She'll purposely piss him off and act like she's the victim, she'll even hit him, he'll hit her back and she'll act like he just randomly hit her, she's even cut him a few times. Not too serious though. 

And the thing is, she actually cheated on her ex husband with my dad, yet she's so hypocritical and two faced. In public she's the perfect mother, a kind genours lady, but at homes she an evil witch who makes her families life hell.

Sorry if I went on for too long. But I've gone long enough telling no one about her. And I jsut don't know what to do. Whether I should just sit through it all and forget about it savouring the moment I'll eventuly escape form her grasp and can live free.
Or try and stop her, try and fight back a bit, and teach her she can't do that to me.
I don't want to go see another adult, like social services or a teacher. I don't want her to be put in prison, and my gmailies life torn apart, I want my family to be fine. Its jsut my mother who I despise in it all, but not enough to ruin her life that way.",30Aug2020,1

I(20m) have been seeing somebody(20f) infrequently since last october. At first I only wanted her around because my friends insisted on bringing their SO's when we hung out, and i was tired of third wheeling on several dates every weekend. Around December, we started hanging out at her place, just the two of us. We would sit in her living room, watching TV and cuddling. This would continue to go on sporadically up until two months ago, when I, in a drunken stupor, accidently told her I wanted to have sex. She said she wanted to wait a little while before we move that far, and I complied. A few weeks later though, our usually routine changed locales into the bedroom. Neither of us have had sex before, and i want her first to be with someone who loves her, which I am uncertain if I do.
Since we started going to her place, I've thought her about her alot. Its gotten to the point where not a single day goes by. I dont know if that's good or bad. She also seems to have an idea of when I'm thinking about her. Whether it 3pm or 3 am, there it is, a text from her.

916,"I am hoping for some ""what would you do in this situation"" type advice here. I am on my mobile so please forgive formatting issues. 

I live alone and am unemployed and my lease agreement is up for renewal. I've lived here 3 yrs, never been late, always paid in full on time. I rent an apartment in a major city in Texas. Each year my rent has gone up and I've renewed for a year at a time. This year, I need to find a cheaper option/bigger option but without income I cannot qualify for a new place currently &amp; the lease is up for renewal in September. 

For several reasons once I find employment I fully expect my income will be significantly less than what I was making when I qualified for this place. So reason #1 I need to find a cheaper place to rent. In addition I have a family situation that will likely be resolved by two family members moving in with me and my current apartment is a very very small one bedroom. So that is reason #2 - I need something bigger if they move in with me and I cannot afford the larger apartment homes where I currently live. 

If I go month to month on this apartment my rent skyrockets and becomes truly unaffordable. If I sign a 12 mo lease renewal (lowest monthly rate offered) there is a good chance that I have to break the lease due to the above listed issues. I do not have family or friends I can move in with temporarily. I looked at renting a room but it doesn't look feasible due to storage fees/pet deposits/plus rental room rate. I am scraping by and my savings is depleting/depleted. I am searching for a new job daily.

Do I have any other options right now? Is there room for negotiations in the rental renewal if I was to explain to the property manager that I'm unemployed, will be taking a cut in pay and very well may have family members coming to live with me which couldn't work in this tiny apartment? Or would telling them I have no income disqualify me for renewal? 

I hate to sign a lease knowing it's likely I'll have to break it but I don't see any other options right now. If anyone has alternative ideas please let me know.

920,"Hi Reddit

So, Like the title says I'm a 21-year-old dude and I am kind of at a weird point in my life at the moment. I'm currently debating on whether or not I should finish my bachelor's degree. It has kind of been a long windy road for me to end up getting to this point so bear with me while I do my best to explain...

In May of 2019, I earned my Associates in Liberal Arts. A useless degree I know but, getting an Associates allowed me to be hired by the various amount of Civil Service agencies in my city which was the main motivation in getting the degree. My plan looked like it was working out as I scored highly on a very desirable civil service test in my city and it looked like with time I was on track to be hired.  I had started the beginning stages of processing in late 2019.

So, knowing that I would probably have a job within the next 2-3 years I decided to continue going to college, transferring to a 4-year college as a backup plan. I kinda messed up doing this. I really didn't go back for the right reasons. I let my parents wishes for me to finish college influence me, I wanted to continue my college athletic career (I was an athlete at my Community College) and, I still wanted to experience some of the social aspects of college life.  Along with my irrational reasoning for going back, I also choose an irrational major, opting to major in History. My reasoning for this was I always had some interest in going into the educational field and my plan, if shit hit the fan, was after getting my bachelor's I could go back to grad school for education and enter that field.

Fast forward to 2020, it's looking more and more like I'm out of luck with the aforementioned civil service job due to the pandemic and the economic status of my city, which has been crushing. Due to multiple reasons, I've lost my interest in entering the education field and I'm really questioning whether I should finish this degree or not. I've expressed some of these thoughts to my parents and they really aren't too happy about it. They're telling me that it's better to have a degree than not, no matter what the field of concentration is but, I know for a fact a BA in History is pretty fucking useless. So, I'm kinda lost at the moment. I know if I go back and finish the degree I'm gonna be in a similar position next year to the position I'm in today. I have entry-level work experience but, no real skills. So, I'm not really sure what to do, thankfully my school starts after labor day so I have a little bit more time to decide. I kinda would just like the semester off to have a little more time to figure what my next move is but, I know I'm gonna get blowback from my folks which is gonna suck.

Long term I'm looking into a few things. I've been looking around for construction trade apprenticeships but this has been kinda difficult due to COVID. I was also signed up for a couple of civil service tests that also got postponed due to COVID. I've also been thinking about going to see a military recruiter because I'd be open to career opportunities in the service. I'd even be open to going back to school if I found a career path that would require a degree.

But, any advice would be appreciated. Do yall think I should finish my degree or explore other options?

Thanks, everyone!",30Aug2020,1

924,"Hi guys. I'm writing this on behalf of my boyfriend he's recently lost his automation job and he's resigned himself to never being able to break out into doing software development or game development because all job postings look for 5+ years experience at an entry level. Because he's not working I think this is his opportunity to go for it.

He's got a degree in computer science and graduated with a B+ (technically a 2.1 in our countries measurement of grades). He's been working in IT for the last 4 years has 2 years management experience in an IT company and 5/6 months experience with Win Automation. He graduated University 4 (almost 5) years ago.

He recently saw a job posting for a games tester with very little requirements but he doesn't want to apply because as he put it ""they're looking for that 'right' type of person, a sort of can do/big shot guy"". Which I personally believe is a load of bull. I think he should apply and go for it and if he doesn't get it que sera.

He wants to do software development or game development, that's the dream. But as he puts it he'd need to get all of this extra experience that he just doesn't have. Would doing an online course in Java and C+ (I think that's what it's called I'm not sure or CS+ or something) be enough or is there more he needs. As he puts it all of these job postings are looking for people already established in the field and he's just looking to break into it. 

He's really smart and I really believe in him but he doesn't believe in himself or his capability. I want to see him happy and not answering phones telling people to try turning their computer on and off again for the rest of his working life. I think it's a waste of his potential because he's so determined once he gets into things but he's quite introverted.

If you're in that industry how did you do it? Is there something he needs to do in particular? Any advice or guidance I would really appreciate.",30Aug2020,1
925," Last July I \[22M\] told my friend \[21F\] I had feelings for her after our friends fourth of July party and she said that she only thought of me as a friend. She was going moving away to go to school and I knew she was nervous about being away from home and I didn't take the rejection too hard and later that night her and I talked as we normally would have. She would often tell me that I am like a parallel universe version of her because of how much we have in common and how we act alot.

One of our friends had a party during Halloween where we put up tents and stayed the night in his yard. Someone pulled me aside during this party and talked to me for a bit about the couple people I hangout with and talked bad about them and it had upset me a bit. I went back to our tent where my small friend group was staying and I told them. I laid down and she had given me a hug and laid her head on my legs for awhile.

We played truth or dare for a bit before we got tired and when I laid down, she laid her head in my arm to use it as a pillow where she passed our for about 2 hours before people around the campfire had woken her up. We both slept in our sleeping bags later that night after talking with people around the fire for awhile.

During the school year, her and I ended up talking a lot more almost every moment of the day. We would talk on her way to class, in class, when she would go and get groceries for her apartment. And it was really nice but I started to spend less time with my family and more time with her than anyone else.

The other two people in our group didn't talk much to either of us besides the usual day of the week when all of us would get in a call to play DND and that would be it. Her and I grew really close during this time considering how much time we spent together.

Her best friend \[20F\] knew that I liked her and knew that she had told me that she didn't want to date me. I took a few trips up to see her once in awhile because she didn't have and friends there and the rest of our group was often working and I had more time off then they did.

Her best friend saw us getting closer and she and I took a trip to go and see her once as well. During this time she told me that she thought that she was having a thing for me with the way we would goof around almost like a couple and that she would talk to me almost all day. She also told her best friend that her and I were best friends too now.

The last time during the semester that I went up there, it was me, her best friend again, and her best friends boyfriend \[21M\]. We all had alot of fun but I was a bit more quiet than usual. When it came time for us to leave, I told them I was just quiet because I was sad about leaving which was true. She came and sat right next to me in the chair with her legs over mine because I was sad about having to go and when I got up later she wrapped her arms around my legs so when I walked I was dragging her with me. This was the first time I remember me shutting down like this.

When everything with coronavirus hit, I told her I would help her move some of her things from her apartment on campus back to her house and we had fun in doing so and joked around whenever we weren't carrying anything heavy. Later that night when we were back at her house, we were sitting on the couch watching TV and I went to the bathroom and when I got back, she had taken over the couch and had me sit by her stomach which I did till she told me to move.

She had often joked with me about me throwing her over shoulder or like tossing her on a bed and such so I had picked her up when I got up to move behind my back and brought her over to her cat sitting on the other couch. She said that hurt so I didn't plan on doing that again and just set her down. Later in the night, my feet were cold and she put them under her legs to warm them up. She was laying in the corner with her legs up and I used her legs as a pillow for a bit but said something about it beforehand and she didn't seem to care much. I only ever did things that she was okay with that she did to me before or we goofed around about because I didn't want to do anything that would bother her or that she would be uncomfortable with which was why I did those things. This was in April.

Over the next couple months I found myself wanting attention from her more and I started to get a bit possessive where when she would talk with one of my friends or one of my friends would do something for her instead of me, I would get jealous and shut down and be quiet like I did when we all went to visit her that time.

Her best friend and I one night were in a call and she had told me that she wanted to two of us to date and that we would be a good couple. She thought we looked cute together and she trusted me with so much that she didn't understand why she never did date me. She was often really needy and didn't understand how I was able to deal with her being that way all the time. I asked her if she could talk to her to see if anything had even changed.The two of them talked and she told me that at one point she thought she had a thing for me but wasn't sure and was dealing with alot of things on her own at the time and didn't want to think about the future too much because it gave her alot of anxiety which I understood. She also told me to not get my hopes up and didn't think it was too likely.

This 4th of July, I had a party with those friends I often hung out with and was not feeling too talkative again. The girl I liked was not feeling too touchy that day which I understood and she would have those days often so I wanted to respect that. When I would get quiet, she would often poke my sides or like scratch my beard with her nails because it would get me to smile but often didn't want the attention in return and I would seem to get upset. Later found out I was being very possessive over her.

During this party, I brought people drinks, put more wood in the fire and such but didn't talk in conversation much. There were several time in the night she would try to get me to sit in her lap to make me feel better but I knew she wasn't wanting to be super touchy that day so I kept to myself to not be disrespectful to her and to not put my problem of whatever it was at the time before hers. By friends were getting tired of me being this way and I didn't hear from them later that night when they got home till I messaged one of them and they told me about the way I had been acting.

They didn't talk to me much for days until she was ready to talk to me again which she brought up about me liking her again where she reminded me that she told me that she didn't think of me that way. I told her about the conversation I had with her best friend that she had told her that she might had at one point but seemed to deny it and not want to talk about it anymore. Her best friend denied me ever telling her about the response I gave her even though I clearly remember mentioning it to her that night.

We both agreed that alot of it was misunderstandings between the two of us and we never set any ground rules between us at friends because she had also told me that me picking her up and using her legs as a pillow made her uncomfortable and I told the only reason I did that was because she seemed okay with it when she did it to me and that we would often mess around like that. Clearly misunderstandings between us.

Now she is back at school and she doesn't talk to me much and only ever in our group chat. I find it hard to be around her because I just get reminded of my feelings and started being more distant as well to figure myself out. She still wants to be friends but its hard for me not having her to talk to anytime I get really bad anxiety and our normal conversations would help ease my mind but I don't get that anymore. One of the other hard things for me is that I have always been really picky when it comes to women and have a very specific type and she fit that to a T.

Sometimes I feel like leaving my friend group might just be easier but at the same time I don' want to lose any of them. It's just hard to be around her anymore knowing once again that we will only ever be friends. I just don't know what the right decision for me is. Do I try to remain friends with her and my group still and just be really distant to not get hurt again? Or do I try and move on and leave them? Was I in the wrong for feeling like things between us had changed? Her best friend thought so too for awhile till she talked to her and when all this happened denied that I told her her response to me that night which seemed to be alot of the issue. I am currently going to Therapy to get myself together because of how I have been treating them and want to fix myself.

I care about her alot and I want what's best for her but I don't know if me being around will help or not given the situation.",30Aug2020,1
926,"So my cats have destroyed the carpet in the closet that I keep their litter boxes in. One cat clawed up the corners so they are all frayed, and the other had a UTI that caused her to take to peeing on the carpet. I cannot get the smell out, I’ve tried enzymatic cleaners and the next one I was going to buy to try to get it out is nearly $40 which I just can’t afford right now. So my question is, what do you think would happen if I just ripped the carpet out? 

I’m thinking to rip it out and then line the closet with an old tarp I have to ensure if there are any messes again that it’s easy to clean up. I figured that whenever I move out of here in another year or so they would have to replace the carpet anyway and because I have semi destructive cats(they haven’t really destroyed the rest of the apartment though thank god, I have scratchers everywhere to make sure) I already resigned myself to not seeing my security deposit back. 

All I want to know is, is the worst they would do is charge me extra to replace the carpet? I will *hopefully* be in a better financial position by the time I move out and don’t mind that bc I think it’s fair. I just don’t want to waste money I don’t have RIGHT NOW continuing to try to get the cat pee smell out because it might not work. I’m fairly certain it’s soaked through to the pad and into the tack boards.",30Aug2020,1
927,"Ok, so some backstory, me and my ex-gf have been off an on since the beginning of this year. The longest we've been broke up was 3 months. In that 3 months, considering the fact I thought we were done for good after a nasty breakup, I had sex with 2 girls. I used protection and got tested well after and I was clean as I'm already very wary of that stuff. 

So skip ahead and we eventually got back together, then she gets a rash and all the symptoms of chlamydia. In this time we've been together, I've only had sex with her. She left and went and partied with her friends and I have suspicions she might've cheated, because I have no clue otherwise how she could have gotten it. I just need to know what to do. I'm going to go get tested tomorrow and see if I have one, but I'm fairly confident that I don't since I've been okay recently in the uhm, genital area. 

And no, since we've broken up I haven't had sexual encounters of any kind in case I do have one. It just really hurts that she would accuse me of that, because I've been a very loyal person and this has taken a toll on me greatly.

928,"I went to work feeling fine for the most part, maybe a little tired (working 6am shifts across town).  
Worked for about 2.5 hours, and was dismissed with everybody else for a 15 minute break. I sat in my car and smoked a cigarette, when I realized how quiet it was outside.  
In an instant everything seemed calm, at which point I asked myself why I wasn't calm before? It's my 2nd week on the job and having recently quit Walmart, I'm ecstatic to be in an industry I'm actually interested in.  
Anyways, I've had small bouts of unexplainable uncomfortable feelings that tend to subside after I distract myself from them. Nothing that prohibits me from living my life though.  
But today when I heard the quiet of the street, it's like white noise playing in my head had just stopped, and I've had this sensation before, just never thought of it much past ""huh, pretty quiet out here"".

929,"hi, i’m not sure what to do here.


my mom does this thing were she barges in while i’m on call with friends or playing a game without knocking. since i’m starting online school soon i made a cool setup with a poster and my albums in the back where people could see but she didn’t like it. so today she came in and told me to mute myself. i did and she started to move my bed to the middle of my room so i could have more space. i tried to tell her to stop and i didn’t want it that way and i liked it the way it was but she didn’t listen and kept going. we got into a fight where i said i wanted her to stop and stop means stop and no means no etc and she said “do you want me to move it back?”. i said there’s no point and she stormed out. i unmuted myself from call and ranted to my rants about how i couldn’t move it back now because i had an extension cord, (which held all my chargers, cords to my lamp etc and if i loved it the bed would be up against the outlet that it was plugged into) and nightstand i had to move too so i was literally stuck. she was listening to me thinking out loud how i’m gonna move it back and she bursts in again and says if you’re gonna bitch and complain we’re moving it. my bed is now backwards i told her to get out. 

to add onto the mess i had my vibrator that she doesn’t know about in my pillow so i decided to throw the pillow on my top bunk so it’ll look like i don’t want it to fall off so instead i places it up there. she got suspicious and started going through my stuff on the top bunk because she said i was hiding something from her. now she’s mad at me for multiple things and i don’t need this stress when school starts tomorrow and my room is trashed. she insulted how i live and i need to clean up when in reality it’s just a few shirts on the ground.

930,"I (24M) decided to search for a better life in another country. I'm lucky enough to have double nationality so setting myself up wasn't really an issue, legally speaking. 

So I decided to leave family, friends and my entire life behind. 

After 3 years, I see myself stuck in terms of personal growth. In other words, I have a job, finished my first year in a online college (didn't very well btw). And I'm lucky enough to have a place to call home. But, after all the hard work it seems like I'm all alone.

I had a few jobs along the way and of course I met some people but it seems to me that people already have a life, so they close their friendship door. So I can't find a new friend or relationship.

After all the virus thing, I used to go to techno clubs alone every single time. Is hard to make friends on those kind of places so I always end going back home alone too.

Dating apps don't help either, womens are so demanding and if you don't brag about something you don't really are then you don't get so much attention. 

All this makes me overthink, my self-esteem has been affected and I'm even getting bald. I can spend an entire day without doing anything, just scrolling thought thousands of images.

938,"To get some stuff out of the way: everyone in this story (besides my parents) are 14.

So to make a long story short, I had a friend that emotionally and sexually abused and continously manipulated me into participating and thinking the abuse was all ok and cutting off other healthy friendships, and she's also a friend of one of my best friends.

I stopped being friends with my abuser and a few weeks after talking to my parents about it, I told her what one of her closest friends did and my abuser even admitted it all to her. My friend saw all of the screenshots/evidence. But yet, she continues to stay friends with her. And justifies it by saying she thought her behavior and actions were very wrong, but she ""apologized"" and realizes she made a mistake.

1) It doesn't matter if she apologized, as I'm the only one who can accept her apology and I don't.
2) Manipulating and abusing someone isn't a mistake, she was totally aware of what she was doing for months on end, mixing up sugar and salt is a mistake.

So I'm planning on confronting my friend saying that I can't be friends with someone that sympathetizes with my abuser. I just have a really strong emotional connection with her and we are super close. So I need that taken into perspective. I just needs tips and advice on how to confront her because I'm gonna 100% do it. I just need to know how. Thank you. I appreciate anything that you send my way. :)",30Aug2020,1
939,"It’s my first week of college, and I should be having fun. Instead, I feel lonelier than ever before. It seems like everyone’s already making friends and finding their group. I don’t even know my hallmate’s names. I’m the only person I ever see eating alone, or walking alone, or doing basically anything alone. I’m sitting in my 2nd story dorm now, watching everyone outside having fun.

I want to be a part of it, but I just can’t. I don’t know why. I can’t just go up and talk to people. I can’t start the conversation. If only, just one person would start the conversation and say something to me, that would be awesome. I try my best to get out there. I ate like a freaking sloth at dinner and spent forever sitting there thinking maybe someone would come sit with me or say hi or something...anything. And no one did 😔.

Being lonely is the most painful feeling in the world. I’ve been literally shot in the arm (drive by... funnnn), I’ve broken a foot, I’ve had half by thigh removed (it’s... a long story), I get migraines. Nothing, literally nothing hurts as bad as being lonely :(. I’d rather be shot at again than spend another day like this, and I mean that.

My mum is a drug user and sever alcoholic. She lives down the street from my gran aunt and I and she lies to us about her coke head boyfriend staying over. I moved out when I was 13 because I couldn’t live in a house with her by myself after she was caught having an affair with the same coke head. I made a promise to myself to never be like her. She occasionally comes up to complain about her life whenever she is dumped and takes our money food and time which we don’t have a lot of before ditching us for him again. 

Basically a few weeks ago I turned 17 and had some friends round for a small party in the garden. My gran got us some ciders which were only 4% each. I had only tried a cider once before and I like the taste of it but I wouldn’t drink it constantly. Midway through the party my aunt got a bottle of cactus jack (16%) and we split half of it between 10 of us playing “beer” pong (didn’t even use beer or spirits). She said we could have the rest of it then asked me to play flip cup with her against my 2 friends. I was reluctant but agreed and because she is competitive she was shouting a lot for me to down a bit of cactus jack. 

I had one in a restaurant with my dad to celebrate Father’s Day cause we weren’t able to due to lockdown

Flash forward to a month later where i had a cider at my friends birthday party with food and a few more spread throughout 6 hours. I got home and found out my mum had been put in a mental institute overnight but for what we presumed to be a further 6 weeks. They asked how my night was and if I had anything to drink and I told them about the ones I had but my friend lives in a deeply religious household so I there wasn’t any access to high percentage alcohol 

Today I woke up at around 2pm, and my aunt came into my room to tell me that my gran thinks I’m gonna turn into my mum. She says that she saw me in the alcohol section of cosco when I was trying to find coke bundles and then I was drunk last night (which I certainly wasn’t, I was on Xbox late). I cut her off and told her to leave me the hell along and never say that to me again. We haven’t spoken today and any comments I’ve made are short or passive aggressive to give across the message that I have no interest in speaking to them.

I felt sorry for her so I accepted and eventually the conversation moved to us having sex. I told her that I’d have to think about it.

951,"School is coming up, and I have to fix my sleep schedule. It starts on September 1st, so I only have tomorrow night, yes I kinda fucked up lmao

Anyway, how much sleep do I need? My parents told me 8, but that means I'll have to go to sleep 4 hours earlier, which doesn't seem possible to me. Is it possible and I'm just looking for an excuse to not do it? 

I have to get to school at 8:10, so the latest time I can wake up at is 7:30. When should I go to sleep then?",30Aug2020,1
952,"Hey, i'm 24 and i live in a shareflat with 3 other people:

&amp;#x200B;

one guy, my age with who i became very friend with

another guy that i don't really like and the feeling is mutual, but we still have some talk

and a girl, 26yo, doing nothing of her life, never go out of her room... she is the one that left the note

&amp;#x200B;

the note basically says ""WIFIEXPANDER, stop pee in the sink, we have bathroom for that""

&amp;#x200B;

i found the note in the bathroom just one two hours ago, she didn't even have the balls to come talk to me face to face, and obviously put it so everyone can see

&amp;#x200B;

this really disgust me and i don't know why she did that

i have never peed in the sink, and even if i did, how could she know...

i live in the flat since 1 year, so if i don't understand why she is posting that only now...

&amp;#x200B;

fun fact: there is a new roomate arriving tomorrow so maybe it's to be taken into account

&amp;#x200B;

the context is that there is not a peaceful atmsophere in the flat... we don't talk much to each other, and there is lot of tensions with cleaning, purshase of common items (sponges, washing up liquid...)

&amp;#x200B;

I am maybe mean, but i really don't like her, she is fat and ugly and its true that sometimes we make fun of her with the others roomates. In one year, i had one good dicussion with her, but except that, we don't talk, i ignore her completly, so as the others roomates.

I also almost fight with the roomate i don't really like, because we had an argument about cleaning and money, because he is always the first to say that the flat is dirty but he has never cleaned it + he never ever bought any sponge, washing up liquide, garbage bag and toilet paper but use ours....

&amp;#x200B;

The note that she left, really made me angry and shocked me.. i don't know why she targeted me specifically but i know that even if its fake, this will really tarnish my image, and that the guy i don't really like gonna use it to push me down or humiliate me in front of the new rommate during future disputes we will have concerning cleaning or something else...

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know how to react and so i need some advices,

what would you do if you were in my situation!

&amp;#x200B;

thanks a lot!",30Aug2020,1
953,"So I’m not the best in staring a conversations but I almost always manage it somehow, but today I wanted to message someone that is probably my crush and now I don’t have any idea how to start after some hi or something. So if you know some icebreakers or know how to start a convo, I’d be glad for your responses.",30Aug2020,1
954,I know what i asked was insensitive and stupid and I wish I could take it back but I can't. He obviously said no and then asked me why I would even ask him that and I just apologized but he hasn't replied back and I'm scared he's mad at me now. How can I make it up to him?,30Aug2020,1
955,"Like many other college students, I was recently notified that my school is now online. I am trying to decide if its a good decision to move halfway across the country to an apartment in Houston for the first semester with a few college friends. I really want to see my friends again, and live with people my own age. However, I have been told twice now that it might get really messy/dangerous around election time, and we have no idea how bad covid will get this winter. We are all very cautious, and would essentially be quarantining together. Is this a bad idea? Are there any cons that I might not have thought about?",30Aug2020,1
956,"I’m 17. I keep hearing the same advice about going on walks, reading, exercising, volunteering and it all sounds superficial. The feel good chemicals would last for a while and then poof it’s gone. I don’t even have the motivation to get up and do those things either way. I see friends once in a while and then that’s it, I go home and do nothing. Yes I’m depressed. I haven’t told my therapist about this recently. Meds suck too. I think smoking anything is the only thing that gives me enjoyment and it’s still hard to get. I need any advice on how to fix this pain.",30Aug2020,1
957,"She says because he has to do things a certain way.

Not sure if she means it or is just kinda mad at him for something.

Not sure if it matters but Im 24 years old.

I need advice on what to believe... 

I feel this could be true but I also feel like my family in general is kinda dysfunctional...",30Aug2020,1
958,"This is just about my incredible stupidity and questioning how I can get myself out of potential danger. Basically, I'm a French girl trying to be an au pair, and someone replied to my profile online. 

Now, it seemed a bit fishy from the start but I decided to give it a try anyway. The emails didn't sound too logical considering who I was talking to (the English was a little broken in some part but, as I said, I am dumb and overlooked it)

I just sent an email with some of my information (phone number, address, amazing stuff basically) when the weirdness got too strong and I had to do some google reverse for the pictures that were sent to me. And, lo and behold! A scammer!

I just want to know what I could possibly do now so I don't end up having potentially put me and my family in danger.",30Aug2020,1
