0,"An old roommate from college reached out to ask if I would be interested in shooting his wedding next month. I'm only a hobby videographer and this would be the first wedding I do, but I was honored (if a little intimidated!) and gave a tentative but enthusiastic yes. We live in one of the few states where covid cases are trending down and he's scaled back the guest list to fit within the state guidelines - only close family and the wedding party.

&amp;#x200B;

At first I thought I was nervous because this would be my first time shooting an event like this, but now I think I'm realizing it's because I'm uneasy attending a gathering with 20-30 new people during a pandemic, even if I am mostly on the outskirts on camera. I'm sure there will be moments where I'm up close and chatting, and I plan to wear a mask at least, but surely no one else is wearing masks at a wedding, right? That would be a weird scene for the bride and groom to look back to from the altar.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd be honored to be there for the day and help a friend capture his wedding, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little irrationally worried. Does it sound like I just need to ask more about the scene and expectations for some comfort? What would you do in my shoes?",09Jul2020,1
1,"So the other day my mother gave me a handmade dream catcher. It was made by on of her friends and she got it to help me sleep. Neither myself or my mother are indigenous, nor is her friend who made it. I really appreciate the gesture, and I know she spent money on it, but I really don't feel comfortable owning this dream catcher when it wasn't made by an indigenous person. I don't know how to tell my mom that what her friend is doing is straight up appropriation and the gift makes me feel uncomfy. Mom is kind of old school and not keyed into social issues like this. How do I talk to her about it, and what do I do with this dream catcher?",09Jul2020,1
2,"Husband has a very secure job for the past 6 years, but it makes him vulnerable to get and bring home the virus. We have a 1 year old with a heart condition who is at a higher risk of death from this virus. 

I have a BS but have stayed home with the kids for years. I know I can get a job that works from home and that pays as much as his, but it would not have the kind of security his job currently offers. He could stay home to watch the kids while I work from home and we can all stay safe in our little bubble and not worry about getting the virus. 

What would make sense to do right now? I’m in the US, our numbers are out of control and it’s not even fall yet. I keep hearing people say the supply chain is breaking down. Half the country is already unemployed. But if me and my family get this virus, I can’t handle losing my son. 

What should I value here? What is the smartest move? Should I be valuing the safety of our health over financial security? It’s not a guarantee that we would be financially in trouble and it’s also not a guarantee that we will catch the virus or my son will die from it. But both are possible.

I just want to know, what would you do?",09Jul2020,1
3,"I was hanging out with my friends today and all day our friends would get us to be alone together. Plus when ever we did anything like hug or hold hands they would smile at him. Also also they kept doing things like looking at me and saying I have a secret~ then they would turn to my friend and be like do you have a secret you want to share [instert name]

So based on this I have concluded that they are doing this bc he doesn't like being around me or bc he has a crush on me.

But if he has a crush on me idk what I'm going to do or say if he tells me he likes me. 
I mean I think of him as more than just a friend, but it's not like in a romantic way, just a very close and intimate platonic friendship. And I don't want to ruin that...

I was literally so nervous that I felt like I was going to throw up every time we were alone. I really don't want to hurt him. I'm just not ready for a relationship and I don't know if I do like him or if it's just platonic.

So what I'm asking is do you think he likes me and if so how do I tell him I don't feel the same way without messing up our friendship or hurting him",09Jul2020,1

5,"Hi the reason why I’ve decided to comment this is because I’m lost and am not sure what to do here, I need some advice. I’m a 17 year old girl who’s in the long process of trying to get her ged. 

When I was a very young my mom had told me that she thinks I had, had adhd or dyslexia, we never really new and just went on with out lives. There were a lot of close calls of being held back in elementary school and my grades and my behavior was out of control (at the time I was a brat tho) I was very impulsive which got me into a lot of trouble with the teachers/kids. Time had passed and in school my grades had continue to be bad. I would always get a D average, always barely passing. 8th grade I had felt more focus on school then any other year, around that time I had a low B average but was more then proud of myself for the first time because I was doing so well in school. High school started and my grades had went under again. Keeping up with things was more then hard, my biggest problem was keeping up with time and everyone around me. My alarm clock held more then 40 alarms and everyday about 20 of them would go off for different things. Scheduling and remember and keeping track of things was hard. My mom and dad had both kinda picked up that something was wrong and I would always get the comment “you don’t know how to be responsible” or “stop being lazy” it was exhausting. Tho I will admit I’m not very responsible person and I’m lazy. I always someone how find a way to make excuses which got frustrating to those around me. Me and my friends would go out, I would say I would be there soon and would completely lost track of time and miss out. I lost a lot of friends. Then I started missing school, a big reason for that is simply missing the bus. School work was hard, I could never completely a task and I went back to a D average fast. Even school work I was so close to finishing I never did, quickly I also started to understand that I was a procrastinator that never finished. More things like this I would add to my list of what I did or who I was. Though something I would finish a lot or stay very focused on most of the time was writing. Even tho my grammar sucks. I sometimes I could write a essay for hours and miss a meal because of it. It confused me because I would be super focused one second and the next not, math was big no for me. I had to take extra classes in school for math too, I often say dream and got side tracked very easily and got very bored over homework and school work. At the time I just once again thought I was just being a dumb kid who didn’t want to learn when I did but not things like math. A lot of kids get distracted but for me I felt it was excessive. There were things I did that I hadn’t realized I’d done before. Like when I let in bed my legs would shake and fidget till I would fall asleep. I have bad dandruff and that’s manly because I pick at my scalp a lot, I bit my nails constantly and peel the skin of my lips all the time. I don’t remember them being fully healed and not hurting. 

When I reached sophomore year I had enough. Everything was moving and I couldn’t keep up. I had no credits my GPA dropped from a 1.7 to a 1.2 by the end of the year and I wasn’t improving at all. I couldn’t focus on anything and my sleeping went from 7h to 4h a night trying to keep up. For a moment there I felt like I almost lost my mind. But these things I was worrying about weren’t even big. My friends were doing fine, going to class, remember there school work, keeping up with there social life while I was falling behind in everything. That year I had missed more days then I had gone these are things that shouldn’t be hard to handle. I had told my mom and dad said “you’re 16 you have it easy, you have nothing to worry about” and she was right. So then why was it so hard? At the last month of school I decided to just drop out. For the first time in a while I felt like I could breath again but I was still scared about my future. So I decided to get my ged and that’s what I’m in the process of doing. I just barley passed all subject except math and I don’t think I can pass it. I failed the first time but making myself pay attention is hard when all I have to do is take 1 more test. 

2 week ago I was on YouTube and saw a video about adhd I decided to watch it and the symptoms that I felt like I could relate to strongly. Now here me out, I hate self diagnosers, after that video I went on with my life but got curious again and decided to watch more videos on it. Every time a symptom was mentioned in the videos I could relate to or made sense to the problem I was having. I went on google and kept searching things up, often a friend I have would joke about me having adhd because I fidget/interrupt/act impulse/day dream when we would hang out. She also told me that I’m a very repetitive person, I keep saying the same things over and over again and would often lose/forget something she would tell me to hold onto or get. This isn’t just with her it’s with everyone I know. I’m obviously not a professional and can’t diagnose myself. Maybe I’m thinking to deep into it and don’t have it but if I did a lot of things would make sense. 

My moms and millennial and my dad is a gen x with boomer mindsets. I’m afraid to say anything to them because when I do have a problem and go to them they say “you’ll get through it, when I was a kid-“ so I’m sure even if I did have it, they wouldn’t test me for it. They are the type who don’t really believe disorders/illness and mental health exist. I’m 17 and am not sure how to go about this. Should I wait until I’m 18 and get myself tested? Or tell them now? If I did can I have some advice about how to tell them? I’m 99% sure I do and I don’t mean any disrespect to people who do actually have it, I’m just concerned and suspicious. I’m not asking for a diagnosis here, just some advice about how to ask/tell my parents about this.

7,"I'm in teen age and I have this for like at least last 3 years. It makes me aroused when someone is feeling sorry for me, have sympathy towards me or is worried about me. Also, when I was younger I liked to be in a role of victim - again  because of sympathy.

For example when I made a post on r/selfharm months ago about starting, I got over 80 comments and there was a lot of ""please don't do it"" etc. and I was hard almost 24 hours without a break. (I'm not cutting now)

It's obvious why it's a terrible characteristics. I am trying to be careful about this, but it sometimes makes me pretend that I'm feeling worse than I really am (not only to others, but mainly to me myself).

What is that? And why? I want to get rid of it",09Jul2020,1
9,"So I've been asking for a dog for a while now, and my parents had finally told me that they were ready to get one a week or so ago. We looked at breeders and we found a sweet little cavachon that my brother and I really loved. Just before I got too attached to her, I asked if they were sure about all this because it DID cost a lot to keep her. They told me not to worry about any of that and we proceeded to map out costs for her food, vet, and other new puppy supplies. I occasionally checked on them by asking if they wanted to back out of adopting the puppy, but they were enthusiastic the whole time. Today though, my mom gave me a long talk about how the cost was too much and that she would not be getting me the dog. I was surprised because after laying down the essentials on a spreadsheet, I had found that the puppy was actually affordable for us. In fact, I was really so shocked that I began crying. A dog has been all I've wanted for about 11 years now, and having something get taken away after it's promised kind of hurts. As such, I've been in a terrible mood for quite a long time, and nothing is able to distract me, not even my favorite TV show. My parents are angry that I got so attached and are not giving me any details on if they'd reconsider. How can I forget about that dog and stop wanting to cry all the time? Please help.",09Jul2020,1
10,"Hey everyone, hope you're all well.

So I'm running a charity fundraiser to raise money for BLM. What I did is make an online raffle, with prizes from local Black-owned businesses. I thought it would be a good way to show support for the cause and give back to my local community.

However, it doesn't seem like its getting enough traction. So far, only a handful of people have entered the raffle; this is great but, honestly, I'm kinda deflated. I really wanted to do more and have honestly put lots of time &amp; energy into this. I guess you could say I got my hopes up too high.

So does anyone have any tips for increasing its exposure and getting people to pitch in? What's the best way to get people to notice (I have been posting on my social medias but my outreach is pretty small)? Thanks!",09Jul2020,1

12,"For the last four years, I've tried to handle my mental health issues alone. The thought of going to a therapist again has always made me feel guilty and ashamed, so I never reached out for help.

Sometimes I wonder, do I even need therapy? I don't want to waste anyone's time when it could be used for someone more important.

I've struggled with a tendency to self-harm all my life. But it's a bit different than what most might imagine. I tried to harm myself through anorexia as a teen. I constantly tore myself down mentally, too, telling myself I was a worthless little bitch on a daily basis.

Now, as an adult, I infrequently get episodes where I hit my head with my fists until there is some minor bruising. I've done it so much, once, that my vision went blurry.

However, I'm still not convinced I need any sort of help. It's partly because I stubbornly want to deal with this alone, and partly because I'm an undesirable person who doesn't deserve the help.

What do I do? Keep on facing this alone? Or should I seek professional help...I'm so confused, angry, and depressed.",09Jul2020,1

18,"I (16f) have been self harming in one way or another for a good portion of my life, to the point where I can't remember the exact age I started. For a long time I didn't even really know what I was doing because all I would do was hit or bite myself when I was alone, generally to the point where I would bruise or bleed slightly. It was only about a year ago that I realised what I had been doing for most of my life was self harm, and by then I had moved on to cutting.

My parents never noticed anything because I was a pretty hyperactive child who played a lot of sports, so they brushed off the cuts and bruises as normal kid stuff. Because of this they never realised I self harm. Recently I've been trying to stop cutting because I don't want scars, but I'm still self harming in other ways.

I thought I could do this alone but it's so much harder than I thought. I relapsed the other night, not for the first time, and I'm beginning to think I may need professional help.

I've never told anyone about this, mostly because my parents say people who self harm are attention seekers, but I think I need to tell someone. What should I do?",09Jul2020,1

20,"So what happened is I and my brother are about the same age, so I would talk to him mostly in the house. However he usually didn't care and just replied with ""oh, ok."" 

He would go hangout with our youngest brother (7M) and left me in our room alone. He would only make small talk with me when only the youngest played with his Ipad. So the whole day, several days, I would just sit in my room and read books. 

I couldn't take it so I said to him ""don't ever talk to me anymore."" Because if he doesn't make effort to talk to me, then it would be different if I cut him out of my life.

So I started to spend time with the youngest and make my brother in his room alone. After a week I ask him if he knew why I wouldn't talk to him, he replied ""because I spent too much time with the youngest"". 

Then I said I would forgive him because I knew that he is not a social and talkative person, I thought he would understand what it felt like to be ignored. However he said to me ""but you could still hang out with the youngest when I am not doing so."" So obviously he didn't get it, I just don't talk to him right now. And he still would say sorry.

25,"I hope you dont get bored reading, but I felt as if a background story was necessary for this case. This past November I met this girl online while playing games. At first we just played together alot and chatted on Steam. Overtime we became really close, like number/snapchat exchanged etc. I am reluctant to get to know anyone I meet online, especially if its a girl i met while playing games. But it blossomed into a great friendship, with it leading up to her saying she really loves me about a month in. I was shocked, but I also grew a deep affection for her. She was my type, very open with me and honestly she is one of the most fun people Ive been with. November into mid January we talked constantly over discord and snapchat, played games together etc etc. We became even closer, learned much about each other. It was honestly as if we were dating online, we would do most things people in a relationship.  Eventually she ends up blocking me cause she does not want a long distance, online relationship cause it ends up hurting. I agreed and moved on, but eventually she messaged me apologizing and it was back to being normal lovey dovey esque friends, and we did more and more relationship-esque things like facetime, watch shit together, do sexual shit with each other and whatever else. Keep in mind I was skeptical, I always asked if she had a boyfriend or other people she was talking to and she said no. I tried to make one hundred percent sure I wasn't going to be tricked or messed with by some random girl that just wants to hurt people.   


The same day she messaged me apologizing (in January) we met this cool teammate and invited them into my group (her and my irl friends in discord). As I said earlier, it was normal. However I began to notice that when we were around that new guy, she would act different toward me. Not mean or hateful, just not all there. Out of nowhere she blocked me mid competitive match, left. I asked the new guy where she went and he said she ""didnt like how i acted around her and it was too much for her to handle"" and since he talked to her more than me, he blocked me too. A week goes by and all of the sudden she messages me on discord apologizing like crazy and was upset. So, me just being glad she is back I forgive and move on. I noticed that the other guy wasn't around anymore, I was curious as to why, but I quickly forgot about it. This time I asked if we could continue the way we were before, loving each other. She said it was hard being around me cause she doesnt want to love someone so far away, and it just hurt her. She said that technically we wouldn't be dating, but could act like it. Fast forward to March and out of the blue she quickly tells me she has to leave real quick mid conversation and gets offline. However, she never just straight up left Steam offline, so I investigated and saw that she was actually online playing with the guy we met prior. So I told her I know, and she said she was just talking cause he blocked her around the same time we started talking again. That night me and the guy started to talk about it with each other. Apparently this girl was going back and forth between us. This guy had a wife, and this online girl i was involved with was talking to this guy, and almost ruined his home life with his wife, but the wife tried keeping this girl to make her husband happy. So both me and this guy were lied to and manipulated by this girl, essentially having two seperate relationships. We confronted her and she began to panic and get really upset, like alternating from sobbing to screaming. As it begins to calm we all agree to move on, and he says he isnt pursing her anymore. Girl and I hop into call, and she begins to talk different, but in a very sincere manner. She opened up more than ever, and talked to me and explained the situation and answered any questions about the lies she told and she gave me every single little detail about the situation. As it calmed down more she began to act silly and ""cute"" and tried to act as if nothing happened, which she did frequently whenever we had our differences.  


From this point these events happened from May until just two days ago. After the who love cube or whatever we could call it happened, we still all played with each other to maintain friendships. But a  another situation happens due to the guy and his wife trying to seduce her into a relationship again, which she declines cause she wanted to be with me. Eventually the guy just blocks us and leaves, deleted his discord and steam and disappeared. From then on out, she was dedicated to me and was completely honest with me and let me check her phone and messages on every platform to prove she wasnt lying anymore. Everything I questioned she answered with utmost honesty and always had proof if she thought it was needed. We got closer than ever before and honestly, I trusted her more than ever. We began to offically date and it was awesome. One day she came to me super upset and claimed she was conflicted, and she explained to me that while ALL of this stuff was going on she was also dealing with her on and off IRL boyfriend and didnt know what to do. She said she likes the idea of having open relationships, but the IRL guy doesnt know. I said we could continue dating (while they also date in real life) until a better solution comes along or something happens. But she started being gone more and more and recently we decided that its just to difficult for her to maintain it and try to consider the needs of two boyfriends. I began to realize I was literally cheating with this girl for months on this dude who has no idea whats going on.   


I want to make it clear while she was/is manipulative and lied a lot, she grew in the almost year I knew her. I knew without a doubt I could trust her near the end because her feelings were genuine and so were all of our conversations. She told me she just ended up loving multiple people, and admitted she was being selfish trying to make it secretly work with all of us. She wanted me to visit, but recently ended up getting a job and car. Her boyfriend had a past of being abusive and aggressive, but has since gone to therapy and gotten better. Now their relationship is getting better and she says she just can't throw away a 3 year relationship with him. She ended up conflicted because at the time we started loving each other, the IRL boyfriend was getting better, and she didnt think it would last but so far he is being a better partner. She said at first he was comfort, but then it got way better.  He brought up to her to move in with him, and she is planning on doing it within the year, if not a few months.   


Although it really hurt that we shared all of these really awesome memories that seemed to just be distant, and some really bad issues that ended up making us closer She knows what she did was wrong and constantly apologized since these events happened, it sucks just as we were starting to get really close, to the point of planning a meetup in August. Now she is conflicted and almost has to pick being with her boyfriend, because he still doesnt know. We had a long, tearful conversation yesterday for hours saying how much we love each other and wish it was so different. I understand her circumstance so I understood and now we kinda stopped and just play and talk less.   


I went on instagram yesterday and found her boyfriends insta, and part of me feels guilty and wants to tell him. But I want to stay her friend, cause i cherish our friendship. I know if i tell him she will probably dislike me, but not going to lie here I want her to learn what she did as well. I dont know what I should do, should I just try and forget about her. Im hurting so much and Im conflicted....",09Jul2020,1
26,"I'm new to this platform but I'll try to stay as concise as possible.

I dealt with lots of trauma at a young age, I wasnt aware of this until I became old enough to understand what happened. 


I was in a 1.5 year relationship 10 months ago. He ended it saying he wasnt ready to commit and that he wasnt ready to settle down and to play the field more. That he didnt except us to become that serious. I didnt take it well. 

He triggered my PTSD knowing my triggers and broke up with me in my vehicle that drove us everywhere (lots of memories) in my colleges parking lot 2 weeks into college. 

The trigger landed me in the hospital and I started medication and started caring for myself. 

My best friend at the time blamed my dissociation on me as I should not have been triggered by his actions. That everything I said and felt in the two weeks I was out of it were me just being bitter. He was fully aware that it would trigger me and later claimed he didnt think it would be that bad. 

It's been a long 10 months. I started my own business, worked up to legal assistant at the law firm I worked at straight out of highschool (2 years total), worked on my chronic pain, finally got a diagnosis of fibromyalgia and started to get help for it as well as starting to gain confidence.

My problem is no matter how hard I try I have lingering feelings for what we had. It's clear I am in a much better place now, he was my first everything and I feel like that's what's holding me back. 

Everytime I try to talk a potential partner I cant bring myself to be involved or interested in getting attached

So awhile ago me and my gf get in a stupid fight and we she breaks it off or I did in the heat of the moment and then next day she texts this guy saying “I think your cute as fuck and I pretty sure you thought I was weird in high school” , I know we weren’t together and she did it because she was mad or something that’s okay/fine. Anyways I get a bit jealous and suspicious when we get back together because she always had a notification from this guy and she told me he keeps
Hitting her up and they don’t really talk, so things were rough for us and were kind of on and off but mostly off due to me being a insecure. I go to her house to surprise kind of and we make up and she tells that they talked while we were broken up but it’s was probably when we were together too because shit was so messy, she confesses to me that he asked for nudes and switch went off in my head and I knew there was more ( she didn’t send any btw). 

I message this guy and he tells me everything and says when we were broken up( idk if we were broken up) she responded to his Snapchat story saying the meaning of life is too suck dick your dick( to a question that said what’s the meaning of life wrong answers only),  but he has a device that lets him know who says it.

Anyways he tells me that she initiated every conversation and they didn’t really talk but she seemed really interested that he played guitar and she told him to listen to music and shit, but he did say there was no flirted or anything or making plans and he thinks she did To make me mad. Essentially just talking but not really just short convos. I was mad because she talked to him after he knew what she said about him 

She tells me that she maybe started two conversations and that she tried to make it awkward and shit because she was embarrassed because she didn’t mean to say she wanted to suck his dick or anything, she tried to leave him on read but he’d hit her up and they really had short awkward conversations, they both told me and had since both blocked eachother on everything.  

Apparently this guy is a huge asshole and is mean to people and is really full to himself and that’s why my gf talked to him because she was afraid he’d start shit. I also blame myself for treating he bad and being an asshole when I could have tried to be more civil.

I’ve just gotten a lot of answers saying this isn’t a big deal and break up like just answer all over the board 

She’s trying really hard to make things work and I did break up with her for awhile and I realized how much she regretted doing this and that she didn’t say anything was lying and she was afraid I’d blow up if she told the truth.  I know it’s not cheating but sometimes it lingers around. But I do feel like a better person around her and a happier person with her and overall more relieved. I think maybe she did something like this out of anger,",09Jul2020,1

The city I live in no longer excites me but I can’t imagine myself anywhere else. My family situation is complicated and toxic so I don’t want to move back in with them by any means.

36,"The guy I have messaged for a few days now has become increasingly less engaging. I messaged him first on r4r. I enjoy that we have a large majority of similar interests. However, I feel the conversations are one-sided. I think he is a good person and can be fun, but he is not putting the effort in the conversations. I feel like I am putting too much effort into something that is going nowhere. For example, I will send him a few paragraphs with questions about him, his interests, and make jokes. He doesn't acknowledge the jokes and some of the things I ask. He also, does not reciprocate with questions about me. He responds to my questions with one sentence and not enough for me to go deeper in. I am struggling to figure out what to say next to keep it interesting. It feels more of a task than a natural occurrence. I feel as though, his conversation skills are a bit lacking. I reached out to be friends with him, but it seems to be a lot of work without real progress or a connection. Perhaps, my expectations are too high. Am I wrong for feeling this way? Do I expect too much? Anyways, how do I let him know that I am no longer engaged and interested without ghosting him and or hurting his feelings?",09Jul2020,1

I had a refrigerator in a kitchen where there were cockroaches. (I even find a few inside it and inside the freezer, weird, huh?)  
I move it to my house and yesterday I unplug it and left the door open to clean the freezer and I saw one on the door.  
I am afraid that there are some inside the refrigerator (not the place of the food, instead of the engine /electric part.

39,"I'm going to try to make a long story short.

On Wednesday (7/1) I called Medicare to file an LOA with my specialty pharmacy in order to get a life saving drug delivered to me and have WellCare cover it (SC Medicare plan). This pharmacy is one of the only 6 pharmacies in the US that carries this medication. I spoke with a representative (after being transfered around for hours to different people) who stated they would open the LOA claim and that it would take 24-48 hours to get it finalized. 

Fast forward to yesterday (7/7), after calling them every day from 7/1, they said I never filed an LOA. Apparently I the original rep I spoke with said they would open the file but then lied and never did. So, the rep I spoke with yesterday said they would open the claim and escalate it to the highest order, being essentially corporate. The rep stated that someone would be in contact with me within 24 hours from that moment.

Fast forward again to today, I still never received a phone call so I decided to take the initiate and call them myself. after being transferred multiple times and even hung up on, I spoke with a rep who said their manager would contact me by the end of day. I have not heard anything from them.

Now I have to call Medicaid AGAIN in the morning and figure out why the hell they can't simply get this one issue resolved. I'm now currently on day 7 of being without this time sensitive and expensive medications and have no clue how I can get a fire lit under these people's asses. Both me and my pharmacy have contacted them every day of the week, had a three-way conference call, and even spoke for HOURS at a time with these people and yet no progress has been made. It now seems to me that they're purposefully trying to give me the run-around based on the horrible experience I've had.

How can I get this resolved? I've tried everything. Thanks for any advice you guys can provide. I'm sure there's someone out there who understand the pain of dealing with this BS

40,"Okay, so a little context; this neighbour is the most rude, obnoxious, racist piece of shit that ever lived. She's insulted my family, called my mum a bitch, ranted to our landord (we share one) about me and my family being immigrants (she's always talking shit about us to our landord. She's accused us of having too many pets, having trash, having an old car parked in front of our house, having too many plants in our garden, and other dumb shit), constantly tries to run us over (It's happened a few times where someone would be walking and this cunt just keeps driving in our direction until we jump out of the way), and she's ALWAYS throwing us a dirty look, like we're the scum of earth. I think in the 8 years we've been living here we've only spoken once and that's when she insulted my mum.

He drinks alcohol a lot and used to get so drunk he could barely walk, he has gotten a bit better, the only problem is he doesn’t want to get better, he doesn’t really care. He sneaks out of the house to go buy more, I think he’a afraid we will judge him. My mom is kinda mean and doesn’t understand so she will get mad at him for drinking or smoking and whenever he improves she says something like “that doesn’t matter. You still drink” so I try and congratulate him and show him that I’m proud, but it’s not the same. One night he called me over and I sat with him a bit and he cried and told me about how he feels like he could go back to sleep when he wakes up but can’t cause he isn’t tired. He told me about how he is numb and has nothing to look forward to and he wants to end it all. He hasn’t had any friends since high school (he’s almost 50) he is very antisocial and works from home most of the time so he doesn’t really have a chance to make any. I’ve tried helping him find some hobbies but he just doesn’t want to do anything. He likes music and listens to that from time to time except whenever he sends me a song it’s always super sad and about being numb.

45,"My friend, let's call her Jessie, and I met through living together. Flashback to 2018, she was a random Craigslist person who came into my apartment to take over my other housemate's lease. We lived together for about 4 months, and I moved to the other side of our state. We stayed in contact and have travelled together, hung out multiple times, and have celebrated birthdays together. I've always known she is conservative Christian and that she voted for Trump in 2016. Her father is also a retired cop. 

Recently, I've started to see a weird side of her on Instagram as what seems to be retaliation to the BLM movement and open talks of immigration and the like. On July 4th she posted a text IG story that said ""if you're an immigrant in the US who isn't happy, please leave and make room for immigrants who will be grateful here"" and then today she posted ""where we go 1 we go all"" which is the QAnon slogan. 

I am a POC and had felt a strong urge to confront her or at least ask about it, but don't know how to approach it. I value her friendship, and whenever we are together we have a great time just talking about life and work and relationships....but I'm starting to get to a place where I'm nervous our values are too different.

46,"Long story short I was extremely unsatisfied with life growing up with my single mother. She was a good mom but her illegal immigrant status had limits and we were very poor. At an early age, I promised myself I would make a better life for my mother and me. I finally graduated college with a CS degree and I got an amazing mentor through a research program and now my mentor is encouraging me to do my masters at the same school. Which I really want to do. However, the problem is that my mom lives with family far away from the school I have been attending for the past four years. Currently, I have a remote summer job while living off-campus due to the bad environment back home. My mother is 60 and working a labor intensive job. My original plan was to graduate and get a good paying job to provide for us and she could leave her job. However, because I will get a discounted rate for my MS I will be missing out on an opportunity. Eventually, I want to get my Ph.D. and if I miss out on this (I am leaving a lot of details out) it will take so much longer to reach my goal and I will live in regret. I know it's all in my head and she is still capable of working but my heart aches because I feel like I am not sticking to the plan and thinking of her working makes me depressed. I can't afford for us to live together near the school if I am a full-time student because she will have absolutely no job (undocumented). She doesn't know English and she's old, she is not very useful. So I would be stuck with her not having a job while having to pay for both our bills while doing school. I could do part-time at a different college near my hometown while working full time but that wouldn't be the best option due to missing details.

48,"I think my girlfriend is becoming a depressive person because of, mostly, her mom, and I don't know how to help. There's unfortunately many other things that is making her life difficult, but her mom is most likely the biggest problem she has to deal with.

First, let me talk about my gf: she lives with her mom and her younger brother (8 years old) in a rather poor neighborhood, while her father have been living and working in Japan for around 6 years now, i think (her parents are not divorced, though). He works there and sends them money every month. She has self esteem issues and can't deal very well with pressure. She graduated last year but still couldn't get her diploma yet due to Covid. She never had a job and is looking for one now but, because of Covid, things aren't exactly easy. We've also been dating for over 2 years now.

Now, Her mother. I visit their house almost every week since we started dating, and from all the time I've been there and talking to my gf, I can say that her mother... Has a lot of problems. I don't know everything she has, but some of the things I know are that she is overwheight, has heart problems, diabetes, psychological problems (like  schizophrenia and depression) and takes lots of medicine everyday. She also attends to terapy and other psychological treatments (but again, they live in a poor neighboorhood, so those places aren't exactly the best). While she is not a bad person, she is not exactly a good person either (she is pretty much what you would expect from an old person that thinks boys can't cry and girls should have babies).

Their relationship (my gf and her mother) is a rollercoaster, except I rarely see ""happy moments"". It usually goes from ""Not bad"" to ""This sucks real bad"". Because of all the problems her mother have, my gf is actually the one that ends up taking care of the house, cleaning things, making food and buying groceries.

And there is the first problem: While her mother does have lots of problems, she is not incapable of doing these things. I wouldn't be fair saying she never do the house work, but most times, it's my gf (and even me, when I'm visiting). And that pisses my gf off because if she doesn't do something, not only her mother won't do it either, but will complain about how she didn't do it.

Another example that pisses my gf off is with cooking food. Usually, my gf does it, but most times when her mother need to do it, she actually doesn't, and order food instead of cooking anything. It's like she is refusing to cook just because she can buy food, while my gf HAS to cook. Not only that, but usually she orders junk food, which not only isn't healthy, but I'm actually worried about my gf and her younger brother health. He is 8yo and is almost obese, and already eats twice as much as me! When it comes to food, her mother spoils the kid A LOT.

Now, you've might been thinking ""Why doesn't your gf talk to her mom about this?"", but it's not so easy. Everytime my gf and her mother end up having a fight, her mother health and psychological problems kicks in. She starts to get either aggressive, talking horrible things to my gf (she even hit her once, before we started dating), or depressive, saying how horrible of a mom she is and that she should just kill herself, and sometimes her pressure and heart also gets in the mix, making her feel ill and dizzy. So, basically, my gf doesn't like discussing these things with her mother because she worries about her health and doesn't want to make things worse.

And that is an horrible thing for my gf. She has to deal with this person 24/7, basically taking care of 2 ""kids"" (her brother and her mom), and everytime she tries to discuss matters with her mother, she victimizes herself and get depressed, but doesn't change a thing. Her father apparently doesn't care about these things, saying my gf should ""Deal with it and take care of her mother"".

Their house isn't exactly the most welcoming place either. It's humid and get almost no sunlight. It's full of old boxes everywhere and it's basically dusty even when you clean it.

She keeps saying how she wants to leave that house and live alone, and we've actually been wanting to rent an appartment and live together, but unfortunately, this isn't something we can do right now. And this also brings other problems related to her mother. She is WAY dependent on my gf, and me and my gf honestly feel she wouldn't be able to live decently without my gf around. Also, her dad isn't found of the idea, and thinks my gf should take care of her mother.

My gf is feeling really lost and helpless right now. She is losing her will to try to do things because she feels like no matter what she does, nothing changes. She doesn't have money and can't find a job, and she doesn't want to deal with her mother (and other people) that lives around her, but she has no choice but to accept it. She says to me that she cries to sleep almost every night, and I've actually seen it happening more than once.

What I'm gonna say now will sound very selfish, but... I feel like I'm the only good thing she has in her life right now. I feel like when she comes to my house, is almost like she can finally rest for a little. She actually told me that, before we started dating, she felt like trash and didn't really took care of her health and higyene because she didn't have the will to do it. I really wish I could be there for her more, but... I can't do it for a variety of reasons (work, family, etc.). And because of Covid, we've actually been seeing each other less, which only makes things worse...

As her boyfriend, it's hurts me too much to talk to her and see her going though this, and not being able to do anything but to hear her and visit her once in a while... I feel like... All of this is out of control and the only thing I can do is watch her burn. I don't want that. I want to help her. I keep telling her that my only job as her boyfriend is to make her happy, but honestly... I feel like I'm failing at this job...",09Jul2020,1

51,"I'm a 26 year old male. Have struggled with social anxiety and making friends my entire life.

Anyway, it's been a long journey towards getting my life together. Over the past several years I moved out of my parents' house in the suburbs into an apartment in the city. Started going to some meetups regularly, getting to know people from work, in general making acquaintances that maybe could have eventually turned into friendships. I would go out a reasonable amount, had vacations and concerts planned, and it felt like my life was moving in the right direction.

Then lockdown happened. All my plans were cancelled. There was nothing to do in the city so eventually I ended up moving back in with my parents. Now, it feels like my life has reverted to the way things were years ago, which I worked so hard to get past - wake up, work (which I'm very fortunate to be able to do remotely), have dinner with parents, play video games, go to bed, and repeat. My biggest excitements in life are occasionally hanging out with my old high school friends or going to family gatherings. And the worst part about it is, there's no end in sight.

I'm just pretty bummed because it feels like all the progress I've made these past few years has vanished, and I won't even be able to start building my life up again until there's a vaccine in a year or something. I was wondering if anyone has any advice on how to think about this, or maybe ways to start moving in the right direction again during quarantine?",09Jul2020,1

I guess my question is, should I seek out getting those vaccinations on my own? Any advice would be greatly appreciated

53,"I am a 20 year old female going into my junior year of college soon. I am petrified. My freshman year was a mess. I had a 1.8 avg gpa and was being emotionally abused and manipulated by someone who was completely codependent on me. The two of us had a lot of trouble with various substances, and I ended up overdosing a day before one of my finals (still got a 96% tho lol). 

My sophomore year was much worse, as I tried to split from this person who retaliated by threatening me, destroying my things, kicking me out of our shared room (I had to sleep at my student center and at friends’ places for about a month). Police had to be called several times bc of them and last I saw of them they were being detained by multiple officers. I was so distressed I ended up hospitalized for severe suicidal ideation and substance abuse TWICE within the fall semester. 

Second semester was better, but still bad, as I had struggled with self confidence, making friends, horrible nightmares and anxiety as a result of all that had happened (frankly, I shouldn’t have come back that spring semester). Then covid struck, and I came home early. Although covid is awful, if i’m being honest, the time off at home without the FOMO was extremely good for me. 

(side note: I ended up with a 3.5 fall semester and 3.9 spring semester, proud of myself!)

I’ve been in a better place this summer. On a high dose of an antidepressant and feeling less depressed but still with quite a bit of anxiety. 

But, it’s beginning to come back as I realize how close college is rolling around. I have this pit of anxiety and fear in me, and my depression is coming back as a direct result. So I ask of you kind listeners, what can I do? What should I keep in mind this coming year? How can I keep
myself stable? More importantly, how can I finally make friends after all the shit that stopped me from doing so? any wise words, recommendations, comfort, or advice is welcome. I want to be excited to go back. not afraid.

57,"Hey everyone. So I have posted on here before regarding my relationship problems with my boyfriend and so this has been on my mind all day. So when we first started dating (we originally had an open relationship), he would always talk about having sex with other women whenever me and/or our friends were around, would have sex with one of his friends (I wasn't friends with her), and would ask me to find women (I'm bisexual) to join our open relationship. However, I would tell him I am not into threesomes and he would get extremely jealous whenever a guy gave me attention and would tell me not to have sex with any of my guy friends (despite the fact he was having sex with his friend that's a girl). Our relationship has been rocky for a while, especially when after the fact we decided to not have sex with any of our friends, he ended up having sex with his same girl friend when he went back to campus. 

About a month ago, my boyfriend, one of his guy friends, and I all talked on FaceTime and that was my first time I spoke to his friend. After my boyfriend went to bed, his friend and I started texting, thinking he wasn't flirting with me. But, he told me he was attracted to me since he added me on snao and started sending me pics. At the time, I was pissed at my boyfriend for what he did when he went back to campus so I sent his friend pics too. He started talking about how he wants to have sex with me when I come back and even though my boyfriend had sex with his girl friend, I felt uneasy talking to his friend about that because I knew that my boyfriend would get pissed off. 

Currently, his friend doesn't talk to me anymore since he started dating a girl he met not too long ago and unadded me on snapchat. I knew he only talked to me because he wanted to have sex and not be friends, but idk what to do now. My boyfriend and I are on good terms right now and he seems to be trying to be a better person now, but I feel guilty for doing what his friend and I did. Anything I should do?",09Jul2020,1
58,"Ok so I’ve known this girl since second grade, and shes been my declared best friend. We’ve had our ups and downs like a freaking lot. But recently as in the last three years it’s only been down. First year we drifted, second year it was like polite nods in the hallway, last summer of second year we started talking a lot like everyday, and beginning of third year it became all about her new boyfriend and she became a crappy friend and I was trying to keep emotions out of it and was thinking like “ she’s just a boy crazy teen, she’ll realize it sooner or later”. She realized it, started going for rebound dudes, and we were normal again. This summer we haven’t had school so we started talking about important stuff that actually mattered. I’ve always wanted to talk about stuff like this cuz it interested me, but she was never into like world events or whatever, and I was like “ it’s just cuz she’s in 3/4/5/6/7th grade and isn’t interested so I’ve been ok with keeping the convo casual. But now when we disagree in stuff it’s always me being childish. We were talking about pancakes and waffles (waffles are better) and I was giving dramatic examples of why waffles were better  like “ waffles may have came second, but that’s only because pancakes couldn’t satisfy anyone’s needs for the perfect amount of toppings”  and she said I was being childish and she wasn’t going to do this. And that I was supposed to be older. And recently I’ve come to realize that instead of being raised with a religion, I’d like to figure it out myself. It’s always been a weird topic for us, I’m usually down to talk about anything but not that one because she’s always try and convert me to her religion. Well I was talking about how my day was (cuz she asked) and I told her about how I was about to do something awful but then like karma or the universe or whatever’s out there stoped me. And she was all talking bout how it was god or whatever and the universe didn’t do anything. And I asked her to stop because I didn’t want to argue about something that neither of us could be right on. She said she wouldn’t stop talking about it because it’s her job to convert people to her religion and that she didn’t want me to go to hell. So once again politely ask her to change the topic or how I didn’t feel ok talking about something that can be so biased. She said she just wanted me to go to heaven and she wanted to save me from believing in the universe or karma or Mother Nature and to stop looking at zodiac sign stuff. So the next day she responds again because I decide I need a breather and need to think to see if I said anything offensive or wrong. I go to my other friends house and tell her everything so I can get a unfiltered opinion and she agreed with me but later my best friends other best friend texts me and she told her everything so now the friend who’s house I’m at and the random girl that texted me are going back and forth and we’re obviously speaking through both of them. I take another day breather and text her again this morning to come to find out that she’s blocked me. I want to know if she’s actually my best friend and if I was in the wrong 
TLDR: my friend is religious and I’m trying to figure it out and I asked her to stop trying to convert me for the moment and she said no and got upset and blocked me, is she my friend?",09Jul2020,1

62,"I will be very brief, because I want to keep my idea mine. Anywho, here's the problem:

* **I'm currently a student**
* **No start-up capital (i'm broke asf)**
* **I have little expertise in the subjects required**

My idea will consist of extensive GIS mapping, with integration to an ios/android app, and integration with data that changes rapidly (every moment). I would like it to cover the entire United States, but realize I may be better off starting in a particular geographic area to keep costs down upfront. 

This is what the app should be able to do if I can make it work properly: Using all the data from various layers in real time the app should be able to spit out what the service provider/industry professional should do that would be most efficient/profitable etc. (leaving out keywords that would give away industry.

I have two business models that i'm considering:

1. **License software/app to service providers in relevant field (i'm leaning this way because this app could put the service providers out of a job altogether by automation, but also the general public may not understand how to correctly use the app for their benefit).**
2. **License software/app to the general public (would be for a certain industry) and charge an upfront cost, and a subscription cost.** 

My issues: I don't know where to start on this project, I have no money, and don't know who to trust as far as going public with this idea and finding people who would like to help. My degree is relevant for technical knowledge of the subject, but I still don't know anything about making applications/software, and my GIS experience has been pretty vague so far.",09Jul2020,1

For some context, my mom vaxxinated me until I was around 5 years old when my brother was born and she ""did her research"". My little brother has several food allergies (one of which is severe) and I suspect this may be because he is unvaxxinated.

I am 13 years old and a male, my mom is STRICTLY anti-vax and my dad just agrees with whatever my mom says because he could not care less. Last year while on vacation, I contracted the flu which then became Pneumonia and the Bronchitis. I suspect this may have happened because I am unvaxxinated.

70,"My Fiancé and I have been engaged since March. When we met we were friends for about a year and he mentioned once (while we were friends) that his ex did not have any student loan debt. She came from an affluent family and she studied abroad in Paris.

My Fiancé has also paid off his student loan debt and I know how important that is to him. Enter me. I have a 70k student loan debt and it looms over my head.

The thing is that I work in IT and I just started my career in technology and I know this career will take me to a place where I can afford the lifestyle my Fiancé and I want.

78,"This will be a fairly long post, sorry if it drags on. Really need advice.. if you've been through something similar please reach out...

I am a 28F living with my son, Julian(J) and his father, Nick(N). We live about 10 minutes away from my parents... which crushes me. Even though they are so close I feel like my father is on the other side of the damn world. J even goes to their house every single Saturday for 10 hours at a time and spends time with not just my lovely mother but my demonic father as well. The strange thing, and don’t get me wrong it’s great, is that he treats J SO differently from how he treated me growing up. F is kind, caring, calm, patient, loving and just other really great qualities when he’s with J. It makes me think that there’s something wrong with me and J is just a better kid and that’s why F treated me poorly and him amazing. Oddly enough I have a fantastic 10 out of 10 star relationship with my mother but a negative 1000000000 out of 10 with my father. I even started telling people I meet who ask about F that F's dead so they’ll change the subject quickly and not force me to think about him. Anyways, I suppose I’ll give you some back story so you can understand why it's SO difficult for me to rekindle a relationship with F. To write out even a fraction of the b.s F has put me through would take the better part of a year so I’ll just speak about some main events and actions that contribute to me feeling the way I do about him.

Probably best to start from my younger years and extend onto adulthood so hear it goes…

Right before I stared kindergarten, M started college to better our lives which left F to take care of me the majority of the time. Up until that point I had barley spent time with F but thought of him as a good person and someone who keeps me safe. He was my teddy bear. My parents couldn’t afford daycare so after school F would pick me up and bring me to his restaurant. I’d sit at the back table and color or whatever until closing time around 4pm (it was a lunch place) then we’d go home. I was terrified to go home every single day. We’d do homework, eat and sleep. M left when I went to school and came home after I'd gone to bed which meant I rarely saw her. I was also to naive to know to tell M that something was wrong; I failed to realize there was even an abnormality. Homework time was a fucking nightmare. He’s a very big man with a deep voice. No one fucks with my dad, he’s very scary when he wants to be so to a small child this towering monster getting angry was traumatizing. I have a learning disability that wasn't discovered until much later. Because of this it makes tasks that are simple to others very difficult for me. He did not understand this and I really don’t think he cared. I believe that it was his chance to explode and unwind at the end of the day by yelling at me. He’d get right in my face screaming calling me an idiot, loser, moron, saying I would never amount to anything because “You’re just too fucking stupid, STUPID. STUPID.” I actually started believing this and doing even worse in school, I became withdrawn and depressed.

Once grade 1 started he began drinking. Until this point in his life alcohol was a foreign substance. Oh boy … when he started he fucking started... hard. He was always careful to be nice when my mom was around but when she wasn’t he turned into Satan. One time he made me wait to go to the bathroom so long I pissed myself around 4 years old … to give you an example. He gave beer to my mothers cat so much that the cat developed kidney issue and died. In my opinion it was all the beer. He also gave me beer because he thought it was funny to get a child drunk. In the years that passed he did this to my cousin sometimes too. F maintained a healthy appetite for booze and would eventually develop an even hungrier appetite for downers (oxys, vicodin etc.).

Fast forward to grade 10. Everything was going great aside from my home life. I loved high school, my friends, even the teachers. Was on honor role but still screwed around when I knew I could get away with it. I skipped classes sometimes, experimented with pot and liquor.,, normal teenage rebellion type stuff. My grades were decent, friends totally cool and I even had an after school job. Life was swell… until it wasn’t. What I’m about to discuss is something I keep to myself. I won’t go into too many details and I”ll try to keep it short. Everything changed for me after this event. My life was completely derailed. I still wonder how far I’d be now in life if he never did this.  From that day on nothing was ok… so many awful things resulted from me trying to deal with the trauma from that time. To condense it, I began drugs and drinking heavily which led me into awful situations and ultimately a horrific few years that followed, some of which events are a thousand times worse than what I’m about to tell you.

As mentioned above I had an after school job, it was at a local coffee shop and I just adored it. I had skipped class on this day of reckoning and then went to work my 6 hour shift. It began with a phone call. F used his landline phone to call the coffee shops landline phone (this will be relevant later). My manager Tim (T) picked up and told me it was for me. He said “I don’t know what kind of weird friends you have but tell them not to call here. The guy sounds really angry and like.. messed up.” I knew who it was when T said this. When F got messed up he went balls to the mother fuckin wall, way beyond the normal addicts limit. I pick up the phone and basically from what I could understand (his mouth was pressed against the microphone and on a landline if you do that you can barley make out whats being said) the school called him and told him I had skipped class. He was in a full on rage, very drunk and stoned. He demanded I come home immediately but I told him I couldn’t just leave work during peak hours. I was terrified of what would happen if I went home. I had never heard him this angry before... believe it or not. I hung up and continued working out front. He called over and over again even though T told him to stop. He finally stopped calling when T threatened to call the cops for harassment. The phone went silent after that. My lizard brain must have been active that night because I knew in my heart that this was far from over.

Twenty minutes later my father materialized in front of the shop. His face beet red, eyes blood shot, sweat coating his face, fists clenched. I was fucking horrified. I completely froze. He pulled me out from behind the counter and made me sit at a table and then sat across from me. Most of what he was saying was incoherent but it was loud and full of swearing and put downs. The main point that he made. “If you dare fucking come home tonight I will throw not only you but your mother on the streets”. He finally left after I pulled out my cell and dialed 911.

I was way too frightened to return home. M called me to ask if I knew where F was I told her he had showed up at my work and gone crazy and that I wouldn't be returning home that night. I didn’t tell her until years later about my dads ultimatum in order to spare her feelings. I realize now I should have told her immediately. The shitty thing though; when I finally told her she said, “Don’t tell me that! I don’t want to hear it. Just anything bad don’t tell me.” My mother was and is still a massive enabler who buries her head in the sand and pops it up only when it suits her agenda. I love M but.. sometimes it just shatters my heart and soul to know they value appearances and, I don’t know how to say this right without sounding bad, but each other over their own child. I simply said “no, I’m not coming home” hung up and went back to work. Basically I winded up being homeless in a matter of days when I ran out of places to stay. Eventually my mom managed to track me down. We all met at a restaurant and laid out rules they would abide by so I would come home. I didn’t know until that moment that my dad had completely blacked out the event. He had no idea he threw me out. So I had been living in the streets getting assaulted, pan handling, sleeping in parks and just plain down in the dumps for no fucking reason. 

I was able to forgive him surprisingly and we maintained a solid relationship once I began using and drinking with him. He knew full well he had kicked me out and what he said about throwing my mom on the streets because he asked me to tell him what happened that night at my work. Eventually I got sober and we hung out a lot less but were still ok. Well, about 3 years ago while at my uncles house it was revealed that my father told everyone that I, NOT him, was the reason I left home and according to them it was because I was a spoiled brat and drug addict (neither were true at the time). I was livid. I lost it on M when she dropped off my son the next day and told her I was never speaking to them again. Eventually it blew over and I spoke to them again. 

Things were not good but not bad with F. Then he had to pull a fucking classic ""F move"". J, N and I were staying at their house overnight. F smokes, as do I, which is fine. He normally doesn’t smoke in the house and my mother doesn’t allow him to but if you know F you know that God himself couldn’t bend F’s stubborn ass boomer will. A few times before he had smoked in the house while J sleept upstairs and I told him not to. He promised he wouldn’t. The vent in our room was right above where F smokes in the house (his mancave). I came downstairs because J was coughing and wheezing from all the smoke. I politely said “Listen F, I know you’ve been smoking in the house again bu-“. He cuts me off and bitches and says he isn’t blah, blah, lies and bull shit. “Listen F, I know you are just stop.”. Which he said next was the straw that broke the camels back. He goes “Well don’t blame me blame you’re pussy of a fiance. J has pussy lungs because his father’s a faggot”. I was shaking on the inside standing still. With zero emotion showing on my face I turned and went back upstairs. Since then our relationship has been on existent. It really breaks my heart so much that J and F have this awesome amazing relationship and that M is always going on and on about how great F is with her and J. This makes me wonder...for some reason he just treats me like total garbage...why? This question keeps me awake at night.

I seriously want to reconnect with my father despite everything he’s done but he’s shown nil interest. He didn’t even call me on my Bday despite me calling him for father’s day and his bday and the fact that F called for J’s Bday. He refuses to call me unless I call him and has even said to me “I love fluffy (their dog) more than you” not that long ago. When I was drinking and using with him our relationship was beautiful believe it or not. We got along fantastic. I just want that happiness and acceptance from my father, minus the drugs obviously.

I’ve tried calling him but he always keeps the conversation short. As cliché as this is about to sound; I just want my dad to love me. I just want a relationship with him. 

How do I go about doing this? I really have zero idea. To any of you out there who are awesome enough to get through this long post.. please help with some thoughts or advice. Especially anyone who's going through or has been through a similar situation. I just want my father in my life... Thanks for reading.",09Jul2020,1
79,"Okay so this is whats happening.

In february i matched with this girl on tinder who i’ve been interested in since i first saw her in my school about a years ago. Im 20 and she’s 18.

Half a year later i matched with her on tinder and we started talking, she was very flirty at first and always texted me goodnight before going to sleep, we talked all night om the phone several times and about two months after we started talking we started seeing eachother, we slept together maybe 5 times but we didnt do anything sexual what so ever. Every time we were gonna meet she always texted me while i was on my way to pick her up that she couldnt have sex cus she was on her period, or her vagina was hurting or whatever reason, which was fine of course since i really liked this girl. We also went out to eat and i gave her rides a lot just to be able to see her as she was working a lot at the time while i was on a reduced schedule due to COVID. After a while she told me outta nowhere in a text that she cant have sex with me cus she’d get a guilty conscience since she apperantly is friends with my ex girlfriend. She knew this all along, that she never was gonna do anything sexual with me at all, but now she suddenly wouldnt see me anymore cus she felt bad. She and my ex arent close friend at all, theyre more aquintaces, they only hangout in big groups or at parties. So this obviously hurt my feelings a lot. And now she wants to be my friend, and i really love her both emotionaly and as a person so i was fine with that for now as i thought she’d change her mind and stop caring what my ex thinks about us after a while. That hasnt quite worked out and its been 2 weeks since we stopped seeing eachother, we’ve been texting and snapchatting as usual until today when i noticed in some snaps that she was in a house i’ve never seen her in before so i asked her who she was with and she only said which town she was in and not who she was with, which was my question. And i know what boy she’s with since we’re kinda aquinted and ive seen that he’s her best friend on snapchat. Im so fucking hurt and i don’t know what to do, i can’t have her in my life as just a friend watching her as she dates other guys, so what do i do? How do i get rid of her and get over her, without hurting her feelings as i still care about her deeply. I just cant handle having her in my life as it is now, please help",09Jul2020,1

81,"hi everyone,

I'm new to this so I don't know if this is the right forum. I have been dealing with an internal issue that has been eating at me and I needed some advice. A few years ago I applied to a modeling agency ad with this guy name Michael except that it wasn't really what they said it was when I got there. Long story short, the guys pressured and talked me into signing off some paperwork and doing sex with guys on camera. At one point I even called my parents to help get me out, cops were called and everything. But it didn't really change the outcome and they were all sent away. Michael convinced to tell them I was there willingly and my parents were told if they wanted to wait they can wait in the lobby of the hotel. We cried over this. It was extremely traumatizing.

3 scenes and couple years later, the videos are posted everywhere. I have anxiety about it to this day. I am scared to death I will be recognize. I have a bf and baby boy who I love (they don't know about it), and I am afraid my life will be ruined if I am exposed.

I recently checked on one of the videos and I saw there were over 10 million views. I hyperventilated and got into a panic attack. I read every one of the 100 comment hoping nobody recognizes me in person. I had been recognized before by one of my younger brothers friends and it caused our family a lot of pain. My brother was teased mercilessly.

I know it is not healthy, but everyday I go check on the video to see the comments and views hoping they won't spike. I clicked on the ""flag video"" option for each of them and put in things like ""underage - please remove"" but nothing happens. they don't even respond to my emails. I even tried using other email accounts.

He will definitely leave me if he does, as the videos were made when we were already together. I really didn't mean to.

I don't know what to do. I know I am an awful person. I wish there was some way I could flag the videos to get them removed. I am stressing out. I just want my family to be happy. I don't want anything to come back on us. I don't know what to do.",09Jul2020,1

I suffer from really bad anxious thoughts, insomnia, nightmares, etc. I also have trouble focusing or working on anything, even though I was labelled a gifted student before the abuse happened. I've never gotten help before because I was waiting for when I turned 18 (my family never wanted to admit something was off about me). I was still scared so I ended up waiting too long, and then corona happened so I had to move back into my family's home and couldn't get help again. 

I'm not sure if I should seek a psychiatrist or a psychologist first. I've messaged a psychologist and I think they're the only person I can afford to see for an assessment at the moment. I'm worried that if therapy doesn't work and I need medication, I'll have to go to a psychoatrist and pay for another diagnosis, which I can't afford. 
Does anyone know how this work? If a psychologist diagnoses me with something, do I have to get checked again by a psychiatrist before getting a prescription? Or does his diagnosis just get placed in my medical record like everything else?

86,"Well fuck, life is shit. 

So as you’re all probably aware lockdowns been quite difficult for everyone in some ways and others. 

I’m in the British Army and for the most part the camps been pretty safe from the virus and I’m not doing too badly even though the job currently means I can’t see my girlfriend of a year every day. My girlfriend who I do still manage to see regularly due to her close proximity to the camp has taken it pretty badly. To put it bluntly we’ve been each other’s rock for our entire relationship, her family is broken and in and out of prison and she’s the most sweet, innocent and good natured woman out there who’s been abused and bullied by pretty much everyone in her life. This has resulted in social anxiety and extreme depression which is no easy beast to tame. 

I’ve always supported her and been her helping hand in stepping into the real world but this year has been a train wreck for her, unfortunately her grandad passed away recently and her depression has been the worst I’ve ever seen it. While the last few weeks I’ve cheered her up it’s still culminated into an argument after she refuses to get help, I feel like shit because in her view her boyfriend has turned against her when that’s not the case. Work for her is extremely stressful now she’s gone back and she’s already been dealing with depression so it’s gotten to a point where she feels absolutely nothing about anything. 

After the last day or so the arguing (over text) resulted in our relationship being thrust into the main spot of her depression and while we both admit the feelings haven’t changed after this argument she says she’s seen me in a different light which I feel awful about as I’ve only tried to help her. Only hours ago I took her for a drive and talked about everything and she just has no feeling about anything due to her mental health and it ended up with us breaking up I guess? But neither of us have fully said we have even though it happened as she wanted time to think but also believes it’s not fair to put me through it or pressure on herself. The thing I can’t understand is why that can’t mean we at least try instead of defaulting to pushing me and everyone away? She doesn’t want the pressure when she doesn’t know what to think or feel about anything which I understand completely but will block me out and won’t let us try to solve it now. 

I don’t know, I’m so confused as my entire relationship has kind of ended in hours when we had so much planned and she was my absolute rock. I don’t know whether I should attempt to put the relationship on hold and try to get help or just stay weirdly broken up and let things be? Just fucked. In complete honesty to  we both still care about each other. 

I guess my question is has anyone dealt with a partner who suffers from depression and social anxiety and how they’ve deal with that person at their worst when the relationship is at stake?

88,"The girl i love is seeing someone else and left me because she felt bad about my ex gf

Okay so this is whats happening.

In february i matched with this girl on tinder who i’ve been interested in since i first saw her in my school about a years ago. Im 20 and she’s 18.

Half a year later i matched with her on tinder and we started talking, 
she was very flirty at first and always texted me goodnight before going to sleep, 
we talked all night om the phone several times and about two months after we started talking we started seeing eachother, 
we slept together maybe 5 times but we didnt do anything sexual what so ever. 

Every time we were gonna meet she always texted me while i was on my way to pick her up that she couldnt have sex cus she was on her period, or her vagina was hurting or whatever reason, 
which was fine of course since i really liked this girl. 
We also went out to eat and i gave her rides a lot just to be able to see her as she was working a lot at the time while i was on a reduced schedule due to COVID. 
After a while she told me outta nowhere in a text that she cant have sex with me cus she’d get a guilty conscience since she apperantly is friends with my ex girlfriend. 
She knew this all along, that she never was gonna do anything sexual with me at all, but now she suddenly wouldnt see me anymore cus she felt bad. 
She and my ex arent close friend at all, theyre more aquintaces, they only hangout in big groups or at parties. 
So this obviously hurt my feelings a lot. And now she wants to be my friend, and i really love her both emotionaly and as a person so i was fine with that for now as i thought she’d change her mind and stop caring what my ex thinks about us after a while. 
That hasnt quite worked out and its been 2 weeks since we stopped seeing eachother, we’ve been texting and snapchatting as usual until today 

when i noticed in some snaps that she was in a house i’ve never seen her in before so i asked her who she was with and she only said which town she was in and not who she was with, 
which was my question. 
And i know what boy she’s with since we’re kinda aquinted and ive seen that he’s her best friend on snapchat. 
Im so fucking hurt and i don’t know what to do, i can’t have her in my life as just a friend watching her as she dates other guys, so what do i do? How do i get rid of her and get over her, without hurting her feelings as i still care about her deeply. I 
just cant handle having her in my life as it is now, please help

91,"Hello everyone. I'm not doing well financially or emotionally. I am riddled with social anxiety and depression, it has me trapped and I can't break free. My life is about to crumble, my narcissistic mother is moving herself and my brother to a small apartment and I am not being included. I am completely fucked and unprepared, due to crippling mental health issues I have not made progress in life. I am being thrown to the wolves and I am helpless.

I have nobody I can confide in, I haven't had friends beyond online people since I finished high school 4 years ago. I don't know anybody who can really give me the help I am seeking, which is essentially someone to tell me what I need to do to make it. I am not cut out to be an adult yet. I live in constant fear that I will make a horrible decision, like taking out a large loan, and regret it for years or decades.

The reason I can't see a future where I am self-sufficient is that I'm now 22 and not anywhere near independent yet. I know there are plenty of young adults who live with their parents at my age, but I need to clarify: I am unemployed, I am no longer in college, and I am gripped with severe anxiety and depression, that really intensified after losing my brother last year. I don't have any sort of counseling nor am I too thrilled with the idea of seeing somebody. Actually that makes me anxious too.

Most of my peers have now graduated and are either working great full-time jobs, living on their own or about to be, and some have children. My sister lived on her own at 18. My mental state, my personality, everything fiber of my being is against the idea that I could ever make it on my own (at least right now). I am not strong enough.

Financially I'm a ruin. Though I have money in the bank and have no expenses right now besides internet, and I'm careful with my money, what I have will not help me if it comes to not having a home. That is what I'm faced with: homelessness, or living in terrible, exposed conditions in a living room in an abusive family (I'd rather take homelessness).

My narcissistic mother hatched the idea of moving. It's a downsize from our current home and it won't have room for me. I won't have a private space to study, do any online work, or just relax in peace. I need to be able to escape from the chaos and I can't. She knows this and laughs maniacally or changes the subject when I tell her I will mentally implode without privacy. I am an introvert and I require privacy, this is also combined with the fact that my toxic family are not trustworthy and are known to snoop or steal things if I don't have a lock on my door.

I can't survive on my own yet. I can't live without a private bedroom with a lock on it. I can't find a studio anywhere that will be affordable and still able to reach places I need to go. I don't live in a major city, and the bus routes are sparse, so a car is mandatory if I hope to return to university. I don't have a license or a car, but if I get a license (hard with anxiety) my family might have an old car I could take, I'd need to pay insurance.

My first objective is to find work, even part time, despite my social anxiety because I know the money is vital. It is hard, though, terribly hard with the mindset I have. My second thought is to try to seek emergency affordable housing or something along those lines with my university, state or town. This is what I need help with. 

I have no money to pay for student housing on or off campus. Do state universities offer assistance to students in extreme financial need, facing unstable living conditions or homelessness? How would I demonstrate these things? When I say ""emergency assistance"" I mean severely reduced rates to live in a decent place and attend school. 

I do not mean to take out a giant loan, I am in the lowest socio-economic status, I can't ever pay back these loans that some students take out. I need government financial assistance for my situation and need help finding out how to take advantage of it. I need to find housing and I am talking within the next month.

I need help making a roadmap for myself, who to contact, how to plead my case to my university to beg for help. Without help from either the university or perhaps the housing agency in my state, I won't be able to afford to live on my own. I will gladly live anywhere on or off campus if it means escaping my hellish, cruel family that have officially cast me out.",09Jul2020,1
92,"Hello all. I need a bit of advice here because I am not sure what to think of this current situation I am in. 

I am 21 years old and my mother is 38 (she had me at the age of 17). My mom raised me as a friend rather than a daughter, we were best friends up until I was about 19 year old. My mom is a permissive parent. I have four young siblings aged 3-11 that live with my mother and my step father. When I went to visit them (they live 5 hours away from me via flight) I realized that they truly do not discipline the children..just like my mother never use to discipline me. Ex: kids are allowed to cuss, kids leave trash all around, back talk constantly and are all addicted to their electronics. 

Now with that background... here is what happened and here is what I need help with:

On this trip out to visit them, the second day in my mother told me that she deleted her cousin on Facebook because the cousin was commenting on a few random common posts that she didn't believe in my mothers political viewpoint and would occasionally message her on FB regarding these things and asking my mother why she felt the way she did about said viewpoint.  Now.. I do not use social media outside of Reddit, just for a heads up there for context. When she told me that she had deleted our family member over this I said, ""Darn, that really is a shame that you lost a friendship and family membership over a social media encounter.. that sucks"" Right when I said this she said, ""Wow. You are victim shaming me. Just because you don't have social media and think you are SO much better than everyone else means that I should just put up with someone and not delete them?""

This went on for about 5 minutes and in that time she had even gone back on a few things she had said and seemingly tried to gaslight me. Basically she wanted to argue but I told her that I did not want to argue, especially over something so silly. I tried to end the conversation and move on but she insisted on pushing things. In the end.. she went upstairs for about 3 hours, crying and distancing herself from me.

The remainder of my trip there, she avoided me and actually had my step father drive me to the airport rather than her driving me as planned...

Ever since I was a young teenager (12-13) I have always had this in the back of my head...I will die at the age of 32. Now, that age isn’t too young or too old, but I feel like I’ve always had that number in my head for my death. I am currently 22, about to turn 23 this month, and if my thoughts are true, I will have less than 10 years left to live. I’m not sure why the number 32 is stuck in my head for my death, but it’s been there for years. 

I am currently in therapy for a severe case of mental depression (according to my therapist), and I’ve talked to her briefly about this, but she kind of seemed to skim over it. 

Has anyone else every had these thoughts or experienced this? I’m not sure if I should think of this as a serious, inevitable “doom” in my life, but I don’t know how to shake it. Where I currently stand in life, I don’t really have many, if any, friends. I’m easily annoyed by people, which I guess, is why I don’t have many/any friends (that’s a whole different story though).

101,"Hi,

My mental health has always not been fantastic, most of it can be explained but some things don’t add up.

I have evidence I’ve repressed memories in the past, as I 2 years ago discovered I had been regularly groped and harassed by another student my age at school and had completely shut it out of my mind for 4 years until someone mentioned it.

I also today found out when talking to my mum that when I used to study the piano, during one of the grade exams I was so nervous I was crying. I also had completely forgotten any of this.

Multiple people in my family have said I changed a lot when I was 9-10ish. How I used to be a lot more confident and outgoing but then just stopped all of that. Although I have a theory why (regular talks/lectures from my grandparents talking down on me regularly) that timeline wise would have been around a year after this. 

Another thing is that during sex education talks growing up, I’d feel nauseous and throw up.

I’m really worrying something did happen to me. And I have no clue were to even begin to figure out what it could have been. But it feels like it all makes too much sense for there not to have been. 

and I’m now stuck in one of 3 things

1. Something did happen to me, and I don’t know and may never know.
2. Something did happen to me.
3. Nothing happened to me, and I’ll spend the rest of my life not knowing if I’m right or not.

103,"Hi, mobile
So I know the title seems a bit harsh

Last Wednesday, me (f15) and my Older brother(17) were at my dad's house. My mom and my dad have been divorced for about 15 years, just after I was born because my mom found out he had been cheating on her. We've been seeing our dad on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays sense they separated
My mom never said anything negative about our dad, at least not to us, but our dad made joked a bunch about being with her before. He's always been blunt and telling us the truth, even if it's not ""child appropriate.
Last Wednesday, the day was going like normal, good even. His girlfriend was over, and we were just having a calm day. We had vacation planned with our Mom to go camping leaving early on Friday, so he was being extra nice because he wasn't going to be seeing us for a week. I'll also be going to see a friend for a week soon after, so I'm only going to be seeing him for about a week this month, if I choose to do so. Anyways, at like 1:30 am, my brother was getting his soccer shoes ready for the next day when he noticed a lace missing. Our dad had washed them without asking, but he got a little pissed when my brother (calmly) asked if he knew where the lace was. He kept claiming that the washing machine wouldn't have taken his lace out, but then goes to check and brings the lace back from the machine and gives it to him. 
When my dad looks at the shoe a bit more, he sees that the shoes don't relace. He starts yelling at my brother for buying $100 shoes that don't relace, and that he was an idiot for buying shoes for the ""name brand"" (not thinking that near all athletic shoes are about that price, or more). He kept insulting him and not just letting it go. This is about when I went upstairs, but the walls are thin and I could hear easily what was going on. 
He kept yelling the same things, somehow bringing in the argument that he's ""always on that damn phone"" and never ""here with us"". He never really talked to me too much throughout the fight. After it was over, I learned that he had pushed my brother into the shoe rack. 
My dad went on the back porch to calm down I think, and guilt tripped him by saying ""I'm going to take time out of MY night to try and fix YOUR shoes""
My brother came to my room and told me (in near tears) that he had called our Mom and she was coming, and if I was coming, to get my stuff. 
My dad came back inside while we were getting our stuff together and yelled at my brother again, for the same things. When he finally went back outside, our Mom was there, and we went with our stuff out the front door. 
My brother told my mom what happened on the way back to our house. We were finally on the last road to our moms when he called my dad's girlfriend and told him 'You should lock the front door. Our Mom picked us up and if he comes by tonight, I'll call the police. I'm sorry you got caught up in all of this' (she didn't do anything wrong in any of this). Not even before ewe pulled in, my dad called my mom. Before she could pick up, I ran inside because I was having a panic attack. I could hear my brother yelling and my dad yelling back from outside.
At about 3am, my mom came upstairs to me. She made sure I was okay, and told me what happened on the call. Roughly, that my dad called him ""stupid"", and ""a little bitch"", and that he wasn't ever going to go back. My mom thought they might make up, but nothing like that has happened so far. She made sure I knew it was my choice if I wanted to go back, or just go for the days and not spend the night. 
I wish this was the end
On the car ride to the vacation, 1-2 days later, he texted me, the first time he talked to me after what happened. 
He started with that he loved me, and asked if I was okay.
I responded short with, ""Yes I'm okay""
He said he loved me again, and after I didn't respond for about 2 minutes, because I wasn't looking at my phone, ""I guess not.""

That's all that's happened for now, he hasn't tried to text me so far. I know he's capable of hurting me, but I don't think he would, but he's also already pushed my brother. 

I'm just still debating if I should still go to see him. I have until Tuesday to decide, and then I'll be leaving soon after my visit with him, after Thursday to go to my friend's for a week.

But I was told I was not qualified to do the job and they want somebody with a IT background to have the position. It is to be a vision system operator/analyst. I learned the system, helped install, troubleshoot, and refine the software. 

Since I am the only person the can currently run it they want me to train the person they hire to take the position and have me fall back to my old one that I am still currently doing. 

I know it’s poor form to set somebody up for failure but just because I don’t have a bachelors in IT I’m not qualified. But yet I do it day in and day out and I really enjoy it since all the bugs are worked out of it. If I quit before training somebody they would have to bring somebody in from Italy to train them. 

So my question is I guess should I continually set people up for failure till I get the position? Or how can I convince somebody that a Bachelors degree is not necessary to run the system and secure the position ?",09Jul2020,1
106,"I’m 18F and living in Minnesota. Covid is still going on in the U.S. of course and my sister is still having her wedding in about a week although the guest list is smaller to about 50 people. Keep in mind in Minnesota family gatherings are not supposed to be larger than 25 because of Covid so she is breaking the rules for her wedding. She’s having the ceremony and dinner at a church outside, and then is having everyone over for drinks at my house where I live with my parents, but my sister doesn’t live here anymore.

It bugs me that she is willing to put everyone she loves at risk for getting the virus just for her big day, and it also bothers me that she is bringing all of those germs to our house when she could just postpone her wedding like everyone else has had to. It seems selfish to me. The drinks at our house are supposed to be all outside so people don’t come in our house, but I know people will need to use the bathroom and some people will just come inside anyway, which makes me nervous.

I know I can be over the top with how concerned I am with things related to Covid and germs and whatnot, but my concerns have gotten much larger recently and caused me to have horrible anxiety because of the virus and her wedding. None of my family members other than my brother and his wife see things the way I do so my family always picks on me and makes fun of me for being a germaphobe like not wanting to have people come inside, having that large group of people over at our house, etc. which makes me feel worse about my worries that I only have my brother and his wife to vent to. I wish I didn’t care this much and wasn’t such a germaphobe because it causes me such anxiety, but they don’t understand that I can’t help it.

My sister who is getting married and I have never had the best relationship and we don’t really get along with each other, so I don’t feel as I can voice my concerns to her. As her wedding is about a week away I am thinking of asking her to maybe send a text out to the people coming to ask them not to come inside when they’re at our house because of Covid but don’t know if that’s asking for too much? I don’t think it is.. 

Any advice on how to keep things safe for her wedding not just for my peace of mind but others safety, or ways to calm my anxiety over this whole situation?",09Jul2020,1
107,He tells me to call him and talk things out when I feel the need but most the time I just want that little feeling it gives so I don’t. He says  I’m addicted and I need to get help. I don’t have health insurance and my mom doesn’t want me to go to therapy. I come from a very unsupportive hectic family so I’m used to finding ways to cope on my own. I hear it hurting him every Time we talk about it but I need it and he understands I’m afraid he’s gonna leave but I can’t give it up right now. He says it’ll only get worse but I don’t think so I’m smart about it I don’t go super deep just till I see the white under layer and on the top/front of my legs and a little on my stomach.

I hate myself I have no friends no job no car I feel stuck like it’ll never get any better I’m afraid he’s cheating and if he is I know I deserve it so I’m trying to be better for him I’m just scared he’s gonna leave because of the cutting,09Jul2020,1
108,"Okay, so when I was fourteen, I found this website called Mr. Poll. It's basically just a place for people to submit their own questionnaires to be answered by others. Now, I used to use the site for the more, well, erotic polls that were on there. Back then, I didn't really see anything overtly disturbing, but, when I came back to the site after two years, I looked a little deeper through the search results and found some really messed up polls which seem way too fixated on children and teenagers. Like, a lot of them would have titles like 'kids being tied up', or something similar, and may of them would be specifically asking for replies from 'boys' and 'girls' and would ask for age ranges of 13 - 18. Now considering that these are clearly erotic, or fetish based polls, this is really worrying. I know that in every website, these kinds of things can slip through the cracks, but Mr. Poll is not a very large website, and these kinds of search results are really common. So, what I need advice about is what I should do, like, is there anything I can do? Because that this possibly predatory behaviour is just happening without any interference is really messed up. Thank you in advance for any advice",09Jul2020,1
109,"So first of all, hookers are legal in my country. This happened like 2 days ago, i was barely using my head and found a really good looking and clean woman from the internet. She was also doing it for cheap prices. Cheap price is definetely a red flag. Whatever, i am going to tell you how i might have majorly fucked up and might not be the smartest one to judge people when they talk with me. At first she saw my car and didnt return my calls and i panicked and went to another street and literally then she answered with ""where did you go"" even though she said to me later she didnt know that it was my car. Red flag 1.This girl was acting way too nice and she literally were ""less hookerlike"" compared to any girl i have ever slept with probably. I was gonna take her to my place with my car driving from her place to mine to make sure i am safe no matter what. She was talkative and even joked about not bringing everyone to my home. Red flag number 2. 

Okay guys, hear me the fuck out. I have never ever been so (probably) wrong ever about a person's personality. Like i can judge people and see throguht their skin from miles away normally but this bitch literally caught me pants down.

When we were at my home,as i always make sure my money and other precious stuff is left in the car where she doesnt even know. I tell you i am not a dumb guy, i just was bamboozled. This girl has purple eyelids and i tell to myself ""Red Flag 3"". However this bitch and i start talking about our childhood, what we like to eat, do we smoke etc. like she is my friend. She is a passionate kisser, absolutely the best and most passionate girl i have ever seen in bed and i had the best sex of my life with a seemingly perfectly normal girl. However this sly bitch probably tricked me and did nothing suspicious the first day on purpose to gain my trust. As she again jokes about ""now we trust each other"". She knows i got good money. But i sure as hell made sure she can't fuck around with me as i do these stuff regularly and still havent had any problems with anyone and can take care of myself. But this girl is something else i tell you. She lied about another thing without even stuttering as if she was totally a different person and this was like, what, 8th red flag? I can't even write all the red flags here. The point is, she was more normal than my ex to me. More like a college friend. What i don't get is how come one tries to ghost before jumping in a car (probably is a part of drug dealer bs, or owes money), does this good sex for cheap(drug addict obviously), and meanwhile act like a new college graduate holy shit. She wasnt even acting like a drug addict if she didnt have purple eyelids i wouldnt ever thought of it. Now the worst part. I need to like not get in contact and make sure no gang, drug dealer bullshit comes through my door, as i feel like she asked too much about my earnings and know that there are valuables to steal in my house. 

I can't believe this oscar worthy performance from a junkie hooker holy shit. And it was the cleanest and most passionate sex i have ever had. What the fuck do i do guys? Am i being paranoid or is it because some blood is pumping into my brain that i can think straight? We talked about our childhood passions and favourite food ffs.",09Jul2020,1
110,"1. I don't want to call out, because then their mother would have to not go to work and she would lose a day's pay, and I feel like I would lose her trust.
 
1a. If I did call out, I would still feel incredibly guilty about it, and would need help with how to deal with that.
 
2. The kids are 6 and 9, and the 6 year old has some of the worst breathing/personal space etiquette. He's spat, coughed, and sneezed on me (not during the current issues, but I've gotten better at dodging and this is the first time during the current event they'll have been in close contact with other people). He still doesn't cough or sneeze into his elbow. The 9 year old is better at this, but the 6 year old really gets close to me for some reason.

2a. I have a mask for me and a few extras, but wouldn't it be rude/weird to have the kids wear masks without their parents suggesting it?

3. I also have a pack of wet wipes and a thing of hand sanitizer in my car, but that feels rude to bring in with me. If I did bring it in, I wouldn't really know how to explain it.

4. I would only be there for about 2 hours, but on Friday I have to be there for seven. Would I have to deal with things differently on Friday, or just bring hand sanitixer again?

I am going to get tested next Monday regardless, but I'm still very scared of getting infected, so I want to do my best to avoid it.",09Jul2020,1
111,"I’ve moved to Greenland from Denmark a week ago, and I’m gonna stay here for three months.
My dad is from Greenland, and it seemed like the most amazing opportunity for me to get to see the beautiful country and experience it’s nature and culture, while working at this local cafe. 
I normally live with my boyfriend in an apartment in Denmark.
I was really psyched for this, and convinced the time would move by fast, and I would be home with my boyfriend in no time. But I’m unsure if I made the right decision.
I just got out of my obligatory quarantine after I tested negative for COVID-19, and I had my first shift at the cafe. But I’m just not a fan of the way they do things there, it’s all very messy, and you have to be everywhere all the time, the people there barely had time to teach me anything. Not the vibe I was hoping for. 
I’ve only been here for a week, but I have been very homesick and cried a lot almost every night. I’m just not sure I feel like I fit in here.

Anyone been through anything like this? Do I just ride the storm out and hope it gets better? Or is there anything I can do to make it easier?

113,"Context: I grew up in foster care from 7 years old and recently reconnected with my birth family last year to help them out.  I have younger siblings and have been going round to my mom's house to help out at least once a week. I have spent most of my savings (over £5000) on redecorating their house because it was rat infested, disgusting and not a place to raise children. What has been most important to me however has been spending time with my younger siblings and helping them through school to make sure they are prepared for university and adult life. I had created a 2 year plan to get them tutoring lessons, start taking them on holiday to get them in new environments and hopefully build their confidence with various activities.

This was all going to plan until last week. My mom is extremely stubborn and doesn't like to take responsibility when anything goes wrong and will always find a way to blame someone else. If anyone tries to tell her otherwise she will start screaming and arguing until you are forced to leave. Last week I told her to take my 8 year old autistic brother to the hospital to get his skin infection checked out which he has had for 2/3 weeks now. I warned her that it could get worse and if it does she could end up losing her children again as she did with me and my older sister when we were younger. 

She got mad and started screaming and shouting at me saying that she wouldn't take him because she didn't want him to catch coronavirus. This would be a sound excuse coming from most parents however, when I asked her the previous week she said she was scared to take him because she would get the blame if the doctor said the infection was bad. What's also confusing is that she spends most nights at her boyfriends house leaving the children alone and comes back in the morning, meaning she could easily be bringing back the virus anyway.

After a few minutes of screaming and shouting she phoned her sister (as she usually does when she wants to complain) and told her that she never wants me to go to her house again and that I'm not part of her family. As you can imagine this has had an emotional impact on me over the past week as I have had a lot on my mind to think about. I'm currently looking for a new job and trying to prepare to buy a house, be brave enough to pursue a relationship due to my attachment issues and finally start to live a relatively normal life. Throwing this on top of my other issues really drained me during this past week and got me thinking whether I should even be taking this responsibility on.

It took me a while but I finally forgave my mom for mistreating me and letting her partner mentally and physically abuse me for years as a child last year when I reconnected with her. What makes this even more annoying is that she still hasn't apologised or even acknowledged that she was wrong and this is one of the reasons why my older sister will never speak to her again, let alone let her see her son who is my mom's first grandchild. 

**What I want advice on is whether I should continue to try and help my younger siblings or should I just let everyone go?** I'm really torn because I don't feel like I will be able to live with myself if I hear that something bad has happened to my younger siblings but at the same time this entire week has drained me emotionally and I don't think I can handle this level of stress much longer.

I genuinely can't put into words how much I love my younger siblings and want to take care of them. If I had the money I would buy my own place right now and raise them myself but unfortunately I'm at least 2/3 years off a deposit after I have spent so much of my money on fixing my mom's place and helping out other family members.

My plan is to message my younger sisters tomorrow and attempt ask if they want to meet up away from the house from now on. But there are two vital issues here. My mom makes my 14 year old sister look after my 9 year old autistic brother when she is not home and my 17 year old sister has a 6 month old baby so I would have to take them all out somewhere. I don't have a car and don't own my own place so this would be expensive and unpractical. Additionally, my mom always complains about my younger siblings putting her down because I renovated the house and buy them things so she will be even more annoyed if she finds out they're sneaking out behind her back. 

This whole situation is a mess, I know. What would you do?

TLDR: After reconnecting with my birth family after 17 years I have been supporting my mom and younger siblings for the past year. However, last week I had an argument with my mom and she told me she doesn't want me round again and that I'm not part of their family. 

I'm torn because my younger siblings really need the help but the situation is taking an emotional toll on me. Should I just walk away from my family for good or find a way to continue helping my young siblings while risking my mom taking her anger out on them for meeting up with me?",09Jul2020,1
114,"Hey there Reddit! I have recently decided to go back to school and get a degree. I currently live in Alaska (AK) but I am planning to move to Oregon (OR) in 2025; I am trying to complete my degree while in AK to take advantage of the lower tuition and job security I currently have here.

So here is some background: I have spent my entire life in AK, spending my days biking to glaciers, hiking up mountains, swimming in the ocean, foraging for berries and other edible plants etc. After graduating high school, I immediately started taking classes towards a Bachelor in Business Management, but quickly found it monotonous and, quite frankly, boring. Before dumping large amounts of money into a degree that I didn’t feel passionate about (I had already put a lot into it – about 1/3 of the way there), I dropped out. I spent the next 5 years working in financial institutions going from teller, to manager, to business and mortgage, to anything else I could get my hands on; and while I have enjoyed being able to learn so much, I have started to find working indoors confining and repetitive.

After taking some time to reflect on my college years, I realized that my favorite class (aside from “electives”) was Biology. My first thought has been to get a degree in Biology, but after doing further research, it seems as though it would not allow me to accomplish my goal of being outdoors – unless I have years of experience under my belt. As far as I can tell, most jobs that pertain to the outdoors will require some indoor work, which I am happy to do – but my goal, as mentioned before, is to spend the maximum possible time outdoors. Now, if experience is directly tied to my ability to work outdoors, it would appear that is my only option; although, I am hoping you guys have more insight.  

Please let me know if I can provide any more information. Thank you in advanced to those who took the time to read this and suggest degrees/ career paths. You are very much appreciated.",09Jul2020,1
115,"Hi --- I am new to reddit but saw Reddit on YouTube and thought to ask this here due to anonymity. 

I wrote a FB post identifying someone who did something like a school shooting here in my country and killed 53 people. We were all shocked and searching for information as it happened --- He live streamed it on Youtube.

All my post, to a closed FB group, said was ""This is a photo of the guy and his name is xxx"". thats all it said

The screen shot went VIRAL all over those Asian countries where that group dominates and because they could not read English the people thought the name in blue (the FB posters name) must be the killer of their compatriots.

During the initial phase I received 100's of friend requests and rather disturbing emails on FB ---- trouble is that even today, 16 months later, I still get the occasional ""friend"" request from these people.

I feel like I've made good progress. I've went to therapy, I've done a lot of research on the psychology and biology of Social Anxiety and anxiety disorders in general to get a better understanding of it, I've read stories from people on how they've overcome it and try to apply what they've done to my own life, and I've been challenging myself to get out of my comfort zone.

I'm currently taking a mental health break from university. I've been working in a cafe for 11 months. It's my first job. I feel like this job has really helped with my Social Anxiety. I've exchanged numbers with two colleagues that I like.

124,"I know that firsthand accounts are biased, but I am being perfectly honest when I say I am a very diligent worker - perfect? No, but I ask questions, follow directions, keep up a steady pace, etc. I was hired on by the then DM, who was aware that my husband was a supervisor with the company and the DM was happy to place me with him. Since then we've had many successful two-man jobs, and the company greatly benefits from our being married. 
  
   
Not long after I was hired, the DM who hired me was promoted and replaced with a different DM who has some weird fixation on my relationship with my husband. He will ask other coworkers about my work, repeatedly and incessantly, constantly points towards favoritism that no one else is mentioning, and when he introduced us to new coworkers when we switched offices, he...pretended my husband and I weren't married and expected me to play along. Everyone hates him for other reasons that all center around him being a liar, and as I've had conversations with lots of different people, my reputation is generally well and people think I work hard (I'm sure some people dislike me, but as far as I'm aware there's nothing systemic). The DM just doesn't think so 
   
   
We have a scaling pay system based on productivity, and my numbers consistently hover around the highest tier of pay, but I still make the initial hire-on pay.

CW: physical abuse

My boyfriend of 6 years was visiting my family’s house (out of state). My family is....difficult. My mom is very mentally ill; my dad is an ass. It’s never fun to visit, so I was relieved that he was coming with me to make the holidays a bit easier. 

On the third day there, my dad threw some car keys at my face during an argument and my boyfriend stepped in to defend me. It escalated to an argument between my dad and my boyfriend, and my boyfriend left the house the next day without saying goodbye or acknowledging my parents at all. 

This put me in a really shitty position because now I had to “mediate” the fight between my boyfriend and parents and still navigate the holidays with my crazy family. It has been 3 years since the argument and my parents still hate my boyfriend. My boyfriend is mad at me because I think he should have stayed and given me moral support throughout the trip.

127,"I'm 18F and I haven't hung out with my friends for a long time. However, some past trauma has come back to me (because the lack of sleep, maybe) and I have come to remember all of the things my previous friend did to me. 

The first shitty thing that she did to me was tell my boyfriend at the time (now ex) that I had cheated on him. I had only cheated on my ex because he was so horrible to me. He kept a lot of pictures of half-naked girls on his phone and insisted to me that it wasn't a big deal and that I shouldn't think about it that much. The girls on the photos were clearly more attractive than me and had better bodies than me so it made me feel really insecure. This was an occurring problem in our relationship and I had confronted him many times about it but he just said that I was overreacting and that it was my fault because I was so insecure.

Whenever we would hang out together, I could see his head turn and he would stare every so often whenever a pretty girl would walk past. He would do this right in front of me. This absolutely crushed me. He would also mention names of other girls (that were in our school) that were attractive and slightly hinted on how beautiful they are, how they would dressed and that I too should be like them and dress like them. It all built up. When my friend would invite us to go out and drink, I would find myself flirting with other guys and I felt guilty but somehow, it made me feel better. I felt better that I was getting back at him. I treated him with nothing but love in the beginning of our relationship but he barely repaid it.

Going back to my ""ex-friend,"" one day at school, she was getting ready for her basketball practice and she had asked me to take pictures of the pages of the book for a quiz because she wouldn't be able to do so herself since she would have practice. I refused her favor, because it would take me a long time to take a picture of the pages (she was asking me to take a picture of 15 or so pages). Another reason for me refusing her favor is because I had to be at church for choir practice later that night too.

But, I still managed to take the time and send her the pictures she asked for, but it was too late. I was at church at this time and before it was time for the choir practice, my boyfriend had been calling me non-stop. Then I knew. I knew that my friend had told him all about the times that I had cheated on him. She even went as far as to list the names of the guys that I fooled around with.

Cheating on him made me feel awful, I always regretted it in the morning but it felt like I had turned into someone that I didn't know. I had turned into someone who I hated because of the relationship I had with my boyfriend.

A few months pass, but we're still together, him on his old habits and me continuing to go out drinking with my friends and fooling around. I thought it would have felt pointless to change into someone who would make him happy because he hated it every time I would go out with my friends to drink but I thought to myself, why should I stop having fun with my friends? He's still going to continue to be foul to me. I forgot to mention the part where he has 5,000 friends on Facebook, and 95% are girls he doesn't know on Facebook but found them pretty so he added them as a friend. When I came over to their house, her sister even told me that he had a habit of scrolling through his friends list, and unfriending those he did not find attractive so that he could make room for more girls that he could add which he found more attractive. I'd like to clarify that I do not have any of the habits that he has, I barely check Facebook because Netflix and Youtube are the main things which consume my time if I was on my phone.

One time, I got so drunk with my friends and I drank way too much because I was so gutted about how he treated me. I asked him to pick me up and he did. I asked him to take me to a McDonalds because I was hungry but when we got there, I realized that I couldn't eat anything because my stomach hurt so much because I drank so much on an empty stomach. I couldn't eat the food that was in front of me and he just scolded me about how I'm overreacting and wasting his time because I couldn't eat any of the food. I was literally so sick that I had to run out of the McDonalds to find a nearby bush to throw up in but when I would throw up, I only threw up bile but I was still gagging even though I had nothing to throw up anymore. While I was throwing up, he just stood there and looked at me. We went back inside the McDonalds for the 2nd time but I still couldn't eat my food and we just decided for me to take the food home. For the second time, I needed to throw up, and when I did, I threw up water because I had drank some earlier. When I was throwing up, he pulled out his phone and took a video of him. I told him to stop but I couldn't reach him since my body was still focused on throwing up. This whole thing sobered me up and I just went home by myself while he went his separate way.

It took me a year of being with him to break up with him and we have seen each other in months now.

Going back to my ex-friend, I recently asked her to apologize for one instance that she has not yet apologized for and that was the time when she was going to meet a guy for the first time and they had planned to hook up at his place. I waited with my friend until the guy arrived and my friend was using my phone because hers was dead. We stood there for a good 10 minutes until the guy who was standing behind us, finally came up to us and picked her up. I was upset by the fact that the guy was just standing there without saying hi to us and it took him a while to do so. I wasn't thinking much, but I said something insulting to the guy and they both left.

The next day, I asked her how their hook-up went and she expressed her anger about the way I treated the guy he met. She was angry about how I treated her one-night stand. I have known this girl for 2 years but she chose to defend this guy who she just met, hooked up with her, and didn't talk to her again. We were in class this time and the argument got so heated that she blurted out, while her voice was somewhat loud, that I shouldn't go around insulting the guy that she hooked up with because I have a lot of sex with my boyfriend. I was shamed beyond comprehension because classmates around us definitely heard us since they turned around to face us when she blurted that out. I didn't say anything after that and just gathered my things and cut class for the rest of the day. That was only the first class of the day though.

Now I have no one, because I feel like other friends in our group would agree with her. No boyfriend and I just finished high school and am not planning on attending college for at least 2 years or so.

Is this all my fault? Has everything that has happened to me because of the way I treated other people?

I have dealt with rape myself . That’s not to put my friend down and to be all like “ I UnDeRsTaND completely “ . Every situation is unique and every situation and how someone copes or reacts is unique . No one situation is alike . But I wanted her to report this for her own good . 

To preference I’m 14 and Ftm . While my friend is 14 and a bio woman . ( who we will call Sasha . ) 

Sasha started to talk to her ex Alex after her most recent breakup . And while talking she let it slip that Sunday 2 weeks ago Alex r*ped her . At the time it was only 4 days after the insident and I told her to report it . She told me she didn’t have to as she already cut him out of her life . I told her to do it anyway as it could harm someone else as it hadn’t been to long sense . And letting him get away with it isn’t ok . Now . I understand NOT wanting to go to the cops for everything going on . But I think Sasha NEEDS to report it . She told me I had no right to report it when I told her I would if she wouldn’t . And she flipped out on me and called me an asshole . I told her I’d rather eat an asshole and have this reported that have it not . She promised me she’d report it . Than blocked me . And won’t talk to me anymore . 

Am I in the wrong?.. . If I am I will apologize to her and do anything I can to make it up to her . She’s one of my best friends and I don’t wanna ruin it by me being a stupid idiot .

Currently working at a supermarket and I've been offered a manager's position at a different store. I have however accepted a graduate job in my chosen field starting ""early 2021"" there is however no exact start date yet due to covid. I'm thinking either Jan or March.

I am in HS right now and for the past five years I have had an unexplainable shoulder pain on my right should near the top where the shoulder and neck meet. It starts heating and burning out of no where and then the pain subsided and then it comes back again and aches. It has brought me to tears several times because I can’t focus on anything besides the pain. I have tried heating, stretching resting and staying active but nothing works I fact it just makes it worse sometimes.

About a year ago I started going to a chiropractor. I got the stretches and heating to help. I still go to this day every few weeks. It has helped my shoulders stayed loose but it has done nothing to help my burning sensation. I ask the chiropractor what he thinks it is and my right shoulder drops slightly compared to my left shoulder.

I have tried strengthening it but it hasn’t made any difference!!! He is a very smart guy but I don’t know what to do about it.

132,"My best friend (F20) introduced me to my boyfriend(M23) in November. She had already told me she hooked up with him way before I even met him, so I already knew of their history. After meeting him, we ended up liking each other and eventually started my dating. My best friend has been honest about everything from the start but my boyfriend has never mentioned it to me at all. I don’t even know if he knows I know about it. 
I wasn’t super worried about it because I know they’re just friends and it was a one time thing, so I’m not jealous or angry but the longer time goes by of us dating, the more it bothers me that he hasn’t told me. 

I know it happened before we even knew each other but I still feel like he should have mentioned that to me  instead of “keeping me in the dark”. Every time the three of us hang out I always think about how he’s done stuff with both of us. 

Another thing that bothered me was I was talking to him about how my ex’s were cheaters and how I didn’t trust shady people and he really said “well I always disclose everything with you” and that just felt like a slap to the face because I know about him and my friend and he never even fucking mentioned it to me once.",09Jul2020,1
133,"I'm not even sure where to begin to provide some context to this situation. But in short, I was recently ghosted -quite suddenly-  by a friend that I am convinced has disassociative personality disorder. I suspect that her ""guardian"" personality has made this happen because she sees me as a threat because I  was getting too close. She only communicated with me once, about 3 months after I was suddenly ghosted, with an abrupt email asking me to never try to contact her again and to never bring her up in conversation. And so I haven't.  But I think there is a good chance that her core personality does not know, though she might suspect, that these other personalities even exist. So the question is, should I try to talk to her again about this? Should I talk to anyone else? Or is best to remain silent and try to forget and move on. Not that she will be easy to forget.

Some months ago I kind of stumbled into an intense but platonic relationship with this stupidly smart and beautiful young woman. She bowled me over with her quick wit and adroitness, her incredible insights, just how fun she was.  She was amazing just to be around. But as I began to get to know her better and the more she seemed to trust me the more I saw her personalities begin to emerge, saw how they contradicted each other, told me the things that then they didn't seem to realize they had told me, and all that. I saw how she severed from bouts of severe insomnia, panic attacks that left her unable to leave her apartment for days at a time, sudden inexplicable silences that lasted a few days at a time.

 She would also confide in me all kinds of intimate details and secrets about her life and experiences. She told me that she seemed somehow to destroy all her relationships besides family every few months and that she was very sad and deeply lonely. She told me directly that she suspected she might be disassociated in fact, though she later did not seem to realize this.  I did some research on it and it seems that this condition is almost always the product of terrible childhood trauma, generally sexual abuse by immediate relatives.  and that the personalities form to protect the core identity from what has happened and ward off any perceived potential threats to their eternal innocence. Knowing all this I began to suspect that her ""guardian"" would find a reason to banish me the more she seemed drawn to me, and sure enough, the reason was found. 

And so here we are.  So what should I do? Break her rules or just let it go. Anyone out here go through anything similar? If so, please share any insights you may have gained. I sure could use some.",09Jul2020,1

135,"On August 3rd, my parents are planning for us to take a road trip to see my grandma who lives a few states away. This is a yearly trip we take, and it typically consists of us staying at a hotel for two nights and going to a bunch of stores and roadside attractions before arriving at my grandma's. My mom is already immunocompromised due to the medicine she takes, and my grandma is at risk due to her old age. I don't feel as though it's smart for any of us to be traveling at this time, but especially not when those two are at such a risk. Whenever I bring this up to my parents, they ignore it because they don't know of anybody they personally know getting corona. My mom brushes it aside since she is considered an essential worker and is surrounded by people everyday, yet hasn't contracted anything. They won't listen to any of my reasoning for not wanting any of us to go, and I told them if they wanted to risk themselves that's on them, but it's unfair to drag me along with them and put me in danger as well. Most other years I have complained about the trip for other reasons, and my mom told me she wants me to go since she doesn't want to be alone with my grandma. Due to my previous complaints they brush all my worries aside even more now. Not to mention they completely ignore a lot of coronavirus facts, like how it stays on some surfaces for days after. Is there anyway I can get through to them? I'm 17 so they're even more reluctant to leave me here, yet my sister could easily stay with me as she lives in the neighborhood and it'd be fine.

137,"Alright, so for a bit of context I was dating this girl [we'll call her E]. We only were together for about a month or three before she suddenly stops talking to me through both text and face to face. One time she was asking for help in school (it was that short period of time you get between highschool classes) and I offered to help, and she responded with ""I didnt ask you"" in a rude out of nowhere tone. So I give her space, occasionally trying to ask her if she was alright once every few weeks but she either ignored me, or said she was fine and nothing else.
Then suddenly during summer vacation, one of her friends texted me saying that E wanted to talk to me. I asked for them to elaborate, but I was left on read. So I go text E asking what they wanted to talk about.
Next thing I know, I'm being called every derogatory name, curse word, etc. Under the sun. With no explanation. 
I got a tad heated and fought back, trying to be logical and asking why she was calling me these things, but then I just got really tired if it [plus this conversation was at nearly midnight], so to end this conversation, I told them 'I'll see you in hell then,' then left the conversation. I regret saying that now that I thought about it for a while. Then about last month I found out that I apparently mentioned her being rude and ghosting me to one of my close friends and word spread.
So then, without telling me she wanted to end the relationship, she tried cheating on me with two of my friends, and failed at both. 
I'm worried about all these events because she left my highschool last year to a different one, and I am also. But this year she's changing schools AGAIN and going to my school. I don't really know what to do or think if she tries being rude again or if she got a group of friends to bully me, and I want to make sure I am not the one in the wrong. I havent apologized for what I said and I dont plan on it unless I know I did something wrong, which she hasn't told me if I did. Please give me some advice, thank you",09Jul2020,1
138,"So, this might be a long one because i believe that you should know a bit about my work before i get to the problem. So, i have had this summer job for three years now. The same people have worked there for a while so we have grown to become a family in many ways. Our boss is an older woman who is the actual grandmother of several people who work there. It has always been a laid back place, but this year, my boss is done with the bull shit i guess.

So, it was a normal day. Not very busy at all, not too much to do. We were quiet, waiting for the day to end because its work, nobody wants to be there. I jokingly asked if i could go home a couple times, i think she took them seriously though, and got annoyed. Because it was rather slow, we kept asking what time we would close because there was only like three orders every half an hour. I think she got increasingly annoyed at this because she kept saying the same thing. 

Halfway through the shift, my boss and one of the employees that is her grandchild got into a little fight. Im not sure what it was about because i was sitting outside. It ended with my boss storming out of the building muttering ""i'll fire all of ya."" 

Later on, we were starting to prepare to shut down. We still had probably about an hour max of being open. Not sure how it started, but arguing came again. My boss went off about how we never go above and beyond and only do things she tells us to. This kind of through me off because i literally cant think of anything to go above and beyond about. We have stations. How are we supposed to go above and beyond in them? I dont get it. Either way, then her same grandchild who got in an argument with her earlier says ""i dont get paid to go above and beyond."" This really pissed my boss off and she stormed outside muttering things again. This time things like, ""thats strike two, do you want to keep your job?"" 

Then once she comes back inside she says ""i will tell you what. You guys get all of your stuff cleaned up and you can go home for the night and i will stay and close. And we can start doing that on every slow day and i will just hire more people to help me."" This made me feel bad. I didnt really know what to do so i said that i can stay if she wants me to. I dont really want to go home anyway. But she smiled and said ""sorry, not after today. Youre going home."" 

As we left she told us that we had better find a different attitude or find a different job. 

I barely know what i did wrong here. I am a decent worker, i do as i am told and do everything i can to help. I pick up the others slack sometimes and i try to just get through the day. I will admit that i am a little lazy and slow on some days but other than that i try my best. I will start to stop asking if i can go home because that is annoying and not cool but other than that, what can i even improve on? I dont want a different job. I want to stay here. If i was fired it would be like losing my family and i dont know how i would get through it. I love these people.

141,"Backstory: my ex and I broke up in April, it's a long story but during the relationship I struggled to get a conversation going with her. We didn't have similar interests and her friends were the worst kind of people. Overall it didn't work out. After the relationship ended, I started to realise that I was probably gay... or not completely straight. 

When I broke up with her, she said that she agreed. But one of our mutuals said that she was actually super upset (this was never expressed to me) and she also suggested that I should message my ex to make sure she was okay. I did so, but she said that she doesn't want to be friends with someone like me. 

Looking back, I wasn't ready for a relationship, ig seeing everyone else around me made me want one. Oh and btw I'm in highschool rn which brings me to my next point. Firstly, my ex's friends are awful (spread rumours, lies, gossip, etc and they hate me) and they sit by me in a few of my classes, they're the type to shout drama in front of the class. Do you think I'm worrying too much?

Secondly, there's a class where that mutual friend sits right next to me, and my ex sits next to them. On my other side is a super bitchy girl who loves to get involved in everyone's lives and spreads every detail about everyone around the school. Any ideas on what to expect in that situation? Also, any thoughts on how to stop worrying so much about it (I couldn't ask to be moved in the class because I'm just too nervous to ahah, I don't want anyone to question why I was moved and then a big class discussion would start). Did I mention I overthink a lot? So there's those three questions and there's this next one as well that would really help me out!!!

We have lots of mutual friends and recently since the lockdown rules are being lifted (slightly) my friends are making plans with her and I feel too awkward to go cause things will be weird. I try to make plans like a social distance walk or smthn but not many of them usually reply to me. Do u think after lockdown things like parties and stuff will be very awkward between the two of us? How do I try to make it not so awkward? 

I'm completely aware that high school is a tiny fraction of my life, I'm not the type to get involved in drama and I try to keep my head down at school. I'm not/haven't been in the best shape (physically and mentally) in a long time so I get super self conscious and worried about social situations.

So I (M25) met this girl(29) last year. We got very close and told each other everything from past to present/ good to bad. Meet her kids and got close to them and everything. I fell hard for her and she for me however it was not meant to be. Long story short it was a cluster-fuck with multiple parties. So in the end we stop talking on neutral terms. That was around 5/6 months ago.

Couple hours ago a mutual friend of ours that I have haven’t talk to in awhile, calls me and tells me that she was pregnant(kid not mine), and that something was wrong.

My boyfriend goes through a depressed stage about 2 times a year. Well we both do to an extent but we deal with it differently. I try my hardest to be around people for a sense of normalcy while I’m going through it. When he goes through it he becomes very distant and almost bitter. I hate to see him like it and all I want to do is comfort him but he doesn’t want to hangout (with me or anyone) as much and he does not want much for conversation. 

Wondering if anyone has any advice on what to do? I want to give him space but I also don’t appreciate when he goes quiet... he communicates that he’s depressed but that’s about the extent of our communication on the subject while it’s happening. We are so great majority of the time but he’s nearly a different person while he goes through it and it hurts me because I do not know how to act and we don’t see each other nearly as often. He just kind of goes dark. I feel I have to act different, pause my own feelings, and let him have his space but where do I draw the line? Weddings and family events come up and he never wants to be involved while he’s going through it but I feel you can’t put life on pause every time you get sad.. I don’t want to be insensitive because I know we all deal with it differently but I just wish there was more I could do to help besides giving him his space, which in turn causes me to become sad. He does still make time for me but it’s just not the same as I can still feel his sadness.. and I do know he feels bad about how it makes me feel but he can’t really help it when he goes through it?

First time Gun Owner anxiety?

Soon to be first time gun owner, but having to over come the fear of owning a gun.  

I’m in Chicago not very pro gun and didn’t grow up around firearms. 

I’ve never been anti gun, but never cared to join NRA or protect rights for gun owners. 

I was pretty anxious going to the range for the first time with myself but it was awesome. Truly a blast and confirmed my interest in the hobby. 

I am 24 and want to buy a gun this year, my first handgun but I worry a bit.

I don’t have kids yet but definitely plan to some day. 

I worry about accidents, accidental discharge, it getting in the wrong hands like a kid or someone who shouldn’t have it and being used to take a life, or worse just snapping and taking my own. 

I’ve never been suicidal, every time the subject crosses my mind I cringe think of everything great in life, but every time I am around Guns or think of them I think of the topic etc no way I could do that. However thinking of guns makes me think of suicides. I hear of “normal” people freaking out every now and then from these studies published and the gun just makes it easier to carry out the task. I’d never want that. 

Part of it is probably these studies that say gun homes make suicide xxx times more likely.

148,"About 3 months ago i broke up with my girlfriend that i’d been with for 4 months. She was my first girlfriend ever and i’ve always been really insecure about relationships because i’ve never been able to relate etc. Being with this girl was the best time of my life. She was so important to me and i was to her. My ex and i lost our virginity to each other and i still look back at it and do not regret the decision if the slightest. I am 16 just to mention. (i’m from the UK it’s legal at 16 don’t worry about it) Over lockdown, not being able to see each other was taking a toll on my side of the relationship and to keep things short i broke things off. 

At the time i thought i made the right decision. I had doubts but that’s normal. 3 months later i’m in complete regret. I’m not built to be alone. I’m just not. I texted her the other day while she was with her friends. I didn’t know this at the time until they texted me after. I asked to get back and try things again. I was rejected rather harshly and she did not take it the slightest bit seriously. Now, i’m 6’2 and quite a masculine guy but i was choking up typing everything out and i was being mocked by her and just being told things i did not want to hear such as she wants to talk to more people. It broke me and i think i’m now truly feeling heartbreak just as she did months ago. I’ve never been the most gracious with dealing with emotion and i said some things to her after the break up that were quite brash. Her friends also dislike me. A lot. I think the harsh response from her was justified but regardless it still made me a wreck.

She’s changed as a person in the past three months and i’m not sure she’s the same person i fell in love with. However at this point i’m wiling to try anything just to be with her again. I am losing my mind thinking about her all the time. I don’t know what to do or if i could try speaking to her again when she’s alone without begging her. I also was quite angry to her basically insulting me and she still dislikes me a lot. If i did things differently there could have been things to salvage but that’s gone now.

Little background info... my parents are divorced, so my brother and I go to my mums house for half the time and then my dads house for half the time. My older brother and I have never really gotten along, and it seems like he yells at me and makes me cry more than anyone. I've thought about asking my parents if when Im at my moms house he could go to my dads house and vice versa because its so hard to deal with him. Yesterday I finally got fed up with his bs and begged my mum over the phone to let us be at different houses. Hes just arrogant and rude and not a very nice person in general. I even think its starting to affect my happiness, especially since he finds it funny to make fun of overweight people when I sometimes struggle with body image and EDs (im only 14). Sometimes tho, like today, we can get along for a bit. My mum isnt one to take action right away, so i know she hasnt asked my dad about living separatly yet. Should I tell my mom I actually dont to live separatly from him, or should I tell my dad that I do. I understand that all siblings fight, but even my friends agree that we really dont have a good sibling relationship",09Jul2020,1

I’m a huge worrier so I always assume the worst, but I feel like that’s a good thing. This past Sunday I was playing tennis at the park with my friend and this SUV with tinted windows circled us slowly about 3 times and when we finally got creeped out and decided to leave they circled around again and parked sideways right next to our car (we were the only 2 people there) I face-timed my brother as we were walking to our car and told him our location and what was going on just incase something happened. When i got on the phone the car left and pulled over to a spot a little bit ahead and just parked there until we left. This is just the most recent incident of me being creeped out but it’s really ruining my mind, i don’t want to go out and do other things because i am absolutely petrified of getting abducted, I know I can’t think like this but I feel i have to for my own safety.

This week has been a pretty good week for me I worked and went rock climbing and had plans to go to the pool with a girl I like, I guess I got a little to comfortable cause when I got to the pool maybe an hour in a half in my mom cut my plans short saying ""get your ass to mutual"" ""youve already had fun this week"" (i dont believe in god at all) I tried to ask if I could stay she said ""no you have 7 minutes to get here"" I apologized to the girl and had to go, I was pretty pissed and my moms the only one who can piss me off. I got to mutual to replace a grownup cause they didnt want to do it (I'm 16). After mutual my mom was ""wondering"" why I was mad I told her why in front of her friends, cause she dragged me here, well i went home and and she came shortly after banging on the shower door telling me to hurry up. Well that's when I had my anxiety attack and I couldnt take I had a breakdown I started crying thinking I wasnt good enough, how am i going to tell them I dont believe in god without them disowning me, why does she have to crush what little happiness I have.

159,"The backstory: this creepy dude has been OFF from the start. We were both new in the neighborhood, and didn’t know our neighbors. One day, I was talking to one of them from our building outside. The creepy dude proceeded to turn around and stare at me (pretty intensely) until my convo with the neighbor ended and I went inside. Something was not right, and my gut was telling me to watch out for this guy. 

The next incident was when things really took a turn. My roomie and I were walking home and of course we had to pass by his house before finding refuge in ours. He was leaning up against his balcony (a not very high up one) watching us as usual in his weird staring game. Accept this time, we both started staring back. He acted friendly and asked “how were we doing” and then as we were unresponsive, he started yelling aggressively, and angrily, cursing us out, while we got into our place. 

After that, we decided to establish a buddy system whenever we went out. However, we weren’t always together, and my roomie had to go run an errand at T-mobile. When she came back, she told me everything. The creepy dude had followed her within an arm’s length all the way to T-mobile, until she stopped and pretended to look at her phone in order to let him pass in front. He did. When she got to T-mobile, he went in after her and started making rounds around the store. My roommate saw him pass her twice and she wasn’t sure if he was trying to make her KNOW that he was there, watching her. Eventually he got bored and left the store. 

This to me, is creepy predatory behavior 101. I don’t get how a creepy old dude with his own family and shit has time to follow a 20 something around. We told our landlord and she sent us a link to buy mace. I’ve been in these stalker situations before, however I don’t know how to get this dude off our backs. Since then, I’ve told the creep to “never bother my friend again” and to “fuck off”.

165,"TL;DR at the end!

Hi! I've never posted to this sub before, but I really need help with my situation. 

Two years ago, I started to go to this art studio, and they were really helpful don't get me wrong. But a couple of months back (January), I quit because I was graduating, and I was going to a different state. I had a few pieces of artwork and sketchbooks there, and I wanted them back because my mom works hard to pay for my art hobby and supplies, so I asked for them back. 

I texted my teacher to ask for them, and told me to come--I was under the impression that I could just go and get my artwork since COVID-19 is pretty big right now. However, he only gave back my basically empty sketchbooks (I used 2 pages) and a crappy landscape painting. I was still missing 2 pieces. I understood because they had just recently moved, and he told me to wait and when he finds it, he'll contact me. 

Practically a month goes by and nothing. I have anxiety issues especially socially, so it's hard for me to keep pestering people, but my mom was pressuring me to get back my art (which I really want back as well). I also want to mention that, yes, I should've asked for it when I left, but I kept forgetting (and my social anxiety was getting in my way), so I didn't. So I text him first, and he responds saying that some of them might have been lost during their move. And I asked what he meant, and he said that he might've thrown them away... and I told him I needed it. I was really shocked and worried because one of them won two awards and looked decent (the other one I don't really mind since I hated it lol). 

So a week goes by, and I text him again. This time he doesn't respond. I'm worried because someone said that they were going to use my artwork as someone else's art. It never struck me, so that's why I didn't keep pestering him when I left the studio. And I didn't leave the studio on bad terms so I don't know why they won't give it back. Do you think that they could potentially do that? Is the moving thing an excuse?

Please, please help! I've been kinda losing sleep over this situation, and I really want this to be done with. I just want my artwork back. 

Thank you for any suggestions that you guys might have! 

TL;DR: the art studio I was studying at won't give me my art back, saying that they can't find it due to them moving a few months back. That isn't an excuse, right? They can't use my artwork as someone else's?",09Jul2020,1

167," 

I work at a preschool that is owned by an older couple in their 60's and there are two other educators that have worked there since it opened 8 years ago in their 40's/50's. I've just joined about 2 months ago and I am in my 20's.

I normally work with the two women N and M, they are cold and sit and talk to eachother all day and it feels very highschoolish, they don't make me feel comfortable or value my input as an educator. I try to focus on the kids and be my happy positive self with them but it definitely brings me down.

Before I started there was another educator in my position who was great with the kids and very knowledgable according to the owner but M and N thought he was ""trying to run the show"" and caused serious problems with him to the point that he resigned because he wasn't made to feel welcome.

Then I joined and I feel like they hate me too and I've cried after work a few times because I feel uncomfortable there.

I work with just the owner that is in her 60's once a week and I thought she was lovely but lastweek I heard her call a child stupid to his face like 6 times. She wasn't even trying to hide it from me which makes me think she is okay with this and not ashamed of her behaviour. I was shocked. I knew I needed to quit soon.  
I would never ever do this and it's not okay with me at all, a lot of the shit they do is oldschool and they aren't really at the forefront of education.

Today I had a sore throat so I called in to say that I don't think I should come in because of COVID and the husband of the owner asked me to anyway saying he would check my temp. I went into the office, he checked it and said I was fine and can work. I felt uncomfortable but I have trouble standing up for myself tbh so after like 5 minutes I had a mini freak out and said I think it's irresponsible if I don't leave the school and go get tested. He made it out like I was being dramatic, stating that we dont have many cases down here and I haven't had a sore throat for long etc. Then he went to speak to M &amp; N and they said ""it;s just a sore throat and colds are going around and it's fine"" and if you ""insist on going and feel that you have to then we can't stop you"".

Basically they just made me feel really stupid like I was overreacting. I feel like they should want me to go and get tested because we are working with like 30 children who have a huge reach in the community and it could spread far and wide to grandparents, families, community members etc.

So now I'm going to quit, Is it okay to do it by email? And should I tell them why? Should I mention the owner calling a child stupid? I feel weird because there is no one higher up to complain to her about, I will be telling her husband basically.

I've just got no idea what to write and there is no way I'm going to call.

The owners are also going on holiday next week so I know they will be rooted if I quit and may not be able to go away. But I also feel like they should have treated me better and it's on them for poorly running their business and not having any other back up staff.

Thanks for any insight, sorry if its a bit long winded and choppy.",09Jul2020,1
168,"I stopped being friends for unknown reasons (we sort of drifted apart I guess for a reason I don't know, but maybe she had a reason) with a girl in about March-April.

We weren't friends for long (probably since August 2019), but quickly became close. We were so different, but bonded so well. We always talked about how lucky we were to have each other, I truly still feel lucky to have had her.

I really think she brought out the best in me and we did some great stuff together, we were always so happy. She was so different from my other friendships, we seemed so ""normal"" and like a coming-of-age movie friendship. I felt so comfortable around her and she did the same for me. We hung out with much different crowds at school, I was very outgoing and friends with many people she wasn't, and she honestly, wasn't very well liked because everyone thought she was so fake. But I liked her and none of that mattered to me. 

However, we didn't agree on some things. She said a slur frequently after I explained not to. She would get mad if I hung out with other friends but would seemingly brag when she hung out with others instead of me (even though I didn't care and encouraged her to have other friends). She also talked so much shit about my other friends to me, which just made me so uncomfortable. She seemed so hateful, and I just didn't understand why. She also called the girls in our grade who had done stuff with boys ""whores"" and seemed so angry that they had. She even tried to force herself into a relationship with my cousin knowing I was uncomfortable with it. There's so much more that happened, but it was just the little things like that that built up and led to some discomfort within me. 

The end of our friendship seemed to begin when I confronted her over hitting me (which she did as a joke). I felt disrespected by it and she profusely apologized, which I accepted. After that I guess, we just slowly stopped talking. She unfollowed my insta and seemingly cut me off. Stopped liking my posts or anything with me in it, didn't reach out when my relative died, and never texted me again. I seemed sort of happy to be out of what felt like a toxic friendship, but now I feel empty. Then corona happened and I stopped seeing her daily at school, and kind of just stopped thinking about her. I hadn't thought of her for a while until I saw her in public two weeks ago and she seemed so annoyed to see me there. I didn't say anything to her directly, but I smiled and waved, which she did back (but looked very upset in the process). I talked to her mom, who is so extremely kind and seemed excited to see me. Yet now, days after seeing her, I feel so empty. I don't even know why this sudden switch from indifference towards her to sadness has occurred. I know things were objectively not great between us and that I felt suffocated sometimes, but she really meant so much to me. I'm crying as I write this. I know she talked crap about me to anyone, but I would overlook it. I don't know what to do, have I lost a truly meaningful friend and it's too late? Or am I having second thoughts about leaving a toxic friendship? I think nothing bad of her and I don't think I could. I've tried to think she was terrible, but I don't think I can. I miss her so badly but I don't know if I should. I feel like reaching out but I don't want to regret it. What do I do?

So first off I'll say that my parents are good people and i love them but idk if their strict or not :p

1rst: im not going to give my specific age but in pretty young and just starting middle school... but hear me out, so I like/love playing video games (just like every other middle schooler) and my parents just hate it. 
My first limit was I had to start at 6pm and end 8pm (2hrs), but my day would forget and we (me and my sister) would play/watch any screen for about 3hrs and 30mins, my dad in turn would get mad and tell us to go to sleep :p . As I grew up I started to play games more and you know how they say ""time flys when your having fun"", my parents would always get mad at me for playing too much and would tell me ""cant you see the time!""

Now on to the present, 
I started to slowly but surely ignore their limits which in turn got my butt in to some trouble no doubt.

They think two hours is good enough time to play video games (too much time) I dont know whether this is true but their the parents so i dont fight it but I kind of doubt it (give your opinion pls.

And to make it even worse I have a phone (no duh)
And they count it as this so called ""video game time,"", so when I use my phone they treat it as If I just spent 10 days at my computer.
To add to this ""video game addiction"" they also add listening to my airpod as ""play/video game  time?""
Which to be honest is the one thing that keeps me not bored while I do something or nothing at all ever since the lockdown.

I think the reason they might be like this is because, their in the older side if the spectrum already in their early and late 50s ( I know this may have no effect on why this hate video games so much but i desperate for a reason to play video games :p)

I know it all sounds mundane but they take a aggresive push too the situation, like  if I'm playing video games I'm just wasting time that I can be using to be helpful they look at it as though if your not doing something productive your not doing any thing at all :p

Well expect  reading of course but I guess that productive.

I have my own freelance business that I would love to dedicate more time to but with my full time job it has been very difficult to do so.

182,"I'm sorry this might ramble a bit. I'm still in that fight or flight feeling. Possible TW for mentions of abuse.

I'm going to try to keep this as short as possible as talking about things that happened during my first marriage and the harassment after is very difficult.

My ex husband abused me for six years.
He was very controlling and even after the divorce he would stalk and harass me and think of new and inventive ways to try to punish me for leaving.

We are divorce since 2007 and he has been through several girlfriends and now a wife and a girlfriend.

His wife and him became a swingers.

I have been friends with male friend since 2013 and his wife since 2016. From my point of view they are good people. Very passionate about women's rights, against rape and domestic violence and advocate for them.

My oldest lived with her dad for about a year and a half because he was being weekend party dad.
Once she started getting real dad she left.
While she was still there she met my two friends.
The friend's wife she described as ex's wife's best friend. My guy friend she said owned the swingers club they go to. Friend never mentioned that to me because even though I don't advertise the fact, I fall on the ace spectrum and it can be fairly obvious.

The wife was over at ex's at least once and seemed to know all about my oldest daughter and walked around in just a shirt in front of daughter's boyfriend.
I always thought this story was about the woman that ended up being Ex's girlfriend with his wife that lives with them.

FB suggested friend and his wife to my daughter and she saw I was a mutual friend with them.

She let me know and sent me a screenshot showing they are mutual friends with them. Ex and his wife are blocked so I don't see that from my side.

I asked male friend and he said he barely knew them.
That they just belonged in the same club and they only knew each other since 2019.

I told him that my ex abused me and his wife helped abuse my youngest daughter.

He removed them both and said he didn't want to be friends with abusers, especially ones that hurt a friend of his, but that his wife is staying friends with ex's wife in case she needs support since abusers usually repeat offend.

Some things don't line up. The time my daughter first told me about the woman in a shirt and panties was in 2018. 

I don't mention him except as a generic my ex when relevant. Like I have court with my ex today. So they wouldn't have known his name. Except that male friend had met my oldest with me at a con once and I post lots of pictures of my kids. What's the odds that they just didn't know?

The scared irrational part of me that's still terrified of my ex is telling me to cut ties that they could be spying on my FB for him. Not that I post anything more than memes and family/pets pictures. But that run away protect myself feeling is strong.

The other part of me says it's rash to throw away a friendship over what is probably a misunderstanding.

My oldest says to unfriend them, but I am a middle aged nerd with questionable at best social skills.
I don't have a lot of friends in my area with similar interests in nerd stuff and politics. I want to believe these people I looked up to are honest like I thought and that it's just a strange circumstance.

I was in a relationship for the past 1.5 years so I didn’t let the apartment situation get me down too much, but I’m worried that another year there will be torturous especially now that I’m single and will have nowhere else to go. 

I just can’t tell if moving will be worth potentially damaging my friendships, spending more money, and dealing with craigslist roulette roommates? Has anyone else made a similar move?",09Jul2020,1
184,"Hi guys,

Recently my girlfriend decided to grow out her armpit hair. For some reason this is such a pet peeve for me and I can't stand it. Its a huge turn off and I haven't been sexually attracted to her for about 2 weeks. In passing a few times I have tried to tell her I really dont like it but my problem comes from the fact that it makes her happy and telling her that I think its unattractive makes me come off as a dick. She doesn't shave her pubes and I never found that attractive but I made the sacrifice because its her decision and thats what makes her happy. But now this? I can't describe how unattractive girls with armpit hair are to me and yes I sound like a dick but it makes me want to throw up. I have a thing with hair and she knows that (She has a very hairy cat and doesn't seem to mind sleeping in a bed covered in cat hair). I dont shave my chest because she likes it hairy. I dont know how to tell her and she has noticed I haven't been very intimate with her recently. I love her to the end of the world so please dont say something like ""if you really love her you wouldn't care"". I wish I didn't care but I get so turned off when I see her armpits. Am I an asshole?

What do you guys think I should do?",09Jul2020,1
185,"I’m seriously beginning to question my childhood. He always used to make fun of my weight, my height, my appearance, basically just belittling me. When I confronted him about it he’d say something like “Oh, I’m your father and I can say these things to you”. When he’s angry he has:
- threatened to kill me
- threatened to kill my mother
- threatened to break my legs 
- pointed weapons at family members
- threatened to disown me
- told me to kill myself

He fights with my mother constantly over stupid crap. He makes fun of her for making less money than he does. She says she won’t divorce because she worries about running out of money. She also fear that he may come hunt her down and kill her if she divorces. They tell me all the time I should be grateful I’m still married. I have a friend with divorced parents, and he says that she would kill to be in my shoes.

Some of these are over incredibly petty reasons. He pointed a knife at my mother when she didn’t cook him dinner. He threatened to break my legs when I accidentally clogged a toilet. He told me to kill myself when I got out of bed slowly.
Then he says “oh I didn’t actually mean it” or “oh I’m you parent and I love you, I would never actually do such a thing”

One of his favorite arguments to use against me is to blame his health problems on me. He will bring up his high blood pressure and say that my poor behavior causes his blood pressure to rise. He’ll then say that if he dies from this one day it’ll be my fault.

Then he’ll apologize and promise to be a better father in the future, only to repeat the cycle all over again. 
He says that his parents treated him like this too, using that as an excuse to treat me this way.

He used to smoke cigarettes. I’m not going to go so far as to wish cancer upon him, but if it strikes one day, perhaps it’s doing me a favor.",09Jul2020,1

187,"Around two weeks ago a huge spider crawled out at me from under my bed. That sounds weird, but it gets more complicated. 

I recently got the carpets in my room replaced, probably around two weeks ago. So a few nights after getting the new carpets, i’m chilling next to my bed on the carpets, because they’re soft, and a spider the size of a grape is full on charging at me from under my bed. This makes no sense because as I explained I recently got new carpets and my room was empty and it wasn’t there. My room is on the second floor and far from any door, so how and why would a spider go to my room? 

Okay, so one spider I brushed off as a one time thing. I caught the huge ass spider in a cup and let it go. But then probably four nights from today, I was once again, sitting next to my bed on the ground chilling, and a smaller spider crawls on my bed frame parallel to the direction I was sitting. Honestly it almost felt like it was fucking mocking me. Now, I’m not going to lie, I am a softie for animals and for me that includes bugs. I was a vegetarian for several years until my parents forced me to stop. So, when I see this spider, I  decide I need to save it. I didn’t have any cups in my room, and it was crawling so I was on a time crunch to catch it. Now I wish I had killed it. I went to the bathroom instead to get a cup, and by the time I got back it had disappeared. 

Ever since then I have had shitty sleep. I always know that if it still is in my room, it could crawl up to bite me. Anyways, two nights ago or so I wake up with bug bites and as I look I can’t tell if they’re spider bites or just mosquito bites. I think I’m in denial a bit, because all of them have like two bumps next to eachother, which I’m assuming means it’s a spider. However, I can’t see actual bite marks so I can’t say for sure. Since then I’ve had nothing, so I am really fucking joking i’m in the clear. 

Just to clarify, today i checked my whole bedroom to try and find it, and I didn’t see it. I think that means that it left, or at least i’m hoping that’s what it means. I apologize I don’t think this really fits this subreddit but i don’t know where to put it and i really just feel like i’m going fucking insane. If you read all of this thank you, I just need people to hear this.",09Jul2020,1
188,"(A bit of context: My family was going through a very rough time due to my mom's passing. My dad has always been emotionally distant from me and my siblings (3, I'm the oldest) due to him not knowing how to express his feelings. He only knows anger and buying us thing to make up for it. I can now see that's just how he was raised. Also, it wasn't until I was an adult that I was diagnosed with anxiety, depression and autism but I've had symptoms since before I was a teen. My teenage years were a nightmare, specially after this happened, my depression, self harm and eating disorder just keep spiraling out of control. English is bot my first language so please point out any mistakes so I can fix them)

When I was 14 my dad got me a kitten. I had always asked for a pet and he finally agreed to do so. I feel in love with that tiny furry boy the moment I held him. He was so curious, mischievous at times and just made me feel less lonely in this world.
I remember he was terrified of the vacuum and I wrapped him in a blanket and just held him. I don't know if it did anything but he eventually was okay with the vacuum as long as it wasn't in the same room as him. He was also scared of baths, through trial and error I found that he wasn't scared of the water, just the sound of running water so I started to fill the bath and close the tap before I got him in the bathroom. Somehow he always managed to find my phone charger or earphones and chew on them no matter how hard I tried to hide them before I went to school each morning. He also woke me up many times in the middle of the night because he keep trying to sleep on my face. Every night I made sure to give him the anti-fur ball paste, he love it.

Before we adopted him my dad made very clear that the cat  would be my sole responsibility, he would only help with the monetary part. Neither my dad or siblings would help/take care of unless it was an emergency. _(I know now I should've never agreed  to that condition because 1: a pet is the responsibility of everyone in the family unit (their lives are more important than petty ownership drama) and 2: I WAS CLEARLY NOT OKAY EMOTIONALLY, MENTALLY OR PHYSICALLY. I COULN'T DO IT ALONE.)_

The problem started with my insomnia and depression getting worse and me feeling like I slept -5 hours each night and not having energy to wake up early to clean the sand box. That pissed off my dad so much. (Btw, I always cleaned it right after I got home from school and I was the first one to leave in the morning.) So I decided to ask my siblings if they could clean any poop in the sand box in the mornings (their classes started an hour after mine did and they were always up before dad or me, they spent it watching TV)
They agreed. I was relieved. In hindsight, they were just 10. I'm not angry at them.
I should have noticed something wasn't right when there was way too much poop for just the time I was at school. I thought he just pooped more during those hours and forgot about it. It wasn't until a few weeks later that I became suspicious that my siblings weren't cleaning the poop even if I asked them every night if they could and then this happened:

me: ""Can you clean (cat)'s poop tomorrow morning?""
bro: ""No.""
me: ""No? why?""
bro: ""Dad doesn't let us.""
me: ""What do you mean?""
sis: ""He never let us clean it. He says it's yours to do.""

Yeah, I was angry, I felt betrayed, not at my siblings but at my dad for not saying anything to me. But I keep all the anger inside me and acted like nothing was wrong. During those following 6 months I started to become paranoid that my dad was waiting for me to do one mistake and use it against me for being a bad cat mom. (Was I the best cat mom I could have been? No, I was very ignorant about cats. Did I try? My f*cking hardest. Could I have been better? Honestly I don't know, I was nowhere near healthy enough to do it on my own at 14.)

Every summer I would spend it with my grandma on the countryside. Most of the time it would just be my grandma, my cousin, one of my aunt and me. My siblings would only stay there when my dad was with them bcs otherwise it would be too many kids and too few adults.
When summer came I wanted to bring my cat along but the vet explained more vaccines and other stuff wold be necessary and it would be best not to bring him along because the nearest vet there is like 2 hours away. So, me and my family decided that instead of me my sister would spend all summer there helping our grandma and I would only go for a week while my dad and brother would stay with my cat and then we would switch and I would stay with my cat the rest of summer.

I was anxious about only having 6 days to be with the friends I made there when I usually had 3 months. Yet I was happy that I could even go. 
I was only 4 days on the countryside when my sister told me ""They've given (cat name) back to the animal shelter"" I told her to not mess with me like that, it wasn't funny. I didn't believe her. I knew my dad also loved that cat, he took care of him just like he did us: distant yet paid for every need. I didn't believe my sister.

I came back, emotionally exhausted from all the socializing. I remember asking for my cat on the way back. I got no answer from dad. Now I was terrified. I vividly remember rushing to open the front door to see him. I got nothing. No orange fur. No meows. Just my dad saying ""I took him back to the animal shelter. You weren't taking care of him."" and my brother fucking smiled. 

The following year was my worst: my depression became complete numbness, my first mayor panic attack, I skipped all my classes, I couldn't get out of bed, I couldn't *think*

It took years for me to trust my siblings again. I still don't think I'll ever forgive or trust my dad again. It wasn't until I was put with an emergency psychiatrist evaluation and put on meds that he finally noticed that I wasn't okay no matter how many signs or how many times I told him. It's been 5 years and this still causes huge fights between us. 

##Did my dad do the right thing? Was I being neglectful? Is my anger/feelings of betrayal justified? Am I being irrational/petty?

_tl/dr: dad got me a cat at 14. I couldn't clean the sandbox before going to school due to mental health issues and dad got angry. He waited months until I was gone for a week to take him back to the animal shelter without telling me. This has almost completely destroyed our relationship to this day._",09Jul2020,1

____________________________________

I met him in august and really liked him but lost touch with him because it was the first week of college and I was spending a lot of time getting to know my girl friends. But the day before fall break in October I passed him twice which made us both kinda think of each other. I went to a party the day we got back from fall break and he was trying to get my attention the whole time and he came up to me and I hugged him. My friend told me he went up to her four times after I left asking where I was even when other girls were throwing themselves on him. She said he said I was so pretty and was blushing when he was talking about me. Him and I started to talk at parties often over the next month. We’d flirt a lot and really liked each other. There was this girl, Brianna who he started talking /hooking up with to in September. I think he kinda pushed her to the side for me considering I saw her hugging him at a party once and than saw him push her off and he came up to me. Than one night my friend who he was asking about me told him he should take me to his formal. He asked her if I’d say yes and if I’d really wanna go and than told me he was gonna ask me. He flirted with me for hours that night . He was holding my hips and was kinda obviously flirting. I know this was wrong of me but I get nervous around guys. I think he was really nervous because he could hardly hold a conversation and usually he can. He was looking at the ground while he was talking to me and was was hardly putting two words together and it made me feel like he didn’t wanna talk. I was talking to my friend, and than him and his friend came up to us, than my friend asked me to come with her to find someone and I said yes. I think he kinda felt rejected and hurt because twenty minutes later he sent me a picture with a girl in his room. I[18F] got annoyed and said kinda rude things on sc and than the next day I saw him out again. My friend asked him about if he asked me to the dance and he got really upset and started saying “NO I have a date I’m taking Brianna”. Than she told him to go find me and he said “FINE I will where is she”. He came up to me and I was looking at him all pissed off. He asked me why I was so mad and than he said “your just mad because I won’t take you to formal”. Him and I got into a play fight I guess and than tried talking about things on text for an hour the next day but nothing came of it because neither of us talked about what really happened. I drunk texted him (I know I shouldn’t have) twice over the next month but I still didn’t open up about anything. He was kinda rude back to my rude drunk texts and basically we lost all constant for November and December. He started dating the Brianna girl during his time.

Than after winter break I started seeing him out a lot again. I excepted to see him with her and for it to hurt but than I’d move on. But the first night back I noticed him pacing by my friend group a lot. Than my friend told me later he was staring at me the entire night. He said hi to my friend he hardly knows in the beginning of the night and than later came up to her and lurked around our group. Than my friends and I were standing by his girlfriends group and he walked up to her and started to pretend to talk to her (his back was to me). I could feel him staring at me out of the corner of his eye and his eyes flinching back and fourth at me for a long time. He finally did a 360 spin away from her to talk to me and stood there looking frozen. He looked like he was trying to talk but couldn’t. So I said “your in my class”. And he responded using a voice where it sounded like he was trying to calm himself and said “I know. Fuck that class fuck that class” (it’s a hard class). I couldn’t really take it and felt upset and I naturally just went “mhm”and turned away from Him. He stood there looking heartbroken and frozen than ran off. Than the next week I saw him out and he was so cold. He was glaring at me from a distance than walked up to me and glared at me.. than when I turned away he glared at me from the other side of me. Also on the way to me his girlfriend tried to grab him and he brushed her off. He coincidentally walked up to his friend while I was talking to him. He also walked up to me and in a cold voice said “how’ve you been”. I said good how have u been”. He looked me up and down, scrunched his face, reached out and pet my shoulder, turned his back to me, and walked away. The next day, we had to stand outside of my math class and he stood by me instead of all his bffs in the class. I saw him out after this and he was blacked out so I asked why he was so mad and he said it was “texts. It was from months ago”. I asked him if he was trying to hurt me and his drunk self insisted “no no” and than he said sorry. After this I saw him out and he was staring at me from a distance w a smirk and eyebrow raise.. he held eye contact until I looked away. His behavior continues for months. Basically I’m confused and can anyone help",09Jul2020,1

She has gone so far as to say I shouldn't be a nurse because I'm not super neat and it fucking drags me down a lot it's just so fucked up because I'm trying my best. I'm just trying to figure out what to do I landed an interview this week I'm hoping it goes well but what can I do if shes refusing to let me do my job I'm just burnt out I snapped at her today normally I can keep my cool but at this point I'm just over it I cant even anymore.

194,"hey all,

i was texting with my girlfriend, and we started talking about me. one thing led to another and i asked her do i make excuses when i'm wrong. she told me she didn't know, so i assumed that it was probably a yes. i kept pushing and it turns out that 70% of the time i do and 30% of the time i don't. 

i was happy she told me. i want to better myself. i asked her, why she never told me sooner and she told me that she didn't think it was an issue because i always owned up to my mistakes. i would make an excuse and still take the blame. i'm a walking contradiction it seems. she wasn't very detailed with it, she doesn't remember any examples of me being so, so i don't even know where to start. 

one more thing, that is one of the things i hate most. not about myself, i wasn't even aware i did it until today. but i always judged people and criticized people who did. who made excuses for everything they did, and it turns out that i'm that person. it's kind of funny how oblivious i was to my hypocrisy. that's besides the point. 

how am i able to take responsibility without making an excuse? how can i admit to my mistakes without coming up with a reason why i did so? 

i wonder if i judged people based on that, i'm sure there are other things about myself that i see in other people and criticize them for. that's all, thank you everybody who responds🖤.",09Jul2020,1

Bueno, este post lo subí con otra cuenta hace unas semanas, pero para permanecer anonimo, desde ahora voy a usar esta cuenta. 

También voy a postear una actualización a la situación y esto va a servir de contexto.

Aunque ya muchos me han respondido en la publicación anterior una nueva opinión nunca sobra, asi que cualquier consejo o literalmente cualquier wea que quieran decir sobre el tema no duden en escribirlo.

Bueno, ahora el contexto (el post anterior) para entender lo que pasó después, se que es una paja de leer, si no creen nececitar contexto sigan bajando hasta unas lineas en el post.



CONTEXTO/POST ANTERIOR:

Bueno, partamos por el inicio, hace unos años (masomenos 2) conocí a una wna, super tela, tda la wea (creo que seria bueno añadir que nunca me gustó)

Pero bueno, los últimos años hemos hablado harto, tanto online como IRL, mi problema es este, últimamente ya no hablamos tanto, principalmente porque usualmente yo iniciaba las conversaciones y como que me chatee de eso y decidí ver que pasaba si de la nada paraba (eso pasó masomenos en Diciembre del 2019).

Ahí es cuando la cosa se puso interesante.

La wna, como que empezó a jotearme harto y como que parecía que yo le gustaba, yo bien piola decidí no hacer nada, como si no entendiera lo que según yo ella estaba tratando de hacer, bueno, pasaron unos meses y como que el joteo paró, lo cual me alivió mucho, ya que se estaba volviendo un poco chato tener que hacerme el weon ante las indirectas mas directas que he visto.
Ahora si, al problema.

Esta wna masomenos cada semana me escribe para que veamos una película (obviamente online ya que estamos todos en cuarentena) entonces yo, que no tengo mucho que hacer gracias al pana Covid, le pregunto qué día quiere ver la película y a que hora, ya que prácticamente puedo todo el día, ella pone una fecha y hora (es importante clarificar que ELLA sugiere ver la película y ELLA pone el dia y la hora, hasta prácticamente ELLA elige la película) bueno, llega el día y la hora de la película y le escribo para ver si se va a conectar y me dice que no puede, yo estaba algo confundido la primera vez, pero pensé que seguramente aun no ha terminado algun trabajo y tampoco quería presionar mucho, asi que le digo que no hay problema y que re-agendemos un día, NUEVAMENTE le pregunto a ella que elija un día y hora donde ella pueda y así lo hace. Bueno, nuevamente es el dia y hora de la película y le pregunto dónde está, ella de nuevo dice que no puede, bueno, esta vez le digo que da lo mismo y me despido sin re-agendar.

Pasan literalmente 3 dias y me escribe si quiero ver una película el viernes, yo le digo que si e insisto que ella elija el dia y la hora puesto que ella es usualmente (prácticamente siempre) la que no puede o cancela, ella acepta y elige un día y hora. 

Llega nuevamente el dia y hora de la película y le escribo para ver dónde está (quiero destacar que ese dia era mi cumpleaños y queríamos hacer un maratón de películas para festejarlo, nuevamente, eso también fue su idea, no mia), me responde a la media hora diciendo que no puede y que re-agendemos para la semana que viene, yo, ya bien chato sobre todo esto, acepto igual y le insisto a que elija un día y hora y que verifique que en realidad no tiene nada que hacer y que puede ver las películas, ella acepta, y dice que no tiene nada para el próximo viernes y además pone una hora. Bueno, llega el viernes y pasa lo mismo.

Esto se repite 4 veces más, la última vez (literalmente ante ayer) parte masomenos así: le escribo tipo 3 (se supone que la película es a las 10) para ver si aún puede ver la película, y vaya sorpresa, no puede, me dice que tiene que hacer una enorme cantidad de trabajos y además me manda foto de su agenda supongo que para confirmarlo con ""evidencia"". 

Bueno, yo ya me lo veía venir, asi que simplemente seguí con mi dia hasta las 10:30, donde me llega una llamada de un grupo de amigos en el que ella y yo estamos, yo me meto para decirle a uno de mis bros que está en la llamada grupal que se meta al Discord (un Discord de otro grupo de amigos donde ella no esta) para que me acompañe a mi y a unos bros en OverWatch (que era lo que estaba jugando cuando me llegó la llamada) y la veo a ella ahí como si nada hablando tranquila, tan pronto ve que me uní dice ""oh, se unió"" (no lo dijo en un mal tono ni nada, es más, sonó bastante tierno) bueno, yo ni le respondo y simplemente le digo a mi pana que se una al OverWatch.

Ahora la parte donde los necesito, kbros de reddit, que hago? Porque chucha una wna te podría pedir ver una película, ELLA MISMA escojer la hora Y EL DÍA solo para decirte que no puede?
Entiendo que tal vez no quiera ver la película, y el hecho que ""de la nada no pueda"" sea una excusa, pero en ese caso, PARA QUE CHUCHA me pide ver una película de nuevo?!?!?

(Ya muchos me respondieron en el post anterior, pero aun así, si quieren dar su opinión, adelante)

Kbros de reddit, en vdd me ayudaría mucho en este dilema de cuarentena cualquier ayuda o simple comentario que me puedan dar. 

(Me acabo de dar cuenta que tal vez sea importante, tengo 16 años, se que probablemente estoy siendo medio weon en la situación, asi que cualquier ayuda sirve, gracias a todos por adelantado)



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


ACTUALIZACIÓN:

Bueno, después de seguir el consejo de muchos, dejé de aceptar las propuestas (no la bloqueé porque me pareció un poco extremo y pese a todo aun me cae super bien) 

Ahora estamos hablando menos q nunca, usualmente a los más que llega es que envío o me envia un meme o algo así, un ""jajajaj"" y ya está.

Debería tratar de revivir la amistad?

Hay que tener en cuenta q hablamos casi a diario por como 2 años y como que no se si deberia simplemente mantenerlo asi (casi sin hablar) o debería iniciar una conversación de algun tipo, tal vez esperar hasta que ella inicie la conversación?

La verdad no se. No espero que mucha gente se haya llevado la lata de leer todo, pero aun así, si pueden comentar cualquier cosa estaria bkn",09Jul2020,1
197,"I only really made this account to ask for advice on one thing. No one really understands so I’m on reddit hoping that maybe one of you might be going through the same thing as me? I’m going to university soon and I’m the youngest of three children to two asian immigrants. My older siblings have a huge age gap compared to me and moved out due to family complications with my dad before I was the age of 10 so it’s always felt like I’m an only child (I really envy you if you have siblings around your age). 

My parents are getting old now and they’ve always been on bad terms with my dad always being on top. The only way to put it is that they argue constantly. My dad is always constantly berating my mum, swearing abuse at her for simple mistakes and constantly bringing up the past unnecessarily, blaming her for being some sort of disease in our family. To sort of explain the hierarchy in this family, my dad is good enough at speaking English, can drive, has multiple jobs whereas my mum can’t speak English at all and works overtime as a cleaner to make ends meet; she has poor health and has ongoing illnesses. My dad is the main reason my brother and sister left the house. You can already kind of guess that arguments in my household aren’t exactly verbal.

I hate being in this house. In my room, crying while hearing all the shouting, wanting to die because I’m too scared to stop it and hating myself because I just let it go on. My sister is practically out of my life and I’ve been resenting her for sometime because she has her own personality problems and she’s never really been there for me anyways. My brother is on my mums side and probably shows more compassion than the rest of us but he can never be in the house at the same time as my dad in the event that some altercation arises. I can never stand up to my dad either.

I’ve been counting down the days until I can finally leave once I finish sixth form to go to university but I’m terrified. I want to escape this place and live my life but I can’t leave my mum alone and I don’t want to. I hate my sister for abandoning us but by leaving my mum alone with my dad I feel like I’m doing the same thing. All of my aunties and uncles know what the relationship between my parents are like but no one ever intervenes- and I don’t blame them. For example, once they were over for dinner and it started to get heated so my aunties just left. Or, one time, my cousins and their parents were sleeping over at ours and they started arguing and my auntie (on my dads side) started crying and left with my cousins threatening to get a hotel. One of my cousins told me to go with them but I can’t just leave my parents alone like that so I just stayed (and they had to return because it was like 4am and there were no hotels)

There are so many complications along with all this that makes it so hard to solve. My dads mum was borderline psychotic and abusive and scarred my dad (who was the eldest out of his siblings). I cant get rid of the image where we were arguing and he just started crying while shouting and started screaming about his childhood. My mum is fragile and financially dependent on my dad so it’s not like they can get separated. I would love for them to get divorced but it’s impossible in our community as-well, because they’re typical asian parents they care more about their reputation than anything else. If my mum was alone she would have nowhere to go. I could never report my dad because... he’s my dad and he’s done so much for me.

It would be bearable if they had equal amount of power in the family or if I wasn’t the youngest or if I had siblings to get through it with me or if we had money or maybe even if divorce was acceptable but it’s just not like that.

Sometimes I just lie alone, feeling trapped. I feel like the only time all this weight will be lifted from my shoulders will be when one of the three of us dies. I know my situation could be worse but I’m just trying to see if anyone has been through the same thing? And what they’ve done and what the outcome was? I have close friends who know about this to an extent but they’re just teenagers/young adults like me so there’s nothing they can do plus I don’t want to burden them with my problems too much because I know they’re going through their own things.

198,"So there is a house 2 blocks away from us that contains like 9 kids and one mom.
The mom really doesn’t care about the kids, and these kids ASK STRANGERS If they can go into their house or pool. 

The first encounter was a boy and the sister (8 and 7?) walked straight into our backyard and asked to play in playground area. My parents said they were fine with it. Bad idea.

They ignored my little brother who asked to play with him in his playground, they destroyed toys, put fucking sand everywhere, PUT WATER IN THE SANDBOX witch made a fucking mess and other countless things. These brats didn’t care when we asked them to not do that.

Forward a week or later they kept trying to ask us to play and stuff, we kept saying no. 
THEY DONT STOP.

one month later the boy with his Godamn bike kept trying to run over my small dog.
The dog was not hurt but was scared. No one fucking does that. Then the kid kept calling me names. 

Forward a few months now they asked us if they could swim in our pool, seems sweet but they are like already dressed up, and probably asking strangers.
I know it also the mothers fault, but I’m not sure what to do?
I know they are going to trespass.

I’m only 13 but I can’t deal with this godamn brats. They aren’t stopping, they’re most likely to trespass, can I charge the other with neglect??!",09Jul2020,1

201,"Super long story so let me sum it up.

I was abused very badly for the majority of my life. I have extremely bad jealousy issues and a need of acceptance because of this. 

This caused alot issues with my  boyfriend and I. He basically dropped me for some stupid game and lied to me multiple times regarding it despite me being supportive. This has left me with an extreme fear of being replaced by a video game and him finding other people who are better than me on there. 

Recently, my dad kicked me out and disowned me 2 years after my mother did because of this, My depression has been extremely bad. I'm honestly extremely close to suicide. 

Today, after a 6 month break, he announced he was thinking of playing again and began playing 5 hours after saying that. I had no time to prepare. With everything else going on, I feel extremely worse. I feel like we're going to go in a circle and hes going to start ignoring me and lying to me again. Hes going to replace me. 

With any other game, I have no feelings. I dont mind him playing video games jnfact, i encourage it. I want him to have fun and to have time for himself. Its only fair. It's just this one specific game that's caused so many problems. 

I want to get better so he can have fun. I just honestly feel like I cant deal with it. I cant go through that again. If anything bad happens regarding it I honestly think itll be the breaking point for me and I'll be in serious danger. 

How do I get over this fear? I feel like he brought it up at an extremely bad time and gave me absolutely no time to prepare. I'm terrified. Please help.",09Jul2020,1

But I’m not entirely sure of all the options for me out there, what some of those jobs entail, and how to even start when it comes to trying to find opportunities. The thought of social media work sounds really interesting, or even article writing, but I fear the lack of stability in freelance, so what else is there that I could do instead?

But around late November I made a joke that they didn’t appreciate, but they didn’t tell me. I quickly realized they didn’t like it and apologized, and they said that it was basically whatever. But they were still passive, so I stopped texting them. But I never stopped thinking about them. 

Few months later, late May, I decided to say fuck it and hit them up. And ever since then we hit it off. We’ve been talking daily, and it’s been great. Recently, I’ve been calling them during free time and we’ve had a blast. But once again, I’ve said some things I shouldn’t have, and I apologized and I do take full responsibility for making them upset.

My boyfriend goes through a depressed stage about 2 times a year. Well we both do to an extent but we deal with it differently. I try my hardest to be around people for a sense of normalcy while I’m going through it. When he goes through it he becomes very distant and almost bitter. I hate to see him like it and all I want to do is comfort him but he doesn’t want to hangout (with me or anyone) as much and he does not want much for conversation. 

Wondering if anyone has any advice on what to do? I want to give him space but I also don’t appreciate when he goes quiet... he communicates that he’s depressed but that’s about the extent of our communication on the subject while it’s happening. We are so great majority of the time but he’s nearly a different person while he goes through it and it hurts me because I do not know how to act and we don’t see each other nearly as often. He just kind of goes dark. I feel I have to act different, pause my own feelings, and let him have his space but where do I draw the line? Weddings and family events come up and he never wants to be involved while he’s going through it but I feel you can’t put life on pause every time you get sad.. I don’t want to be insensitive because I know we all deal with it differently but I just wish there was more I could do to help besides giving him his space, which in turn causes me to become sad. He does still make time for me but it’s just not the same as I can still feel his sadness.. and I do know he feels bad about how it makes me feel but he can’t really help it when he goes through it?

I’m sure there isn’t much I can do in terms of helping him besides being there for him if he needs to talk but I just don’t know how to regulate my own feelings while it happens so any advice would help.",09Jul2020,1

209,"I am a 23 years old male who is OUT but I am a very masculine guy . My friend is 23 years old attractive male too and we’ve been close for a while now . We are friends from back in high school . 

We’ve known each other for years now and for the last year and half we hang out pretty much everyday to have some beers and smoke . Him and I do pretty much everything together and we have fun . We agree on a lot of stuff but we also have discussions that end up agreeing usually . We have personal conversations all the time and tell each other personal information .

Recently a really hot girl asked him on a date and he accepted to go . He went on date and told me how they had sex multiple times but he said he had a good time with her , but he keeps telling me he doesn’t want to like her . He said she has too many red flags like her “kinks and views” gave him a bad impression . He said she was one of the hottest girls he’s been with and I agree she is a total babe ! 

The other day I was at bar and downloaded grindr and saw a guy I’ve talked to before that I had chatted on tinder with and I asked him what he was up to ... I ended up leaving bar drunk where he was working and going to guys place to hang out . My buddy was texting me all night and asking me where I was and if I was hooking up with some guy .... I told him I fell asleep at the guys place and he continued to ask me questions about the guy . What he looked like , where he lived , what he did for work and etc .. he was acting but weird and then told me he was going on another date with the girl and I said, “that’s great ! “ . 

The next day he asked me for password for my phone and he saw the Grindr app on my phone and brought it up ... he said he didn’t think it was bad but started talking about how sexuality isn’t something that he thinks should be narrow. He said if a guy wanted to suck his dick I wouldn’t take offense to it ... He went on to ask me to delete my account and my app and he would delete his tinder . I didn’t mind doing it so I did it but he kept looking at my screen making sure I deleted everything .  He said those apps aren’t good for us.

Yesterday on his date , I texted him good luck a while before his date and he “loved the message” . But when he was on his date he texted me asking me where I was . I was unfortunately sleeping and didn’t see message . He later texted me after his date asking me what I was doing . He said “just fucked her to sleep and he was just chilling “ I don’t see why he would be texting me while he’s on date . 

I don’t know what to think , I love this man as a friend and care for him but idk how to feel sometimes . If he kissed me I would kiss him back, but it’s like something I am scared to try because I am not the type of guy to do that . 

Him and I are very touchy with each other and just really close friends . he loves telling everyone I’m gay so maybe I am thinking too much about it . But he tends to ask me a lot about the guys and who I hang with . Am I thinking about it too much or should I ask him how he feels?",09Jul2020,1
210,"Okay, this all just happened today and I just feel terrible, and sick to my stomach. 

I’m getting married within the next couple of weeks amidst the pandemic. However, before this all started I chose my groomsmen. My one groomsmen who I’ll call Pat (not real name), was one of the first people that I asked to be a groomsmen. We met in college through his girlfriend who I was really close with and still are. We hit it off and became good friends. I asked him because I wanted him to be there. 

I had also asked my older brother (Tim, not real name) to be a groomsmen. He also accepted. Tim...is really just stupid in my opinion and has never really been a good person since he turned 18 and moved out, and is basically a red neck racist for literally no reason. I’m still so confused as to why he thinks and acts the way he is. But he still has a few good moments. However it was at the point where originally I wasn’t going to ask him to be in the wedding party because A) he’s an a$$hole and B) I really didn’t think he would actually care to be in it because that’s just who he is. But when he kept asking who was going to be groomsmen I just said idk yet, until I finally said my friends from college. Then he was just really sad and maybe angry? Idk he was just very distraught the rest of the night. Then I talked to my mom and dad and they both said that you always have your brother as a groomsmen. My mom just babies everyone, but even my dad thinks Tim is just a stupid asshole and he still told me he should be on. That was so confusing. After that I felt so guilty, and decided to put him on as one of the groomsmen.  

Fast forward to today after the pandemic and BLM protests start. And I will say that I am completely for the BLM protests against oppression and police brutality. Pat looks on Tim’s Facebook page that is riddled with so many racist posts and anti BLM photos. Pat messages me in a long message that he doesn’t feel comfortable or safe to come to the wedding because of Tim. I feel awful just for not telling him about Tim, but I just kinda tune him out when he talks. I also spoke with my brother about Pat and pretty much told him if he makes any kind of stupid comment then he’s out, and he said he understands and accepted it , at least I think. Anyways I can’t just kick Tim out of the wedding because I would receive so much backlash from my entire family meaning people not coming or me being resented, but I just feel like a complete ass because I’m not. I am really glad that he found the courage to speak up and tell me rather than just be miserable the entire time, but I just feel awful and don’t know what to do.",09Jul2020,1

So there's this woman around my age (mid 20's) that I admire as a person, but I don't know if I want to be in a serious relationship with her...

I know her from work... we work in different departments, different hours... I messaged her last year a few times and we briefly talked and have things in common

I know women usually want things defined, like if it's a date or not...
but is this expected when we haven't even hung out in person yet?

I want to get to know her, but honestly don't know if I want to date her yet... what do I do?

217,"So my life hasn't been great. I was sexually abused by an older guy since I was 8. He told me that I was gay and I believed him although I had crushes on girls prior and post the first time. During my puberty once or twice seldomly more a year he would force himself on me. But I always kinda jerked off to girls.I never had a crush on a guy. And everything else was usual in my growing up besides that. Normal friends, usual crushes, normal parents. The tears I let off after every time were unreal after he forced himself on me. But I couldn't escape. I was his toy. Mentally and physically. At a point long after I am comfortable saying I shunned him because I got stronger. So I went on to live my life. My first time with a girl was when I was 19. I had literal panic attacks about what if what happened to me made me gay. I couldn't breathe. And my dick stopped working from the fear.  I thought I've become gay. I cried myself to sleep that night and literally 3 days after that I started jerking off to a better version of what happened with that girl. I jerked off for like 5 months to that. And in the beginning I cried out of happiness because it meant I wasn't gay. I had a few relationships since then all with girls. But no sex. Mainly because of my muslim surroundings and girls waiting for marriage. But it wasn't a problem. I knew what I was because of my jerking off and other details like my penis getting hard only from kissing with women. So I lived happily till last year and a paranoid panic attack while being high on marijuana where I fought myself to not start yelling at myself the words ""I am gay"" while I was surrounded by people. Which later I found was PTSD. Panic attacks followed after stopping to smoke. The same stuff. I literally thought I was going crazy. So I told my parents what happened to me. They were supportive. And told me even to be what I want. But it's not about that. It made me confused. I developed a form of OCD named HOCD. And suddenly I started questioning my relationships, my crushes, my sexuality. My libido fell off. I see girls, nothing anymore. No reaction. It's like what it was like while watching dudes. I touch boobs nothing anymore. I tried sleeping with a woman. Nothing. While at the same time I have become ashamed around guys. And last night I jerked off while looking the guy in a porno, not the woman. My masculinity fell off. I have become a nut job. I don't know who I am anymore. I feel suicidal because I was happy god damn it. Why does my past haunt me this much. Do I deserve to live a life like I want it?

222,"Ok so I live in the UK, and around 8 months ago, through a gc in instagram, I met this girl (she lives in NY). We never really talked to start with but like a month ago, we started talking in DM’s. I started to get feelings for her, and she said that if we lived closer, she would date me. Our relationship just got stronger from there and we just had a conversation about our relationship. She was saying how it’s unfair on myself that I’m not putting myself out there to find a gf, but then the point came up that I could move to NY. 

At first I thought like, “ah nah, that can’t happen” but then I started to think about it a lil bit more and honestly Idk what’s better. Cause like, I wouldn’t be leaving that much behind tbh. I live in a place where there’s dodgy people around every corner, I only have a small group of friends that I would miss, like they’re the only people I meet up with frequently. And my family is like, idk, I wouldn’t really miss them. The only people I’m worried about are my grandparents cause they’re all still alive and tbf, some of them don’t have too many years left but idk, I try not to think about it. Plus I can always FaceTime them and stuff as well, that goes for friends as well.

But like, I mean we both love each other, but we’ve both said that we can’t ‘be a thing’ cause of the distance. Like for me at least, the physical side of things is a lot on a relationship. I don’t mean just sex, like I’m a virgin ffs, but like, kisses, hugs, just being able to see them.

But I’ve been thinking. If I manage to get a decent job, I can save up money for a quick like 3 week holiday to NY, so I can go see her, like when I’m 18 or something, just to see what we’re liek together in person, but I did some research and I think it’s gonna cost like £3000 in total for the entire trip but that’s only a rough estimate

I just like, idk what to do, cause I love her, I really do, and she loves me, and I feel like I can see us actaully Working out, but like, this is both of our first real relationships tbf as well, and like, all the prep if I were to move to NY like becoming a citizen, the passport, housing, a job, all that shit, it’s just like, idk, I just don’t know what to do.

We were both like ""what the heck was that?"" We were confused since we thought we locked it. So the reason the door didnt open all the way was because we also locked it with the ""U"" lock. So we went to open the door and there was some lady claiming she worked for the hotel and if I had called about needing help with something. I said ""no?"" And then opened the door wider, and she saw my friend and was surprised and then was like ""oh okay!"" And she left. We were confused but we just locked the door again and walking back to bed I even said ""Even if I did call for help, why would you open the door without knocking?"".

227,"So, I don’t know for sure if this would be considered a problem, but I thought I’d just make sure.
About two years ago someone very close to me died and everyone who had known him got very sad and cried and all of that, but I couldn’t care less. In fact my mom and brother still haven’t fully gotten over it. 

So basically, I know that I’m supposed to be sad and upset and depressed by someone’s death, but even the thought of it doesn’t bother me. I’ve thought about how I’d feel if my mom or my best friend died, and I still feel as though it wouldn’t bother me. 

I don’t understand how I’m supposed to feel, clearly the person who’s dead couldn’t care less what I think because they’re dead. But I know that. And yet I still feel guilty.

I isn’t like I don’t feel empathy or something like that, I can feel sad by watching shows or videos that upset me. And I can be depressed and happy and such. I just don’t see why I can’t mourn the death of people I care about.

I’ve always had trouble reading people, and end up upsetting them all the time by something I said or did. I’m always told that the way I talk to people comes off as rude or distant or aggressive, and that I talk about “sensitive topics” way too casually.

I’ve looked possible reasons for this (yes I know the internet isn’t reliable when it comes to ones mental health, I just thought I look anyways) and the most common thing to show up is stuff about  a type of autism close to that of Asperger’s syndrome. and stuff about sociopaths and psychopaths (which I’m almost certain isn’t a problem).

Anyways, I just want some other people’s opinions on what could be up with me, or if I’m just being too paranoid and I’m overreacting.",09Jul2020,1
228,"Hey Reddit,

I'm going through a difficult time right now with my grandmother, and wanted to turn to Reddit for some help and advice around what type of housing I should get for her.

Some background on my grandma:  she lives alone, and with things around the apartment, she's fairly self sufficient--she can cook, shower, etc., but doesn't leave the apartment much.

To help her with groceries and other necessities, family visits her every so often to bring her the things she needs, and talk to her, as she doesn't have any other people to interact with.

What makes her significantly difficult to take care of, is that she is very difficult to be around.  She will often treat people with disrespect and spite, and often angers the people around her.

She's moving to California (for various reasons I won't get into), and I'm looking at various options for her.  She has medical and medicaid, and is currently in section 8 housing.  We found that it would be best to find her a place that had a decent distance away from other immediate people/neighbors. If she's in very close proximity to people for long periods of time, problems are likely to arise. It would significantly help out if we had someone that could help take care of her.

I've come to Reddit to ask for some help in identifying the best housing situation for her.  I thought about assisted living, nursing home, or a new section 8 (government housing assistance) apartments.",09Jul2020,1
229,"
 I’m going to try to make this as short as possible.
Back story: I’m (20F) and my ‘friend’ Tyler (fake name for privacy purposes) is also (20M). We’ve been good friends since middle school and I always considered him someone I could trust. He grew up in a world that has not been so kind to him, but he always treated everyone around him so well. We developed feelings for one another in high school and he asked me out. I said no because deep down I knew I didn’t want to be involved with him romantically, nor did I want to risk ruining our friendship. I ended up dating someone else a while later (we’re still together), and Tyler &amp; I remained friends. My boyfriend liked Tyler and sometimes we’d all hangout which was always a good time. 

Tyler recently got a girlfriend (his very first girlfriend, too) but here’s the catch: she is 4 years younger than him, lives across the country, and before he moved there, they only met
once. They were on &amp; off for about a year until she messaged him 2 years ago asking to catch up. Things took off for them and he would confide in me for relationship advice when needed, or just someone to express his excitement to. I was supportive and overjoyed for Tyler! After everything he’s been through in his life, he deserved happiness and love more than anyone. One day while Tyler and I were hanging out, he told me how jealous his girlfriend was that we hangout. I immediately felt bad and wanted to somehow reassure his girlfriend that she had nothing to worry about, so I asked Tyler if I could message her and he said yes.

 Later that night I messaged her, explaining that Tyler and I have been close friends for years and that I support their relationship because he’s happy, and as a friend, that’s all I ever wanted for Tyler. I also told her I have a boyfriend. Her reply back was disrespectful and rude. She told me that she doesn’t trust me and that I’m “a bitch”. She also said that she knew Tyler liked me because he “talks about” me all the time to her. I apologized to her for that she saw me as those things, and she said “stop being so nice, god”. I then stopped messaging her and told Tyler. He excused her behaviour as “oh she’s just feisty, don’t take it personally”. I suggested that we maybe stop hanging out because I didn’t want to be the reason for their fights anymore, but he assured me that it was fine and we could still hangout. He stopped telling her that he was hanging out with me because she told him he wasn’t allowed to see me again, so he would lie and tell her that he’s going out with other friends. After doing this a few times, I told him that he shouldn’t be lying to her and that she shouldn’t be controlling him. He agreed, but he said he cares a lot for her and couldn’t break up with her. My boyfriend even told Tyler that he was seeing red flags, but Tyler dismissed it as her being ‘feisty’. A few months later, I moved away for university. We still hung out on the weekends I went home, but I spent the majority of my time in the new city I was living in and my boyfriend would come up to see me most weekends. 

Fast forward to October 2019, Tyler told me he was moving across the country to be with his girlfriend. Initially I was a little surprised, but also excited for him because I always believed he needed to get out of our hometown to truly find himself. I asked him if he found a job/a place to live there and he said no. This did not surprise me one bit. Tyler doesn’t have a great work ethic and always settles for the bare minimum. He never went to college &amp; he barely passed his classes in high school. He’s lived in some sketchy places (people smoking in the apartment, people stealing things from others in the apartment) and he lived in a tent for a little bit after he was kicked out. So, to hear he had no plans didn’t shock me. 

I came home over Thanksgiving and was out shopping with my boyfriend one evening. We went into a store where one of our friends was working to visit, &amp; we got onto the topic of Tyler moving across the country with some of his friends (I didn’t know he was going with friends, so I felt relieved to hear this). He said that Tyler told him he got into a good university there for some type of science and that’s why he was making the drastic move. My boyfriend and I chuckled because Tyler has no plans on going to university and he told me he’d have to upgrade his high school classes if he wanted to go. So we told our friend that he has a girlfriend there who’s 4 years younger than him and that’s why he’s moving. Our friend was in disbelief and said that Tyler never mentioned anything about having a girlfriend. I thought this was really weird. And to this day, nobody would guess he has a girlfriend. He hasn’t told anyone about her besides his close friends, and even they say that Tyler doesn’t talk much about her. One of his best friends told me that Tyler always spoke “much higher of me than his girlfriend” and that none of his friends like his girlfriend. I became worried for Tyler, but never said anything. 

Now it’s November 2019 and Tyler was at the airport with two of his friends about to take off to across the country. I think Tyler was experiencing some nervousness because he repeatedly told me that he “misses me so much already” and that “I have to promise we’ll stay in touch”. I told him we’ll be friends forever and that he can do this. I truly believed that this was good for Tyler because our hometown is nothing but bad memories and hopelessness for him. A new city could change him. 

Now, things get crazy.. Tyler landed a few hours later and the first thing he told me is that he still has feelings for me. I was stunned. I sat there for a little bit until I said “I have a boyfriend and you have a girlfriend that you’re about to see. Really?” he told me he was sorry and I told him no need to apologize, but maybe we should try to limit contact. He suggested we cut communication completely. I didn’t want that because he has been one of my closest friends for years and I couldn’t imagine not talking to him, but I reluctantly agreed. We didn’t talk at all for a few days, then one day he messaged me and apologized. He told me he still wanted me in his life and I told him that I did too. Things were normal for a bit, we still had our normal conversations until one day I noticed he blocked me. I texted him and asked what happened? He became quite aggressive and told me to “fuck off” and that I was hurting his girlfriend by talking to him. I couldn’t wrap my head around what was happening. 

I reached out to his best friends and they told me he’s been cutting off almost everyone. I also reached out to Tyler’s brother to see if he had talked to him, and he told me that Tyler has no job there, no ambition, and is living with his girlfriend in her parents house for free. I became fearful for Tyler because for someone who was always so happy, sweet, and kind, he was turning into a cold hearted, bitter, and aggressive person. My boyfriend messaged him and Tyler ignored it &amp;  blocked him. I left it alone and tried to accept the fact that I lost one of my good friends. It was a really tough time. From December-April, he would periodically unblock me &amp; message me. We would be friends for a bit, then he’d get aggressive and block me again. I had enough of his mental game, so I blocked him on everything and we had no contact up until middle of June 2020. His brother told me that Tyler was coming home for a few weeks to visit and that I should message him because he thought he’d appreciate it. I was excited but nervous, but I messaged him &amp; the way he replied back was as if he was back to his normal self and like nothing ever happened. He told me he’d love to hangout, but his girlfriend said he’s only allowed to see certain people, and I was not one of those people. We talked for an hour and he apologized to me for everything. I somewhat forgave him because I’ll never fully forgive him. I couldn’t believe how drastic the personality change was, I finally was talking to the Tyler I knew. I ran into him a few times out and about in public and we’d have a brief conversation. Everything was good up until yesterday night. 

Tyler and his friend took off yesterday morning to go back across the country. He blocked me again on everything but Snapchat, which I thought was weird because he had me blocked on there for months and now he suddenly unblocked me. But, before that, he texted me and said to never talk to him again. I’ll admit, I kind of lost it on him and called him out for his sudden personality change. He took a screen shot and said “lol pls fuck off already”, so I blocked his number. We haven’t had contact since. 

I do not understand what is going on. I’m so upset because for 7 years, he was the kindest person and such a great friend to me. He’s been through a lot of shit in life and he always told me that I was “his rock” and he owed it to me for helping him get through his hardships. He’d never hurt a fly, let alone tell someone special to him to “fuck off”. I personally think his girlfriend is behind this mess. She’s 4 years younger than us, hasn’t even graduated from high school yet, and is therefore more immature. Part of me also thinks it could be his trauma from childhood, but I really don’t know and I’m overwhelmed and upset. I want to hate him so much, but I can’t. I feel empathetic towards him even though I should feel rage and betrayal. I’m reaching out because I want a clear mind to offer their opinion/advice on the situation. I’m so lost and feel like I’m going crazy. Thank you in advance!",09Jul2020,1
230,"F/20, parents are F/51 and M/53.

I've just begun law school, and it's becoming increasingly clear to me that this is not where I belong. I was diagnosed with major depression and GAD two years ago, and both of them are making it increasingly difficult for me to study and do well. I have never thrived in high-stress environments, and I don't know what made me think that law school was a good idea in the first place, but here I am now and I hate it.  I like what I'm studying, I know I'm fairly smart, but the workload and the added stress of online learning is so hard and I don't think I can juggle it anymore. There hasn't been a single night where I haven't cried because I was struggling.

A week ago, I decided to just finish the term. I don't think my mental health can survive a full year of this. But I don't know how to tell my parents, who are both successful, well-connected lawyers, that I no longer want to pursue this career, or at least tell them that I'm not ready for it yet.  I attempted to broach the subject of how difficult it is to study law online to my mom, but she was adamant that I adjust because apparently I have no choice but to adjust. My mother really wants me to become a lawyer, and I love it when she tells me stories of how her own experience in law school went. I love the stories, but I don't think I'm as resilient as her. I don't think this is the right path for me.

I don't want my family to be disappointed in me, but I don't know how much more of this I can take. I would appreciate any advice on how to tackle this. I'm out of options.",09Jul2020,1

my(28m) ex and i broke up a few months ago and normally i would have been over them but quarantine and being fresh out of a relationship  were a shitty mix. i still think of him just not as much now but still comes to mind. 

i met some guy (27m) off hinge last week and honestly it’s been going great. however i’m noticing him opening up more while i’m pretty sheltered. he’s incredibly smart and has his undergrad in psychology so he understands that i’m protective over my info and is ok being patient and he’s admitted that he’s gain confidence in me and tells me some pretty deep stuff. 

yesterday we actually kissed and it was fucking amazing. after 5 hours hanging out together he went in right before i left to my car and it was perfect tbh. i’m into him for sure but defitnitely have my walls up. right after, on the drive home i couldn’t help but think of my ex. how o still miss him but know we can’t be anything and haven’t talked in months. i feel bad now because the other is showing feelings and i can’t reciprocate. 

i know i sound like an asshole and i don’t hate the fact that we kissed but i genuinely felt bad after wards on the drive home because i know this is leading him on. i just don’t think it’s fair for him to be into me and tell me things and i’m not doing the same plus still have some sort of tie over my ex. 

i don’t want to cut this guy off because i don’t want to feel like i’ll miss out on someone, he’s genuinely blowing me away. but i also don’t want to tell him how i’m feeling because he might just dip (he’s incredibly confident and has absolutely no problem dropping anyone relationship wise) he’s so upfront and honest. it’s amazing but fucking scary. 

i’m just stuck and don’t know what to do.. any advice would be appreciated

I just really miss having someone and being in love. When we were together I was so excited to do things with her like spend Christmas together, Thanksgiving,Valentines Day, cuddle under a blanket under the stars, surprise her for her birthday or anniversary and all that.

I miss having someone to love in that way, someone to cuddle, to kiss, be intimate with, someone to have who even if I'm having a shitty day, seeing them and hearing their voice immediately makes it better. Hugging someone that you love in that way is one of the best feelings ever, and I don't think I'm going to get that again for a very long time if EVER again.I do have friends, although they live in my old city.

Christians and people who are religions get this idea that gay people are pedophiles and murderers. that gay people shouldn't be allowed near kids. they speak so much bullshit without thinking.

when i was a kid i was being molested. i was being abused. the person who abused me was a heterosexual man. when i was a kid i was forced to go into conversion therapy without my mothers knowledge. the pastor in our church was sexually abusing kids. i wasn't the only person who was sexually abused as a kid. there were hundreds of other kids that was going through the same hell i was. no kid should have to be forced into sex with a adult. kids trust adults and that's what i did. i trusted people who were abusing me because at that time i didn't think anything of it. i trusted an adult to only be taken advantage of. i was being sexually abused when i was 5 years old to 16 years old. that's when i told someone and it stopped. the people who are doing the abusing are heterosexual men and some woman who stand behind the men and don't do anything to stop it. so stop saying gays are pedophiles because as a gay person i never done that to anther human soul and i never abused anyone. i was the one being abused. thats the reason why most LGBTQ have mental problems. because all of the suffering we went through as kids. 

so when people say gay people are pedophiles that makes me angry. when i watch the news and i see reports about woman being groped on the subways. who is doing the groping? heterosexuals. i see countless news story's of children being abused and murdered. those are done by heterosexuals. or the mother who burned down her house while her kids was sleeping and killed them. you will never see a gay person doing that. i could go on all day and write all day. i wish people would think before they talk and look at logic. 

if god does exist and has a problem with my lifestyle then let him deal with it. you are not god to be going around telling people what you think is right and wrong. no one needs your prayers either. keep all that to yourself. when it comes to god im 50/50. i wanna believe he exist but then i see so many bad people in this world that gets away with doing bad things to others. at the end of the day we dont know if god exist. we don't know whats beyond the grave. so people should stop using religion to justify their hatred towards others. stop saying gays are pedophiles because we are not.",09Jul2020,1

She was also into that abdl studf (if you dunno what that is it’s literally a fetish for who like to shit themselves in diapers and pretend to be a baby) She’d unironically speak in “cutesy uwu” language.

She was much different a year prior to all of this: She was into guns, and picked on me and my friend a lot.

I wouldn’t be surprised if he figured out how much of an ass she was. But ever since that incident I never saw her again. She said she was moving schools, and her discord is the only form of contact that I knew she had, so she just disappeared never to be seen again.

Not only that, my parents had built them an apartment in my basement.. for these kids to live together. She’s extremely rude and does not speak to my family members except for my brother. She takes over the entire house. 

This is especially unbelievable because I grew up with VERY strict parents, I could not leave the house or hang out with friends outside of school until I was 18 years old. Even now, i am not allowed to do much. Although I am the older sister (and the only one with a college/ master’s degree, steady job, and long time relationship), my parents still impose strict rules on me and I am confined to my tiny childhood bedroom. However, this young girl is allowed to do and have whatever she wants here- including a brand new apartment in my house in which she invites her little friends over. My brother is a drop out and she refuses to work. He fully supports this girl with his little job. Meanwhile, my 24 year old boyfriend of 4 years is to this day, not allowed to stay at my house too late. 

I am extremely uncomfortable in my house. I have developed major anxiety and now depression ever since this girl moved into my house.

Long story short, a month ago I (30m) made a friend (21m, let's call him Ray) thru the subreddit r/MakeNewFriendsHere. We talk almost everyday cause we share a lot of interests together and have some common experiences and perspectives in life despite the age gap and cultural difference. I live in Italy and he's from the state of Indiana, USA. We talked about almost everything; family and relationships, our pasts and future plans in life. Currently Ray lives with his abusive mother with whom he helps pay rent and bills with just about all of his income from a low-paying overtime-demanding job in a famous food store industry. I say 'abusive' cause as he have told me, even though he pays almost everything to maintain their rented apartment, he is tasked to take care and do everything in the house as well as to provide and cook food for the both of them, all in his few hours of free time after long hours of work. Due to this he also doesn't have much of a social life, he is not allowed to invite anyone over at home and not to stay outdoors without being constantly questioned thru phone calls where he is. Ray told me he was diagnosed with Asperger's when he was a kid which made social interactions during his childhood, school and teen years extremely difficult for him, reason why most of his close friendships were entirely online. This didn't hinder him though to get a girlfriend in the past but unfortunately their relationship didn't end well. His parents divorced when he was a kid, his father was almost not present in his life aside being obligated to spend time together for few hours a month and to pay for child support which Ray's mother exploited; though after an incident of Ray confiding his father he was being mistreated and underfed by his mother, she was fined and sentenced by court to pay back damages to his father. This might have been the start of his abusive relationship with his mother.

These past days, Ray told me he's very exhausted and depressed about his current life situation and desperately wants to go back studying to pursue a better career in life, but if not possible at least to save enough money (which may take years cause of his current financial status) to live by his own. He is trying to convince his only trusted friends to share a room or house together just to be able to be independent and get his own freedom but unfortunately without success. He therefore mentioned to his mother his desire to study again and eventually contribute less in their household to be able to focus on this but he was threatened to be evicted if he does this. Sadly as a distant online friend I am powerless to help him and all I could do is to listen to his frustrations; even if I want to help him financially, we agreed that our friendship is and will not be based on financial favors. Since he has no contact with his father anymore and his grandparents are refusing to help him, I want to know what can I advise him doing and where can he reach out to... I meant any non-profit organization or religious or non-religious group in the state of Indiana, in particular in Indianapolis, before he really gives up mentally with all his daily arguments with her and his feeling of hopelessness regarding his current situation.

I feel compelled to write this and ask for any advice or possible help since the last time we talked tonight Ray told me he had another intense argument with his mother about his plan of going back to study while maintaining his job and when I tried to talk to him about this, after he told me how he hated his life and current situation, he never answered my messages back. I am getting worried. Thanks for reading.",09Jul2020,1
252,"So my Ex-friend was friend then first said that our accounts were similar because I was doing something in the study community of Instagram and blocked me on that account. Due to stress I deleted the account and I wanted to start fresh. I had already apologized and said that there was a possibility of me using her work to inspire me but that really wasn’t the case I just didn’t want to hurt her feelings. 1-2 weeks later I create a new account and complete ignore her excistence. Now I had one spam account to see if she was posting something about me because her group of friends is know to talk behind people’s back... to preface this her friends weren’t friends with me. Then a 2-3 weeks she finally makes something public about me with saying my name but directing it at me. Now I over panic because my parents always taught me unfortunately to just apologize even if your not in the wrong. I apologize on the spam account but after taking with a friend I unsent it. Then in her account she unblocks me said that it is clear that I’m “copying” her. So I can admit are stories look similar because of the filter I use but other wise no. Or she would say my highlights were copies of her because I had a section for all of my stories that I thought were aesthetic and a section for all my supplies. Then she try’s to make me feel guilty and that as a creator she just wants a tag and credit. So me being the bigger person and pushing away my need to start drama I tag her in all my post and those 2 highlights. However only to find out afterwards she and I quotes says “I don’t mind your post as much” as though she started this over what. What I didn’t realize was that she taking trash about me to her friends mind you have enough following to just destroy me even if I was right. I can’t even make friends with creators I like because they just believe what she said. Honestly I wish I had screenshots of my 1st and 2nd apology to share. I only have the conversation on my new account if you would like to see those just ask I will blur her pick and username though. I just am clearly clinging on I think to this but it doesn’t sit right with me that all her friends all the popular ones and by now they have already told everyone how terrible I am. I know this is only high school and that this will eventually not matter. It’s just after reading the message again it clearly sounds like she is manipulating me and the situation to make me comply with her. My friend tells me to just get over it and that if they believe her over you then I shouldn’t want to be friends with them which I agree but it leaves a pit in my stomach. Knowing that I let her deframe my character on something that wasn’t true. Do you guys have any advice on getting over it or if I should do something?

253,"So here’s the deal: I (F22) have ears that stick out pretty far, nothing too unsightly but they’re definitely noticeable. I never got bullied about them as a kid so I never knew there was a problem with them until I got to middle school and started caring about my looks. I tried to hide them for a few years to no avail but made a breakthrough my sophomore year of high school when I confided in my childhood pediatrician and family friend, asking if there was anything I could do to fix them. She told me that a good friend of hers has the same problem and took to applying small amounts of superglue to the back of her ear and pinning it to her head, reapplying every few days. 

I had finally done it, I had found a temporary solution: Applying superglue (which is not contact toxic) to pin the top of my ears to my head while being careful not to get it in my hair. I’ve been doing this for about 7 years and the only person I’ve told is my best friend (it took 2 years of friendship before I told her). I just feel so comfortable and confident with my ears pinned back. I physically can’t bring myself to go out if they’re not back or unless I have a bandana/hat on. I don’t even feel like myself when they are out so I’m not really looking for advice on how to feel comfortable with my ears. They’re not coming out. 

So here’s where the problem lies, up until this point I’ve never had a serious relationship (I didn’t really like the idea of being in one until recently). I guess I’m kind of just asking what you guys and gals would think if a partner were to whip her ears out after dating for a little while essentially saying “hey so by the way my ears stick out really far but don’t worry I superglue them to my head so nobody knows and I didn’t feel comfortable telling you until x months/years into our relationship. Hope that’s okay xoxo”. Like what would you think??? How would you react? Is it a big deal? I know it’s technically a lie of omission but I don’t feel comfortable telling anyone until I trust them completely.",09Jul2020,1
254,"Obligatory on mobile so sorry for formatting. Also this involves child abuse, so I understand if you don't read passed this

So let me explain why I'm not sure how to feel. My father was abusive towards my mother and I, mostly he was emotionally abusive, there are 2 times in my memory where he became physical and I'm also mildly autistic. My earliest memory of him is him screaming at me about how he never wanted a son and how I'm a ""worthless little shit."" The next thing I remember, years later, is him pushing my mom into a filing cabinet at the office of the carpentry company they used to own. After that, about 3 years later we went to Kennedy Space Center, all I remember of that trip is him choking me out, letting go right before I blacked out. A little after this he and my mother separated, and he moved to another house in our neighborhood and recently moved a half hour away when someone bought the house he was renting. I repressed these memories as best I could, so they were in the background, so when I was about 16 I started working with him after they closed down the original company and severely downsized such that he was the only employee at the time, he never taught me a single thing about the trade but even so he was quick to berate me for the smallest of mistakes. After almost a year I stopped helping him for a year, I forgot the little I learned during this year, and again the berating started when I didn't know where all the tools were after he got a new bag and reorganized everything. After this I told him I never wanted to see or hear from him again, for a few months I didn't after he told me I had to pay him for helping with my Eagle Project that I never asked for him to have a hand in, then my mom convinced me to talk to him and so far that's about it so far. Honestly I don't want to see him again, I don't love him and have no good memories of him. What I'm asking here is how should I feel? And how do I deal with this? I mean I don't want him dead but I don't think I'd be sad if he did die, just the opposite I think I'd be happy.",09Jul2020,1

256,"Currently I am in college, but at the time of this relationship I was in high school. This happened over the course of several years, but the relationship ended when I graduated, so I gave the ages for last year of the friendship in the title. I met this ""friend"" first in a scholarship program that I as well as my best friend were in back in middle school years. However, we only really got to know him when we were sophomores and he joined our high school as a freshman. Although my friend group was virtually all girls, he assimilated into our group quickly and starting hanging out with us all the time. Everything was normal until the following year, when I felt like he was giving me selective attention above the other girls in the friend group. He wanted me to always walk him everywhere. Sometimes it was to classes (despite us not going to the same classes ever) or sometimes it was to something he didn't need accompanying for, like going to the Lost and Found Box. He always hung out with me during all my free periods and all my lunches. Furthermore, he accompanied me everywhere without my solicitation. He even accompanied me to trips to the girl's bathroom (not actually going inside the bathroom but walking me to there although I assured him he didn't have to).  My friends and I usually hung out in this large abandoned room with tons of rows of ""pews."" Despite the quantity of pews, he always joined me in my pew, sitting so close to me that there was essentially an inch of space between us. I just felt so boxed in around him. Every time he was walking with me, he was literally walking on my toes. I remember joking a couple times about how he can't walk straight but right into me, and he didn't even deny it. On top of all of this, he was a bit touchy-feely (admittedly though, I'm quite sensitive to people touching me). I had a split-second thought that he liked me as more that a friend, but I just felt like I saw enough signs to make me believe he was gay (after I went to college though he apparently got a girlfriend, so I guess that was untrue). I also excused the way he acted with me because I thought he saw me as an older sister. Given the age difference and given the fact that we had known each other before high school, I thought that might be a reasonable way to act. Because of these explanations, most days I could handle how close he was to me at all times. However, one day I think it started to boil over for me. I felt like the only way I ever got privacy was when I was in the girl's bathroom and thinking about that caused me to impulsively confronted him. My other girlfriends were present and what I said to him was, ""Ya know, I think you are a 'dependent' kind of person."" He looked so hurt by this and my other friends were confused because they never experienced that with him. I immediately felt bad and told him that it wasn't necessarily a bad personality trait, but eventually I apologized entirely. I've been so torn about the level of normalcy of this relationship with him which I only ever wanted to be platonic. All of my girlfriends denied him ever seeming clingy and thought I was overthinking things, **so** **I'm wondering if you all would agree with that? Were any of these signs about him alarming or am I really being too sensitive about all of this?**

&amp;#x200B;

**TL;DR:**  I've been rethinking a 'friendship' with a guy who was one year younger than me in high school. I felt that he was constantly invading my space, but there's also a chance that I'm overthinking how he was acting. I excused his need to be with me always more than our other friends because I figured he saw me as a big sister. I never thought it was because he had a crush on me because I thought he was gay (and I also only saw him platonically).",09Jul2020,1

258,"So some backstory:

I met her when we were both 16 in high school and we instantly clicked. It was like we were meant to be best friends, and I've never met anyone who went through or understood the same situations I felt. But obviously there were problems, she was super social and she had many best friends. Of course I was open to meeting all of them and hoping to become best friends with them also. Although, she became friends with a girl named (lets say, Mary). Mary used to be on my volleyball team and after I got spiked in the face I felt humiliated and she made a comment about my shirt. I just felt a little attacked by her. Anyway, they became closer and I felt like I was being pushed out of the way, then my bsf, (lets say Poppy), said basically, ""You don't have to act like she killed your dog"" and ""if you're insecure, thats your problem"" and I felt so bad i wrote this paragraph about how great she is blah blah blah I regret it now. I told her about what Mary said to me and she didn't trust what I said since she talked to Mary and Mary said she didn't say that. Now for a couple months I backed away from her because I just didn't want to be friends with someone who has so many ""best friends"" because it's just difficult. A year later I still felt the same way while she moved in to my house, (her parents kicked her out, and of course out of the goodness of my heart I asked my parents if she could stay with us for a month until she finds a place to stay) and then you'd expect us to feel a lot closer right? WRONG. It ended up her sleeping at her boyfriend's house almost every night and her inviting her friends in my house and not inviting me to hang out with them. At the time I was struggling with the new distance learning for school and I didn't have the energy to do fun things. When she moved out, she didn't say a word to me. Haven't talked since. Now she works with me and everytime I see her it feels weird.

The question: why don't you just talk to her?

I don't want to talk to her because before I met her, I thought I needed someone that connects with me to be happy. Now I don't need her for that anymore. Plus, it just feels one-sided.

I feel like I should talk to her because tbh I haven't tried to communicate with her and her priv stories make me worrisome. I felt like I left her all alone even though we had such close moments together.

This is all still confusing to me and trying to sort this all out confused me even more lol.

261,"Tl;dr at the end

This is weird af but I don't care. It's not like I can trust my doctor to address my concerns and if I can't trust the doctor then how will I be able to trust my mom who I'm pretty sure won't get it, so here I am talking to internet strangers. Yay me. But seriously I need answers so enough seasoning. Time to get into the meat.

So basically I started doing workouts I found on YouTube right? I have a schedule for this. I focus on my abs one day, my arms the next, etc etc. Today I was working on my legs right? And then I realized that while it was kinda working on my legs, this also meant that my butt was gonna get bigger too. Most girls would see this as a good thing. Not me though. I'm scared of working my legs out so much I get a butt much bigger than I'm comfortable with in the process. 

I know some flat girls are pretty insecure about that partichlar aspect. And I understand. I also know that there are plenty of guys who actually prefer flat girls to thicc ones. But here's what I don't see: other girls who are like me. Like same weird issues I mean.

Oh for context I'd say that my ass is pretty average for someone my age and body type. I like it how it is. Kinda thicc, but I can live with that. 

But here's where the advice comes in: Is there something wrong with me if I don't want a bigger ass? Is it weird that I absolutely despise it when people say I'm thicc and stuff? (Ok fine I kinda like it depending on who it is, but I HATE it SO much more.)  This sounds so much like medical advice, but I'm not looking for that tbh. I can take care of that myself or I can go to r/AskDocs. I'm only looking for reassurance that I'm not alone ans that there are other girls with the same problems as me.

Tl;dr: I don't want a bigger ass, I find it weird when people call me thicc, I need to know I'm not the only one.

Problem is there is a distinct lack of women to meet in the fishing community, especially around my age.

268," 

I just want say thanks ahead of time to anyone who responds to my post! Thanks for offering whatever advice or insight you have, it means a lot.

I will start with a little of my background ... I have been in two relationships before and in both there were many lies, possible cheats, ex-girlfriends and ex-friends with benefits from the both of my exbf, therefore in my last relationship I became controlling, insecure, had and reviewed all his social media and the cell phone, since I thought that no one else could love me again.

After much thought and seeing how miserable I felt in that relationship, I ended up and that was a year ago.

However, three months after that relationship ended, I started dating a man who is in my classroom, at first I did not expect anything serious, but I really liked it, it was totally different from my two previous relationships, patient, loving , honest and understood me because we studied the same.

But I ... I was still insecure, even though a few months later we formalized our relationship, I saw his ex-girlfriend (the only one he has had) fitness girl, good job, pretty ... I have always been chubby, I do not consider myself ugly but... you know, not like her... I have never been to a gym but I had exercised at home or in parks and well ... my insecurities started there.

He told me to please tell him when I felt like this, and at first it gave me a lot of trouble because I was not used to talking about my insecurities with anyone (in my previous relationship, they got angry with me) when telling him I felt a great relief, because He supported me and told me that he loved only me and reassurance.

Afterwards, since I felt completely in love with him, the insecurity of losing him, of cheating on me, of lying to me or hiding things from me began ... and I told him about it, as in my previous relationships it happened, and I told him that I was also scared that when I told my feelings, he one day could be afraid to do something that could make me feel bad and that he could lie to me or hide something from me because of that fear, however he stated that it would not happen ...

Little by little, my insecurities decreased, thanks to the fact that he always supported me and listened to me, although I was very sorry and embarrassed to repeat the same topics, he told me that I shouldn't feel that way and he was happy to help me.

But not all is perfect

The first situation ... they are somewhat childish, perhaps you may think so.

I published a chain once on WhatsApp, he answered me and I told him that he also had to publish it and as it was kind of funny, ""Mom, you're going to be a grandmother"" and I just wanted to see what his mom could say to him, but from the beginning he denied to post it and I told him that he was a bitter in a little angry way ... soon he tells me that he published it, but I do not know, my intuition told me that something was strange, and I said ""It is not worth it if you just published it for me and blocked the others ""which he denied, but in the end, I was correct ... He blocked others except me, I realized that and he did not, because he did not know how to use WhatsApp Stories ...

I felt betrayed, when it was such a silly, irrelevant thing ... a whatsapp storie? It was easier for him to tell me in a serious way that he didn't want to and thats all ... but he did not to not ""make me angry"", but it went wrong and only made me distrust him, in the end I forgave him because it was something very silly.

But yesterday, well ... the only account of him that I have, its the xbox one, since we both play and share our accounts, and well, I entered two days ago and saw his messages and saw that he had a chat with a girl friend of his ( I do not know her in person, but I know that they have been friends for a long time) and the literal messages said: SHE: JEJE HE: JIJI. THAT'S IT.

I saw it and I just said, oh how strange and IT'S ALL I didn't think anything ... I know that she is his friend.

Yesterday I went back inside and ... he had deleted it.

I marked him and asked him why he did that? He told me that he was afraid that I would see it and feel insecure, that I would get angry or think badly of him. I explained that I had already seen it and did not find anything wrong, however I was already angry and sad because it is something so simple and without anything wrong and he deleted it, for something like that?

He always tells me that with all confidence that I can check his phone if I want (I avoid doing it, i dont want to be like i was before, but i have done it in total a 10 times in our entire relationship of 8 months, never got angry about anything on his phone, so idk), and I said yesterday: How am I going to have the confidence to check your phone if I don't know if you don't erase something? If you deleted something so simple.

He spent his time apologizing the entire call, swearing he didn't do it maliciously and just wanted to avoid unnecessary insecurities in me ... and that he even feels guilty sometimes talking to other people (girls) even if he's not doing anything wrong ...

I felt very bad, because I caused this by telling him about my insecurities, I felt like a nuisance, rubbish for not being able to do anything right ... I told him that then I would not tell him any more when I feel sad, and he asked me not to did, that he wants to help me, but how? If he is afraid that I may feel insecure about seeing talks with his friends, how can I tell him? I forvage him at the end, but now I feel insecure again about what happened and i'm afraid of telling him that i feel this way, cuz i don't want to cause more trouble than i had...

I can't afford a therapist now, but I do my best to read on the internet, download CBT applications, try to do something I can until I have the means, but I feel that nothing works for me and I'm just ruining something with someone who just have given me his support, what can i do? please",09Jul2020,1

275,"**BACKGROUND:** Due to COVID, many of my coworkers left and a new batch had to be hired, one of them was a girl (H) whose friends w/ my crush (R). One day I walked into the back and announced my crush to a friend (D), H overheard and asked who. I said, ""oh, it's R!"" Anyway, long story short, H and R are best friends and he recommended her for the job. She promised she wouldn't say anything to him. 

**NOW:** Around 2 weeks ago, I met this guy at work and we hit it off and started talking as often as we could with one another during our shifts. I work in retail so we're put in specific zones and told to stay there until the end of our shift. During my last shift, because it wasn't so busy, I inched myself towards his zone so I could talk to him more, it got boring in the front so I went to the back to join my friend where he later showed up as well. We all wasted time in the back until I was called back onto the actual floor. While we were in the back, he was talking to D and brought up his ex-gf saying how he dated her for 2 years and she asked if he was ever in love with her, to which he replied, ""how would I know, I was just a kid then."" He then noticeably glanced over to me. Nonetheless, I kind of took this as  a direct rejection to my advances because personally I wouldn't talk about an ex in front of someone I'm interested in. I want to mention as well, while we were in the back, he asked for my IG. Anyway, I was a little sad as I went back out onto the floor nonetheless, took it as a swift rejection and got over it in about a solid 5 seconds. I later went to the back where D was (after R had left) and said ""y'know what! I'm over him, I guess it wasn't meant to be!"" to which she explained that in the 3 milliseconds I was gone, R spilled a fuckload of his feelings. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-&gt; **BASICALLY**, she told me that, *H told him that I like him.* He confirmed with D whether this was true, which she confirmed. He said he likes me as well. Nonetheless, he then supposedly said, he wouldn't date me, despite him liking him, because I'm a year older than him. 

**The issue for me:** He has BEEN flirting with me for the past 2 weeks, he asked for my IG, his friend adamantly states he isn't a fuckboy, he himself seems interested, so, is he just stringing me along for fun? I don't want to get hurt so I'm thinking of just giving away all my shifts alongside him and simply avoiding him. I don't want to be hurt and also don't want to make him uncomfortable. The idea of rejection doesn't hurt but I don't understand his intentions.

&amp;#x200B;

*&gt;&gt;&gt; sorry i know this reads like a shitty ass teen drama filler episode but i don't have anyone to ask irl*

279,"I didn't know exactly how to title this. 

A couple weeks ago, I walked to the mailboxes around midnight. I got there no problem and started walking back toward my building. I then see headlights coming up behind me. (I was walking against traffic and on the grass.) The car was going extremely slow. At first, I assumed they were being extra careful because maybe I startled them, since I was wearing all black clothes. But they sloooowly drove past and my nerves were on high alert all of a sudden. I watched as the car pulled into the very next drive on the right and then make a U-turn. The car was now driving by me again slowly as I walked by. He had the passenger window rolled down and he said something. I wasn't right next to his car, maybe about 15 feet away, so I didn't know what he said. Then he said it a little louder, ""need a ride?"" I just looked at him, trying to be calm and said, ""no, thanks!"" And walked away. But there was something so off about the whole sequence of events that as I walked toward my building, I called my friend and then I acted like I lived in the building across from me, so started walking toward it. I wait about a minute, then start walking to my actual building right across the parking lot, all the while on the phone and making no sense to my friend. I then look behind toward the main drive and the car was backing up and starting to turn into my drive from the main drive! I booked it and ran inside, up the stairs and into my apartment as fast as I could so they couldn't see where I lived.

Fast forward to last night. I again walked to the mailbox and on my way home, what looked like the same car (color and model) drove by and did the same thing with the U-turn as before! I didn't hesitate and immediately, casually, crossed the main drive so they wouldn't be right next to me. The car proceeded to drive SLOOOWLY away. I just powerwalked home before the car had time to turn around. 

Anyway, I guess I'm just wondering what I should do. Nobody ACTUALLY did anything illegal and I can't absolutely say for certain it was indeed the same car/person. But the coincidence is creeping me out. 

Should I say something to the office? But what if I just sound crazy? At the very least, the office could tell the security person who patrols once in awhile about looking out for a vehicle, right? 

All I know is my nerves each time were just screaming at me to get away, but also ""remain calm so they don't see me being scared.""",09Jul2020,1

My mom travelled to the US with her mom, so we have all been really close. Her family however is very toxic, judgemental, kinda racists and whatnot. My friend grew up here so she is not as much so. But she was still raised in that household, so she picked up some not so great habits. Growing up, her mom would ALWAYS praise her, put others down, compare her to me, compare her to other kids, called her prettier and smarter than everyone else all while she would judge other people, call other people ugly and dumb, etc. Sometimes she would even drag me into it. And all my life i never really let it get to me, idk why. In our friendship, she would always be the prettier one, the smarter one, the better one according to her mom. tbh the daughter/my friend has thought this way as well. there’s been many instances where she didn’t even hide her opinion of me, it was obvious that she thought i wasnt smart or pretty. And i never really cared. But now, i’m 19... and i care now! I’m really stressed because in my eyes, all i believe now is that yeah. She IS the prettier one tbh. she IS the smarter one tbh. and she’s planning on attending medical school and all that and become a doctor so she’ll probably make shitload of money while i’m an artist in college and will probably struggle. don’t get me wrong, my friend is a good friend. she is there for me. but she has been quite toxic to me in the past and her ego is big. i wish i didn’t care about her and her life but i can just picture the future. she will be rich and successful and i’ll be poor and unhappy. and before you say it, yes i need a therapist. it’s not very accessible to me at the moment. i just need some kind words, words of advice, words of wisdom, SOMETHING from someone out there. i’m feeling stuck and sad about this situation that i probably can’t escape from.",09Jul2020,1

286,"In light of the outbreak of Covid-19 and lockdown economic restrictions the company I work for has instituted actions to “ensure the operational survival of the company”. For the past three months we have received pay for hours we’ve worked and claimed the rest from government subsidies. This made the shortfall of our salary minimal (single digits). The first of this month that we can no longer get the subsidy, this means we will only be payed for the hours we have worked and pay out our leave days. Best of all the letter stated “please spend wisely your salaries paid on the 25th”.

For context I work with eight other people who rely on their salaries and as such when we were offered to either continue working as in two shifts and short time or be back to full time most chose the latter. I am lucky enough to still live with my parents and work because I like earning my own money. The strain put on physical, emotional and mental health is now something unexpected. I am at risk for Covid-19 and so is one of my parents and the other works in a position that is damning if they contract it.

He has been our baby ever since. Recently, my boyfriend decided to end things and I am now forced to move back home to my parents for the foreseeable future. I can’t bear the thought of just leaving my cat behind and never seeing him again but I also am terrified of bringing him with me and terrifying him to the point that he can never get accustomed. He’s extremely shy and hates change. I would be taking him out of the only home he’s ever known to one with multiple people he doesn’t know and a totally new environment. On top of that, either way he will be losing someone he is very attached to. He is my first pet I’ve ever had so I am very close with him and I don’t want to bring him here and him be miserable just because I couldn’t let go. I just want what’s best for him even if it hurts me. Should i bring him along or let him stay where he is?

I know I can talk to girls fine, I've done it a lot before with success but the parts where I massively lack confidence are starting conversations, asking them out and my looks. It's really hard for me to try and start conversations with girls because I'm afraid of getting left on opened and being seen as weird. I have sometimes successfully started conversations but generally especially recently this has been a problem. Asking girls out and getting intimate with them is also a little bit of a struggle because again I don't wanna be seen as weird or rejected.

293,"I (27 M) was caught recently with some friends on a roof by security and I am unsure what to do going forward. I was born and raised in the States but in 2015 I moved (for reasons not relevant) to Istanbul.  Lucky for me I found this wonderful apartment community with around 1500 people (mostly families) gated-in with the best amenities imaginable for about 300 USD a month.  When I say this place is off the hook, I really mean it, and the people are terrific too (but they tend to gossip quite a bit).  Initially I was a school teacher just down the road, and for the first two years I enjoyed a huge amount of positive attention from the people around me.  I didn't actively seek this out mind you, however, when people are interested in you its easy to enjoy it, and return the interest in them.  However, in the last two years my Turkish has not developed as planned (I can fend for myself but sometimes complex conversation is out of the question on bad days), and they have become used to me and my antics, my antics being drinking sometimes more than they would consider appropriate and speaking a bit too loud.  Now prior to this ""roof event"" I was on good terms with almost everyone (I am certain most if not all of the 1500 people know me as I am the only foreigner here), however, years and gossip about my drinking and lack of Turkish skills somewhat tarnished my reputation.  So about a week ago, three of my pals and myself are hanging out.  Were sipping chilled wine, some Tequila, etc, when one of them who also lives here gets the idea to go up to the roof.  Now I knew this could go badly, and being as high profile as I am I knew this could be even more of a problem for me but I didn't want to look like a baby so we all made our way to the roof of his building.  Now in retrospect we should not have gone on top of that this particular building because it was one of the lowest, which allowed others in other buildings to see us.  After about 25 minutes we began to hear sounds below us, and we all dipped down the around one side and stayed quiet.  Despite our best efforts a flashlight came around the corner and, BAM we were caught.  That moment was very shameful for all of us, but for me especially, as I was immediately recognized by the security.  After this I told the guards if they could try to keep it quiet I would appreciate it, they said they would but they had to report it to management. Next day I get a call from my ""Turkish Mom"" who handles most of my legal and financial problems here, and she was pissed.  They called her and she apologized for me and told them it wouldn't happen again.  On top of that some people had taken photos and posted them on the community FB page.  Now mind you it was dark (about thirty minutes past midnight) so you cant determine who was on the roof and most concluded it was teens.  I laid low for about 4 days but then my girlfriend came and I needed to go get some food.  I was nervous leaving the gate and as I did I saw one of my security buddies.  He told me what happened was Barney Stintson grade: ""legendary"" but basically the news was spreading.  This made me feel better but also I was disheartened that the news was spreading, however, this was no surprise.  Emboldened by his positive feedback I continued on and later that night I had another friend over and we went to the garden.  After a bit I had to go to the bathroom, and on my way I passed a table with some older people I knew.  Unknown to me at the time one among them was a member of the management and he was not very happy with me at all.  As I said my hellos to the table the first thing he asked me point blank was ""So how about that roof business,"" and I could tell by he demeanor he was fuming and making inconsistent eye-contact with me.  I tried to play it off a bit, but he was not having it. So I sat down and spoke more quietly with him.  He said the complaints were numerous, from a safety perspective it was dangerous (it really wasn't), and that this could (more like ""would"") certainly erase the past good I had done within the community.  Foolishly I suggested the only reason this is getting so much attention is because I am a foreigner, I wasn't even that drunk, and it wasn't even my idea (my friend who brought me there was moving out of the community next week so that was the real reason we went).  All he said about this was he hoped nobody would bring it up in the next meeting.  So as you can see I am on thin ice. Now I don't think I will get kick out or anything that serious (it could happen) but if I could I would like to recover some of my lost rep.  So this is my question: should I write a brief letter to the management expressing how sorry I am for violating their trust, and causing a disturbance in the community?  The reason I would do this is because the management is made up of elected members of the smartest, and most respected members of the community.  They are almost all men, and I feel like they have been dubious of me from the beginning, meaning I don't think they would have any problem letting me burn for this one.  My only reservation with sending the letter is that if I acknowledge what I did as wrong (which I do think it was, not seriously wrong, but wrong all the same) they could take my admission as weakness and run with that even farther making the situation even worse. On the other hand it could show that I am not just some loose-cannon here to suck up the benefits and ruin their happy homogeneous community.  I truly am sorry it happened, and I can't put the genie back in the bottle, but if I could use this letter to soften the blow, and perhaps if properly written I would circulate and win me back some good-will within the population it would be help in the long run. But maybe I should just leave it be, lay low for about a month, and hopefully it will pass me by the best it can.  I really hope there are no reddit readers from the community, otherwise I fear I have made the problem worse.  Anyhow, any advice on how I could repair my damaged rep.. I'm 27 for God-sakes, I shouldnt be climbing any damn roofs, but I've got myself into this predicament, and hopefully I can mitigate some of the damage",09Jul2020,1

I’ve had some trouble getting rid of hidden resentment for a few of my friends. It’s a long story but there was a period of time many years ago where they said some hurtful things about me, but never knew that I found out about it. I never addressed that issue, so I don’t think it’s fair to dwell. They have fully grown in the years since then and I truly don’t believe they’d ever say things like that about me again. But still, every once in a while I can’t help but get paranoid and even jealous about certain things.

As of most recent, one of these friends, is beginning to do work in the field that I’ve always voiced my passion for. She is a VERY big overachiever and she is also my closest friend. She is a really great person, but I think she is aware of how much she overshadows me, and I think sometimes she really enjoys it. We’ve grown up together, went to college and shared an apartment together. I really wanted my job and my passion to just be my own thing that I try to navigate for myself. I can’t help but feel like she intrudes on a lot of things that I want, only to try and do them better than me.

I know she has a good heart but part of me really wonders why she has to do these things. It genuinely feels like she sees something I like and decides to be more vocal about it, so that people think she’s the one who’s really into it.

I feel so childish saying these things. I’m too old for all this lmao. In truth I can’t tell if I’m being insecure or shes genuinely like this, but either way it’s been bothering me for years.

You said you wanted to be like shrek!"" and now I feel really humilliated and sad because my own mother thinks i'm genuenly ugly (i know I am but she made it clear that the features i'm insecure about are also the ones that make people think i'm ugly) and well now i am just sitting in my bed crying silently. to be honest i don't know what kind of advice i'm expecting. maybe i just needed to type it out to feel better? i don't know but if you guys know how to stop feeling ugly and have suggestions of activities that i can do instead of being on my phone for 7 hours straight that would be awesome.

302,"My girlfriend and I are in a long distance relationship and haven't been able to see each other since February because of the pandemic. We both really miss each other and want to see each other more than anything. I'm currently living with house mates in a house we all rented for the school year. I'm moving back to my parent's home when my lease ends in August. The thing is, if I don't see my girlfriend before my lease ends, I will not be able to see her until sometime next year when she gets her own place. 

Here's the thing: my girlfriend has Type 1 diabetes  and asthma. My biggest priority is my girlfriend's and health and safety. A few weeks ago we decided that I would get tested for covid-19 just in case, and if I was negative then she would come to my place. We both thought this was good enough precaution and agreed to it. I had the test done and we were awaiting results. I just got back my results and I am negative, so that's good, but while I was waiting I took a second to slow down and really think about my living situation, and now I'm not sure it's the best idea. 

I have my own room, but I live with 4 other people. They all recognize the risk of the pandemic and have been taking precautions for the most part, but that still has not stopped them from having friends and significant others over and traveling back and forth between their parent's house and our house every few weeks. During the time that I announced my girlfriend would be potentially coming, I overheard one of my housemates discussing the circumstances around her boyfriend coming as well. Another one of my housemates who generally stays at her parent's house with her boyfriend, messaged me after my announcement saying that she was excited to have us all have out together when she comes down with her boyfriend. These two things made me realize that I don't want here interacting with any of these people at the risk of her health. I don't know what my housemates do when they walk out of the house and I much less know what their significant others are doing. All of this makes me really weary of having my girlfriend over because I have realized we would have little control over who she comes into contact with. I've talked to her about the risk, and she doesn't seem to be too concerned about it and thinks that we'll be fine, but I really can't let go of the possibility of something bad happening. Am I thinking about this too much? Is she right in not worrying about it too much?",09Jul2020,1
303,"I’m currently a sophomore college student (19 years old) going for a business (general management) degree. But I really don’t know if college is for me because I’ve always wanted to start my own restaurant business (as a chef). My dream has always been to start my own asian fusion restaurant and create my own menu (I have lots of ideas in my mind that I’m willing to experiment with). I’ve been cooking for 3-4 years and I know I’m not the best home cook (but people tell me my cooking is super tasty) and I’m willing to learn as much as I can, as early as possible. Even if that means going to culinary school. 

My entire family is telling me I should finish college first but I really don’t know if I can endure 2-3 more years of college because I’m pretty much academically challenged. I suck and pretty much get B’s and C’s in all my classes. I’m also afraid to drop out because I currently receive financial aide and afraid I have to repay everything because I couldn’t finish school.

305,"i currently work at a local business (restaurant). it’s pretty informal—i got hired w/o resume or interview, never received official training, and the boss pays me with straight up cash and doesn’t even bother to put it in an envelope or anything lol. i started working here about 3 weeks ago because i wanted to help my parents out with the bills. at the time, the coronavirus cases in my area were really low and i felt safe working because there weren’t many customers in that store anyways. however, the cases in my area suddenly skyrocketed and we’ve been having triple/quadruple the amount of new cases in a day than before. many people around me also have been contracting the virus and falling very ill. my parents are fairly old and weak so i am extremely worried about contracting the virus and passing it onto them. that being said, i am thinking of quitting my part time job but i’m not sure how. i know it is professional to give a 2-weeks notice through letter but i fear for my parent’s health so i don’t feel exactly comfortable working for another two weeks. i also feel really bad because i haven’t been working here for long. i talked to old employees and they told me they just gave a verbal two weeks notice. in this scenario, is it completely inappropriate to not give a 2-weeks? i am willing to finish up this week’s amount of work but idk about any longer. this is my first job so i’m not sure how this process works. any advice is appreciated thank you!!

TLDR: planning on quitting a part time job bc covid cases have been skyrocketing. my parents are high-risk so i want to quit my job just to be safe and not pass anything into them. i know that i should usually give a 2-weeks notice but i don’t know if i feel comfortable working for another 2 weeks in the current state of my city. how should i approach this situation? should i suck it up and brave through the 2 weeks or explain to them my current circumstance and hope for the best?",09Jul2020,1

312,"I just can’t live like this anymore. I’ve never felt like anyone in my life has loved me and it is becoming apparent that I won’t get to experience that. I don’t think I’m ever going to be good enough and I just can’t deal with it. I’m so sick of being alone and I can’t do it anymore, I drink and smoke weed all the time just because I can’t go to sleep while I think about myself.

Nobody wants to be with me and I don’t blame them. I hate everything about myself and 6 months of therapy hasn’t even made a dent in it. I just want to die. All I’ve ever wanted is to have someone who thinks I’m good enough to spend my life with and I’m never going to have that. I can’t stand how I look when I see myself in the mirror, I’m going into debt for a shitty worthless history degree, I will never have any money, I just have nothing that makes me have any worth as a person at all. It feels like the only reason I’ll ever have to wake up is to make someone else money.

I don’t care about sex honestly, like of course I’m sure that is an important part of any relationship but I just want to be with someone who wants to be with me. I’m just not good enough. I don’t want to live like this anymore. I don’t want to wake up tomorrow and have to be sad all day because nobody cares about me. I feel like I’ve put everything I have in to other people, but if i were to man up and end it tonight there isn’t a single person on this planet who would care. I feel like a burden, I bring nothing but the same consumerist bs that everyone does with no benefits. 

I’m not going to r/suicidewatch either. That sub only exists to be an easy cop out for every other sub that doesn’t want to hear anything that heavy ig. Maybe it started out good, but anytime I’ve ever talked about how badly I want to die all I hear is “SAME!!”.

I just don’t want to do this anymore. I feel like a waste and I’m just not going to be able to this much longer on my own. It feels like I’m just counting down the days until it’s not worth doing anything anymore. I’ll never be able to cuddle someone, I’m never going to be able to spend any of the holidays with someone, nobody has ever cared about me and it’s obvious that nobody is ever going to have a reason. I’m tired of being a waste of resources. I’m tired of trying so hard to make it work when it just isn’t going to. And I’m tired of asking for help when nobody is ever going to actually care if I’m okay or not Because I’m ugly, because I’m overweight, because I have a useless degree, because my hobbies are so fucking stupid that nobody with have a brain is ever going to want to spend anytime with me, because I am the fucking worst.

314,"Hi, first time posting here. My wife and I have been feeling so stressed out from several things and the weight is getting hard to carry. Here are the things we're dealing with just within the last month:
- Bought a new construction house that we're pretty happy with, except one major thing. We somehow have the start of a cockroach infestation (we've seen 3 in the last two weeks). My wife and I are germophobic so this is a great deal of stress for the both of us. We called an exterminator the first one we saw, and he said to see if we see anymore, and we didnt until tonight where we found two, one in the kitchen and the other above the bed we sleep in (suspect they're in the central air vents maybe?)
-Covid has quadrupled the number of people my wife sees at work and its kicking her ass working 14 hour days with a 1 hour commute each way. Shes dead exhausted a few days a week leaving me to try and lighten the load from her life while I'm ramping up on a new project at my job. 
-My mother has been causing us anxiety and stress for a long time because of her repeated failure to acknowledge her role in us being more distant because of how shes treated and talked about my wife in the past. We had a huge blowout with my mother and brother and its caused residual stress (mother showing up out of nowhere has left my wife and I feeling on edge in our new home, feeling like any moment can be turned into a stresser when she stops by unannounced to ""get things off her chest"")
-I'm dealing with a kidney stone that I likely won't be able to pass on my own and will need general anaesthesia which has my wife stressed since there are dangerous side effects of anaesthesia according to her.
-my wife also got stiches in her hand this week from cutting her hand with a knife by accident, and has had really painful soreness the last week.
-my mother in law decided that my wife and I are mad at her because we haven't reached out in a while after living with them in the transition period I to moving into our new home.
-sister in law is sick, refuses to see a doctor be cause of her disbelief in them, and is crabby all the time, so we've been really offput by her demeanor lately and shes usually our go to person for a friend.

We've been feeling like we're being attacked on all sides and we don't know how to deal with this stress, especially during the pandemic.

My grandmom is too old and fragile to survive the virus, and if I got it she'd get it too because we live in a tiny appartment. We've already lost two cousins, one was 40 and the other one 62, and no one in my family wants my grandmom to get infected. She's very loved by everyone and we want her alive. I want her alive, she's my only parent and the idea of being an orphan in my early 20's terrifies me. So I've decided to stay at home until we have a vaccine even after the quarentine ended here.

But I feel like a financial burden, we make ends meet and we eat well but it's discouraging to live like this, I feel ashamed. But I know that I'm going to regret the rest of my life if I infect and indirectly kill the only parent I have just because I wanted to feel better about not doing anything at 21.

So honestly I just need some support because I feel terrible, it must sound stupid to ask about not doing anything but after 4 months locked I feel I'm going to go crazy about this because I feel too ashamed of myself. Sometimes I don't know if I'm making the right choice, it's just until things get better and we have a vaccine.

i don’t even know what to do anymore and I just am trying all of my options here. I recently have been in this mental fog where i just can’t seem to push certain thoughts out of my head. i stopped working and started seeing a therapist last week but nothing is really improving. last night I had a horrible panic attck that was brought up by this memory I had of my dad when I was younger, which I dont have many childhood memories so recently my therapist encouraged me to attempt to “access” them and I think this was kind of a result of that attempt. but anyway, I haven’t been able to shake the memories from my head, and it made me start thinking more and this morning (after not sleeping, I havent been able to) i had areally scary thought. I realized that I think my dad sexually abused me as a kid. its been over 10 years since I even lived with him, but i also dont even remember those first 10 years for the most part. the memories i do have are scary. i remember getting in trouble when i was younger, maybe 7 or 8 because i told my mom that “daddy has a tail like tiger” and I remember my dad getting physical and angry with me for telling my mom that. I remember shortly after my parents divorced when I was 10 going to my dads house and being so terrified that i yelled as loud as I could (the neighbors ended up coming over to make sure everything was okay) and I made him call my mom to come pick me up probably not even an hour after getting there. i also remember finding drugs at my dads house a lot as a kid, crushed up pills that I thought were smarties at the time

i don’t know if this is all just one big delusion or even what I should do about it. i was supposed to meet with my therapist today but her power isnout and she rescheduled for friday, so I havent been able to talk about any of this with her but I cant stop these thoughts. i dont want to do something I regret so please can someone just tell me i’m not going insane because it really really does feel like it.",09Jul2020,1
321,"So basically, both of these jobs are retail jobs that I would be doing while in school, so career is a little ambitious. 

I worked at company A for a few months short of 2 years. The working environment became toxic, my boss was constantly changing her mind and getting upset that we would do something she told us to prior. We had a work app where employees could post kinda like text posts where you could ask for a shift to be covered or mention that you're unwell and that sort of thing. She would frequently make passive aggressive posts that even though the person it was about wasn't mentioned, you knew who it was about. So, I got fed up and left for company B. 

Company B is great! I get paid more, I've already made friends with a lot of my coworkers, life is good.

325,"Hello,

I'm 15 years old i live with my Dad, Stepmom, Stepbrother, and Uncle. My Stepbrother and I used to be very close until this 4th of July (2020), my brother and i were smoking and getting high, he was drunk already so he heard a noise as i got up from his bed to go into the kitchen to smoke, he said ""was that a queef?"" and my headass got embarrassed even though i didn't and said ""why?! no, it was your bed? How do you even know what that is""...i was high remember this, please. 

He went on and on about how he's fucked so many girls and how you do doggy-style or slam a girl that's how you get a queef, i already knew this, after a while of me being silent i asked him ""why do people say pervy things when i say i have a stepbrother?"" he asked what they said, but like leaning in...and i told him they say shit like ""stepbro come help"" and disgusting shit like that, he smiled and said ""i mean i don't think it would be weird, honestly if we fucked, i mean"" i crossed my arms over my chest in an X position and i told him ""nope no no no, this is my no-no square"" and he smiled as i said it would be gross, lemme say after that i went to my room.

It has been a couple of days as it's now the 9th of July (2020) and he has been acting weird while he's sober, honestly, this makes me queasy, so like two or three nights ago he was in his room ready for bed with my niece he was wearing skin-tight boxers and stood up and leaned on his door frame away from my uncle's vision who was playing video games at the time. He stared at me until i looked back, he then walked out and was like pacing? my uncle gave him a look but i kept my eyes on the tv since i was having a major anxiety attack, he gave me this drink but while he did it he like moved so his thigh would touch my knee as my legs were up on the couch, i moved them back which made him smile and go into his room, he then yelled saying i could take a hit from the bong. 

I've been out of the house, i don't hang out upstairs, tonight i came home from my friend's house and my brother and uncle were sitting on the couch, i was wearing some shorts and a tank so i rushed downstairs into some sweats and a t-shirt, its like 100 degrees outside and I'm in SWEATS. He at first didn't really pay no mind which I'm so thankful for but once my parents were gone and my uncle was sitting too far my stepbrother took his shirt off in the middle of the fucking room and then like stripped to his boxers, keep in mind i wasn't fully looking i was like side-eyeing and pretending i was focusing on the tv, he kept looking at me and kept going behind me, my dad came upstairs and didn't even notice my brother acting weird, then thats when i realized he was acting weird for a while but i didn't notice since i only saw him being brotherly, he was not, and my family doesn't notice it. I brought up independent living and maybe doing it, that made him kinda mad and go downstairs, my rooms downstairs so i got scared a lil thinking how long he finna be down there im trynna go to sleep, but he was down there for a good 30 minutes, he finally came back upstairs and thats when i went downstairs.

&amp;#x200B;

He has a 20-year-old friend who got me drunk, and yes i know i could have chosen to not go and not drink, but i got drunk and he ended up forcing me to give him head resulting in me throwing up on the pavement. Now going through my trauma and now this? i don't even know what to classify my stepbrother situation, i don't know if i should stay at home and see if it passes or just leave and maybe report him? I honestly don't know what to do, and im tired. Please give any advice you think would help and anything else thx.",09Jul2020,1

327,"This is going to be a bit long winded, and honestly this may just be an attempt to get some of my own frustration out, but I am hoping for some advice on how to deal with this situation. So, the story: I (28M) have had this guy (30M - here on referred to as Q) as a roommate for about 6 years now. He started off subletting for another person and then ended up resigning for another year to start. Another of his friends moved in at that time and all 3 of us became friends. Video games, DND, MTG, etc. The other guy moved out after a couple years and we all stayed friends, they had their friend group who we would hang out with sometimes and then there was my friend group that we would hang out with sometimes. Good times ensued... for a while. Slowly it started coming out that Q had some anger issues. He would slowly bottle things up that upset him or caused him inconvenience until after a few months he would have an extreme blow up on one person in the friend group. That person would end up having a sit down with him, things would get worked out, and life would move on. People who had knew him longer would just say ""That's just how it goes with Q. But he's fun the rest of the time so we put up with it."" (It is probably important to note that these blow ups were almost invariably over text message.) So then, slowly over the last few years people have been getting tired of the cycle and sort of dropping out of his friend circle. For about the last 6mo-1yr I am pretty much the only one left (partially because I live with him, partially because I am probably one of the more patient people in the group). I literally have done everything for this guy. Went through a suicide scare, ease up on rent when he gets behind, used to give him rides everywhere because he couldn't afford gas. And yet he constantly accuses me of taking advantage of him. His blow ups constantly involve money or that I am somehow screwing him over. (His anger issues are particularly triggered by money. He also has recognized in himself and admitted that he has anger issues, that he doesn't trust other people with anything regarding his money, and that he blows up mainly over text.) However, it has gotten to a point where I just can't take it anymore. I finally 2mo ago told him that he can't live here anymore and that he would need to find a new place. We finally had a little face-to-face a couple weeks after that and I told him some of how I felt - that I was tired of waiting for blow ups and that I just couldn't do it anymore. I ended up making him cry because I revealed how much I had been hurt by all these times of him attacking me. He texted me later saying he wanted to try to leave ""as close to neutral as possible"". However, now he has been blowing up about literally everything even after that talk, and it is every 1-2weeks instead of every couple months. It is to the point where he is even scaring my girlfriend because of how much cursing he does and the names he calls me. I honestly dread seeing his car here and knowing he is home. And when his car is not here, or I hear him leave, I feel such a sense of relief. Tonight, he had yet another blow up on me. My girlfriend and her sister came over because covid numbers/restrictions in my area have finally started lightening up. He immediately blew up about us ""spreading filth"" and saying that I am taking advantage of him, and called my girlfriends sister ""nothing but a fucking chance of disease"". My usual tactic is to de-escalate and attempt to patch things up the best I can. I just can't do it anymore though. I currently have a text message all the way typed, but not sent, about how I literally just can't stand him anymore and that I literally don't care about him anymore. And that I actually just can't wait to have him out of my house so I can never see him or talk to him again. But I couldn't quite bring myself to send it yet. So for anyone still reading, I guess that is where I need the advice. Do I just ignore it? Do I try to placate again? Or do I finally just let him know how I feel so that at least one of us can get closure? I don't know what the right thing to do is. Sorry if this is a bit jumbled, I tried to edit the best I could. I can answer any questions in the comments if it helps.",09Jul2020,1
328,I recently today sold my car to a psycho. The car wasn't in bad shape and ran good. 250K miles so it wasn't a top tier car. Today I sold it to a guy and he test drove it for a bit and decided to buy it for 2K. Later he messages me saying he wants his money back and karmas a bitch and he knows alot about me. Not sure what to do here. He must've regretted it or broke the car because it was running perfectly. What would you do? Have some screenshots about what he said to me and will post them if asked,09Jul2020,1
329,"Good evening folks. So to give you the gist, I'm a 20M currently in week 3 of a 10 week EMT program. Before the pandemic hit I had just started a warehouse job but had to leave that since mom is high risk(50s, overweight and diabetic) but am getting unemployment payment. After I pass my program, I plan to take the national exam, and then send in my paperwork and documents to get my license for where I want to work. The city I'm looking to relocate to is ~3 1/2 hours away from where I currently live at home, and my reason for wanting to escape is due to exasperation and frustration with family drama that's been going on for years.


Now I'm really not close to my mom or dad(they are divorced and he lives elsewhere). They had a VERY dysfunctional relationship throughout me and my sister's childhood especially in my adolescence. Last week, my mom was saying that it hurt that I'm distant and irritated around her, and brought up her signing over one of her two cars to me(I didn't ask, but she had considered it since I was a HS senior) and me still living at home. And yes, with both my parents I don't really talk to them and even my relationship with my sister is up and down. But this morning, she was talking on the phone to someone downstairs and was talking about last week's conversation. She then went on to tell the person(likely my grandma) about a time where I referenced frustration with my parents' mess growing up, and she said that was me ''getting upset over a hair out of place'', ''that I should go see what it's like living in the hood', etc. Now we are black, but she's an RN so we've always lived in a decent middle class area. Yes we always had some presents at Christmas, never were starved or malnourished, had cable etc. But none of that changes that there was some messed up things that occurred in my upbringing(again, much of this was in middle/early-mid high school):

-Parents had loud shouting matches with profane language to rival Adult Swim characters. Dad once told Mom her fat ass smelled like shit due to not being able to clean herself without squirting water. Add in some physical altercations with him shoving her, her scratching him, death threats from my old man, having told my mother at least once he would break her neck. Once told me he didn't like me because I was weak and said no girls would want me(I was 13).Speaking of which...

-My sister(3 years my junior) over the last few years has had problems with mood swings, anger and depression. While some of it had to do with some school drama the family mess was definitely a big factor. She has tried to run away or commit suicide by walking to an overpass to jump off, once trying  swallowing Window Cleaner or Nyquil, and last summer the cops were at our house 4 times(within 2 months)  because of she and my mom fighting physically and her pulling a piece of my mom's hair. The 4th time she actually swallows various pills and is rushed to the hospital and stabilized. Parents start their blame game crap right there in her ED room and I tell them both to shut it, Dad takes off belt and says he will''break my neck/beat my ass'' and Mom calls for security. Just around two weeks ago me and him had spent some time together and he had been giving the whole apology speech and all that, which wasn't even the first time.

-During middle school, we were even exposed to their accusations at each other of cheating. My dad had even gone to our old church, and had me come out of youth group to tell me my mom allegedly ''had condoms in her car''. He actually has a girlfriend now that he is engaged too but I'm not invested in another train wreck.

So that gives you at least some idea of what I've been through. I'm not in any physical danger, but it was just stressful to deal with all this shit. Aside from standard corporal punishment(black family, so this could include face smacks rarely) they have never starved, bruised, burned, scarred or done any real physical harm, but they have left me just feeling burned out with this situation, especially with my mom not only saying I still need to try to forgive and have a relationship with my dad, but she's also homophobic, accused me of being gay for never having a girlfriend, and telling me and my sister to have 4 kids each one day(in case some are gay, so her blood passes on). I'm not cool with that, or her telling me I'm going to hell earlier during the pandemic(end times craze.) 



But even being aware of all this there is still a part of me trying to wonder if things were really that bad, but the other wants to move on to better things, and get back on track with college education(financial aid through vocational rehabilitation department, due to autism) and focus on that and building myself up for my career(game warden or park ranger) so that if I start a family one day I won't have to put them through similar BS. But I don't plan on telling them when I move out, and I'm unsure of if I permanently cut contact, or at least till I have some clarity?


Thoughts? Thank you.",09Jul2020,1

331,"Hello! So part of me has my mind made up about this, but I also feel very guilty.

Both jobs in question are retail jobs that I'm doing while in school, so career may not be the right word. Basically, I worked at company A for a few months shy of 2 years, and left this past March for company B. At company A, I left because I felt suffocated and the work environment became toxic for me. I  loved my job at company A, and I often had weekends off and had more free time, though I was constantly being texted or called by managers to come in, and guilt tripped when I would say no. The general manager of that store would also be very passive aggressive to everyone, and would micromanage every little thing you would do. I was constantly being pressured to stay hours after my shift would have ended and was always coming in on my days off. While there, I was considered by people to be a good employee, because I knew what I was doing and did my job well. When I left, I gave a full two weeks notice, and still showed up for my remaining shifts. 

I went to company B after leaving company A. My time at company B has been really really nice. I've already made friends with a lot of people that I work with, and there aren't expectations of staying late or coming in on my days off where I feel like I'm being forced into doing it. My managers make me feel like my work is appreciated and let me know when I've done a good job at something, something that company A never really did. 

Well, recently, a manager from company A messaged me on facebook asking if I would want to return.  I gave a maybe, and she told the general manager. The general manager basically told her that I left on bad terms (even though I gave a two weeks???) and that I wasn't a friendly or outgoing person (I'm a relatively reserved person, but I still know how to give guest service, I'm just not someone who will approach guests constantly or push if I feel like they want to shop by themselves). However, this other manager really wants me to return and has vouched for me, and said the GM would call me soon. 

I really like my current job, and knowing that the GM thinks of me that way at my previous job makes me not want to go back to an environment where I know that the GM thinks of me that way. If she calls me, I don't know if I should even answer or what I would say to her. I thought about going back for a little bit just because of the schedule, but this has all reminded me of why I left and now I just feel sick to my stomach and weird thinking about it. what do?",09Jul2020,1
332,"I have an almost 2 month old kitten that l got for my birthday, most cat owners know that this age is when they're the most playful because they have a lot of energy that needs to be let out. My family however doesn't.

When we first got him he was really quiet and calm because he wasn't used to us yet, a few days later he started getting more used to us and therefore more playful. Ever since my family has been more of a pain in the ass than ever. 

Don't get me wrong they can be very nice too, I mean they bought the cat for me as a birthday gift, but verbal abuse is part of their daily routine the only problem is I didn't expect them to be that way with an animal. 

It took a few years but I finally knew what I'm allowed to say and do and what I'm not so the yelling and name calling wasn't as severe anymore until Milo (my cat) came and it started all over again because he's a kitten and kittens won't listen and create a whole different personality just for my family. 

This morning my mom threatened to hurt him or throw him out in the streets if he doesn't ""calm down"" and the more I tried explaining to her that this is how kittens are the more angry she got at him and me for ""promoting his behaviour"". 

The worst part is she acts like nothing happened after she calms down and if you try to show hints of still being upset about what she said she'll turn the tables on you and either and start arguing with you for overreacting then go on about how you were being sensitive and she wouldn't have actually done anything or start playing the victim. Threatening to hurt an animal (which in my case my cat is the only thing keeping me sane while living with this hell of a family so he means pretty much everything to me) is not exactly something you can just get over in a minute.

So if anyone has any kind of advice on how I can get her to accept that this is how kittens are please let me know because I really need him to stay.

Thank you xxx",09Jul2020,1
333,"My bf and I(22f) have been together for a while now and marriage comes up on the regular during conversation. With that, occasionally children will also be a topic of discussion. 

A bit of background: I have a younger kid sister(9) and my bf has quite a few siblings. I’m okay with children. I can get along with them just fine if need be, but have a general dislike for them. I don’t enjoy being around them, I do not like entertaining them, and I do not want them touching me or even near me. They get on my nerves extremely easily and I especially cannot tolerate babies. I’ve tolerated my sister as she grew up (big age gap between us, 10+ years) and we’re actually pretty close now. My bf absolutely adores children. You can literally see his eyes light up when he sees his baby cousin. He’s really good with kids and it’s quite endearing. However, he wants a big family. Think 4+ kids. I, on the other hand want maybe 1 in the future. Maximum 2. And even that’s iffy. 

I’ve told him multiple times that the maximum that I’m willing to have is 2. It’s my body and ultimately he’s not the one that has to carry a kid for 9 months and go through the birthing process. I don’t think I have the patience and the mental strength to deal with more than two kids as even 2 seems very overwhelming to me. I currently have anxiety and depression and kids do not make me happy, so there’s a concern for my mental wellbeing as every person I know who has given birth has gone through postpartum depression too. 

I’ve told him multiple times that I will not marry him until we are on the same page about this as I think it’s a topic that should be agreed upon before committing to marriage. However, each time it’s come up and I’ve said that I don’t want more than 2 kids he’s kind of just said “we’ll see” and dropped it. 

Today the topic of kids came up and I kind of snapped when he said something along the lines of “so we’re gonna have 4 kids hey?” and told him that it absolutely was not happening with me. I’m tired of having this discussion over and over again and him not listening to me. Today it seemed to finally click for him though, when I told him “I’m honestly annoyed with this discussion. The maximum amount of kids I’m ever willing to have is 2. There’s nothing you can say and no amount of pleading will change my mind. This discussion is over”. He went quiet and didn’t say anything else when he drove me home other than “good to know early I guess”. 

I’m not too sure what this means or how to proceed as neither of us seem to want to budge on this matter. Advice please?",09Jul2020,1

And whenever I do get the chance to join them we will play for a little while and once one of my other friends get on they will replace me for them. The thing that hurts the most is when they want to hang out they always invite everyone but me. Sometimes they do it right in front of my face and don’t even ask if I want to come. Other times they talk about the fun stuff they did without me over the weekend and try to hide it by acting like they didn’t do anything at all but it’s so obvious because I always listen to their conversations because no one wants to talk to me. There’s only one person who I feel is my friend because he is the one who I hang out the most with, but every now and then he will hang out with every else and not tell me about it.

338,"I absolutely hate complaining about this, because everyone's family has political discussion in it,  
but it's starting to negatively effect my life. (As dramatic as that sounds!)  
'So far, I've been playing dumb, because I don't want to be this self congratulating know-it-all.  
I do not want to be a this superior intellectual sort of person.  
I do not want to make people feel the way my family makes me feel about this sort of thing.  


My family isn't abusive in any way. At the end of the day, they still love and provide for me.  
It's just another pet peeve or idiosyncrasy, I guess.  


I doubt I'd contribute much by adding their specific politics into this,  
but lets just say that they yell at each other all day about this thing of sorts.  
They complain how horrible the world is, and how life was so grand back in the day.  
They laugh at all the jokes that are geared towards their side, meanwhile pick the living daylights apart from the apposing side. Often commenting how horrible and idiotic something is, meanwhile uplifting their views.  


I absolutely hate it. I have a someone in my family who is on the side of the side that they don't like, and while she has her flaws based on her character, I don't blame her for not coming to visit after hearing how they talk about her to each other when she's not around.  
They call her an idiot, and they claim because she agrees with a certain thing, she wants this thing.  
It's horrible to hear. I'm often seething in the corner.   
When they aren't yelling about politics, they are watching politics.  
I treasure the moments that are politics-free, even if it only lasts an hour.

That's not to say I hate politics completely. I understand that paying attention to the current issues in the spheres of specific topics are highly important,  
however I feel immensely burnt out from the subject.  
To make matters worse, my friend is living with us currently,  
and she talks no better than they do.  
The only difference is that, despite her being merely three months older than me,  
She talks down to me as if I were a kid.

She has the pseudo-intellectual demeanor. I am having trouble calling her my friend, when she talks the way she does to me.  
She gives me this raised eyebrows, squint-y eyed, disappointing parent look.  
She always says ""Well actually"" and ""No"" and ""Your wrong"" often in this superior tone in voice.  
All I ever do is hear her complain about this that and the other, the addition of psuedo-politics is unbearable.  


I love to learn about history and science. However, my family almost ruins it for me.  
I've hit a rut where I was uninspired for months, and didn't learn a single thing,  
because of how they talk about it.  
They always talk about how great their side is in history, meanwhile the other has all these nasty horrible things, while overlooking all the flaws on their side.  


History is filled with all sorts of horrible mistakes and tragedy from all sides, undermining it is just as horrible as ignoring it all together.  
I unfortunately let all the toxic political filth touch what I love.  
And as much as I love my Mama, she put sticky notes on our doors, and asked us to do a report on the president she wrote on each sticky note in exchange for money.  
I absolutely declined, and refused to touch the sticky note since.   
All the presidents that she chose were remarkable to say the least, but no deep contrast.  
I felt like a jerk not wanting to do her little game, but it irks me she's turning the things I love into some sort of political post she can make on Facebook.  


I've had enough, I'm afraid.  
Today, I've made a mistake, and I feel horrible about it.  
I plan to apologize for my rude behavior tomorrow,   
but their recent political rant was my breaking point.  
I was making my plate at the dinner table,  
(Which nobody sits at, because they'd rather be in their rooms or on their phones)   
and they began talking about not only a historical subject, but a scientific subject as well.  
and I guess it was my fault for butting in, especially since I haven't been doing much at all in the past few months.  
I made a tin foil hat joke, and that's all it was, albeit with slight frustration after she told me I was brainwashed for not caring about a certain political issue, and there my friend comes along.  
Boasts about how she read a book on the matter, and tells me how ignorant I am.

I've been playing dumb, but at the same time, not learning much for awhile really dulls your brain down. I don't know why, but I openly disagreed with my family, and by the end of it, I was on the verge of tears, I couldn't even bring myself to eat my dinner, so I threw it out, cleaned up the kitchen, and went to my room. I cried for hours as I overheard my family complaining about me.  
I tried to go to sleep, but I just couldn't.   
So I am here typing out my frustrations.  


I understand that I am in the wrong in the situation, but I want to learn from this.   
Is there any way I can cope better?",09Jul2020,1
339,"In fact, I have good reason to hate this religion and ones like it. But, I have a gentle forgiving heart, and its hard to hold a grudge. I've started the process of attending a christian university, and I'm quite nervous. 

There's so many reasons why I won't be their typical student, but here is a few: 

- LGBTQ+ (I prefer Queer myself) 
- Polyamorous
- Pagan
- I am a Survivor of numerous hate crimes committed by ""Christians"", starting around age 9.

But I also have these advantages: 

- I want to learn more about the history of these religions (especially ones I have strong opinions about.)
- I grew up in a two religion household. My father was  raised christian and my mother chose to be pagan long before I was born, but she tells me that she believes in Jesus too. 
- I took to paganism as my personal belief system, but I went to plenty of bible study and Sunday school growing up. In middle school, I even really enjoyed Christian Youth Group because of the music. 

The reason I'm even considering this is because there is no other school that I've found which offers affordable fulltime online courses in my state. I've looked for colleges that fit my needs, for hours on end, and mixed with my crippling anxiety- I spend those hours sobbing and shaking. It's taken me 2 years just to get to this point of filing admission and filing for financial aid. I feel like maybe I should turn back now and look for a non-religious school, but I'm scared that I'll be paralyzed and NEVER  actually end up attending anywhere. My biggest concern about this school is the teachers, because I am experienced with religious harassment amongst my classmates and I feel like I will find that no matter where I go. I just am hoping that the teachers won't be religious AND bigoted, like I am so accustomed. 

If youre a secular person or someone of a different religion that has had to attend a religious school which you have different religious belief than, or if you're someone who empathizes with the fear of starting college for the first time, I'd love your advice.

345,"Using a throwaway because my gf knows my main account. 

Over the last few years, I really got my shit together. Before meeting my current partner, I hurt a lot of people in my life. I'm not proud of it. I had past trauma and mental health issues that I didn't deal with for too long. Since meeting ""Chloe"" (not her real name), I'm a changed man. I'm happy, stable, and thoroughly in love. We met before I fully improved my outlook on life, and she's proud of how far I've come, as am I.

Thing is, there is a bunch of stuff I did in the past that I've never come clean about to anyone. I don't want to get too specific, but just know that it wasn't anything too terrible. Chloe knows some of the accusations made against me, and I have quite successfully convinced her of my innocence. We've been together just over two years now, and I'm not sure how she would react if she found out that I wasn't innocent, and that I did lie to her about those things. 

I really don't think there would be a benefit to telling her, but I'm not 100% certain about that. I worry that if I did, she would see the acts alone, and not the situation that created them (trauma/desperation/etc). I have faith in myself that I'm never going to do anything like that again, but I want objective advice on this.

Would there be a reason to tell her? I know some people will just say ""honesty"" but I really feel that it's more complicated than that.

I will say the following about my past actions, because I know that will help with the advice required: It wasn't anything that could get me a serious prison sentence, no murder or rape or physical attacks. The actions boil down to anonymous harassment after being rejected or treated badly. I know that sounds bad, and like I said, I don't feel good about it, but I have worked hard to repair my behaviour and I don't want a bad reputation to undo that hard work.

346,"Recently, my parents had a massive argument that tops all arguments. And I feel like my dad isn't very considerate of her feelings at all. 

My mom and my dad have been married for about 16 years. They've obviously had their ups and downs but have always managed to pull get through them - usually resulting in my mom compromising. 

A week ago, my mom took my dad to the side so my siblings couldn't hear what they were talking about. She had told him that when he doesn't listen to her, two of the younger ones think they don't need to listen to her either, and they just stare at her as if they didn't even hear her. 

My dad took this the wrong way, and he said  things that weren't related to what she was trying to discuss. To say the least, he spewed a few things which I never thought he would say.

""How much more should I take?"" ""The kids don't listen so it's my fault??"" ""You and your eldest daughter laugh at me behind my back."" ""I'm only withstanding all of this for the kids."" ""I wish I had my freedom back."" ""Should I just go in the ground then? Would you be happy?"" (Basically should I die lmao)

He didn't let my mom talk. When she did, he'd get madder, and in the end, my mom didn't get a word in and was pretty hurt. I saw her with tears in her eyes and she was just extremely upset. 

She said it felt like he kept half of that in for years, and how she'd seen a face of his that she'd never seen before in her life. She said that she had made so many compromises for him and they've gone done the drain because of his blowout. For example, we stopped watching a lot of shows and cartoons because he believed they were a bad influence on kids. My mom also stopped inviting people over because he'd find an excuse to get mad at that [and yet it's okay for us to visit one of his relatives who we can't stand]. She thinks he's changed a lot and thinks that his friends may be a possible influence. Or that maybe he's just taking his anger out at home because anyone else would get up and start a fight with him. (Or another possibility, but 😞)

So she hasn't talked to him since last week and refuses to do so because she's sick and tired of his attitude. 

My dad thinks that just because he's 50, no one can go against him or tell him what to do, or give him advice. He often gets snappy if you try to tell him something - he thinks he's always right. 

I've been wanting to stand up to him, but the last time I did, he got mad and said that I was being disrespectful. I was defending my mom when I heard him come at her buying some clothes (which we needed at the time.) And actually, I was being very respectful but I also cried a little later cause he was scary.

Lately I've been thinking about getting a job in case anything were to happen (which he'd also get mad at) and in case he ever decides he's fed and wants to leave. From the way he said things, it really sounded like we were all a burden on him. And honestly speaking, me and some of the kids are also getting fed up with his attitude towards our mom. 

What's a good course of action in this situation?",09Jul2020,1
347,"I had a best friend (let’s call him Jim)I treated like a brother for 2 years. We grew apart over the end of our junior year of highschool but it was pretty fast. I stopped hitting him up to hangout and he stopped hitting me up to hangout. I found some new friends and I thought there was no bad blood between us. He then told people he didn’t like me anymore and we weren’t friends and said some other mean things while I never said anything bad back. After about 2 months of not talking, I confronted him when I needed to pick something up from his house. I told him I would always love him and would take a bullet for him anyday and I tried to hug him. He gave me a cold hug back and said he can’t be mad at me but he felt abandoned. A year has past since then and we are on okay terms. We play xbox sometimes and I chat his stories on snapchat but nothing besides that. I still care for him even though people have told me that I should just move on because he doesn’t care. I have thought about asking him to catch up at lunch before we go to college because I wish were on better terms. I’m just not sure and maybe I should just move on and leave him in the past.",09Jul2020,1
348,"I am a 14-year-old transgender male, and I have quite the experience with art, and others consider me incredibly good at it. Well, back in December my stepdad purchased a special kind of sketchbook for me—a 16-page sketchbook that will be sent to the Brooklynn Public Library to keep in a collection of sketchbooks from people all around the world. I've worked off and on in that sketchbook, and I am about three-quarters of the way through. The problem is about my name being on the front page of it.

The cover can be customized, and I currently have written on it my preferred name and last name. The big issue is that my parents believe that me being a trans guy is a phase that will eventually pass, but I've known this for several years. They refuse to use my preferred name and pronouns which is quite stressful. Anyways, I know my parents will not let me send the sketchbook back to New York with my preferred name on it. They will make it so my birth name is right front and center. I would just go along with this, but my problem is that I am already known on social media as my preferred name. Plus, my art and name will be there forever, and there will be tagged my social media accounts, again, with my preferred name. I'm scared I'm making a big deal out of this, either way.

It feels so wrong to have my birth name on the cover, but I know my parents won't let me have otherwise. I don't know how to handle this and I need advice. Should I just go along with my birth name on it or should I be persistent on my preferred name?",09Jul2020,1

355,"Im 21F and I live in Singapore. Ive always been interested in psychology but didn't do well enough to enrol into the diploma course. Thats when my business path started. After my diploma, I thought it would only be practical to continue down that path but accountancy made my depression and anxiety worsen. I had to withdraw. 

I'm now on a gap year and I've started picking up new skills such as making vector art on photoshop and upcycling old clothes by sewing and altering them. Ive also rediscovered my interest in psychology through an online course on intro to psych conducted by yale. On top of that, my time with my psychologist really helped me gained lots of insight about my life and sparked an interest for me. I have been set on enrolling myself into a part time psychology course for a few months now. However, it requires me to have a full time job. Hence, i started looking into job listings and the only thing i could find (due to my lack of background in social sciences) was social work. I also chanced upon a few job listings for counsellors (none which im qualified for). I did a google search on the differences and similarities between psychologist and counsellors and with every post that ive read, i only became more conflicted. Im trying my best to make an informed decision as Ive already withdrawn from a course, i do not wish to enroll into psychology only to find out that counselling was a better fit for me. Hence, im here to ask if theres anyone out there with a diploma/degree/masters in psychology/counselling who could share with me your academic experience, your opinion on the differences, where you ending up working at and whether you regret your decision.

371,"Using a throwaway because I am already quite heavily active on reddit.

Me and my girlfriend come from devout christian families, as both are we, as we offer ourselves wholly to god. 

That being said, we of course abstein in any form of intercourse because of our beliefs. We do not intend to engage in sexual acts until I've carried her across the threshold, so to speak.

Recently though, I have been feeling increasingly sexual, not towards her directly or any one thing in particular, but I find myself fantasizing about the day I can take her virginity.

I have been masturbating in the shower in order to quence these feelings, it isn't adultry as per the Bible (Matthew 5:27) so I haven't felt too bad about it. Whenever I have finished I have done so in the shower and the water has washed away all evidence.

About a month ago I had a shower and as I was getting out I had another urge to purge, but because I was already out the shower I didn't want to waste time getting back in, so I just did it standing in the bathroom. I wasn't thinking straight and I finished on my towerl, then threw it in the laundry basket and thought nothing of it.

Now my GF is being sick nearly every morning, we are seeing the signs of pregnancy and I asked if she cheated, she swore she didn't. I thought about it for a moment, then asked her ""What towel did you use when you got out of the shower a month ago (exact date unknown)?"". She thought that was a weird question but I pressed her and we narrowed it down to her using my towel, which she took from the laundry basket because hers was still damp from the day before.

I had to break to too her that I think my ejaculate got inside her when she dried herself off down there. She was mortified, obviously, and we had a big argument about absteining.

That is where I am now, if I tell my parents, we will both be shunned and removed as they will most likely not accept a ""cover story"". If we go to planned parenthood then I think that despite there being no reference to abortions in the Bible, that is directly against God, nor do I want to be responsible for creating then taking away a life. If I tell people adamantly about how it happened, then that will just be awkward.

I am freaking out, probably even more so than my GF, she hasn't offered any suggestions either which makes me think she wants to keep it? I think we are too young for parenthood, plus all our christain friends wouldn't approve of having a child so young.

Any suggestions helpful right now",09Jul2020,1
372," 

I will admit, the in beginning of this I was acting stupid, but that's not the main issue, so stick with me.

Around mid-November last year, my parents went of vacation for a week, leaving me (16F) with my younger brother (11M) with my dad's parents. My grandparents have a boat they bought about 2 years ago now, and they had a boat parade scheduled for the weekend of my parents' vacation. Leading up to my parents vacation, school was getting very busy and we had just gotten 2 young kittens, and my grandmother was resentful that we had gotten them when we know she's (very mildly) allergic to cats. I had been making a point that I wanted to be left home alone for the weekend instead of going on the boat, because of all my schoolwork, and because I've never liked sleeping in boats as it makes me sick.

So the friday before the boat parade we were set to leave after me and my brother got home from school. In the morning, I saw one of the kittens launch herself into the toilet, and she spilled the (clean) toilet water around the toilet, but I was running late to the bus, so I told my brother to clean it up as I rushed out the door.

At school, I get a text from my grandma saying that my brother refused to clean up the bathroom, saying I should have done it because I was there while it happened. I got annoyed, because our cleaning schedule for the kitten's litter/the bathroom was he cleans before school, I clean after, and I didn't see why he thought me witnessing it had anything to do with it. She was urging me to ""take the high road"" and just clean it up, and I refused, it was his responsibility, etc. etc. 

Well I got home, my grandma again pushed me to just clean it up so my brother wouldn't make a fuss. I refused, and when my brother got home from school, I told him to clean it. He said no, and we started fighting, and eventually it escalated into a shouting match. I don't remember the details, but he said something that really pushed my buttons so I pushed him. I am not proud of this, and later both me and my brother apologized to each other for arguing. Anyways, my grandmother, who had been trying to ""stay out of it"" had been trying to hurry because she wanted to leave quickly because my grandparents don't like to drive at night. After I pushed my brother she snapped, and screamed a threat to call the police on me for pushing him. He had barely even taken a step back when I pushed him, but she stared screaming about me assaulting him and that she was calling the police and that I would spend the night in jail.

Naturally, I panicked, and pled with her to not call them, and I said I would go and pack my things to stay on the boat. I went to my room crying and shaken to pack, and as I walked she called after me saying that if I wasn't done packing in 10 minutes she would call the cops. I freaked out and in my room all I could do was cry and shake in a ball on the floor, because at this point I didn't really want to spend 2 days stuck on a boat with her.

For the next 2 hours, she opened the door to my room every 5 or so minutes and threatened to either call the police, or after she realized I was mostly beyond reason, to put me in a pysch ward. She accused me of lying about having panic attack so I could stay home and do homework. Sometimes she shouted insults, and called me irresponsible, bratty, spoiled, rude, and she even said I was disrespecting her when I told her that her coming and shouting at me only worsened my panic. I was hyperventilating and sobbing, and close to running away through my window. 

Eventually, my grandpa made her go on a walk, and he and my brother helped me calm down (my brother ended up cleaning the litter while I was panicking, and he was also really mad at my grandma) I still had to go to the boat, but I mostly avoided my grandma, and told my parents about what happened when they got back on the following Monday. They were mad at her, but never said anything, and I think they assumed I would just get over it. 

My grandmother has done things like this in the past, but never to this extent, and I had never really enjoyed being around her, but after this I can't stand being her. My heart rate goes up when I'm around her, and I'm just scared. I told my parents I don't want to see her anymore, but they, my dad especially, think we can resolve it by telling her to apologize, and want me to suck it up and se her anyways. Because we only live an hour away from them it's really hard to find ways not to see her, but I managed it until January, when I couldn't convince my parents not to let her come to my birthday. I avoided her as best I could, but being near just made me anxious. 

I haven't seen her since then, but she texts me constantly asking me to talk and saying she misses me, and she sends us packages of candy and toys a lot. I really don't want to see her, and every time I tell my parents that, my dad says ""how long are you going to do this for?"" like I can control if I'm scared of her. I feel bad for keeping my family from seeing my grandparents, but I can't handle seeing her. 

I can only go so long before I have to see her, or I have to tell her and my parents that I don’t want to see her. What should I do?

tl;dr: My grandmother threatened to call the police on me and caused a panic attack, so now I feel scared around her. What do I do?",09Jul2020,1
373,"Me and my friend are both 17F. At the pool, one of her classmates was there and his older brother, 20M, was kind of ogling at my friend. Later that day the 20M guy started dming her on instagram and she thought he was weird but she started texting him to see what would happen, and she sent me all their convos. He's definitely weird, not in a red flag way but maybe a yellow flag? He's giving the impression that he thinks he can hook up with my friend and he talks about kind of sexual stuff despite knowing she's a minor (my friend does kind of enable him by not calling out the shit he says, but it's still weird) He's clingy and constantly texting her, probably surprised a girl is actually talking to him or something. Me and friend both agree this guy is a weirdo. 

My friend was talking to me and she jokingly said ""wouldn't it be funny if I said I'd hang out with him, but I took you with me without telling him and said you're my girlfriend?"" (The guy doesn't know me, and me and my friend are both bi). Then she wanted to actually do it and I said sure, because she's my best friend.

We respect the fact that everyone has different parameters and comfort levels they have to work with. Many don’t have the choice, even if they are uncomfortable. However, we’ve noticed that the difference in responses from our friend circles has either drawn us together or drawn us apart.

Has anyone found successful ways to bridge this gap? How can we maintain friendships, when one life is at a standstill and another is forging ahead?

I don’t think that “well if they are good enough friendships, it will last” works as an answer for me. This is because we are a young family and our friend circle is also all young families.

380,"Long story short, I got into pretty bad credit card debt in my very early 20's. (I'm 25 now) I eventually got so overwhelmed, I enrolled in this program a couple years back through a company called Freedom Debt Relief. It's essentially one step away from bankruptcy; they tell you to let all of your active accounts go past due/negative, then they step in to renegotiate your debt to a lower amount, and they settle it with the company for you. You pay into a dedicated account, and once the finances are there, they pay the creditor.  I enrolled with a 727 credit score (I had 100% on time payments, but it was all consuming and I was living paycheck to paycheck just paying the minimum amounts) and about $19,000 of debt. From using this service, my credit score had dropped to 430 when a partner company contacted me for a loan to pay off the remaining balances and settle all my debts immediately. I agreed and decided that was best, and my score did go up quite a bit from doing this. I had retained one of my credit accounts and opened another small credit card, so I began building credit again.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, I just checked my loan with this partner company; when I initially got the loan, it was for $10,888. I've been paying $304 a month for the past 6 months, and now the balance is at $10,276, so the balance has only decreased by $612, despite paying $1,824. I also did the math, and once the loan has reached its end, I will have paid $8,000+ in interest. This seems....wrong to me. My credit score now is 671-680 (I just pulled all 3 scores from Experian with their membership). Although my score is increasing, I'm scared to apply for a loan to get a better interest rate because a hard inquiry will only serve to hurt my score, and with my ""poor"" history of defaulted/settled accounts, I don't even know that I'll get approved. I am eligible through the current loan company to refinance, but it's another hard pull and I already feel extremely taken advantage of. What should I do at this point? I want to get rid of this debt once and for all. I have about $4,500 in savings, but I'm reluctant to use that for my loan, given the current state of the USA.

382,"I’m (f19) just wondering because of a tiktok I had seen that added on to a previous suspicion. I have always been considered the weird friend (always was told it was a good weird??). I have been told I’m rude in situations where I didn’t realize I had been (ex. people are over and I don’t do the typical hostess type stuff, seem like I want them gone etc...). After I’m told what I should have done I do significantly better when future situations arise. I have many sensory issues and can become overwhelmed by them, primarily sensory in regards to physical touch(masks can overload me to the point where I go to an empty isle in the grocery and take it off for a minute to collect myself). I function well in familiar social settings but in new ones I struggle with eye contact and conversation. I am functional in society and live with my husband in our own apartment so if I am I know it would be on the mild end of spectrum (if that’s the proper terms, feel free to correct me). I am in therapy for my anxiety but I feel like it’s not going anywhere or helping me much. The reason I am asking is to get a better grasp on what’s going on with me. I know I’m different and I simply want to know if this could be it. I know it could better help me cope with some things and better help me understand potentially triggers for my anxiety. 
Any advice from those who are autistic and those who are close to someone who is are welcome. Thank you in advance!",09Jul2020,1

384,"Im 25f my bf is 33 we been with each other for 5 years  , lately we have wanted to try different stuff in the bedroom, so we decided to look online for another person. Im terrible at communication and I hate texting, so I generally wait for my boyfriend to find someone and then we kinda go from there. I've expressed to him that if he is chatting I would like to be more involved. He's  constantly asking me what I'm comfortable with and I tell him I just need him to share with me the chats and what going on. Recently I went through photos in his phone and there was a recent nude picture of him  . I asked him if he sent it he said yes thats kinda how this works,  I knew that , but this was a new nude . I asked him why he didn't involve me or tell me when it came to taking the nude picture and he was like I already have some of you.  I instantly got upset because I feel like hes exchanging photos in chats and not sharing them with me. I feel like he is being so nonchalant by saying that sending nudes is just something you do, when I feel like deep down hes doing it for personal gain and not for us.
I met him on a hook up site and I feel that he enjoys exhanging pics and dirty talk . This was supposed to be a us thing. I know I let him be in charge of the communicating but he doesn't even ask me what I think of the girls I don't even know who he sent that nude pic to. Then to tell me you sent them one of me , and I dont even know which. He says tell me what you want and trys to act all innocent when i really feel like hes being sneaky. He has this ""who me!?"" Type of attitude, I dont know how to address it. I want to believe his intentions are true but how can I when he doesn't share information with me.",09Jul2020,1
385,"I’ve lived in my apartment for about a month now. It’s been great, however, I noticed a week or so ago that someone has moved in above me. It is a new building with many vacancies and I went from hearing zero noise from above (I am on the second floor) to regular walking around noises. Either way, people definitely live above me. The sound of walking around doesn’t really bother me, even though it does happen until the hours of 3-4am most nights. What does concern me are the vocal fights these people get into.

386,"Were both bi just to clear that up but yeah. We got close when they dated and afterward I only text him every few weeks or so to see how he is. 

He brought up how weird our conversations were and how it was only just the two of us complimenting eachother and calling eachother “sexy.” He said how it’s weird for his ex gfs best friend to do that but “I don’t mind I like it.” I’ve never called him sexy and he’s never called me sexy other than in a joke. I HAVE complimented his hair or physical features because I like complimenting everyone but that’s it. I replied and said “ah it’s all just for fun it doesn’t mean anything lol.” 

He then brought up spooning and said “idk how we would spoon tbh because you’re very tall and I’m short but I like to be a big spoon and you seem to like that too.” I got very confused here and just said “well I’ve never thought about that before but dw, I wouldn’t wanna spoon you anyways.” Then he sent lore awkward videos of him talking about how he’d be okay with it then saying how it’s weird I talk to him.

387,"I grew up with a neurotic, anxiety/fear driven, controlling and intrusive mother. She pervades every aspect of my life. She’s the cause of a drastic hindrance to my independence and developmental delays. 

I’m completely dependent on her, we’re codependent. She even sleeps with me. She takes pleasure from shaming me. Consequently, my self esteem has plummeted. I can’t even look a stranger in the eye without getting anxious. I feel guilty for doing any “shameful” behaviors. My mother is a prude, she wouldn’t let me wear bikinis or show skin, and this contributed greatly to my body image and eating disorder issues. 

She is highly manipulative. She manipulated the therapists to where they concur and side with her. When she has sessions with MY therapist without me who knows what she says. I even found out that she had multiple sessions without my knowledge. I lost all trust for all therapists. I don’t trust anyone. 

I have had therapy my entire life, as if therapy is a substitute for life experience, which is something I was and continue to be denied of. 

When I was 6 she showed me videos of people getting stabbed and cut open to make me fear the world. Why have kids if you think the world is this terrible place?

She would keep me in this protective bubble. If she knew where I was, managed me by instilling fear in me, knowing I was safe she was at peace. But I wasn’t. I suffer while she’s at peace. If a therapist doesn’t want my mom involved in every single therapy session she automatically hates that therapist and she finds me a new one. I want a male, but her being sexist she says no. Every session I’ve had my mother has been with me. Without my mom around I get anxious and uncertain. That’s why I stopped going to school. Crippling anxiety. 

She doesn’t let me start driving, when all of my peers have already started. She isolated me from my friends. I’ve never had a single sleepover, I rarely hung out with friends. If I tried her stipulations would be ridiculous, i.e. meet and contact with MY friend AND friend’s parent, location and hourly updates, no cars aside from hers, no later than 8pm.

I’m that one kid who’s mom is overprotective and won’t let them go anywhere. That’s me. I have no friends because she suddenly moved me to a “Christian private school” where I got bullied because they were racist. I still don’t have a phone. I’m 15, I use a shared iPad, which I found spyware on. 

She keeps track of my menstrual cycle on her phone and feels the need to announce it to everyone. As you can imagine...I’m left infuriated. If I’m in the restroom she will abruptly open the door, stare at me, ask me what I’m doing, and if it’s nothing too exciting she’ll leave. She’ll do the same in the privacy of my own room. By the way, she deliberately broke all the locks on the doors with the exception of her room...how convenient for her...? She came in my room when I was changing, I told her about boundaries and privacy, she laughs and leaves the room. A few minutes later she walks in nonchalantly asking if I want to watch tv with her. No sense of boundaries whatsoever. She makes herself out as the victim. I don’t understand her or her motives.

My mental health issues have worsened significantly. My mother continues to invalidate me, and do all the above and more. I have put myself in hundreds of “risky situations” since I was 11-15, even getting traumatically raped twice, but it was like I was so low I didn’t even care. I self harm. I feel like I have no control whatsoever and I don’t know what to do. I’m only 15 and this is what’s so frustrating. She’s debilitating me. I’m afraid the detrimental effects of her parenting will only get worse if I don’t escape. 

To this day I ruminate on past events and it leaves me angry, hateful, and suicidal. I can’t let go of any of this. I don’t know what to do. I don’t function at an expected/age-appropriate level. It’s not like I can just wait until I’m 18 and move out because with my vast lack of life experience and complete dependence on another person I wouldn’t even know where to start. I’m feeling hopeless. There’s no way I can get out of this situation. I don’t know what to do.",09Jul2020,1

390,"I feel like having money is becoming too important for me? I used to not care about having a lot... but as I've grown up, I've seen situations that people end up in when they live in poverty and I never, ever, want to have to worry about how I am going to pay for my next meal or if I am going to be able to make rent. So I have been saving as much as I can so that when I need to, I will be okay. I have made career plans into a field that will make me good money. However, when I tell people this, they have called me selfish.. and I am worried I am focusing on the money aspect too much... I don't want to be money hungry by any means, I just want to be comfortable and not have to worry about it, you know? So, I guess I'm asking two things:

1) Does what I said come across as money hungry and selfish?

2) How can I work on myself to not be as worried about it.. like. How can I make myself chill over it?

391,"
I think I have some identity issues and I don't really know how to tell about them, so what I'm going to say isn't really well organized or coherent.

So I have a best friend who I really really like and care about. My identity issues I think comes in me liking his personality so much that I start acting like him, I don't know how to be myself or if that's myself, but doesn't matter if I'm trying to be like him or trying to be “myself”, he always gets what I want, and I don't know if that's a little egotistical to want, probably.

We both like the same things, but he has a way more insight in those things than I do, and people consider him very smart and he's like a class celebrity, he's very charming and charismatic to everyone, and I don't know about myself, I feel like I'm so bland.

College is on 2 years, I don't really care about high school reputation. But I'd like to be like him in college, by that I mean a more charismatic and charming person, I don't know if it's too selfish to wish to be popular, I don't have sex in mind, I just want to inspire everyone and be friends with everyone, I don't know if I want this because it would massage my ego, but I just hate how I'm at school right now, just really hate it.

I don't know what to do, how to act about this, what's the issue and what's right, I'd really like some insight in what I should do, I'm sorry I explained this kind of terribly, today has been a horrible day and I have just been pondering this question all day.",09Jul2020,1

393,"So long story short me(19m) and my fiance (19f) are what you might call so in love that it hurts, we spend all our time (and I mean ALL of our time) together and when people tell us we're moving too fast (haven't been together for a year and I'm her first bf) we laugh and say we don't care we love each other. Our communication with each other is 9/10 and we tell each other everything the only time it's not perfect is when one of us misunderstood what the other is saying, but there's a downfall to this peace and happiness of mine, whenever there is a slight change in the usual mood or emotional routine I get worried and insecure. (I'm a bit clingy and possesive and she is as well so there's normally no complaint on either side because we both only want each other) it's hard to explain, but for example we're in bed in bed right now after a little intimacy and we're not cuddling (we always cuddle after) in fact her back is facing towards me and it could be my imagination but Im convinced she just silenced her phone, both of these are huge red flags for me by the way. I don't want to believe she's cheating but I have trust issues from the past and I've noticed in past relationships that I didn't pay attention to the signs at the time or didn't want to, admittedly she's been a little disconnected and distant recently but we've had a busy two weeks and I figured she's just in her thoughts now that we have time to think. It's most likely not an infidelity issue but my other concern is she's been unhappy lately and I need advice on what I should do before it becomes one.(sorry for the long read:)

PS, if she's cheating it can't be too hard to cover it up, I tell her everything including how she's been acting lately and I could easily and unknowingly tell her she's showing signs of cheating and I wouldn't have a clue.

394,"# Here's a quick few facts about me : 

1. ***I am 22 years old and I live with my mom and dad. I am the only child they have.***
2. ***I started university a little later than most people my age. I always regret that.*** 
3. ***I am currently pursuing a bachelors degree. I am in my final year now and this time next year I will graduate.*** 
4. ***My parents have a business that I have no interest or passion to help with. I have my own personal ambitions but no motivation to achieve them because I get most of what I ask for.***

The issue is my parents don't believe in me. When I leave home, my friends believe that I'm so fortunate, I have almost everything I ask for while their lives are actually hard. I'm constantly arguing with my parents because they force me to enter their business. When we go out on family gatherings, they always bring up the fact that they are worried about where I will get in life because I sit home some days and I don't do much but I know that this is temporary and at some point, I will find what I love to do and make a living. 

Mom is always ashamed of my achievements, rather than praising me for my good performance in academics, they are only concerned about the fact that currently, I'm not independent. I don't do many things by myself and they constantly tell me today you're at your own house but when you're married, what will you do? How will you survive?

Currently, I have finished my second year about to go into my final year and I have some free time but I recently lost my best friend to suicide, I've been through some sort of a really traumatising experience with friends and I want time to process everything and then begin thinking about work. My parents don't seem to understand this and every time I ask them to give me time, they instead taunt me on how I am not responsible and one day all the luxury I have will go away if I choose to just sit at home this way. 

I do have some goals for myself and slowly but steadily I am working towards them. My passion lies in languages and communication. I initially started to give home tuitions for French and make money that way. During this time, my parents were happy and did not coax me towards joining their business but deep down they have an expectation for me to join and help them at work. Due to the pandemic, these lessons I gave have stopped and now I am just home doing nothing according to them other than the required studies. 

Here are things I would like to do 

* I love to write, I want to work in this field 
* I would love to get my work published but I don't know how to. 
* I want to work for the United Nations as a translator- I speak French, English
* I want to teach/ do something relating to communication/writing

That's all I know are my strengths and I definitely want to do something that links these things but I don't have a specific job/internship in mind. 

I have worked and had experienced in the past. I have done two internships one linked to social media marketing and copywriting and another linked to events management for a month and also a short two-week work experience at a content writing firm alongside teaching primary students at my home. 

I'm currently pursuing a bachelors degree of arts in media and communication. As far as my passion for languages. I have finished my French fluency exams by the Alliance Francaise the DELF B2, I'm working towards the C1 level. I will write it this year. I just feel like with enough academic commitments, getting a job or working won't help me perform well in college instead, it will just make my life more difficult but my parents don't understand that. How do I explain to them my situation?

Some days are lazy, I do study but I don't have the drive to work especially when my parents taunt me and forcefully try to take me to their workplace. Its a family business so, therefore, the expectation. I get it but they don't see my side of the story. All they are concerned about is how I have to become independent and financially self-sufficient. 

I want my parents to be proud of me but I don't know-how. I have tried to go and interfere with the family business but unfortunately, it does not interest me much, because I would rather do what inspires me or what I am passionate about than just help them but they fail to understand that.

My parents think that all of what I have done is not enough. How do I get them to not force me into their business? I have gone there but it's not my field of interest but they see it as me pushing myself away from important responsibilities?  How do I make them confident of who I am?

They constantly compare me to other young adults my age who help their parents or are either working or doing something by themselves. This has really brought me down and is half the reason why I don't choose to do anything much with life. I want to achieve my goals but if people constantly compare my progress journey to their own, it gets toxic and I don't feel like working at all. 

I agree, I also lose interest in things quickly, as in I would not know in how long am I bored of doing a particular job. I 'll do it for a while and then just get back to procrastinating every day. 

I know what they say is for my benefit in the long term but I wish they understood that I need time to find what I like to do as well. I'm still soul searching. I'm still trying to find something that I'm most passionate about that I can do for a living but they don't see this as being important. 

In my eyes, if I am currently studying and pursuing my bachelor's degree, I shouldn't have the pressure to work simultaneously. I feel as if I can do only one thing at a time but they see that as a weakness.  I promised them that once my degree gets over I will work and do something to earn and feed myself at least but they just focus on how at this moment, I am not doing anything productive. According to them, I'm lazy, demotivated and not yet self-independent. 

***I know this is contrary to most people who by 22 find and create a career for themselves but is it wrong to take time to find yourself?*** 

***How do I manage this situation and build their trust in the fact that one day sooner or later I will be earning and feeding myself and them too?*** 

***How do I start working and doing something without having enough experience in the field of writing?***",09Jul2020,1

My problem is that she constantly wants to be around me and if not she's either sad or hurt if I say I don't want right now. If we are not physically together she would love to have constant contact e.g (texting, calling).

406,"During the week, my boyfriend works 8 hr shifts starting at 8am, and I work 10 hr shifts starting at 2:30pm. My job is only for the summer, so I will be done with it after August. After work, I go to my boyfriend’s apartment because it is very close to my work and I don’t have a car. During the week, I only get to see my boyfriend for a little bit after work before he falls asleep. However, me coming to his house late at night wakes him up, and then he cannot fall asleep for the rest of the night even if I sleep in a different room. I told him I can take a lyft to my own house after work, but then we will not see eachother at all during the week. My boyfriend wants me to switch to an earlier shift at work, however, I really don’t want to because I enjoy my job the way it is now and I don’t like the people or the environment of the earlier shift. I’m also only going to be working for probably 6 more weeks. What should we do? Am I too stubborn by not changing to an earlier shift? We don’t want to not be able to see eachother either.

408,"I am 18 years old, female btw. I know I am young but I feel like life is useless and I can't seem to be happy or whatever I am supposed to do solely because I exist. I don't think I have a terrible life, that would be a complete lie. Sorry if I sound overly negative but that's just the way I see the world now that I've opened my eyes. 

There's so many injustices in this world: corruption, diseases, rape, mass killings, racism, bullying, abductions, poverty, pedophilia, famine, people dying in horrible ways, fraud, medical negligence, discrimination, terrorism, sexual harrasment I could literally make an infinite list.

There are so many terrible things that never come to light and it terrifies me because I feel so powerless.

On top of that I don't think my life is fun at all? I've never had a meaningful friend to count on. People always treat me like their ""side friend"" when no one else is available. 

When I was little I had so much expectations for my life. I thought I would be some happy person with a bunch of friends, a boyfriend, someone who knew how to function like a normal adult.

None of that has happenned. I've tried my best to improve my life but I have not succeed, there are things I enjoy to do and things I aspire to be but I don't really see myself completing any of them.

I don't know if there's something I can do to change this ugly perspective I have of everything. I know life is never going to be perfect and bad things are not going to magically stop ocurring. But I shouldn't be wasting my time focusing on the negative, how does everyone do it?",09Jul2020,1

411,"Apologies if this doesn’t seem to fit the subreddit, I just wanted to genuinely get some thoughts on this. 

I’m 23 (female) and this happened when I was a 16 year old in high school. I’d never told anyone all of the details, but after 7 years recently told a male friend of mine and he not only was disgusted, but genuinely angry for me. I was caught off guard by the reaction and wanted to see what others thought.

The guy in high school was my best friend, we’ll call him Brett. Brett expressed feelings for me and I told him I didn’t feel the same way. He didn’t take this well and constantly brought it up and got angry with me for not returning the feelings, and would make sexual comments about me.

We had a mutual friend, we’ll call her Alice. Brett and Alice would constantly roughhouse with me at school. I would generally laugh when they started doing this, but got upset when it was too much, which angered them. 
The two would try to put me in trash cans, and shove me into walls to the point of it being too hard, in the name of fun. Mind you I was 5’7”, but very thin. 

Brett however took things further, by constantly kicking me IN the ass. Literally. To the point where he was actually injuring me. I asked him to stop all the time, I tried to have serious conversations with him and he said he would stop but continued. He would push me into a corner and pretend to grind on me (using his leg) and say “you gotta get your money’s worth.” I would uncomfortably laugh and try to move away. Our friend Alice witnessed and laughed at all of this. Brett constantly touched me (just to annoy me) even when I said to stop.
He was not like this all the time which was why we remained friends.

 One day when we were at Alice’s house I was laying on my stomach on the floor playing with her new kitten. Brett laid on top of me on his back, which startled me because that kind of contact was not normal and he was heavy. He was wearing thin shorts (if you get what I’m implying..) I panicked and told him to get off. He didn’t and I managed to roll out from underneath him. Alice didn’t think it was weird, I immediately messaged a female friend when I got home and she wasn’t fazed either. That one incident in particular made me feel sick to my stomach for weeks. 

I ended the friendship because he wouldn’t stop texting me about rejecting him. He reached out years later trying to be friends again, and said that he knew his behavior towards me was wrong but he was not capable of apologizing. I blocked the number. 

I understand that 16 year olds make stupid jokes and do stupid things. Shoving each other around is fine, but actually telling the story I find myself repeating how often I said “no” or “stop.” 

This is a sensitive subject, but I’d like to know what people think. Was this sexual harassment? Harassment in general? What would *you* have done in this situation? I’m an adult now and would never allow someone to do any of these things. However it really does bother me that it’s hard from my perspective to tell HOW bad this was. I also have to wonder the lasting impact this could have on someone. Getting older I realize being treated that way and brushing it off may still have lasting effects.

412,"Last night I broke up with my girlfriend, and immediately regretted it and took it back...
We've been together for 3 months. I did it because we have some differences about work. I work a lot and it takes up a lot of my time. We wanted to figure it out, but then I took a job that means we're gonna spend less time together the next two months. I thought she was gonna dump me. I always have a hard time trusting people. Don't have any close friends, I barely see my parents. Never let anybody close except her. The thought of her rejecting me scared me and I acted impulsively. I'm going into therapy. Not just to fix this (don't know if we can), but because I need help. 
Im seeing her today. We talked a lot yesterday. Obviously she doesn't know if she can trust me again or if she wants to try again. I don't know what advice I'm looking for here. I guess I need help talking to her. It shouldn't be just about me and my problem, but about how she feels regardless of what she decides to do.

416,"For context,  I’ve been dating my girlfriend for 9 months now, and we’ve been living, and doing everything happily together for the past 8 months. 

We’re both students studying in a foreign country, so we stayed there during the whole thing where everything was basically normal. 

She’s very close to her family, so I’ve video chatted, as well as met some of them before, so I’m not really worried about that. However, her friends are a different story. 

I am a couple years older than her and took a few years before starting uni , so i went through the whole process of weeding out my social circle after highscool, i mostly hung out with people older than me; most of whom have graduated by now. So i was surrounded by a certain level of maturity that i try to adhere by in my other circles as well.

Her friends, from what i heard*(from her, seeing group chats, and talking to some of them)* on the other hand are like a group of 12-14 people that haven’t matured much past 17 and many have classic high school movie shit kind of attitude. It’s really frustrating for me that i have to go deal with that for the entire time i will be there. 

Add to that, her ‘ex-fuck buddy’ whom was apparently very manipulative, and would only mess with her for his own pleasure (Literally never made her orgasm) is also part of the group, and he’ll apparently be there often, i was also told he was ‘touchy’. Like, what the absolute f***! I’m supposed to interact with a guy i already hate without meeting, and I’m expected to be okay with it? 

I am not a fan of big groups of people, loud music, or getting wasted as a ‘fun’ activity. So I’m really anxious, and i don’t know how to deal with that. I don’t know what to do? I don’t want to disappoint my girlfriend because i really love her, and i want to make this trip fun for her. 

Just everything is overwhelming, and i really don’t know how i will deal it yet.",09Jul2020,1
417,"On mobile.

I (19f) have been living with my mom, stepdad and siblings in the same house for over 12 years. I have Autism and ADHD, and I've been diagnosed with depression and am in therapy for it.

My mom and stepdad have been treating me badly for years. Constantly screaming at me and acting like I'm worthless, yelling at me that I'm acting like a child, hitting me, and only ever really talking to me to whine at me that I have to clean my room/do my laundry/cook/do other chores, or to ask every hour if I found a job already. They're the main cause of my depression and suicidal thoughts.

Because of the constant cycle I'm in with my depression I was generally unmotivated to do much, but thanks to the help I'm getting I've been breaking out of the cycle every once in a while to get things together or clean my room and get some work done with getting into college and other adulting that needs to be done at my age. It's still hard to motivate myself though.

Through my therapist I've managed to get in contact with a few people, and I can move out this Monday, to a sort of accompanied housing. It's a big building where you technically live alone as an adult, but you're with a group of other youth and with people specialized in guiding young adults with finances and such. 

Today, I set my alarm at 8am, opposed to the usual 1pm I manage to get myself out of bed, and listed what I wanted to get done today to prepare for Monday, mostly laundry and my own dishes. I went downstairs to have something to eat before I got started, and my mom was instantly on my neck with ""are you fiiinally going to do your laundry? are you fiiiinally going to stop being so lazy?"" and all of my motivation went right out of the window. I instantly didn't want to do anything anymore and just curl up into a ball and sleep. 

I said, ""If you keep telling me to do things when I'm already planning to, I'm not motivated to do them anymore."" to try to explain that her asking me all the time had the opposite effect, but she got mad and told me to ""stop being childish, if you're not gonna do anything like usual I'll do the rest of the laundry then"" which is four or five baskets, so I probably can't get mine done today anymore. 

I just don't want to do anything anymore. I don't want to do the laundry or dishes like I planned and set my alarm for, I don't want to take down my posters or start packing. I just want to play videogames or sleep through the entire day so I don't have to see my mom or stepdad and have a day to myself without them breathing into my neck. I'm just so done and I'm sad I don't want to do it anymore, I just want to get going and get shit done so I can move out already and be done with them but I can't move a muscle to get to work and I'm just sad and angry and crying and I want to hit someone for feeling like this over basically nothing.

How can I get myself motivated to fucking do something? I have 10 hours to get shit done today but I know that if I start lazing now I'll never get to it and I'll be even more stressed about the time limit I have and eventually I'll blow up and have a panic attack over this, and my therapist is on holiday and can't help.

I do also live a healthy life: I’m on a diet, I workout daily, and I study things that have nothing to do with my school just because I’m really interested in them (psychology, piano, philosophy). 


But I am not entirely alone; I have a friend I hang out with often, at the park or at my house, but nothing more, and apparently for my family this isn’t enough. 


I spent the last years of my life crying about the fact that I was just a loser, that I was and I had no one, at the point that I started cutting myself and I also had suicidal thoughts.


That’s the past. Since the first days of June, I radically changed. I started accepting and appreciating myself for who I am. I decided that I shall only do things that I like and enjoy, and I found an internal peace. 
I was finally really happy. 


But here’s the thing: my whole family started telling me that I should live more. That I should go out more with lots of people, and go at the swimming pool or at the disco. They also told me that “teen-hood” is the best time in one’s life, and that I’m not enjoying it enough. That I should do as they did, and being more social. 
I tried to talk to them about this, saying that I’m happy with my life and with who I am, but they either don’t want to listen or get angry at me. 


What should I do? I finally found internal peace with myself, and now my whole family wants to destroy it? Can’t I just be happy?

424,"Hi, I'll start off by saying a brief rundown of the situation before giving any real details. Essentially, I broke up with my girlfriend (Lets call her H) because the relationship didn't seem to be working out. Not to long after, about a month or so, a close friend and I hit it off really good (Lets call he E). Now I thought that I would be over H by now but I really am not.... I still love her. But now E and I are practically in a secret relationship, which I feel really guilty for being in. But I also am in love with E and I dont know what to do. 

A round January, I broke up with my girlfriend of 6 years. Unfortunately, after a long while, I felt as if the relationship had not been working because I have been ultimately unhappy. I never spent any time to really grow as my own person. H also never made me feel accepted for who I was, she really only made me feel accepted for the things I did, not who I am. I devoted so much time into making H happy, making sure that the relationship was financially stable and the relationship was always on the ""up and up"". Now, those are really the only real negatives off the top of my head, there were obviously really good things that came from us. We practically set up a whole future together. She was there when I needed her in tough times like when my parents kicked me out, or when I had family members pass away. We had done a long distance relationship for 2 years when I lived up in Maine for schooling. She was there for me and I still love her. After this break up, I think it has opened her eyes to the things that we have done and the things i need too.

About a month passes since the break up. Im spending time with a close friend E (who I never really had any romantic feelings towards until things started to unfold) and inopen up to her. She then kisses me and admits her feelings towards me. Her and I start forming a romantic relationship without anyone's knowledge. The thing about E is that she has been in alot of really bad relationships. She has gone through alot of trauma where she was debating giving up on love in general. But then her and i got close and she says that she feels safe and secure with me. Like as if love is a real thing that she can actually have and that really means alot to me. She has always tried to understand me and see things through my point of view. The fact that she has been willing to put faith in loving me, when she was practically giving up on it, and to understand who I am has gotten me to fall in love with her. Now there are downsides to all of this as well. She is very doubtful of me and filled with paranoia due to her previous trauma (which i understand and dont hold it against her). She is very ""fiesty"" and when she is mad, literally anything could happen between us. I worry that this relationship will end up becoming me pampering her and giving her what she wants without consideration towards me.

The big issue now is that I am conflicted now. I really miss H, she was my better half for the majority of our relationship. She has been there for me through my toughest times. She still loves me and she now recognizes and understands what failed about us. I love her still. On the other hand though, I am in love with E as well. I havent felt this accepted before in my life. Alot of my life has been expectations and judgemet by my family and now I feel like things aren't like that with her. She entrusted her heart to me and that means so much. Working on myself is still an option that I hope both of them would respect. 

For H, I just dont want to continue to break her heart and I want to be there for her still and with all of our history. I dont wanna just throw that away. She seems to now understand what happened and where things fell apart too. Maybe things could work.
For E, I also don't want to break her heart, especially after how hard she wants us to work, that she gave a chance at love after being broken and abused for so long. I dont wanna give up on her either when she makes me feel like i matter.

I dont know if I should choose a girl (as much as i hate to say that because i dont want any of them to feel ""optional""). I dont know if i should step away from dating so that i can work on myself. What should I do or at least, where should I start when trying to come up with a conclusion?",09Jul2020,1

428,"So I'm friends with this guy with has shown quite some anxious-preoccupied traits when he told me about his past relationships -- ranging from being called as clingy by his ex, constantly worrying about whether the person he likes likes him back, relatively low self-esteem, etc.

*A little background:* we have known each other for around 5 months and had been texting almost daily for 3-4 months ever since I've returned to my home city. So basically it's a long-distance friendship.

As an introverted person who is generally dismissive-avoidant, I feel mostly overwhelmed whenever I have to respond to his texts the first thing in the morning because they consist mostly of memes or small talk material. One important anecdote, I once admitted to him that I don't really know how to respond to his memes and he assured me that I don't need to feel obligated to do so. HOWEVER, the fact that he still sends me more after I left him on seen (which is seldom) makes me feel *pressured, overwhelmed, and guilty*. I am also guilty for seldom taking the initiative to text, but really, I only do so because I want some space... and I don't really want to get too attached/ used to this frequency of communication since I can foresee that he won't go texting me every day anymore after the quarantine or after entering a relationship (or is this over-pessimism?), but this is the secondary issue.

Also, I don't feel particularly comfortable opening up to him, given that I don't want to mislead him into thinking that there's a possibility of romance between us. (I know that it's possible to open up in a platonic sense; [my other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/h8vmri/my_friend_23m_assured_me_21f_previously_he_isnt/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) might explain my worry.) Last week, we had a great few hours of deep talk but I'm scared of doing it again because since then he has been a bit more attached and stuff?

In comparison, I have a few other friends who are more on the secure side and I don't have big problems opening up to them, just that it takes a little bit more time. Plus, I think I have improved a bit by voicing out my then-incomprehensible feelings to my friend instead of running away.

Now I think about this new friend that I have, I think setting up boundaries is in order, but I remain a bit unsure if I'm overreacting and don't know how to do so without appearing rude. Very early on in our daily texting, I felt suffocated by the frequency of texting so much so that I had to take a few-day break (I told him I need to go on hermit mode, he said he understands and didn't text me anymore until I initiate). Maybe I should do this again, but be more explicit about my feelings towards our dynamics...

Honestly, though I oftentimes feel annoyed and tired dealing with him, having learned that he might be anxious-preoccupied makes me sympathize with him more and want to help him because this surely isn't only affecting our friendship but also his romantic life. I really believe that we can bond emotionally and intellectually as friends, just that the way he behaves makes me back off in fear every now and then.

So the main question is, how should I segue into talking about this issue without making it awkward and insensitive? Like he mentioned several times he craves human interaction since he can't go out with his friends in this lockdown so I think it'd been a bit unfeeling to tell him we don't really need to text every day?

431,"I wrote this as a reply to a post that got deleted, so I thought I could post it on here.

I relate a lot to what you said. I feel like I didn't spend my teenage years well and I missed out on so much fun and experiences. I'm only 19 for another 6.5ish months and I keep asking myself what I can do to make the time count. Now that college is online and things have changed a lot during this pandemic, I still have hope that I'll be able to make more friends and enjoy the time I have left. I made a list of goals and I add to it whenever I think of anything new. I saw a video about a speaker who influenced someone to write down 100 goals and when the met again 10 years in the future, the guy had completed everything compared to those who didn't write them down. you never know, so make a list of things both short and long-term and maybe this could change your life. Keep your head up and know that life won't be like this forever. Everything happens for a reason and good things and changes take time. instead of focusing on the negative things that can't be fixed right now, think of everything you're grateful for and write it down as a reminder. You're alive right now for a reason and you have a purpose. You'll figure things out eventually and everyone has their own path, so there's no rush. I hope this helps and that you have a good night :)",09Jul2020,1
432,"Me and my boyfriend have had lots of ups and downs in our lives. Our history can be summed up as meeting, having drama, taking a break, reconciling, dating, breaking up, taking a break, reconciling again, then getting back together. I was very thankful about where we had ended up, and I think I still stand by that now. Today, he came to me and basically admitted to being attracted to children in the past. He didn't really expand on much, as he felt it was just something he had to get off his chest. He said he felt awful and disgusting, and that he really needed to get help because he didn't want to hurt anyone. I comforted him because he was feeling suicidal, and I could tell he had never opened up to anyone as much as he had to me in that conversation. I'm still in a relationship with him because I do still think he's a good person willing to make good choices to be better, and that I can trust him to make good decisions. Based off of what he had been telling me in regards to his mental state, I came to the conclusion that because of feelings of loneliness, isolation, and lack of intimacy, his brain had resorted to an extreme measure of seeking pleasure and satisfaction, and therefore turned to something that it thought could satisfy those urges. (There was a thread about this on a porn addiction sub here!) I was able to come to this conclusion because he said that he had never felt the attraction was ongoing and only when he was desperately horny (which was not very often.) My concerns, however, are very high. I have an 11 year old sister and the thought of her being targeted or something happening to her would destroy me. I trust my boyfriend enough that he would never do anything like that, but the concern is still in the back of my head, screaming loudly at me. I love my sister very much and I would feel absolutely horrible if I indirectly let anything bad happen to her. My other concern is that my boyfriend may not be able to afford professional help, therapy or counseling, and he may try to treat himself which I know will put him in immense stress. I'm trying to offer him any help I can, and I'm willing to work through things to get us both through a tough time. He has brought me a lot of joy and happiness and I'd rather work through hardships than drop everything, but if any of you could give me advice on this I'd appreciate it :) thank you!",09Jul2020,1

I really am not sure why I am like this but I’ve always cried really easily.

But then I’m so embarrassed by crying that I keep crying I guess and it’s really hard to stop and impossible to hold back tears at all. How do I stop doing this or at least develop a thicker skin? Do I just ask people to honestly and bluntly insult me or talk to me honestly about my flaws? I feel like my friends walk on eggshells around me because they don’t want to upset me and I know it’s really unfair to them.

440,"First time posting here, I don't know how to format so that's a warning. And a trigger warning for those who might need it. 

A little backstory. 

In the past few years I've started having suicidal thoughts and I've been getting some sensitivities with my senses (can't eat certain food because of texture and getting really worked up over the sounds people make when they eat). I've tried doing stuff to get better and tried talking with my parents  about it but to me it just seems like they don't care anymore. And late at night if I'm not distracted i start to think depressing and suicidal thoughts. My therapist hasn't said out right to me that I'm depressed so technically I'm not clinically depressed. any who onto the story.

This is gonna be a long one.

So, I was leaving the doctors with my mum and we decided to get fries and a chocolate sundae from Mc Donalds, and because we live near a lake, we thought why don't we stop by the lake and eat. Between the drive from maccas to the lake, My mum was trying to talk to me about trying some calming stuff at night to help me sleep (she kept on suggesting stuff that i had already tried) and I was trying to tell her that the stuff doesn't work with me. She started yelling and getting aggravated. eventually we made it to the lake. 

After eating, shiz hit the fan.

My mum kept trying to tell me to try the calming stuff and she wasn't listening to me when I was telling her that the stuff didn't work. I'm a bit sensitive to yelling so i was on the verge of tears. I told her ""Can we please go home I don't want to continue this conversation anymore"" and her response was ""No. We're not leaving until we talk about this!"". At this point I was crying.  Next, I threatened to get out the car by taking my seat belt off and reaching for the handle. then she yelled at me ""Don't you dare leave this car!"". so I decided well fine, but only if we go home. so once again through tears i begged her if we could just go home because I wasn't feeling safe anymore, and I was getting more scared. She said ""no."". So I did it. I got out the car. as I stepped out she grabbed my school blazer trying to prevent me form leaving, I kept walking and walked onto the path and started trying to run away, back home. My mum pulled the car around and got out and started speed walking after me. fast forward a little bit  after running through some suburbs. We came to a grassed area and there were some shopping trolleys, my mum had gained on me and so I got behind a shopping trolley, holding the handle begging my mother to ""Leave me alone! I don't feel safe anymore!"" and I was still crying. Of course, she didn't let me go and instead she started shouting at me like i was a crazy animal. She was yelling at me the same way she yells at my dog when she does something wrong. She tried cutting me off and I pushed past her and kept walking. after walking for awhile I came to a main road. up ahead there was a path that would have looped back around to my mum's car. my mum yelled at me ""If you turn left and go back to the car I'll stop talking and we'll go home. I still didn't feel safe being alone in a car with her. So I kept walking and then mum yelled at me to give her my phone to call my dad to pick me up. I gave her my phone and she called dad and I waited for 5 agonizing minutes while i waited for my dad to come pick me up. 

When I got back home.

Because mum had to walk back to her car from where she was she would take longer and because my legs hurt i decided to have a bath, but because mum had threatened me whilst she was walking behind me I didn't feel safe when she would come back home. So I decided that if she tried doing anything to me while i was in the bath i would threaten to hurt myself so I grabbed a knife and hopped in the tub. 

When mum got home she didn't say much to me other than ""Don't you DARE leave YOUR washing on MY floor."" So, because i was sad anyways i ended doing some self harm while i was in the bath, and i tried cutting my left wrist but the knife was too blunt. so After I got out the bath and into my room mum had turned off the internet and hadn't given me my phone back. remember how i mentioned about thinking dark and depressing thoughts when I'm alone. Yeah well i had told my mum about it and she was purposefully doing this so id be sad and suffer, and she got what she wanted i sad in my room scraping my arms and thighs using a metal ruler. 

The next day.

I had school and I leave early in the morning so when I was ready to go and asked mum for my phone back, she said ""I'll look for it if i have the time, but I don't think i should give it back until you apologize to me for what you did"" 

Any who its been a week since then and she hasn't been treating me like her daughter and i am feeling like she doesn't love me anymore because of what happened and I'm still upset about the situation. I don't know if I'm in the wrong. I don't know what I should do next. That's where I could use some advice as what to do, also feel free to ask any questions about the situation.",09Jul2020,1

So I'm 23F (also disabled) and currently living with my mother and my younger siblings. 

I planned to go apartment hunting in February/March but I've only seen two before the corona stuff happened. 

On Monday I was looking at a new apartment  that was a 2 hour train ride away from my family but otherwise at a great location. 
Still inside the city but not directly in the center. 

The location is the only good part though. 

The whole apartment is rather old and looks really cheap and worn down and I'd have to share it with a stranger. 
Also the other people living in the house seemed rather weird (I've seen 3 out of 7 residents) 

Granted, it is actually cheap and I could afford living there easily, but I'm not really sure. 

My social worker (not sure if that's the right word for him) called me today and said I have to decide until noon today (which is in like 4 hours) if I want to move in next week. 

I don't like pressure at all and I'm not really happy with the apartment, but I doubt I'd find a better location that cheap ever again. 

My mum says I can stay at hers for a few months later and leaves it up to me if I want to leave or not, but I'm so torn. 

I'd love to live alone but I didn't feel comfortable in the apartment too, especially since I'd have to move next week. 
But I know I don't have the money to afford my dream flat in the next years either. 


I know its my decision but since I've never actually lived alone or done apartment hunting I could use some advice.",09Jul2020,1

449,"CONTEXT:

I have feelings for a girl I've known since childhood. A year ago she showed a lot of interest to the point of getting into bed with me, but I didn't make a move for two reasons:

1. We were both intoxicated (Had a house party for my birthday)

2. She is my friend's sister...

Since I've always liked her it felt good when it seemed that actually she had an interest in me, but it didn't feel as great when I found out later about her promiscious behaviour with loads of different men...

THE STORY:

About a month ago, she told me about her pictures getting leaked online and the account that was doing it. I messaged her throughout to comfort her while she called the cops to get the account removed, she confided in me first as she didn't want to tell her parents because they are super strict. I promised her I wouldn't tell anyone about it, especially not her brother as I can't even imagine how this event must have felt to her, the last thing she's want is family members finding out.

A few weeks later I tried to keep a convo going with her, but she went back to her usual bluntness and just leaving me on read. It shouldn't really bother me, but it did and I hated that, however, a few days afterward she posts a story on her snapchat posing her body in a sexual way...

 This made me pretty angry so I decided to just stop watching her stories all together because I just got sick and tired of always just guessing what she thought of me and maybe that I should just stop trying to get close to her. I didn't view any of her snap stories since.

Turns out this may have really bothered her? She has stopped viewing mine now and my friend showed me some tweets she re-tweeted that go along the lines of ""Fuck begging for anyone's attention"". It's pretty hypocritical on her end if that's about me concidering the 'suggestive' stories she posts.

Ok so what do you guys think - was refusing to acknowledge her a bad move, do you think i've really pissed her off?

I don't want to hurt her in any way shape or form, but I feel like I care about what she thinks of me too much and it's pathetic, given all of her behaviour maybe I should stop trying to pursue her and just try to be friends with her?",09Jul2020,1
450,"I have bad social anxiety and depression issues every time I have to go there. Going to school saps the literal life out of me, not in a satirical, joking matter but in the context of: ""By the end of the day, I'm wanting to die""

Its mostly due to the people that are in my classes. I just always stress myself out and overthink the fuck out of everything. I think that they talk shit behind my back, I think that they don't like me, I think they only talk to me because they look down on me, I have the mindset of: everyone hates me and is trying to make fun of me.

I know that this is a terrible, terrible way of thinking but based on what I've seen people do and say to me, I just feel its like that. I get the feeling that my thoughts about these people are true, its hard to convince myself otherwise. 

I'm basically saying that I'm devoid of any form of happiness when it comes to being in a school environment. 

I've done some bad stuff in the past to people, raging at them, getting into fist fights and more. Its lead me down a path of just sadness. I want to ask my parents to allow me to study at home.

452,"Hi this is my first post so please go easy on me. I also wasn't sure whether to post this here or r/legaladvice but here goes. This morning, I found out my mom had her hurt her arm. I was a little worried but I thought it wasn't anything major since she was still able to move it and hold stuff fine. Plus, I had an interview for an internship that same day and to be honest, my mind was more focused on that. I was preparing for my interview when she left for the hospital on her own (I'm pretty sure she left with her friend). 

Later that day, I come back from my interview. My stepdad comes to see me to talk to me about my interview. I thought it was a little weird that he didn't send my mom to the hospital. He leaves the house and goes to what I presume was work. A bit later, my grandma calls all worried. She asks me what happened to my mom to which I told her I had no idea and would ask her when she gets back from the hospital. She says okay and hangs up. A few hours later, my mom comes home and she looks upset. I ask her what's wrong and she cries immediately. I follow her up and my sister comes too, asking her what's wrong before she has a complete breakdown and starts crying loudly. I start to get really worried at this point and wonder what's going on. Soon, my stepdad comes back. My stepbrother asks him what happened to my mom's arm to which he replies ""I'm not sure buddy"" while looking away from him and the rest of my siblings (there's the four of us, I'm the eldest). He walks out of the room. My grandfather starts calling my mom and she starts moving to the bathroom to speak to them in a different language (all of us are bilingual).

Later, my mom tells me she got into a fight with my stepdad. Apparently my stepdad strangled my mom with both his arms and somehow fractured my mom's elbow. I start to feel a mix of emotions; anger, frustration, fear and sadness all at once. I told her this is highly unacceptable behaviour. She agrees and tells me he apparently went out actually to speak to one of his friends who's a lawyer to get protection while also filing a police report (?). Also, the police detective wants to speak to my mom but she says she's too tired to speak to her today. She says she'll speak to her if she insists. She says that she wants to get a divorce and that my stepdad has his good qualities but also his bad qualities. Right now, my stepdad is speaking to my mom privately.

Anyway, this isn't to say this is the first time this has happened. My stepdad and mom also got into a big fight 2-3 years ago, in which they were fighting for my stepbrother (who was 1-2 Y/O) in which I literally had to break them up physically and take my stepbrother and my siblings to my room to protect them. After that fight, my stepdad mentioned to all of us he would never get that angry again and begged us to forgive him. Furthermore, my stepdad and mom got into a huge argument earlier this year- my stepdad lied to my mom about having a job and was actually unemployed. He even went so far as to say he got a promotion. That's when my mom kicked him out of the house and told him to sort his personal problems out. One day, my mom gets really drunk with my stepdad and suddenly the next day, he moves back into the house. Following this, the next week we all end up going on vacation to an island (we live in Malaysia, the no. of cases are really low). 

Now this isn't to say my stepdad is always like this- he is actually a really nice person and has helped me out a ton in the past. We've had a lot of fun moments together and we get along well. It's just these weird rages that he has that make him seem like a monster.

Long story short, I don't exactly know what to do. I've cried and am scared what to tell my siblings or my birth dad or anyone really. I could really use some advice or simply some emotional support at the moment. Nonetheless, I'll be glad if anyone could read this and help me out. I'm also sorry if I've rambled on too much. I just felt like I needed to get this out there.  Thank you reddit in advance.",09Jul2020,1

454,"My a/c can't keep up once it gets past the 80s, and during this ongoing heat wave it's been shooting out warm air. I live in a 2bedroom apartment with a large west facing window and glass door over a parking lot, and a smaller well shaded north window. I moved the bed into the living room and try to stay there as much as possible because thats where the wall unit air conditioner is, but that's also where the sliding glass door is. Every day around noon the sun bakes off the parking lot and shines through that door and it turns this room into an oven for the rest of the day.

I was considering getting heat absorption curtains but the sliding door already has blinds and I don't want to put holes in the wall installing a curtain rod. The apartment leasing office has an issue with anything strange showing in/on the windows so I'm not sure if heat reflecting window film would be ok. They don't allow patterned curtains or window decals so it seems risky. I can't spend money on something I can't use.

So far pulling air out of the apartment through the north window with a box fan kind of works, but not that well. Putting bowls of ice water in front of fans doesn't last more than an hour before I have to replace it. The oven has been kept off and extra electronics are off.

457,"She’s 14 years old and she acts like she is so hard done by.  We live in a nice house and my parents always make sure we have nice things and my mother goes above and beyond for all of us.  But she is so self absorbed that she doesn’t see any of this. 

I want to keep this relatively short so I’m going to list her behaviours.
I’m pretty sure this has stemmed from problems at school and her not fitting in, and she’s taking it out on everyone around her.  She is viscous, angry, always argues back with my mum about EVERYTHING, when asked to do a simple chore she just says “no I don’t care”. 

She is snappy and horrible to everyone even when we try help her.  She has the biggest bedroom in the house, and she had it completely redecorated last year.  Recently she has been complaining about her room and how she hates it and it’s upset my mum a lot because of the time she spent on it. 

She always demands to be given things and when she doesn’t get her way she just isolates in her room as a sort of “if you don’t give me what I want then fuck you”. 

My mum has tried to sit her down and talk to her so many times, she’s tried taking her phone, Nintendo switch, etc.  I think she’s acting like this mostly because of social media. 

She threatens to kill herself whenever she has her phone taken off her.  I’m not sure if these are empty threats or not but she’s done it plenty of times. I’m pretty sure it’s a tactic to get her phone back. 

My mum has gotten her a counsellor (online because of the certain circumstances) and she has slept in late twice for talking to him.  All she has to do is open her laptop she doesn’t even have to get out of bed.  



The reason why I’m writing this post is because today my mum was helping to buy some stuff and help decorate her room the way she wanted.  My mum asked her to pick up her dirty laundry off the floor and she started having a fit at her.  She went downstairs and we tried talking to her, and all she does is argue and argue even if she knows you’re right. There’s absolutely no reasoning with her as she won’t admit she’s wrong.  as she storms out of the room she THROWS a glass bowl with cereal in it and the wall and it goes all over the kitchen. 

Today she also threatened to tell her counsellor she’s being abused at home (her account of abuse is getting her phone taken off her) and she said she would happily lie to him because she doesn’t care. And she said she also doesn’t care if social services did an investigation even though this could be traumatising for our younger brother. 

She is very un self aware and doesn’t realise how unreasonable she is being.  I can’t even remember being this bad at 14 where no one could even talk to me. She interrupts you before you even finish your sentence.

I’m really at a loss on what to do, and any advice would be appreciated (sorry this is longer than I expected)

460,"Okay, so basically I got into the only highschool I liked out of all of them (2nd year) (they're all crappy but this one is fine) and everything was fine until corona. See, I've went to online school for 5 years now and it's really not for me whatsoever and I struggle mentally, socially, and physically because of it. 

I never made friends from it, I always didn't really do the work, I stayed in my room all day, I never moved my body, etc. I just hate it so much. This year (September) was supposed to be \*my\* year of transitioning from a mentally horrible state (other things influenced my state) and actually doing things because I never got to do it for other reasons.

 Considering COVID-19, the schooling with the public school would be an absolute wreck and it wouldn't be as fulfilling academically or socially. The schooling if I were to go back to my online school would be stable, actually fulfilling academically, and basically the only thing there that would be a positive would be my academics. 

I'm truly torn have absolutely no idea what to do since I know if I go back to online school I'll be miserable and probably skimp but if I were to go with public it'd be a mess. I really want to stress the importance of the social aspect of the school because that'd be the absolute easiest way to make friends for me and if I go online, then I wouldn't be able to even if I go into clubs and such. 

I want friends that I can hang out with and that live fairly close to me and public would be the only thing that would give that to me. Any advice?",09Jul2020,1
461,"I (47F) and my husband (49M) have three children, with our oldest one (21M) a soon to be senior in college. He’s been home since COVID in March and he has two younger sisters, one in high school and one in elementary school. 

Last week our son came into my room with tears in his eyes and told me that he was gay and that it was not a choice for him and that he had known as young as 11. I was honestly shocked since there were really no suspicions or signs so I was surprised. I told him I loved him and that it doesn’t change anything and it made me upset how upset he was. He obviously kept it in for a long time and who knows what he’s been through internally, I feel terrible but I had no clue.

The problem here is my husband. My son told me not to say anything to him at first as apparently he is terrified of his Dad hating him which honestly as a mother broke my heart. Even worse is apparently some of his straight college friends who are guys began to treat him differently and he gets very selective with who knows. My husband is a “manly man” I guess you can say and is definitely more conservative leaning than I am. He’s used gay slurs before and I’m sure my son knows how he feels on these issues. My husband knows I have gay friends and he’s ok with it and has treated them with respect but is definitely uncomfortable with it.

My son came out to him anyway yesterday and was clearly nervous telling him. After finding out my husband looked shocked and just said “Ok” before leaving. My son then texted him asking “Do you still love me?” and my husband just said “Yes.” I was happy to see that but I can tell you he’s definitely having a hard time with it. He told me he feels like our son won’t be like most men and that he’s uncomfortable with what two men do behind the scenes. He also told me he believes homosexuality is an abnormality and goes against biology. The thing that annoys me is he said he would have been fine with one of our daughters being lesbian “but why did it have to be my son”. My husband is the type of man that I believe will come around but he’s definitely struggling and I don’t know how to help this along, he’s definitely to some degree homophobic and trying to reconcile his prejudice with our son.",09Jul2020,1
462,"I got a part time job after not being permitted to work through an abusive marriage.  Twice my life/divorce affected work (court, etc). I spoke to my boss about my personal life. In my first year, my private life resolved enough that it didn’t interfere. I worked near full time my second year and beyond. 

I’ve recently discovered that I was passed up for promotion twice and my boss openly discussed my personal history with managers or associates. Promotion, wage, scheduling was affected.  All other managers have recommended me for promotion and discussed positive work performance though my boss refused annual mandated written reviews.  It’s a retail job, there’s clear lines between competent and incompetent and levels of performance. 

This has tanked my confidence. I was eventually promoted into a low level management (by another manger who came and went due to ongoing problems in the workplace) but my duties and responsibilities were capped (via scheduling) and requests for instruction, training, or upholding my signed contract creates conflict or delays. These delays prevent me from doing functions of my job that would allow promotion or wage increase. 

I emailed (documented) then spoke briefly to my boss who admitted (indirectly)  I wasn’t promoted because of my personal life due to “trust” or my ex.  The conversation was quickly shifted and I was reprimanded for documenting in email and “gossiping” with former employees.  I had no idea that this has been ongoing through my time there. 

This affects references for finding other work and general fear of a new work place. I don’t know what to do. HR doesn’t really advocate for employees, just mediate between employee and employer.",09Jul2020,1

There are other things I'm concerned about as well, like info on devices being stored, so how should I deal with that?

In all honesty, what happened was that I went on a binge of those conspiracy theory videos, and between crazy stuff I've seen about pizzagate (don't wanna get into it, I don't like, 100% believe it, but it scared me i guess if that makes sense) to like, the blue whale game, to like, other things cyber conspiracy related and such, I just wanna not deal with it, and try to unplug myself as much as possible (I still wanna keep some form of social media, like my Instagram, but I don't post i just browse there), and do what I can after probably being careless about social media use (again, never show my face, but have used multiple insta accounts, reddit accounts, I tried tik tok, still have it downloaded, but I don't like it, I have facebook but haven't uploaded in 5 years, and other accounts as well) and want to just cut off access and such.

Since the lockdown I went through a breakup which sucks, but a non issue when I know what I want and it wasn’t that person. My problem is I had initially put a lot of effort into that relationship, and hadn’t put a lot of energy into my other friendships which ended up suffering, and put plainly there hasn’t been much of a “welcome back” party since the downfall of that relationship. I have tried to rekindle these relationships but I am very aware that I do not have much in common with these people any more, and I am sort of feeling as though I want to start fresh and make new friends, and I am totally novice at this, I haven’t made a friend since I was in high school, I have struggled with mental health problems for the last hear and although I can come across and very friendly and approachable, I tend to become distant and anxious at the thought of making friends, I’m worried I won’t be interesting or intelligent enough, and worst of all I worry I am actually an annoying person.

468,"I've stayed up all night and I've been thinking about my first year at university. I really struggled to make friends and don't have any still. For some reason, every person I connected with violated my boundaries in such an egregious way that it was almost comical? What kind of a sick joke is karma playing on me? Essentially my question is this: is there something about me that is attracting people like this? Am I over-reacting?

Let me list out the incidents:

1. I meet a girl in my class. I talk to her a couple times and she proceeds to overshare about her mental illness, about her tumultuous past, and admits to instagram stalking me. Later in the semester, we get our midterms back and I conceal mine because I didn't do very well. She proceeds to look and announce mine quite loudly, and appears unapologetic when I call her out. 
2. Meet a guy in the chem lab. We talk ONCE for the duration of the lab, share some ""mean"" jokes along the lines of ""oh wow you suck at titrations idiot"". I DM him the next day and as a joke, he calls me a dumb slut and my boyfriend a cuck. Wtf? We've spoken once how could you think this was okay ??? Like the other jokes didnt really involve extra mean stuff or insults against other people like that :(
3. Meet a guy who I think is pretty cool. He seems a bit older and has a bunch of cool stories, so I'm interested in talking to him. Eventually me, my bf, and him meet up to go to a karaoke bar thing. I said, before the event, multiple times, that I'm there to hang out and support him and my bf, because I don't want to sing. He proceeds to continually harass me about singing even though I said no directly many times. Later he made an extremely graphic sexual comment about me and my bf. We are 18, and i found out earlier that evening that he was 30. THIRTY. I had assumed he was in his mid twenties, yikes. Also he knew our ages, and we were clearly uncomfortable and I even left early.

These are the major ones I could think of, but there are some minor ones that aren't worth listing here. All of this happened in the course of a year. I am asking if anyone has had a similar experience and what they did to stop attracting people who act like that.  Is it me? Why does this keep happening?

Since I have been eating healthily, exercising and organising my life, I've begun to tackle some of the big worries in my life, I have had 2.5 hours of Autism Spectrum Disorder assessment in the last two weeks (thanks to everyone who supported me through that). I get the results on Monday and am wondering how it might change my life and how to break the news to people, some of my closest friends often joke about autism and the majority of my family suspect nothing so any advice would be appreciated, particularly if you've already had a similar experience.

470,"Context: So my friend started this project about 3 or 4 months ago, it was supposed to be a collaborative project among my friends and a few other people I didn't know. The project was originally just going to be book(s) that we would all help make. I joined the project along with around 7 other people. So we started working on the project- of course there were some ups and downs, along with issues but everything was going pretty okay. Eventually over time people started to leave the project, saying ""Oh this project isn't fun anymore.."" ""I don't have time for this project.."" ""This project is stressing me out.."". Then eventually there were about 4 of us left who were still in the project, the remaining people were me, the creator and two other girls. So- sometime last month my friend (lets call her L) left the project. She was stressed out with her personal life and with the project so left. After L left the project the creator of our project basically said that she wanted to cancel the project and whatever- But we kept on going- at that point weren't really doing the project anymore besides just mostly talking about it. Ever since my friend L left the project, the creator and the other girl began talking trash about L- Saying that all her characters were garbage, how they don't want to talk to her anymore, ect. I personally felt bad because I was just listening to my friend being trash talked behind her back just because she left some project so she could focus on her life and make her life better for herself. 

I've been wanting to leave the project for a few weeks now, I've been dealing with a lot of stuff in my personal life and I want to focus on bettering my mental health but i'm terrified of leaving because I would absolutely hate for my friends to hate me- I want to stay friends with them, I really do. I want to leave but i'm scared that they wont want to speak to me again, especially I was super excited to see them after this whole pandemic is over but I feel like if I leave, they won't want to see me or they might hold a grudge against me.

471,"TL;DR - Something’s going on between my parents, and I’m just super worried of what may happen.

	I am now 16 years old, and when I was around 10, there was a point where my parents fought a lot. I think they don’t know that I know what was happening at the time, but I’m pretty sure it was because my mom caught my dad cheating. At some point then, my mom and I left the house and stayed over at my mom’s parents’ house. Eventually, things got better and we just became a normal family once again. However, I would still catch my dad going on dating websites, texting other girls, or basically cheating. I never told my mom anything because I really just didn’t want to mess up anything anymore.

	Last night, my brother walks into my room telling me that my mom wasn’t in my parents’ bedroom. I didn’t think anything of it at first until he told me my mom was staying in the guest bedroom, and my dad was sleeping downstairs. I also noticed my mom has just been crying around that time. Today, I still noticed that she had just cried. They also won’t eat together. My mom even skips meals. Also, my parents haven’t really said anything to each other. I’m just really scared that suddenly my mom would just go away. I’m also worried about my dad, but unlike him, my mom is someone who needs more care.

	So for the advice part - is there anything I could or should do right now? Should I tell my relatives? Should I ask them about it? Also, what should I do when things get even rougher? (I’m talking about them shouting very loudly at each other and full on fighting.)",09Jul2020,1

474,"I'm a uni student in the US. I've lived in the same place my whole life and have always hated that, with a plan to move after I graduate. However, I'm now about to transfer schools (I've been undeclared and couldn't get into CS at my current school) and am considering going out of state or international (considering Australia as I have friends/family there).

I should mention that I suffer from depression sometimes and being in quarantine hasn't helped with that. The way my state and the US has handled COVID-19 also makes me want to go elsewhere.

I could go to another university in my state for a very cheap overall cost, but it is considered socially dead. I've visited recently and am not sure if I would like it; I'm worried it will make my depression worse. I also have no family I talk to in this state besides my parents, so it is quite lonely and there are not many people who I can relate to.

I also have the option of going to a private university out of state, but that will cost me significantly more. This would be located in a place I've considered living in \[in the future\] and with more people of my demographic.

My third option would be becoming an international student. I am considering Australia as I mentioned earlier. An important note is that my boyfriend lives there and I haven't seen him in 6 months, which has drained my mental health. The only issue is that the tuition for an international student is expensive. Other than that, there are a lot of people of my demographic and I could see myself enjoying life more.

What I'm mainly concerned about is my mental health and the effect of me staying somewhere that I don't want to be. Additionally, I'm unsure whether a \[Comp Sci\] degree in the US or another country such as Australia or Canada would be better to pursue.

475,"So I understand the title might seem a little jumbled but I didn’t really know how to word my question. I lost my job recently because of this pandemic, I’m a care assistant and they simply didn’t have the hours for me. I was unable to find work elsewhere so I went back to an old job that i loved because I was desperate for work. I’ve just started. It’s the same kind of work so sometimes I will be working with other carers depending on the call. 

Anyway I found out my ex best friend still works here. She is one of the reasons I left in the first place. We worked together a lot and the fights and misunderstandings were getting too much to the point I lost a lot of hours and a lot of the carers hated me due to her spreading rumours. For my anxiety’s sake, I left. I’m not saying I was an angel. I can be a bitch when I’m angry so I do say things but I often regret it later on. It was all just a mess really. 

The reason she hates me, is the last fight we had which to me now seems silly. Basically after about five months of no longer being friends with her and me leaving that job. I started dating a guy she had sex with a couple of times. They were never together. Just hooked up now and again. I know this might sound bad to people but I honestly never saw the problem as they were never serious and she was in a relationship at this point. Me and this guy starting dating. We have been together now about three years and have a child together. 

The last time me and her argued it was due to me dating that guy as she said I was disrespectful and should of asked her permission even though we weren’t friends anymore. I apologised but said I didn’t regret my choice and the same bullshit started again. Her spreading rumours and venting to anyone who would listen how awful and disloyal I was. I know it does make me up to be a shit person, I admit my choices weren’t all that selfless at that point. I was being selfish. 

Now I’m back at this job and I’m worried. To me now I’ve had a child and it seems silly but apparently she’s been asking other carers about my shifts and I’m worried all the drama will start back up again. I probably deserve that. How should I act if I end up having to work with her?",09Jul2020,1

480,"Ever since I was little I've hated my dad. To give you an idea of why: 
- He constantly calls my mom and brother fat and it's like he feels the need to shame them whenever he sees them eating
- He never helps out around the house (or with anything at all) and doesn't seem to care when my mom ruins her own health because of the insane amount of stress she goes through
- He thinks he's all-knowing and refuses to admit when he's wrong, instead of admitting he's wrong it's like he absolutely has to turn it around in a way so that the other person must feel stupid
- He's extremely homophobic, for example he can't even stay in the same room when there's an LGBTQ+ person on tv, he also always presents his opinions on the subject as if they're facts
- He gets crazy over politics and says some real nasty things
- He's the type to yell at waiters for things they have absolutely no control over, he even hit a waiter once
- Basically, he has no empathy whatsoever

I know it's not like the rest of my family don't have any problems with him either, but I guess since we're not allowed to hate a family member, we've all always just pretended everything's fine. 

But lately, my hate towards him has gotten out of hand. Maybe this sounds a bit morbid, but I've fantasized about killing him since I was little and how good it would feel once he's finally dead. Even now I sometimes plan out ways in my head to kill him. I know following through with those plans is probably unrealistic, but I could physically do it and I constantly think about it. 

This has gotten a bit much for me to handle so I recently tried to tell my mother about it (only the part about me not liking my dad). She was shocked when I told her, but she didn't get mad or anything, she must've understood why. She basically just tried to convince me to like him anyway by saying how much he's improved and how he used to be way worse before. Of course that doesn't convince me at all. 

Whenever we've talked about it after that, she's gotten more mad at me. She gets mad at me for not understanding why I'm obligated to like someone purely because they're my biological parent, she says I'm acting worse than him and worst of all, she asks why I'm acting up like this and if I'm on my period or something.

I hope to move out soon enough and don't want any unnecessary contact with my dad whatsoever, but I don't know how that will work because the rest of my family are intent on acting as if they're a normal family. Basically no matter how much I want to break away from him, he'll always be there. My mom also says he ""does everything for me"" and that he really cares even if he doesn't show it. Of course I couldn't give a shit about that when he's still an asshole to every other human. I desperately want to never have to talk to him again, but that doesn't mean I don't want to talk to the rest of my family. I just don't know how to handle this and just his existence in itself frustrates the shit out of me.

I started talking to a girl recently and we kinda clicked but I can’t get my mind of my “best/closest” so I’m asking what should I do ? It pains me cause we used to be a thing and she used to like me and sometime it feels like she still does In the way she talks to me... but I don’t know if I should tell her how I feel or try and get over it for good or just wait and see if something happens.

Call her text her I’m livid

My BM won’t let me see him. I can’t go to court I’m fresh out and need to wait a little bit. I have a job and a better living situation. But she won’t see that I need to be in his life for him to be in a better situation for his future mentally and intellectually.

I won’t bore you but she is toxic. She cheated on her husband with me tons of times. She told me she kept my child (from the 4 times she had an abortion from others) and said “I had your kid for a reason”... it’s money... that’s why...

I’m livid. I just want to be talked to with respect from my sons mom and she has been the mental hospital 4-5 months ago. Cops got her for punching her BF before she was married.... her other ex was so miserable he TRIED TO SHOOT HIMSELF DEAD, missing a vital organ in his stomach by inches....

She does this to all men.

485,"Hello, first post here, so sorry in advance.


I just bought a BLM mask off of Amazon, and once it came home, my Dad saw and asked who bought it, and why (I have a brother). I said I bought it, and so did he. Long story short, he doesn't want us to wear it. I got into a heated argument with him, because he thought at first it was a racist thing. I explained it is the opposite. He said, ""all lives matter"". I explained how black lives are being killed double of any race, and the protest is saying that their lives matter TOO. He then says, while he understands the movement, there should be no reason for me to wear the mask in public, as I am picking a side, and could cause problems.

Here is where I'm stuck. I am not black, I am Asian. He said, me wearing the mask won't change the way the world thinks. He also said the movement is over for now (idk where he got this info from). I want to wear the mask when I go to the gym (legit the only place I go out), but I also dont want to cause big problems with my dad, and I don't want to somehow be in danger from strangers who oppose my mask. (This is the first time I bought something REMOTELY controversial).

So, if you guys could help me out, I'd greatly appreciate it. What should I do? Thanks in advance.",09Jul2020,1

487,"Hey guys, first of all I'd just like to apologise for my terrible writing and explaining skills. 
Please comment if you would like me to elaborate or further explain anything I say in this post:

So basically after any social interaction -  no matter how large or small, I feel like locking myself in my room and not talking to anyone for a few days. (Which I can't do due to having a girlfriend who constantly wants to see me, wanting a job etc).

I'm going to explain some background details describing what's been going on for me somewhat recently because I know that I haven't always felt like this my entire life. 

So about a year ago my dad was caught cheating on my mum after a 30 year marriage which was super messy and caused the family to split in all different directions. My mum has definitely changed since then for the worse. I honestly suspect some kind of post trauma related mental issues have begun to take root. For example, she can't hold a job down anymore, constantly gets worried her new boyfriend is going to leave and gets really angry over the smallest things (my mum is normally the most chill person on the planet). 
Often, she'll talk AT me or my brother about her problems. It's like we can't get away because she will follow us to our rooms and talk about issues with her boyfriend or how people at work are being jerks etc. Which whilst I am happy to lend an ear to my mum, I now find myself feeling extremely drained due to the sheer amount of this negative information being throw at me. A lot of the time, I feel like all of this has been left up to me to be there and to hold her together (for what feels like) every single day.
I'd like to also mention that due to the fact my mum can't seem to hold a job down anymore, we could potentially lose the house we live in which just adds to my stress at the moment. 

On top of this, I've been in a relationship with someone for the past year and a half who struggles with a lot of mental health issues. This often leaves me having to help her out as best as I can when shes struggling. The problem is that I sometimes don't have enough emotional energy to empathize with her when she needs support, which leaves her questioning whether I really care about her or not.

Another thing that's currently on my plate is my best friend also struggles with mental health issues who is doing much worse than my girlfriend. I constantly worry that he's going to do something stupid someday. so I always give him a phonecall to make sure he's all good or I often ask if he wants to hop onto discord and bust out a few games of league of legends together and we often sit in discord and listen to eachothers problems etc. 

The thing is, I like to think I'm usually pretty good at giving friends and family emotional support. It's just that now, at this time in my life, I feel like everyone inside my world is looking to me for emotional support as if I'm some sort of mental health counselor or something. When in reality I'm also human and I just can't hold the weight of everyone else's emotions for them for much longer.

Anyways thanks for reading. I personally think these things I've mentioned play a part as to why I feel drained 24/7. If anyone has any advice, it would be greatly appreciated. 

tl;dr : constantly wanna stay in my room. fam split up. gf and best friend are struggling. constantly feels like everyone looks to me for emotional support which leaves me very emotionally drained.",09Jul2020,1

491,"My philosophy for the longest time was: ""If I don't do at least one memorable thing; something that people will keep alive long after i'm gone, then there was no point to me living at all."" It didn't have to be curing cancer; could be as simple as making a well received video game or a well known online personality. Those things obviously not as important as curing disease, but I would have made some impact.

Now i'm 24, waiting at home for my work to reopen (I work kitchen at my local sports center), feeling guilty as my dad goes to work and i'm sat here. I give £150 a month, but only because I requested it; my parents are too nice to me. College starts again in September and all i've done is play video games, watch stuff online with friends and occasionally draw; I don't currently have a drive to be creative, which from what i've gathered is common at the moment.

I started to realize...maybe what I do doesn't matter; but in a good way!

I've had large problems with social anxiety and low self esteem throughout life: i'm not the smartest, not the most athletic, not in a relationship, not quite ready to leave home yet, not motivated (pretty lazy honestly), social skills are abysmal but...does it really matter if i'm fine with a lot of that? 

I think my initial philosophy stems from wanting to be a people pleaser and needing the validation of others, but part of my therapy to overcoming my insecurities was coming to understand that ""No one really thinks about you as much as you think"" and why should you care what the passerby thinks of you; why should they control your life? 

For the longest time, i've seen being well known as the be all end all, but in reality I think it's the opposite; this is my life, my decisions, if you get to experience that with me, great. But if you don't then it isn't a big deal and the same applies vice versa. Not to mention there are huge downsides to becoming famous: stalkers, people judging your every move, a demand to provide what is demanded. We little people get to live our lives and I don't think we realize how great it is that no one cares.

Of course I won't discard the potential for improvement: I'm dieting, hoping to live on my own someday and wanna work on my social skills. But I do these things for me and not because others tell me to or mock me otherwise.

TLDR: If i'm not hurting anyone (that includes my own health) and i'm ok with it, then is it ok to live life as a ""nobody""?",09Jul2020,1

493,"I'll be graduating high school in a year. I enrolled in a dual-enrollment type of program that let me take college and high school classes at the same time. I'll be attending my senior year as a full-time college student. By the time I finish my senior year, I will have graduated with a high school diploma and an associate's degree.


I've wanted to study for a career in medicine. Emergency Medical Services (EMT/Paramedic) really caught my interest many years ago and I've wanted to do it since. However, a job in EMS doesn't require an associate's degree or even college. You take private programs to get your certificates for them and immediately get hired, which is why they are pretty low-paying jobs. 


I don't want to throw away my interest and not do the job I've always wanted to do, but I don't want to feel like I wasted my time getting an associate's degree or settle for a low-paying job when I could take just a few more years to get a higher degree and a different job.

494,"Hi everyone,

I need some help with relationship advice. I had a very abusive childhood and was abandoned a lot. 
I met my first bf @ age 15. We were for 6 years, married 1 year. I went off to college, naive, and became “curious” and we ended up separating. We were inseparable during the 6 years so this was a massive shock to both families and friends. I went through a lot of dark times, as did he. We are still married 4 years later, but not together. 
When we separated, our biggest issue was intimacy. We didn’t have sex often &amp; I started to lose interest. I went off with 2 other guys and he found out - I was immature and didn’t tell him. This killed him, rightfully so. The guys were pure rebounds and I was trying to void my feelings for my husband, didn’t work. We tried marriage counseling and he gave up after 4 sessions, understandably he wanted to but wasn’t ready to forgive. After lots of destruction, from both parties (emotional abuse, manipulation, other people, contemplating suicide, etc.) we decided to stop talking for a while. He went off with other people and I stuck with my bf now. We couldn’t and still can’t stop talking to each other. 

Fast forward, I’ve been with my bf now for 3 years. He is pretty much the opposite of my husband. My husband is funny, artistic, very social, low self esteem, short, skinny, anger problems, never went to college but very smart, $10/hr job. He never had a problem making me laugh or naturally be happy. 

My bf is tall, shy, very kind, people-pleaser, simple, smart, high paying job, medium self esteem, basically the perfect boyfriend. He’s always trying to make me happy even though he’s not always sure how to. He is very sweet and loving. We have sex all the time. Our biggest issue is not enough adventure. 

So! My dilemma. My husband and I have been talking on and off for the 3 years that I’ve been with my bf. Yes, I’m an asshole. I haven’t cheated on my bf but I would every now and then go and meet up with my husband to talk and see if we still have any fire. We do. He’s just still so abusive with his words and we fight. He’s improved a lot of the years but it’s still there. I’m having a contractor re-do my deck and he will say things like “I bet your sleeping with him” or “oh I bet he makes you wet down there”. So he’s still very hurt but he wants to be together &amp; says he will change.

When I am talking with my husband, I become very distant with my bf. I feel bad and he deserves better than that. but he’s so sweet and loving, he makes me wonder why I’m still so attached to my husband. I love my bf so much and he’s given me everything I’ve ever wanted since I was little and when we argue, it’s never yelling. He’s so calm and we just talk things out. I’ve never had that before. 


What do I do? I still love my husband, I think about him all the time. He’s in everything I do, even when I try SO hard to get over him. I have the “perfect” life with my bf, we don’t have any struggles and we get along very well. My husbands asked for a divorce and I know we need to do it, regardless. I’ve been thinking about asking my bf to move out so I can clear my head and reassess the situation without any influences but I don’t want to hurt him. I know I sound like a total ass and I am. I just need some help, I’m 25 and my main goal in life is to start a family &amp; show them what life is like without abuse, so I need to get my life in order. Thanks for reading.",09Jul2020,1
495,"I’m a senior in high school and growing up my dad would act certain ways and now that I’m getting older it makes me wonder if he’s very toxic and unfair or if I am just sensitive. I’ll give you guys some examples. 

I grew up as an athlete, I boxed, wrestled and played basketball all competitively. During fights or games when my dad would watch and if I would lose or preform bad I would get grounded, lose phone and gaming privileges and would be unable to go out with friends. 

He would always nag me to practice dribbling a basketball in our hallway or the kitchen and if I didn’t want to then I would get yelled at and it would cause a huge scene and a headache for me. 

When my dad would teach me to drive and if I would mess up he would blow up at me and same thing, ground me, lose phone and gaming privileges. Ultimately if I wasn’t perfect it would infuriate him. I never understood why he would make it all such a big deal. I feel like he exaggerates the punishment when I didn’t do anything terrible to begin with.

497,"So my sister is in her mid twenties and I'm just a few years older than her. We've always been close and best friends.

This morning I woke up to see her post about how ""her depression is hitting her real good right now"". Like wtf. It was so ""cool"" and ""casually said"", but definitely a cry for help or attention. She has done this off and on for the past few years - posting about depression on social media. 

Since she was in high school, she has had these on and off spouts of ""I'm so depression"" and ""Suicidal thoughts"". I am not saying her feelings are not valid, but she has lived a good life, she has a good family - there is literally nothing wrong with her life. She is doing better than 99% of people her age. She has a great job, good salary, lives in a beautiful city. I just surprised her with her dream puppy as my maid of honor proposal that she gets to pick up in 2 weeks... our parents are healthy, our family is supportive and loving so her life is good. 

Of course life is not perfect, like there have been ups and downs, but nothing so tragic has happened. I feel like she clings to the concepts of ""depression"", ""mental health"" and ""suicide"" and I don't get it. Honestly, it really just makes me angry and stresses me out because I feel like she just has some sad feelings and will name it depression.

Everyone gets sad, and I know what depression is like, but I also think in my sister's case that she is in control of her feelings. I'm not saying she shouldn't feel sad - she definitely should allow herself to feel whatever feelings she needs to, but she doesn't need to unpack there. I honestly think she is just a worrier and she lives in ""what if land"". She isn't a very decisive person and I think this also leads to her attachment to depression.

How do I address this? Like it is so freaking annoying. I've helped her and had honest convos and she has told me thanks for being real with me and that I am right  - that she in in control. I really think she needs to get off social media too and I've told her that many times, but she doesn't. I don't know what to do. I'm just so annoyed.",09Jul2020,1

But the characters in that show along with every other show and book and movie all have such powerful friendships. I guess it just made me think that I wouldn't ever have anyone outside of my family who cared about me like that. After that I started to just get really upset and tried to chill out but couldn't. Now I'm really frustrated and sad, to the point where every typo I make makes me loose a bit of faith in humanity. I kept thinking that nothing can actually be that deep and no one could have that level of a connection and that every interaction I will ever have is solely superficial and no one will ever like me.

500,"So basically my girlfriend and I are about to move into our own place after high school, we’ve been together for a little more than two years, and all I can think about are the differences between us.

Of course I love her and I care about her extremely much, I’m just not sure I can see us making it much further in the long run. For example, she enjoys spending most of our days together, doing fun cute things like special dates and getting each other little gifts, while I prefer to just hang out, not make a big deal about holidays, birthdays, anniversaries, stuff like that. Like a good plan or time for me is maybe going to a small restaurant once a month or spending most of our time together watching Netflix and cuddling, while she likes when I get flowers and gifts. Plus she HATES when I play video games too much and she gets upset when I want to hang with friends sometimes over her. I don’t blame her at all and like I said I care about her so so much, I just don’t know if I’m in love. And last October we had a little break that lasted about two months, which led her to behaviors she wasn’t previously known to do which really bothered me, which is the main reason I wanted to get back together. Because I absolutely hated seeing her like that. But I also know she would never want to remain friends, as it would hurt her too badly too ONLY be friends while we see other people. Also another thing that makes this situation so hard is that we’re planning on moving in together and a lot of her after high school plans revolve around us being with each other, so if we broke up I would ruin a lot for her I feel like, or maybe I’m over thinking it idk.

He used to be completely fine, he could take care of himself, then all of a sudden, I notice he’s gazing off into empty space most of his time. I try to talk to him and when I do I find myself just reminding him of things that are right in front of him. Like he’ll ask where his cigarettes are and I’ll say “Dad they’re in your hand” He can’t even light a cigarette, normally he’s a chain smoker and he does it with ease. It’s just been a lot of mental trauma, and weight on my shoulders knowing suddenly I have to help him, and it’s really sad to me. I can’t fully express the way I feel towards seeing my own fathers memory decline by the day, but the pain is unbearable. And I feel like a bitch for expressing my pain because it’s the pain of taking care of someone that I love, and that should be second nature to me and not a task of learning maturity or responsibility, nevertheless it is present in the form of something that is proving to me very trivial and it is harsh and depression and just overall shitty. I feel like I’m watching my dad die slowly right in front of my eyes. He is not the playful joking man he once used to be, he is now this forgetful shell that I have to remind him who I am as his son and it pains me deep down every time I see him or talk to him. I don’t even know how I can describe it to someone who hasn’t been through this. But it’s a terrible terrible feeling. And on top of me being a yearly long alcoholic for like 5 years or more it’s unbearable. I can’t stand myself or other people, I get angry and depressed too easily, I’m emotional all the time. I see and hear things, my mental state is constantly falling apart and I feel like I don’t have any sort of power to grip my mental state and take control, I don’t even have the strength to leave the house. I have a car and my dad has a car and currently both of them have issues and need mechanic help to run. Which we don’t really have the money for.

503,"First of all I would like to say that English is not my first language so I'm sorry if the phrasing seems odd.

Ok so sometime ago I was browsing YouTube and I happened to stumble on the men's style genre of channels. I watched a few of the style videos which seemed interesting as I had no idea that certain style rules existed and I really learned a lot about men's style so I started to apply these style rules to myself and found myself really benefiting from them. Let's just say that I got hooked on their content.

Those familiar with these types of channels know that clothing and grooming tips are just the tip of the iceberg because they also offer advice on how to become a ""gentleman"" or a ""real man"" depending on the specific channel. Now some of the advice is genuinely wholesome while some are harder to swallow. 

Fast forward to earlier this day when I was scrolling through the r/lpt subreddit and saw a post on the topic of being a gentleman. Curiosity begged me to read the comments of the post and to my surprise the top comment warned against the Alpha M channel calling it toxic and full of shit. I then replied on the comment asking why they thought that about the channel but alas I got no reply. 

As the Alpha M channel is now one of the channels I frequent I was forced to ask myself whether or not those types of channels are actually toxic. I now leave it to you to decide the truth of the matter as I don't want my biases to lead me astray.",09Jul2020,1
504,"   My ex gf (18f) of 2 years and I (20m) broke up on good terms because her parents didnt want me involved on her life. The problem is, we havent stopped talking like we weren't couples. We end our nights saying I love you on call until the morning. We keep eachother company. We sneak visits from time to time to hangout even just for 15 minutes. She swapped to my workplace in order to hangout a bit more. But the problem is we talk to eachother and saying things that will motivate eachother to move on. It's very difficult for us because we never fell out of love but her parents told her that if she chose me shes out of the family (in addition, she hates her family but is scared she will not have anyone to back her up in life) 

   We tried to cut off eachother out of each of our lives about twice and twice was unsuccessful.  first was when she sent me a text saying something along the lines of, ""We need to stop, I love you but goodbye"" next thing that happens is I get a huge apology letter saying to disreguadd that whole moment and act as if it didnt happen. I tried cutting it off because I got jealous that a friend of hers that she used to like is already making a move on her. we ended up forgetting that moment a little bit because she explained that she used to like him but her love for me far outweighs any emotion towards him and that the only thing holding her back from moving on is her feelings for me.

   Ideally I would love to continue to drag this out until I finish college in about 2 years, Join the Air National Guard, and start my life so I can start with her. She tells me she would love me to wait but to not throw away any opportunity and she said the same that She will wait but at the same time, another great guy could come along and would not want to throw away that opportunity.  dont get me wrong, I love her and I want the best for her but I want her too . In addition, shes gone through so much pain in life emotionally and mentally, and shes used to me being there each time for her to vent, and cry on. I would love to have a good friendship with her as well but I dont know if staying will crash and burn again or will work out. What do YOU think I should do reader? :/

511,"For privacy, I do not want to disclose my age but just know that I am under 18.

A little backstory, I have a child that I am more or less only allowed to see a couple hours every month. This is not my child’s mother’s choice but my mother’s choice. I am becoming more and more depressed every day because I have to keep my mother happy just to be able to see my child them few hours and I just cannot keep her happy anymore. She will usually have an attitude with me and then expect me to not react, and then start shouting at me as soon as I do. She will usually then proceed to call up my grandparents (her parents) and say that I’m being this and that, when I never do anything wrong. Suffice to say, I’ve just had enough of having to keep everyone else happy just to see my own child. I want to do something for me to make me happy for once too, as my life isn’t really my life. Everything I do is controlled by my mother and I just don’t want to live it anymore.

That being said, I have a couple of options.

Option 1: I could go to my dad’s and live a happier life, albeit a worse off one but I’d be happy and I could see my child more and be free. With that, I would have to open up to him about my life (never knew me for 16 years). I’m embarrassed to do so, and scared to really. Yet, I know that he’d be heartbroken if I never told him too.

Option 2: I could go to my grandparents but I run the risk of never being able to see my child because I can’t drive myself yet, and I might be forced to go back home.

Option 3: I stay here and get worse and worse but still be able to see my child, albeit my life would still be controlled and I generally would end up killing myself after a while.

I know what option I have to go for, I just need to know whether or not it’d be the right one.

TL;DR : Had enough of having my life controlled, what do I do?",09Jul2020,1
512,"TL;DR - my parents went completely crazy over me wanting to send a correction after they sent an email to my doctor without my consent and I don't know what to do: should I move with my boyfriend or should I just ignore this situation and pretend it didn't happen?

Quarantine may have messed up with our mental health a lot, but I don't think that's the main problem here. Shit like this always happen and this is just my latest example.

Some context: my (21F) family has always been pretty dysfunctional with my dad (68M) who was aggressive towards me, my mother (60F) and my sisters (32F and 39F) and my mom who LOVES to play the role of the victim. Now my sisters live independently with their partners and I'm here at 21 alone with my parents, trying to finish my Bachelor's degree and about to start my Master's. Despite I would define my parents (especially my dad) as mentally unstable with rage outbreaks out of nowhere and stuff like that, they always guarantee us to get an education and always paid for our medical care and in this period they were looking to buy a small apartment for me so I could live with my boyfriend (27M) in a place closer to where we work and study. I would say that, overall, they are not terrible. Just a tiny little bit fucked up mentally.

This is what happened.

Two days ago, I had an appointment with an occupational doctor to do a compulsory visit. All my colleagues had to do it. I have been recently diagnosed with a chronic illness and the doctor recommended me to do a disability certification. That's all. I told my family in our Whatsapp group chat and my dad, the following day, asked me to go to the doctor with him so we could figure this out.

The doctor is a dumbass. He is an idiot. Completely useless. He told me that he wanted to add a diagnosis of ""depression"" in the certification because the chronic illness' diagnosis ""had an emotional impact"" on me. I'm pretty sure I am NOT depressed and my doctor is just dumb, but you know. He is a doctor and if he says something, I'll take it AT LEAST in consideration. In front of my scepticism (when the doctor told this, a loud WHAAAAT?!?! escaped from my mouth), my dad just agreed with the doctor and told him that it was a great idea.

I was still sceptical and told my mom, who changed her opinion to polar opposites (wonderful idea - terrible idea) a few times in the span of 10 minutes and at this point, I'm just confused. Nobody even explained to me what this certification is about and what would be the consequences. Then, without telling me, they sent an email to my doctor asking him not to put the depression shit and sent that email with my dad and MY signature. But they only told me AFTERWARDS.

I think I got reasonably mad and, with the right tones, told my mom that this is unacceptable and that they should NOT send my doctor mail in my name without even letting me read first, especially because I did not fully agree with them: I think that if the doctor wants to add that I'm depressed, I need to be clinically assessed by a specialist, not ignore the situation completely. I told her that I wanted to write to my doctor that I didn't really want to ignore the ""depression"" shit, but I wanted a serious diagnosis, first.

Of course my mother started playing the victim because ""you want to punish us for writing your doctor"". She started crying loudly and called for my dad who, as I mentioned before, is mentally unstable. He started screaming violently, insulting everybody, saying that we want him to kill himself, saying that he was going away, shouting as he threw everything in the air while and slamming every door. He put some shit in the luggage and dramatically left. My mother just sat on my bed and watched me crying, silently accusing me of this situation.

Long story short, I spent the night alone (not really surprised because shit like that happens all the time, but still in shock), trying to think rationally and told my boyfriend everything for support and asked him if he could please come here (I can't go there because I cant' drive. He lives 45 minutes from me). He told me that ""the petrol costs too much"". I could have paid for it, if he didn't have money, anyway. It was just rude, in my opinion, but I understand that he can do whatever he wants with his money and I am not entitled to anything.

So here I am, the next day. My dad came back and everything is awkward.

My boyfriend gives me zero emotional support because he is in a ""bad mood"" because he has to write his Master's degree thesis. He literally had more than a year outside prescribed time to write this thesis and *every single one* of his classmates graduated last year in time, everyone with the maximum grade, cum laude. He wasted almost every day not studying because he is stressed. I understand that he has another shitty situation in his family and we suspect that he has undiagnosed Asperger's syndrome, so I try not to push him and be supportive, but damn. We all have problems. I am immunocompromised during a pandemic, I still have to do all my exams at University, I fight against my hypochondria and SEVERE needle phobia (I have to do injections and blood tests and IV way too often that my brain can accept due to my illness and I'm trying not to collapse) and he literally just have to write his thesis because he already did a year ago all the researches. He promised us that he would graduate 3 times already and always delayed.

I don't want to say that I have bigger problems, but we have projects together and him graduating and getting a job/entering his PhD (he didn't apply for his PhD because he misread the deadline, for example) was part of it and I honestly don't know what to do at this point. I feel like I should just go away from this house because my parents are a bit toxic, but I am also afraid to go to live with my boyfriend because I start to fear that he is unreliable with bureaucracy and when we will live together we will have to pay taxes and everything. He is just avoidant. I have to beg him for months before he does something like going to the doctor because he has a skin infection. I don't know if we would be really able to take care of a home.

He is awesome: during this quarantine, something similar previously happened and I asked him to take me away because the situation was just awful and he saved me, but I just can't forget that this time he told me that he couldn't be here because of some money I could give him back anyway. He is caring towards me and I don't know if I'm just being a piece of shit for being disappointed.

514,"I quit a job I loved so much because I was in a bad place in my life. I brought home with me to work.

516,"So a few months ago now I (19M) went over to my friends house because him and his gf were having a little party. A little bit into it my friends gf introduced me to one of her friends, for the sake of the story we will call her “R”. I talked to her (20F) and thought she was a pretty cool person, she had a lot to say, was super nice to everyone and always welcomed others to the conversation so people didn’t feel weird. 

Anyways that night passed and about a week later I get off work and my and my friend plan to hang out. We were just planning on going to McDonald’s then heading back to his place to place some video games or something. So I hop into the front seat and who’s sitting in the back? His gf and R. At that point I was pretty happy that she was there because I never actually got her number or Snapchat at the party because the conversation kind of just shifted away from just the two of us. We go back to his house, hang out and everything’s great and this time I actually got her number. After that we all hung out in a group a few more times and I was thinking about asking her out. 

So end of June rolls around and my friend is having another party because his parents were gone for the entire month up north visiting family or something. I showed up pretty early to help with whatever I can and I tell him that I’m probably gonna ask R on a date after tonight and that when he dropped a massive bombshell on me. He tells me that she has a boyfriend and she lives with him and his parents. Her aunt was moving like 10 hours away a year prior and she didn’t want to go with so she moved in with her boyfriend at the time. The worst part was I knew who he was too because I used to go to school with him. I really dislike this guy, he’s rude, angry, manipulative and only looks out for himself. I was really shocked when I found this out, but what was even more shocking is that they were purposely trying to set me up with her so that she would get rid of that asshole. I felt pretty betrayed by everybody. I kind of pushed to the back of my mind when people started showing up because I didn’t want to think about it. 

R showed up and I decided not to mention the bf thing yet. After a while she kind of suggested that she wanted to hang out with me alone for once so I thought it was probably a good time to talk about it. When I brought it up she said she was sorry for not telling me and that she wants to end things with him, but she’s just stuck. If she breaks up with him she’s pretty much gonna be living on the streets. I don’t like the guy either he’s awful, but I told her that I can’t do this if they are together. I’m very against cheating and if I tried to date someone knowing they have a bf already I basically am cheating. Her situation is shitty and I do like her, but I feel like I’ve been a puppet this whole time. I really don’t know what to do at this point. I kind of feel like I’m just too young to be doing this sort of thing. Do I try my luck or do I just forget about her and this whole situation?",09Jul2020,1

523,"Hi guys. I’m stuck on what to do. A little context. I am 28. My husband is 36. We have been together for 5 years. I’ve relocated for his career twice. Both times to rural areas with little opportunity for my career. And honestly, racist and bigoted areas. Within the last year i went back to school for my business degree in order to switch fields. I will be done in December. I’m able to finish online due to the virus. 

I found a nice job, however i am driving an hour each way each day. My job is difficult and the commute makes it worse. This drive is putting a ton of mileage on my car and jts really tiring. I have discussed this with my husband and he sympathizes, but all he offers is saying to stick it out for six more months with hopes that he can find a job elsewhere by top of next year. He’s actively job hunting but the process takes a long time in his field. Also, we would still be limited in the areas that we could live in. So i am pretty much just supposed to suffer and wait to relief. Which has been the common theme for the last couple of years for me. 

I’m honestly tried of living in places that i dislike and just being supportive. My job has a location in Raleigh Nc. I am able to relocate if i want. This would be three hours from my spouse but closer to family. It’s a way better city than the last couple of places. 

Considering i can afford to manage my bills, do you guys think it is a good idea for me to relocate to Raleigh alone ? We would have to manage travel back and forth to make it work.

524,"I used to perform gay acts with my cousin and I hate myself for it.

To keep a long story short, when I was around 7, my cousin would first introduce me to porn videos and games and it was literally a daily thing. Then one day, he led me to his mum’s room and told me to lay down on his mum’s bed as he shut the door. He began to dry hump me and I was just there shocked and confused. He would keep dry humping me as well as checking the door in case if anybody came in until he finished. It felt wrong but I didn’t know what to do. After he finished, I felt awful about myself but I thought that it was nothing to bug about. He’d then started to kiss me and slip his tongue in my mouth and it all just felt wrong, yet I didn’t do nothing and just went with it. 

It made me question my sexuality. I even thought I was gay at one point (I’m straight). I didn’t know who to go to at the time as I had a mother that didn’t care about me and was a strong Muslim, even to this day. 
It made me hate taking showers and touching my genitals. I also hated wearing certain kinds of clothes that I wore that day as it makes me remember about it. 

I now have a porn addiction and I hate it. It makes me remember all the gay things I’ve done but it’s the only thing that calms me down nowadays. I also hate being choked or anybody touching my neck as he used to grab my neck in a seductive way. I’m scared to actually tell anybody because I don’t think anybody will believe and will tell me things that wouldn’t help. I haven’t told anybody and don’t think I ever will other than on this Reddit post. 

I hate myself for it. I feel like suicide for me is the best option, but I’m scared to die and don’t really want to. I want to cry but I can’t, no matter how hard I’ve tried. I guess I’ve taught myself to man up’ and just get through life like everybody else. I can’t rest at all and believe that the only way I can function and get things done is to watch porn and I hate it. I believe porn as well as all my childhood problems have really messed me up mentally. I get constant migraines and just feel like I’m about to drop dead very soon. 

I’ve told him that I’m not cool with him anymore and lost all contact with him but I haven’t told him why and he doesn’t know why either. I just didn’t have the strength to tell him why I’m no longer cool with him. I feel so hopeless and don’t know what to do.

So for some context I work for a food producing company and I have been there for about six months.  I absolutely love the company that I work for but as always some people are not the best.  It started when I got my new position in this factory as a cutter, and I had a new supervisor named Ed.  Now right from the start Ed and I did not get along very well we had issues talking and he would always try catch me doing things I wasn’t supposed to be doing.  I’m not talking just walk down and see if I’m messing up but actively try and hide and peek around to see if I’m doing something.  

I had had enough and decided to go talk to HR about the issue that was going on, and they honestly seem to hear me out and he slow down for a while but that’s when I noticed some thing else.  In my position there are two people my spot and the person adjacent from you as per there are two flumes.  This person adjacent from me does not like me because I did not crack up to be what they expected of their new partner.  I noticed that she started carrying around a notebook and would write down every single time I would come back or go on break to the bathroom or do anything in general that was not my specific assigned duty.  Not only that but would report to the manager right in front of me on the other side of the flume. 

I am tired of being harassed and my final days are coming up and I have decided to take some time to be a stay at home dad.   I was just curious if there was any ideas or recourse I could take as far as revenge goes for these harassment that I have been going through.  

Bonus information:  my manager has a thing for being friendly with women and not towards men almost sexual discrimination but not quite. 

My partner across from me is a woman.  She is very gossipy and often tends to annoy people with her pessimism all the time.

526,"tl;dr: I'm a freelance writer and I think this guy is taking advantage of me.

I'm a 21-year-old female who works part-time at an office supply store chain in America. They don't pay me much but it's honest work that sometimes it's really good to do somedays and really hard to do other days.

After working there for only a few months, a man (let's call, Bob) started showing up at our store and getting prints done because we also make posters and flyers for people and their businesses. Recently in the past 2 months or so he was telling me of a venture in which he was selling PPE (which, in retrospect, I should be reporting to the Better Business Bureau in my town). 

He asked me if he could contact me in order for me to do some work on his website and write the copy for the products that he was ""selling"". The man managed to get me to sit down with him for a face to face dinner to tell me more about what he was asking me to do and I ultimately agreed to the project. 

However, since then, I have been more of an assistant to him. He has not talked about what I would be getting paid for the website. Instead, I've been getting up at 5-6 am to be meeting him and driving him around in MY car and being an errand girl. (which he'd pay me 12 dollars an hour for, but I've got 25 dollars for a week's work of pay.)

The waking up at 5-6 am to work with him has gotten me exhausted to the point of sickness. He'll have me doing things with him until I have to go to work at the other job I mentioned at the beginning of this post. I'll be up from around 5am until 8pm when I get out of work at the other job. I got depressed because of this. 

Thankfully, I wouldn't be giving up the chance at work because my stepdad is offering me a job where I know that I'll be getting paid for the work I do and how much I'll be getting paid.

I even got 3 tickets just for driving to work an hour and a half away (nobody would take me even if I paid for gas)since my license was revoked ever since I got into some trouble, so ashamed to tell anyone, it was a dui over about 1 1/2 years ago. I got help, kicked the xans-ain’t touched them since that’s saying a lot since I was hooked since 17 or 18(now 30)and even explained my situation but they don’t give a s***.

528,"Hello fellow redditors,  


first of all, this is a throwaway account which will only be used for this specific post. If you do not feel like investing time into this thread or give advice, I can understand.  


  
**Situation at hand**

I have experienced boredom and lack of meaning in my day to day life for years now. While I have been successful in my field of study - engineering -  I have not felt fully engaged in anything I do apart from spending time with my family. Currently I have no hobbies anymore and spent most of my free time - family aside for the moment - with computer games (Rainbow Six Siege, Counterstrike).   


**Typical approaches to handle the boredom**

Group 1 (progress +  challenge related)

* sport
* new hobbies
* reading
* studying
* working/crafting

Group 2 (others)

* meeting friends
* going out
* reading
* ...

*Why are you not doing any sports?*

Doing sport for the sake of it is not engaging. If it does not revolve around challenge and progress, I will lose interest in the specific sport. On the other hand I realized I will not be able to spent enough time to reach a level that is worthwhile or retain it in the coming years. Due to aging and responibilites in life, it would be rather a deed of wellness with a few exceptions. I have considered picking up hiking/mountaineering or skydiving since I love nature and activites with a controllable, yet obvious element of danger. I found my single skydiving experience to be really fulfilling and the perspective/view was magnificent. In terms of adrenaline it definitely was cool but I assume it would finally wear off and the environment you jump in will gain more relevance. 

  
*Past hobbies*

Sport:  5/6 days a week including parkour, climbing and swimming. I won't add the realted workouts here, this is kind of obvious.

Reading: Mainly fiction, some philosophy or political pieces.

Music: I taught myself some guitar but did not show the necessary determination to get to a decent level**.** 

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion/Tldr**

**Most actvities I used to enjoy lost their spark and I seldomly feel engaged in my life, with the exception of more dangerous activies like the occasional scaling of a building/crane, hiking or the time I went skydiving last year.**  
**Thus life is mainly a sequence of responsibilites and boredome unless I spend time with loved ones.**  


*Has anyone of you had this persistent experience of boredome?  How do you spent your time in a meaningful and engaging manner? Have you added a activity to your life that became an unexpected but dear hobby?*

This has been bothering me ever since it started and it makes me feel a lack of affection. I’ve told him this before and he always brushes it off as insomnia. When i tell him to go get treated for it, he always denies to do so. 

This goes on EVERY night and it causes such a big strain on our relationship, i don’t know how he doesn’t see it. We don’t have sex. When i wake up, he’s going to sleep so i have to be extra quiet with morning activities. It makes me grumpy because i wake up in the middle of the night due to him. I’m just tired of it. 

What set me off is yesterday was his bday, we went to his mom’s house and when it was time to sleep, he did the same thing. I’m just laying down on a couch while he’s chatting it up on the ps4 on call of duty.

534,"When I was in my first-year of university (17 yrs. old) I sent an incredibly toxic, racist pic to a group chat targeted towards a close friend at the time. The picture was of me stretching my eyes, essentially 'impersonating' an Asian.  Immediately after sending the pic I regretted it but knew there was no way I could take it back. I apologized endlessly to that friend and told the other two members in the group that I realized how terrible the mistake that I committed was. 

Four years later, I am now 21, and I'm looking back at that message and I realize just how bad it was. If a photo came out showing what I had done, I'm scared it could ruin my life, career, friends and everything around me. I spoke again to the person I offended and she accepted my apology but I'm constantly under the pressure that someone might post that picture from 4 years ago and its kept me up at night, I can't focus on anything but how bad the consequences might be. Its been four days since then and I just don't know what to do anymore. 

Should I post the photo and confess to my sins in public, even though the person I offended already accepted my apology? Should I somehow try and forgot about it knowing that at any moment, that photo could start circulating?: I keep asking myself these questions and I can't figure it out. All I feel is an endlessness of guilt and regret.",09Jul2020,1

I've been applying to jobs since March and the last few weeks a lot of interview requests have been rolling in. And I want to do the right thing but... my soul is begging for a break because this situation with my mom has been an absolutely daily nightmare. But it also seems irresponsible to take a break. But jumping into a new job with double the hours, double the shifts(albeit for better pay and much, much better benefits) seems like a recipe for disaster. And I truly don't know what to do.

I want to do the right thing. And with my soul yearning for me to take time for myself but I don't know if any jobs will be available down the road... I need to make a decision on this offer today and have asked to call the recruiter to inquire about additional questions I had and I want to explain the situation to her, ask if its possible to be considered for a later hiring pool but I feel like it'll absolutely destroy my chances of getting this job.

541,"I'm an IT major going into my third year of college, it's not been too bad but I've been stuck on this class, Data Structures, it's my third time taking it. The past two times, I've tried to tell my professor I'm going to switch majors because I can't pass the class. Every time he tells me he knows I can do it and that he will actively help and what not. I've emailed him a couple of times and no response. Which, really kills it for me, I genuinely don't want to try anymore. I'm having to work 30+ hours a week and take the class which demands 15 hours minimum. I'm no longer happy, I can feel this job and class taking a hard mental toll on my health in general. I told my manager I'd be putting in my two weeks relatively soon to try and find another decent job that won't stress me out or kill me with hours. 

Anyway, they're changing the IT degree plan so if I change, I have to take cal 2, advanced algorithms and a few others, but I'd really rather not. I no longer enjoy programming, in fact, this is the only class I've not been able to pass. I don't even eant to program, in fact. I enjoy networking much more. I really do want to continue but if I fail for the third time, I'm honestly not going to have the capacity to try again.

This class is the only thing between me and my higher level classes due to it being a pre-requisite. I'm at this point where I'm in my late teens, about to be 20, and in a year or two I'd like to be independent. I keep telling myself if this won't work, I'll get into welding just to kick off some of my life instead of just at home, working towards what's supposed to be a four year degree possibly turning into a 6 year degree, and still living with my family at 26. I know there is nothing wrong with that, but personally it really doesn't appeal to me. I just want to see if I can continue on this, IT degree plan that I'm on now, and minor in welding so I can take those classes at least but also not have to switch to the new IT degree plan. 

I've become so unhappy in my life decisions at this point, like I said before, the situation has killed any motivation I had. I really don't know what to do. I personally want to just drop the IT course and go into welding to make money and possibly go back to college when I've got the money saved but gosh.. I also want the IT degree.

I just want some feedback in maybe what I should do, I can't schedule an appointment with my advisor and I've emailed another professor to ask them some questions but no reply. Maybe some welders on their experience or IT majors who struggled with the same course.",09Jul2020,1

Now, I know that was a bad idea but I had no choice since the cat wasn't coming back at all but she came in that evening and now she's searching for them, Jumping from the windows and from the gates,open doors .

Just school and after school tutors all the time. I couldnt go outside and have friends mostly because of her, I missed out on so many great video game titles during the xbox 360 era when it was at its peak. But I kinda started very late when the slim came out and somewhat tried to relive the past. Anyway off topic, I guess most of this comes from my family just a huge language barrier they couldn't really say english that much and if they did they really were stereotypical asians. High school was a mess especially in LA I just hated everyone I didnt even speak to anyone all I had were thoughts of murdering everyone I still have it in my thought every now and then. I guess high school made hate a particular race group hispanics. Some are cool but just most of them are arrogant assholes and my old high school is filled with them.

545,"For context, this uncle hasn't been the biggest part of either of our lives, mostly just there cracking jokes at family events or playing the occasional round of golf. He loved his grandkids (my godson and his siblings) immensely and while he had a few rough patches in his marriage (caused by both parties), I can't recall him ever being a bad guy. I mostly remember him always trying to throw out dad jokes like they were going out of style. 

Three days ago, he lost his battle with cancer. It wasn't pretty, he started his chemo and within a month he'd lost 25kg and unfortunately passed away in his sleep next to his wife at home. He tried, but his body was too weak and it went out of control very quickly. 

My sister messaged me to ask if I was OK today, I told her that I was fine but that I was more worried about his wife and children/grandchildren than anything. She just replied with ""I know it's bad to say this but I never liked him. Don't tell anyone I said that. But I also feel sorry for everyone else.""

I'm at a loss for words here, even when my mom had posted the news on our family chat she just completely ignored it and posted something stupid about her day. I would usually just ignore stuff like this for the ""sake of family"" but I don't want to be that person anymore.

546,"It has been a fantastic 8 years, we loved each other so much, she was everything for me as I was everything for her. A love that I don't think is possible to experience twice in the same life. Then I left to work 4 years abroad. I always knew that after that period we would be together again, and she has always been in my plans for the future, in my perfect life I have always seen her. But I never managed to tell her maybe, I couldn't make her understand how important it was for me and maybe I neglected her. We stopped saying things, talking to each other, I probably disappointed her and she disappointed me. Until two weeks ago when she asked me for a break and not to talk for a while. I will have to leave again in September, so I asked her to see us again and we decided to try again, to get to know each other again, a second chance to talk and fall in love as the first time. But she says she doesn't know what she feels, she doesn't know if it's love or just a strong friendship. I believe she still feels love but what troubled me most was that she told me not to feel physical attraction, not to feel the need to hug or kiss me.  
Do you think it is possible to recover such a relationship or are we only harming ourselves? I know that in these two weeks when I haven't seen her, she has been terribly crying every day, and I haven't been really well either. But do you think love can offer a second chance?

I don't understand if I did well to ask her to go out again or her love is really over.

548,"I am currently 2 years into my degree for paramedic science. I absolutely love it and don't get me wrong it's hard work. I've struggled with my mental health for a few years, (I am currently taking anti-anxiety meds which I need reviewing by my GP and also have started therapy last month.

Recently due to the Covid-19 i've had a lot of time to sit and reflect about life and what I want to do.

I absolutely love my degree more than anything and want nothing else but to become a paramedic and although I know you are never going to be ""ready"" for qualifying, I feel that I am putting a lot of pressure on myself and I genuinely don't think I can cope with the pressure with being the responsible clinician, even as a student, let alone when qualified.

This isn't something that's new to my thoughts, at the end of my first year I was very on the fence as to whether I wanted to continue, but had no other plan to fall back on so stuck through it. 

This thought process, along with my mental health and anxieties has had an affect on my uni work where I am not being able to focus, nor have  I been getting the grades I know I am capable of, resulting in failing my most recent submission, meaning I will have an extra assignment to retake on top of 101 other things.

I currently work part time in another healthcare/patient facing role (which I don't let affect my studies), and there is a job opportunity to work still on the ambulances (as an assistant) rather than a paramedic which I am debating applying for.

I also don't tend to go out a lot at uni drinking as I am in my mid 20's and it doesn't appeal to me as much anymore as it did 6 years ago.

I know I need to take some time out to focus on my mental health so my advice is, is it worth changing to a similar career role or changing to something less mentally draining?

The fact that I am even considering postponing my studies breaks my heart a this is a career I have wanted for such a long time.

However I’ve gotten used to wearing baggy clothes to hide myself because of quarantine. But I can’t dress like this forever.. especially since the school year is coming up again.

555,"Lets start from the beginning. In high school I was always a hyperactive, attention seeking kid that couldn’t stay out of trouble. Eventually I was expelled from high school and was sent to a intermediate vocational education which prepares trainees for jobs that are based on manual or practical activities, traditionally non-academic, and totally related to a specific trade, occupation, or vocation. I live in the Netherlands so the school systems are different. I’ll try to explain them as best as I can. 

Anyhow I finished this education in 2 years and of I went to a university in applied sciences (This isn’t university yet, its less theoretical. In american standards its comparable to college). At first I chose a workingfield related to my prior education, which was in the legal services field. After like 5 months in my first year I realized that it just didn’t suit me. So I dropped out. Afterwards I started the study to become a physical therapist which I also dropped out of because it was in a different city than I lived in. The distance was pressing and I was like 20-21 and not really motivated to put in the work that was needed.( I really matured around my 23rd year).  Around that time I started being more social and outgoing etc etc. and I do feel that that was where I started maturing. So I quit again. The year after physical therapy, I started in Nutrition and Dietetics. Which I sticked to. I am now in my final year and I plan on finishing it. Keep in mind, I chose these studies in my earlier twenties without knowing what I wanted. I just chose for the sake of studying, as my parents and environment wanted me to study.  

During the first year of my dietetics study I started researching more. Thinking for myself instead of listening to the ‘’wiser’’ older people around me. I quickly found out that religion was a manmade construct. (I was raised in a muslim family).  I started researching certain fields like evolution, biology, physics, chemistry, history etc. etc. I started developing. Now I am a 24 year old with decent knowledge about these subjects, thanks to myself. I have finally found myself in a state wherein I can make my own decisions. During my quest for answers I stumbled on the evolutional theory and biology, like I mentioned before. These have been my main interests for a while now and I have been reading a lot about it. Its amazing how we can predict animal and human behaviour, how are genes influence the ways we act and how these fields can answer big philosophical questions. I will start a minor about evolutionary psychobiology in my next semester so I am really stoked about that. 

Here is my problem: I finally found what I want to do with my future. Best case scenario? Become a professor/teacher in the field of evolutionary biology. I want to study a biology master and major in evolutionary biology but the problem is that I cannot apply for a masters program in this field because of my prior education. Even with a pre-master they do not accept it. So now I am at this crossroad where I want to pursue my dreams and the field in science that I literally love but I am being blocked by this bureaucratic nonsense. I can’t do what I want to do because of the fact that my teachers in high school didn’t see me as worthy of their time. I will not accept this. I always hear these inspirational stories of how a teacher influenced a student in a certain field and they became great at it, well not with me. But I will become great at it, not sure how yet. 

I won’t accept working as a dietician for the rest of my life, I didn’t choose it on basis of my interests. I spoke with a councelor at a university that provides this master and she said it wasn’t possible to apply without hesitating.  I haven’t had guidance from my current university regarding masters. I am sure I could take the studyload of the master but I cannot prove it. What do I do? Who do I contact? Do I just drop the idea and continue developing on my own?",09Jul2020,1
556,"So, to start things off. I'm a 26 year old man living in Norway, in a relationship with 22 year old woman from the Philippines. She's the woman of my dreams, like she truly is, and I would do anything for her. Sadly in my life I've experienced a lot of friends dying, a lot of people breaking my trust, which lead me to try to forget about a lot of it. Yesterday we were talking about my past relationships and so on, and I remembered something I didn't think of, and shes now making it seem like she's suicidal, saying she doesn't care if she dies, and it's honestly breaking me. 

In the start of our relationship I told her I don't remember everything perfectly from my past relationships because of what I've been through, and because of how many girls I've been with. 

So in the start of our relationship I told her I really care for her, and I love being around her, hearing her voice and what not. She asks me, ""so you love me?"" And I said, ""yes, I think that's the best way to describe it. ""

Shortly after this we were talking about relationships and we came to the subject of if I've ever told anyone I love them first, I took quite a bit of time to think, couldn't remember a single time, so I said ""no, I don't think I have."" So for the last two years it's been the same, but yesterday I was trying to dig through all the chaos in my brain, and I remember this one time almost 13 years ago, where me and my ex-girlfriend were outside her grandmother's apartment talking the day after me and her almost broke it off completely. She was hooking up with me, another girl and another guy, and she didn't know who she wanted to be in a relationship with, and that was extremely hurtful, but after I told her I can't be with her until she figures out what she wants and who she wants to be with, I can't be there.

I started walking away, she started crying, I started crying, because I did care, I really did. She pulls me towards her, and after we kiss, I tell her ""I kinda love you"".

Now I told my current girlfriend this yesterday that there was one girl that I did tell first, and it just broke her completely. I've tried to explain it, I've apologized, but nothing matters to her currently it seems like. Yes, I do understand her being hurt, absolutely. But then again, its nearly 13 years ago. 


I think what makes it the most difficult is that me and her have this long distance relationship. Every single day we're on call, for all day long, watching things together online, and it is amazing, it seriously is. But things would be so much better if I was able to be with her in real life, hold her, kiss her, make her understand that everything is going to be fine. Last year we were finally gonna meet, and I was working my ass off in a company, month after month. We were making plans, and everything felt so real. But then I end up getting basically scammed from the company I was working for month after month. But I stuck through it, telling her ""maybe next month I'll finally get the pay I'm supposed to be getting?"" So obviously I was questioning it. I was never able to save up, and after 7 months I told my boss I'm quitting. And I think because we've been making plans to finally meet for the first time, and it doesn't happen, she's way more emotional than she would be otherwise, and I just don't know what to do. 



If you were in my situation, would you say that the way she reacted is the right way to react, or do you think that I messed up completely? I hope anyone would be able to help me fix this situation, because she's too amazing to let go.",09Jul2020,1

So I just started working at a very popular tourist restaurant in my town. I was filling up the ice containers for the soda machine during closing last night and this parts gonna sound weird, but I was laughing at someone’s joke and legit drooled a bit into the bucket for ice. I froze and didn’t know what to do so I left it behind. I didn’t want to say that I accidentally drooled into an ice bucket. But then somebody filled it up and used it to put ice in the machine.

I’m kinda freaking out cause obviously there’s a pandemic now, and this place gets a lot of business. Should I say something? Does the ice in the machine self sanitize? I don’t even know how to approach this situation. I’m not actively sick or anything, but I work other busy jobs (albeit with a mask).

I'm here because of an inner conflict between my heart and my brain but first of all some background.
About a month ago I met a really nice women on reddit. We talked a lot, played video games and called for hours. We had a really good time (often).
As you can tell I like her a lot (and she told me that she likes me/talking to me as well).
I have some kind of weird mental problem though (don't know how to describe it properly). We talked about that a couple times.
A couple days ago she told me that she doesn't want to talk to me anymore as it is draining her (I guess because of my problem). She blocked me on some platforms but not all of them.

At the end of december I got in a relationship with my best friend who I really loved ( it was a ldr as he was working in a country different than our home country). At the beginning of our relationship it ws perfect and I sent him
some nudes of which I dont remember that my face is showing but I cant really think clearly rn. They were sent on snapchat on 3-5 seconds and he was sending me pics back and took no screenshots.


He became to show his narcisistic tendancies about 1 month into the relationship and we eventually broke up which DESTROYED ME (this was in march). I had 2 suicidal tendancies that month and I begged him like hell not to leave me. 


*when we started fighting I stopped sending him any pics*


Now it s been 4 months since we broke up, he had my netflix password and tried to change it and cancel my subscription, he talked about me with my friends and did all kinds of bad stuff. 


I eventually blocked him and moved on and today I was stalking him a bit and saw he changed his facebook description to a instaram username in which is posted a photo from an account I follow and that has a description: stay tuned for more (or smth like that).


I am really scared of him leaking my nudes, he is a very revengeful person and I dony know if he had another phone, I am shit scared because I have a wonderful job and I dont want everyone to laugh at me for loving an asshole and trusting him too much.. 

The police in my country doesnt care much about this matters so idk if that is an option.

564,"Hello there , I(M16) don’t really feel that people care about me , other than my parents . The thing I feel like people forget about me a lot and just sort of ignore me . It’s as if I’m not there to most people . To be honest I don’t really care to much about my situation. I just want to put it out there and see if there any way of improvement. 

I had some friends at school but most were short lived due to moving schools and me not connecting with many people causing I’m a bit shy. I got a couple friends that are from outside school however , I can tell most of them don’t really care about me . When I say something they usually ignore me . When I text on a group chat most people don’t respond . They never text me , I always have to text first . I honestly can’t remember the last time someone approached me or texted me before I did . There is one friend who’s better , we get along in person , but I still have to text him first most the time . Im not here to wine , I honestly just want some advice to make things better .

567,"My bf is selfless to a fault. For example, he's currently ""volunteering"" for a woman running a real estate business. He does all her excel work, and even got up at 11pm when she texted him last night to make her a business poster. He gets paid nothing for this. Its not like shes a charity working for a higher cause either, its literally just this woman's for-profit business. His excuse is that she's not making much of a profit yet, and that she helped him get an internship last semester. Honestly, the second part isn't even that true. She called in to a guy she knew at a company asking for interns to recommend him, but he passed the interview and everything on his own. That was nice of her, but its still not enough I feel for him to work as an unpaid on call graphic designer and office worker. Every-time I try to bring this up with him, he gets kinda annoyed and says that he's allowed to do with his time what he pleases, and that he just wants to be a nice person. I honestly feel like she's exploiting him for free labor, I just want him to get paid especially since he sometimes worries about money.

Hello, I am a Muslim, I have two friends, one muslim and one non muslim. They have both had a dispute with each other where my muslim friend told the other friend that he “hopes his mum dies”, this was during the heat of an argument and now my non muslim friend is going to beat up my muslim friend. I’ve known both friends for over 8 years and are really good friends with each other but the two have never got along too well, my muslim friend is clearly in the wrong but I don’t know if jumping him over something said in the heat of the moment is the right thing to do but it is very hard to justify my muslim friends point of view, my muslim friend is sorry and I can’t seem to mediate between the two and calm my non muslim friend down to not fight the other. I really don’t know what do to do as they’re both saying “pick me or lose me” in a sense, whose side should I take or should I stay neutral and try make things right, any other suggestions are much appreciated.",09Jul2020,1
569,"Hello there :)

I'm here because of an inner conflict between my heart and my brain. First of all some background information.

About a month ago I met a really nice women on reddit. We talked a lot, played video games and called for hours. We had a great time (often, nothing can be always be good). As you can tell I really like her (and as far as I know she likes(d) me/ talking to me too) 

Sometimes we talked about my 'mental problems' ( I have no idea of how to describe it properly) which wasn't that good I think. Besides that we had fun. 

A couple days ago she stopped talking to me though, saying that it's to draining for her (didn't say why but that 👆 is the reason I think). She blocked me on some platforms, not all of them. 

So here's the problem: My heart wants her back. I want to talk to her again, laugh and play. I think if I text her we could try to sort things out. It's worth a shot, right? 
My brain though would leave her scince that seems to be what she wants.

575,"Hey people!
I would love to get your advice on something that is quite complicated for me.

Here's the background story to my question:

Eversince I can remember my parents had the worst marriage. They were constantly fighting and bickering with each other. My dad always lied to my mom about drinking and smoking and was very jealous and did not allow her to go out very much. For example one time it even was a problem for him that she wanted to take me and my sisters to go swimming because others would see her in a swimsuit. My mom would get furious about him  and beat him and cuss him out for that but stay with him. Over time their relationship looked like that: My Dad constantly drank and smoke secretly which my mom would find out again and again and get furious. They would fight aggressively but stay together because my dad would first insult her and then cry and say he loves her and can't live without her. He left my mom alone with everything. My mom was responsible for keeping everything together and take care of us kids. My dad didn't seem to care. Also my mom started to treat my dad poorly and there was nothing he could do right anymore. She would also tell us kids about what bad of a person my dad is and what he is doing wrong. Nowadays I know that that was wrong of her. She shouldn't have put the weight of her marital problems on her kids.

Now I am 24 years old and my parents are finally breaking up. 

Alright, now I am coming to my question (sorry for the long story 😅):

I have a problem with creating boundaries and my therapist tells me that my mom should keep those things about the break up to herself and is overstepping a boundary by sharing her feelings about the break up with me. But it torments me that my mom is miserable and needs support. My dad is not making the break up easy. He constantly drinks, picks fights and goes from insulting her to crying and pleading her to stay together. My mom goes to therapy but can't really talk to friends about it because they are also friends with my dad and my dad always put up the act of the nice guys that just can't make it right for his always critical wife. My mom is now realizing that she has let him talk her into staying with him for 35 years and how that has damaged our family. My therapist says that it is incestuous if I am there for my mom, listen to her and give her advice, which really shocked me but should I just let her alone with all this and be like: not my problem.?

I am very confused and hope that someone can give me their objective opinion.",09Jul2020,1

579,"**ThrowRA** im(F18) a receptionist at a hair salon and the other day this boy(M18) comes in, on the way over to his chair he had stared at me while he was walking back but I didn't take it as anything. the stylist, him, and i were having light conversation and he would glance again and again, I assumed because I was talking.

cutting to the chase, as we walked up to the register so i could ring him out he stared again. He lingered after he payed and pulled out his phone and asked where i was from as he pulled up his instagram, he asked for my name and searched it but my name is very basic and he said he couldn't find it. so i told him what it would be under. he said he'd hopefully see me around and left. i got the notification he had followed me and the stylist that did his hair was so happy for me over it.

you might think this is fine and dandy but i have a boyfriend(M19). the boy unfollowed me, i assume because of the photo of me and my man. so the stylist actually messaged him and told him that i thought he was attractive but i have a boyfriend and that I was sorry about it. he took it very well but i cannot stop thinking about it.

my boyfriend and i have had a really rocky relationship just over a year long now and i had tried to leave the relationship fully multiple times and always end up back with him, but right now things are better than ever and I haven't been wanting to leave the relationship like I wanted to a few months prior. I know its probably only a matter of time until it gets into its rocky states again. The boy at work made me feel genuinely pretty and gave me a confidence boost. At the time my face was swollen from a bad sunburn i had gotten the day before along with some messy hair and a not so flattering outfit to avoid the burn on my body. so with all of that considered it felt really good. I really want to be able to talk to this boy before i miss my chance.

the issue is I don't know if the customer just gave me attention and a confidence boost or maybe i unknowingly see it as away to get out of the relationship i'm in now. I do feel attracted to the customer and he was extremely kind to everyone in the salon which is huge considering my current boyfriend is kind of an asshole to people he doesn't know. I really feel like i'm missing out on my chance with this guy but i also know i shouldn't break up with my boyfriend over a boy i barely know. My friends and coworkers both think I should leave my boyfriend and talk to the customer but i don't think that's a reasonable way to end the relationship. though, my boyfriend has never abused me, he would flirt with/ get nudes from other girls for the first 6 months consistently and for another month or two here and there. As far as I know all of that is over and we've grown to be a pretty healthy couple but i don't see it staying that way for long considering the past.

im pretty sure I know the advice i will get from this but im really hoping to be enlightened and get some advice/motivation on what to do regarding the customer. I also understand that I am pretty young and most of this may not matter in the long run but I would appreciate some advice for the time being.

582,"this is a bit of a doozy, and im still reeling if im honest.

when i was 7, the man i knew as ""dad"" passed away from lung cancer. i was devastated, and it affected me profoundly, and still does. 
when i was 13, my mom told me that he wasn't my biological father, and that man was still out there, his name was martin, and that i could get in contact. i reacted badly to this at first, because i was upset that i didn't know this sooner. mom told me that she'd found out she was pregnant with me, and then left martin without telling him, as she was an alcoholic at the time, and she painted her leaving as a ""good"" thing, so as not to tie martin to her, as she felt that having a child with him would ""drag his life down"". her ex-husband then stepped in and raised me as his child, and he was the man i called ""dad"" and passed away when I was 7. i have 3 older half-siblings who are his biological children - a sister 11 years older, and 2 brothers 13 and 15 years older than me respectively. they all knew, all along, and never once told me.
shortly after i found out about martin and wanted to make contact, my mom told me that he had also passed away a few years prior, which felt like a crushing blow - i felt i had a chance at having a father again, and then it was taken away a few days later. nevertheless, i wanted to get in contact with his family, and my mom spoke to them on my behalf. they requested a DNA test, and i sent off my cheek swab and waited and waited and... nothing.
i asked my mom what happened, and she said that they did not want to be in contact with me regardless of the positive DNA result. this really hurt me, and i felt a lot of resentment towards his family, and did not want to know them any more.
fast forward to now, im 24. my mom passed away a month ago from cancer. impulsively i decided to reach out to my biological fathers sister, i wrote a polite and pleasant message, introducing myself and asking to get to know them (a lot changes over 11 years...)
she replied and apologised, and told me the DNA test i did when i was 13 came back with no relation to their family - in other words, i wasnt martins child, either. she said my mom was informed at the time, which means my mom knew i was not related to them, but let me believe for 11 years that i was, and that they'd rejected me.
i messaged my oldest brother to ask if he knew any more, as he would've been 15 when i was born, so he might remember more clearly. 
he began apologising profusely and telling me he always disagreed with the way my mom handled this situation, but that honestly my biological father could be one of many men, some who's names he remembered, others he said were ""nameless"" and probably untraceable. he said she was drinking a lot at the time, and had bad judgement when drunk. he said there was a man it couldve been, who used to come and see me on weekends and sometimes took me out when i was a toddler, until he started turning up drunk and late and eventually stopped turning up at all. 
im sure my mom kept this from me because she didn't want to hurt me, but now she's gone and i can't even ask her for an explanation. ill never know if she genuinely knew who my father was or not.
I've spent the day mulling it over and trying to think of any possible ways i could track this man down, but it seems a bit hopeless at the moment, when all the information I have is my brothers half-remembered names and faces from almost 25 years ago.
do i try and track him down, or do i leave it alone? part of me wants to know, but part of me really doesn't.",09Jul2020,1

We talked so much... then... he shared something to me... that someone confessed to him, and he confessed too... He was happy... He never mentioned who it was... He would not tell because I would become angry, I want to hear who it is, but... he said, I knew who it is... I totally really don't know... I gave up... I'm not really interested who could it be...  


 Further, he said to that person was that... he has priorities... like study first... so, he would not attempt having it. It happened through chat like 3 months ago.

2 years ago, my cousin (33F) and her husband (40M) got divorced. It was a nasty divorce, where dad was shunned, couldn't see his 2 kids (8 and 9) anymore, and was labeled 'bad' by my aunt and uncle. We don't know the full story, since it's treated as taboo. However, the kids know no better then: 'dad is bad'. They weren't allowed to see dad for 2 years, and now one or two hours while supervised.

Ever since the divorce, my 2 nieces' upbringing has been worthless. We've collected some examples over the months.

\- They're starting to become violent but they're never corrected or punished for it. Mom says: ""They're probably just tired, let's go home"".

\- They're taught to lie. The youngest hurt her ankle. It wasn't bad, she could still stand on it. The mother goes: ""It's okay, just tell them it's broken and be extra sad about it. People will give you extra stuff if they find you sad"".

\- There are no consequences to anything. If they want to eat, they open the fridge. The stuff their faces, 2 hands at a time. The oldest now wears adult maternity clothes size S because nothing else fits her. If they show bad behaviour, they're not punished but cuddled.

\- The youngest sleeps in bed with the mom. This can be fine of course, but when the new boyfriend comes home, he's not allowed to sleep in his bed, because of the little one. Mom says: ""She's my all, and he get's enough around here"".

\- The kids have court mandated therapy, but mom refuses to bring them. There seem to be no consequences to this so far.

\- The kids have no structure in life. No bed times, no wake-up times, no decent meals, just what they want, so pizza, pancakes and ice-cream for life.

My cousin is most probably ill. I see signs of depression in her, signs of bipolarism and signs of narcisism. I'm not a a doctor, however both my parents work in healthcare and they agree. Besides, she is my cousin, we've had a friendship for many many years. However she won't listen to reason anymore. Me, my sister and brother tried to talk to her about it, but she both won't accept that she is ill, nor that there is something wrong with her kids. Normally I'd try to keep talking to her, helping her, but I'm afraid things will get worse. However my conscience is telling my it's a morally difficult move to call CPS on my cousin.

We barely talk and I'm the one who always makes the efforts to keep the conversation going. I must say that I'm the one who always texts first (he did so just two times).

I don't want to stop talking to me, especially since it is supposed he likes me and if I must be honest, I kind of like him too and can picture us together in the future.

596,"The recruiter from an ecommerce company contacted me last November and I got an offer around early December. The interview was quite exhausting because I applied to job 1 but they thought I was way too promising so then they referred me to job 2, but the Head didnt deem me fit for it and so referred me to job 3. The last one offered me a job, but I declined it. During our interview, she said she’ll be blunt and told me I was not what she was expecting. Probably because I was quite sick that time. Then she proceeded to rant about her employee who she was very frustrated because she couldn’t get anything out of her. Told me she couldn’t get along with introverts as she’s an extrovert. I asked her about mentorship but she’s hands-off and believes working on your own is the best teacher. I asked about the job and she said she would place me in their operations and that one of my projects would be improve their current procedures through excel. I wasn’t expecting this kind of work in marketing—I thought I’d be able to work with brands, campaigns etc. I asked about that and she said she would let me shadow the other teams. 

Even though it has been 7 months, I’m still torn about my decision and question if I ever made the right decision. The what ifs haunt me. Such as because even though the work isn’t exactly aligned, maybe I could have worked my way until I was in the team that I want? Afterall, it’s a step closer than staying in my current field—banking right? Or like I could have a wfh setup rather than exposing myself outside; or I could have had a higher pay by now. Then there’s this other thought that maybe it wouldn’t have worked out? Maybe I’d hate the job? I don’t want to dwell on this any longer. It’s affecting me during work. I’ve asked others and all they say is “maybe it isn’t the right time?” But I feel like it could have been if I didn’t decline. Ugh self-inflicting problem :( I reapplied to the company numerous times, but not one word.",09Jul2020,2

I only thought about it recently and have come to the conclusion that I liked her, however, I can’t decide if I should come clean about liking her or to just keep it to myself and let her go on with her life.

599,"In May, I saw a mouse leaving my bedroom and going into my bathroom. It scared the shit out of me and made me extremely unhappy. I bought the house last year. I keep it pretty clean. Shouldn’t be in my house. I digress, I left the house to go to work and immediately called a pest control company. The pest control company came out the next day and set up different variations of traps everywhere from the bedrooms to the kitchen to the basement. They looked around the house and said everything seems pretty insulated and they think it came through the basement door when my mom had left it open for a while. I’ve seen the mouse on camera two or three times since having them put the traps out but has not been caught. Since about June, I haven’t seen it on camera at all. When I’m at the house, I’m on edge but haven’t seen it. When I had the company come back out, the guy says he thinks it may have left the house as he noticed some of the outside bait had been eaten. I had my mom go through and clean up the house for me after hearing that and she found mouse poop atop shoe boxes in my spare bedroom in the closet.  However, that’s the only activity I’ve personally seen. The food in the cabinets haven’t been tampered with, there’s no random holes in the wall. 

I believe it was just the one to start out with but I don’t want it to attract more. It’s has been two months. During this entire fiasco, my air conditioner apparently broke as well. So the house is around 87 to 90 degrees most days. I would hope that would cause the pest to leave but I’m not sure. What can I do? Should I fire the pest control and hire another one? Can I hire somebody to poison bomb the house or something? Would investing in a thermal camera scope to try to find it be a good idea? I need this thing out.  Any help would be great. How can I get it caught and gone? How can I make sure it’s gone?",09Jul2020,1
600,"hard to choose where to begin, but for anyone bold enough to read context to understand my dilemma, please help.

So, I’m a sophomore in highschool next year, and I’ve never really managed to get farther then the friends department when talking to girls, which I really had no issue about. 

The beginning of freshman year rolls around, and I’m crushing hard on a girl in my grade. I had already known her for some time, and we dabbled in being friends, but she had been dating someone prior. Nothing serious, but it fucked her up when the guy ghosted her, but I was there to help her get through it. 

Over the summer I began to build an infatuation for her, just child’s play, but after going on what I’d call a first date, (walking around town, goofing off in Costco, and honestly having a few long deeper talks,) I really started to like her.

She’s the incredibly touchy type, which is probably a solid reason why I became hooked on her so quickly. When school started, we hit it off, (3 weeks after the “first date.) Every morning, I walk into our freezing campus to hear her sprinting at me to give me a warm hug. To my poor brain it was like we were dating before we even got near it.

She comes from a Mexican family, and is RARELY allowed to go out with friends, and is constantly harrassed by her single mother of 3 kids. Her home is a small run down apartment complex with awful people living next door. Im always the one who she comes to when she’s sobbing because of her mother, which is frequent :(

I walked her home everyday because it was honestly a shit neighborhood and I’ve been close to getting mugged once or twice. It was also just fun being able to talk to her, and normally I just went my way after walking her there, but on a few occasions her mom and siblings weren’t home. She decided to let me in the house and we watched tv on her bed while she lied on my chest almost falling asleep.

To me, you can imagine it’s a dream come true, to her, it’s just something to do with a friend. Smh

We did this 3 or so times, until I was eventually caught when her mom came home, an awkward situation when she found me in the closet, but not really important.

I of course asked her out a few times, but she said she wasn’t ready and was hung up on the boy she used to date. 

We’d been best friends for about 5 months, all of that happening in that time. Around October of 2019 something did change though.

It was me, her, and this other unnamed friend. My other friend isn’t very skilled with girls, or socializing, including basically unattractive 😬. 
We were walking her home, and playing around at the park nearby like retard teenagers. It got late without us realizing, and she panicked. She knew she was as good as dead by her mom, and we were 8 or 9 blocks from her house.

I offered to take her home, while she decided what to do, because my house is 3 blocks away, and my parents were out of town. I’m an only child meaning I could get guests in easy.

She came home with me and my friend, holding my hand the entire way there. We watched a horror movie, and as I was crossing my fingers for, while I was sitting in my chair she hopped up on my lap and I held her while watching the movie. A cute memory. My friend thought she was sad or something because she had been crying about her mom, so he didn’t think anything about it ig. Later on in the night, my friend was bashing skulls in Superhot VR, and me and her were both on my bed.

I wasn’t expecting anything, but she, again, crawled on top of me but this time facing me, and said “do you still like me?” Inches from my mouth. 

I nodded my head and you can imagine what transpired for a short period while we narrowly avoided my friend seeing us.

Her mom eventually called her for the 205th time and screamed at her. My crush finally broke and told her where she was. As her mom ran over a small group of third graders rushing over to my home, I consoled her while she cried about what was to come. I felt genuine grief when she had to go because it was my fault it was worse now, then if she went home 4 hours earlier. 

(And yes her mom remembered who I was from meeting me in the closet🤡) 

We returned to school, she was okay, and it wasn’t that bad. I expected us to begin dating, or something close to it, but it didn’t work out that way. She said she wasn’t really ready to date again, and wanted freedom, but she still really liked me apparently. I accepted this because regardless I’m a horny teenager and she’s my crush. 

In the days after that, nothing happened. I tried to work my way into being flirty or changing the dynamic, but it never worked. 

It stagnated, and eventually that infatuation she had died. I was disappointed and for months thought I had killed it. We stayed friends, and I started liking another girl for about 4 weeks, while she dated 2 guys in that time. She later told me it was out of desperation and attention, including boredom. 

Neither got under her shirt or even kissed her. One of the guys was a funny 81 hour relationship, and the other, is what founded why we are what we are today. I didn’t care she was dating people and I had vocally told her prior to her dating that I didn’t want to like her anymore. 

Winter break hit.

She was dating this stupid fuckboy she apparently hated, and the day before winter break we hung out and made memories I still cherish. At the end of the day, I flirted a bit and she eventually told me she was dating him, while I thought she was actually single. I cried for the first time that day in 5 and a half years. She knew that I rarely ever cried and seeing me almost break down before leaving struck a cord in her. 

The day winter break started, we texted for 13 hours. I’m not kidding. I have the screenshot. The next day went the same. We spent an entire weeks daylight texting. It got dangerously close to complete cheating (you’ll see.)

 I of course had no regard for her boyfriend at the time, and constantly flirted and tested my luck. She eventually did reciprocate, and i even got her to ignore her boyfriend for 6 days in a row. 

I went on a San Francisco trip with some of my friends and their parents, and texted her a lot. This is where she realized I still actively crushed on her by sadly, siMPInG during the 8 hour car rides and instead of sleeping. We constantly dm’d the 400 ways we’d fuck eachother and graphically described it as a way to virtually get off to the thought of eachother. She asked for dick pics and I’m not one to shy away from that, so I did send it to her in a bliss. 

I asked for something back, and she said she felt guilty still dating the tard. 

That convo ended there, but we continued to mentally fuck eachother over text. When the break ended, she instantly broke up with the sped, and started to fully like me. 

Our relationship slowly progressed as we liked eachother more and more, seeing as how we have perfect chemistry being best friends and all. One day, around the beginning of February, I was walking her home. She knew she was getting her phone taken away, so she wouldn’t be able to text me over the 3 day break, and as she left and I said goodbye, (a simple hug, at the time) I felt her muffled sob and she ran to her house.

Her mom wasn’t home so she managed to text me for about 30 minutes before she had it taken away, and she told me she loved me. She said she never felt that way, and she couldn’t even live a day without being able to text me. She was in tears sobbing her eyes out that she wouldn’t be able to talk to me, and it warmed my heart because I honestly had begun to feel similarly.

We still didn’t date, because for some reason she still wanted “freedom” after being tied to 2 guys she didn’t like, and I kinda understood, but didn’t really care too much. She told me I was allowed to tell people (not our main friend group directly,) but randos in my class that I wasn’t single anymore, and she was the reason. 

Over the weeks after that, we progressed naturally, through deeper means, and sexually up to a blowjob, *shrugs*. It was the golden age of our relationship, about 1.5 months long.

One day, (end of February) something horrendous began happening and I had no idea. She got back from a detention (too many tardies) and didn’t hug me, didn’t really do anything, and just kinda was there physically. I asked her what was wrong and held her, and she just pushed me away.

I ran my head thinking what I could’ve done, what happened, and I had nothing. Present day I kind of see it. The days prior, I got clingy, and loved every moment with her, she made every second worth it’s weight in gold. I asked her if I was being too clingy, and she always said no. We openly said I love you to eachother, but after that day it stopped. A few times we had an argument when she was caressing our friends hair (male) or literally giving me no attention sometimes. I’m petty and I guess I needed that when I was in love with her. It was nothing major, the first cute little arguments.

But in the time period, I couldn’t figure out why she became distant because I thought she adored my affection towards her. Overtime it got worse and worse. Arguments, disagreements, less talking, shit like that. 

It eventually barreled over into the dark ages of our relationship, nothing yet compared to the nuclear holocaust that is now. This was during the beginning of March. We always argued, constantly fondled eachother, and had no real communication, so it was like getting a release of being horny with depression. 

Eventually came a pouring down day of rain. I was done. I had my heart broken from some of our major arguments during those days in March, and I was just alone without her laughter in my life. I still walked her home no matter what, and we stayed in silence up to her block. I finally burst and told her I couldn’t do this anymore. I was in love with someone who wouldn’t even talk to me. She stayed quiet the entire rest of the way home and I was heartbroken. She walked inside and I thought that was it. As I turned the corner covering my head with my hood, I hear smashing footsteps behind me to get tackled in a bear hug. She told me a few things, and said the reason she was so distant, is she felt that she didn’t want to be with a person that loved her so much that they would “die” for them, and it was too much pressure.  and such to be with them. Looking back, she got mad I loved and supported her too much smh. (I wouldn’t of died for her if you’re wondering)

I was dumbfounded and hurt. I said okay, hugged her, and walked home. We texted afterward, and she said she couldn’t lose me, and I said the same. We both decided to try again, but the day after, school was shutdown. We assumed it was for only a week or two, but then spring break rolled around and we were in quarantine. 

Over the days in quarantine it was argument after argument after argument. We broke each others hearts, insulted eachother, and broke every rule we set in the beginning.

The nuclear holocaust. 

Nothing made sense, we seemed to hate eachother, but love eachother too. We had a few days where we stayed happily together, the “imu” and “I want to see your cute face” but it always died soon after with a gunfight of words. 

One day she disappeared. For an entire month she was gone. I was at peace and almost forgot about her, but she came back and said she was grounded. We tried again, we argued, but less this time. 

This leads up to now. 

It’s been 4 days of where we were cute, no arguing, but tonight, we had another fight. Doesn’t matter about what, but it’s just awful. I currently barely like her. But what I still want, is the sad horny dopamine release I got from her, and atleast her comfort and security blanket. I’m not sure how irl will go, but I don’t know what to do.

I’ve threatened to leave countless times, and she says “don’t leave,” or something else more manipulative, and proceeds to treat me like trash and I do the same.

I miss her touch and laugh, and her smile. I want to go back to those days, but I fear they’re dead.  

I’ll be okay without her. But I want her. That’s the issue. With all the context you can decide how you’d go about it, and hopefully give me any suggestions you see fit. 

I’m lost. And I’m sorry if this was long, this is my first advice reddit post.

Thanks.",09Jul2020,1
601,"A longtime friend of mine is having a shotgun wedding in August which my husband and I recently received an invitation for. I initially told the bride that we would love to be there and will try our best to make it. We live in the US and upon our arrival into Canada, we will be required to self-isolate for 14 days. We will be able to attend the wedding on the 15th day as we plan to appropriately follow Canada's quarantine rules. 

My concerns have upset the busy bride and mom-to-be. Her friends being there for her is especially important because her family hasn’t been very involved or supportive about the wedding. 

Concerns:

- Husband will have to take 16 days off of work

- We will be paying for a 2-week stay at an Airbnb

- I won’t be able to freely see my family and friends as I normally do when visiting home (I’m Canadian)

- We will have to heavily rely on others for groceries and basic necessities. Alternatively, we spend even more on delivery services

- The ISOLATION. Not being able to leave the Airbnb even for a walk for 14 days feels too suffocating. Not to mention this will be our time off and we won’t be able to do anything at all.

With all this in consideration, we're considering not to go and simply gift the newlyweds a generous gift that would equal our travel costs along with covering the costs of two wedding guests. I really wish I could be there for them and also finally see the rest of my family and friends but the current situation is making this extremely difficult. Am I terrible for declining my really close friend’s wedding invitation?

Why the guilt?

The guilt stems from her traveling for my wedding and further, I have not shown any concerns on attending another mutual friend’s destination wedding next year. This is something she has expressed her own financial concerns for and is still planning on going to show her support.",09Jul2020,1

604,"This sounds like a pathetic (or troll) question but I swear it’s a genuine problem, so... hear me out.

Oh, I’m a teenage female in case that’s relevant.

I swear EVERY TIME I have a little bit of free time and sit down on my bed to get it over with, one of the relatives that I live in calls me for help with something or comes in or wants something and then I have to spend the rest of the day with them (e.g. my grandmas long rants) and can’t weasel away to a private space to get some satisfaction.

And you’d think I could peacefully do it at night before going to bed, but my despicable tired body always catches up with me and I accidentally fall asleep before finishing.

Our bathrooms don’t have locks and my relatives have a habit of just bursting in when they need to tell me something, so I don’t feel safe doing it there.

I haven’t been able to do it in two weeks or so and I slowly feel like it’s having a serious physical effect on me.

The person who is the newest, recently decided she wanted to contact me constantly.  She will send 10 messages in a row, or one huge message, and leaves multiple voicemails, within minutes of each other.  It's almost always something dramatized.  I left for 5 days, and while at the beach  one day  I left my phone at the hotel, I came back to 16 voicemails from this idiot.

I deleted most of them and listened to one, she was complaining that the lawn maintenance men the landlord has had for many years,  are not pulling weeds from her personal plants she has sitting outside, unless she stands outside and demands it every time.  She wanted me to contact the landlord and back her up, with any issues I have with him because she has a ""list"" of things he needs to address, but wants him to know other people also back her. I don't.  She then said the landlord should ""spring for mulch and plant stands"" since the plants she has brighten up the place, but complained he told her he didn't even want the plants.

613,"So as of now, I'm stuck at home doing chores, reviewing for exams, helping my grandmother and looking after my sister. It's pretty mundane and I wouldn't have it any other way except for the fact that we are constantly stressed in the afternoon when she's about to come home. My sister isn't the really the obedient type and can make quite a mess so it's up to me to clean up. I try my best to teach her how to clean up after herself  without accidentally hurting her in any way. Everything will be fine in the day time until she comes. My mom works as a teacher and works as hard as she can (sometimes even more than she can handle) so I can somewhat understand where all her rage is coming from but when she said her blood pressure was a bit too high, everything took a turn for the worse. Every single damn time she comes home, there's always something to complain and blame us about. Not one single day I don't get insulted and yelled at. Not one single day I see my grandmother smiling. Everytime she talks to my mom in happy way, I could tell it was fake and I knew why.

It would've been over then and there if that was it. Everytime we'd get into arguments, it always ends with her shutting me up or shutting me out and not even explaining what was wrong without her degrading me. What  hurts me the most is her hypocrisy. When she would argue with my father or is done berating me, she gets to cry her eyes out and scream like a banshee while I don't even get to cry or tell anyone about what I'm feeling. I get that streotype of boys don't cry and I think that was her mindset that she taught to me when I was young but preventing me to atleast express these really strong emotions just feels hurtful and wrong.

The worse part is that I realized what my father is feeling about her. I understand now why my father acts the way she does around her. My father usually jokes around and teases my mother and my mother usually dislikes it but I know that if they were both serious, it will always ends in fights which affects everyone. I understand why they aren't always together because if they were, they would always argue. 

The thing I hate about it the most is that she's unaware of what she's doing. She refuses to change and gets angry when we try to explain or just shifts the blame to me being a crybaby or weak. That part really hits me because I really try my best to put up with her yet she only makes it more difficult and refuses to acknowledge her flaws.

Please tell me, what can I do? I feel so close to breaking and I can't share this with anyone else besides me grandma. We just try to put up with it even if it hurts. I want to talk to her but how can I if she even refuses to touch the subject?",09Jul2020,1
614,"Edit: I'm 25 ftm and she is 27 f

My sister is not an easy person to talk to or to be around. She doesn't have conversations really, she just rants at people and it's too much for me to take. I recently spent the weekend with her and my mom who is also bad a conversations and really just monologues to people but at least it tends to be positive whereas my sister tends to rant about politics without considering whether the person agrees or wishes to engage in the conversation (she leaves no room for people to address her thought before moving on to the next one).

It's challenging for me to fully put into words the extremely negative affect she has on me whenever she talks to me, but this last trip was extra awful because I came out as a trans man and she did not take it well. It was so bad that I couldn't sleep or eat most of the weekend and when I got home it took me some time to recover. She sent me a really long text about wanting to watch youtube videos together and having a discussion and something that she often does is try to control a set up for a conversation. Like I know that she will want to watch the video and will have a prepared connection to some political idea that she has and how it relates to that video and will want a ""discussion"" on it but will bull doze me over with her ideas without allowing any room for me to actually address any of her points.

I feel ashamed of myself for allowing her to think I agree with her on things just because I don't want to deal with her tactics and because I don't want her to lash out on me. She takes everything extremely personal and will respond with anger if someone disagrees with her.

She also told me that if I ever feel hurt about people deliberately using the wrong name or pronoun than it will be my fault for feeling that way and that I shouldn't 'give people that power over me'. This is like preemptive gas-lighting.

I still don't think I properly explained everything because one of the issues is that being around her makes me so anxious I dissociate and forget what even happens sometimes. When I received the long text from her I almost had an anxiety attack. I just responded by telling her I was still drained from the weekend and to please wait until next week to contact me. Which of course she responded to with anger.

How can I effectively set boundaries with her? I feel like I won't have the right words to describe to her what I need and why. I'm also terrified that she will gas light me about being too sensitive or something. I just have no idea how to do this and any advice would be greatly appreciated.",09Jul2020,1

Now I have to note, that for some reason I used to reset my phone quite a lot and also make me google accounts each time for a fresh start. That combined with the fact that I don't know when I took that damn video  (sometime between 2017 and mid 2019)

I am now just 24/7 trying to remember when exactly I took the video, what google account I had at that time. The problem is that I don't remember and that's what's driving me crazy. I'm pretty sure that I never had google photos, but I'm scared that I maybe set it up once and forgot about it... I can't check now, the uncertainty is killing me.

I'm scared that somebody could hack my old google account, gain access to the video I thought I deleted, then somehow track me down and blackmail me with the video and publish it and send it to my contacts.

I really really need advice on how to stop thinking about this and maybe somebody telling me if my fear is rational at all??",09Jul2020,1

619,"Hello Reddit,

Any links I list will be separated by spaces around the periods as to not share any of these obviously bogus links.

I'm a guy in my mid-20s, so I don't usually find myself in tech issues I can't google my way out of. In the past few weeks every day I get about one text from different phone numbers such as:

""Hello (my real name)! You are Sexy! I am Sara, msg me back, OK? 166fn . 9oo9e . pyc""""Alo (my name)! I saw your profile. You are the coolest! Let's start sexting hsji . 61M . pyc""""Hey (name), wanna be wild together? I'm I am Alyssa, check out my kitty: 1ob4g . oxox . pyc""

These are just three of the most recent messages, clearly this is coordinated and they have more than just my phone number, but nowhere online have I seen how to handle this beyond just individually blocking each number as they come through, I also report the numbers to my carrier but that's so much effort for something that is just wearing me down. Does Reddit have any better ideas of how to handle this, or how this even begun happening to me in the first place? I've been experiencing it since about June 20th.",09Jul2020,1
620,"My name is Adam I believe i am just broken i was never able to make friends as a child, idk if it was my adhd but I was *and to an extent still am* just an annoying person, after a short time no one can stand to be around me. I first started fantasizing about auicide in grade school, mainly just due to loneliness but i kept hearing that it gets better in middle school, they it didn't, but it must get better in high school right, well then it got worse and the bullying and shit got bad enough that all my effort at school went into avoiding anyone my age. I would go to school do the bare minimum go home and play online games with the few people i found there. I have told people before that I truly belive in high school world of warcraft saved my life, it was the only way I managed to get to have friends without it I dont know how I would have survived that horrible time .

Through all the horribleness that was school my family life was fine hobestly my parents both loved me they got divorced when I ws like 12-13 but they were civil about it and I mean who doesn't get divorced now aways. So I feel like i can't blame my family for how I turned out, with some people who came from abusive homes or something like that i can understand how they became so fucked up but i really have no excuses. I seemed to really draw the short straw in the sence that most it seems atleast like most people who struggled socially during school atleast do well academicly, not I, I am worthless when it comes to studying or taking tests. 

But i stuck it out i thought ok it has to get better after high school and honestly it did, atleast the bullying stopped, but i had no plan at all i spent the first 2 years after high school working at Walmart, juat living day to day still living with my mom just going to work to pay bills and spending all my free time either playing video games or going on solo walks or bike rides. Over the years since then I have worked several general labor jobs and minimum wage jobs, I still have no plan all as far as a career is planned and I dont expect that ever to change.

And obviously with the never having had a friend or even really spoken to people my age not over the internet I have never even really spoken to women lol, as I write that out it sounds so pathetic.

In the end I am just sick of trying, I dont believe i can make my life better and I am just ready to give up, im either going to jump off a cliff near my place or jump in front of a semi... i just want to be done.",09Jul2020,1
621,"My father has pancreatic cancer, and is currently on hospice. He and my mother sleep in separate bedrooms -- not because there is any issue in their marriage, this has been the arrangement my whole life, because neither of them sleep well with another person in the bed and have very different sleep schedules, mom's a night owl that likes to read in bed late into the night and Dad usually gets up before dawn.

Most of my colleagues are young, fit and athletic people, whereas I am overweight (size 16). I'm actually not bothered by this, as I think I carry my curves well and am still reasonably fit as I exercise often. Despite this, most of my colleagues will regularly meet to go swimming, running or cycling, and often go on hiking breaks and things like that together, never inviting me. I have even helped them to plan trips and advised them on good routes and places to say, but am still not asked to join. This got quite annoying so I tried to mention their trips, which they would just shrug off. I sometimes didn't find out that they would all have gone until I saw it on social media. Before we were furloughed I overheard some of them discussing whether to invite me. The general consensus was that I'd be good at providing snacks but am way too fat - I'd just hold them up and get in the way. Shortly after that we were furloughed, and I was removed from various group chats. Now if people message me to ask for help with something I ignore them. They're happy to speak to me when they want something, but not otherwise. Am I being an asshole, or should I try and give them another chance? Should I have to prove myself to them?

626,"I (24F) just finished my masters degree in May. My field has been hit HARD by COVID-19 and most companies are not currently hiring and are not even sure if they’ll remain open/ reopen for the next season (I’m also in the US so things seem to be getting worse right now). 

I’ve applied to hundreds of jobs and had been planning to go to a job placement conference in March where recent/ soon-to-be grads can do lots of interviews with lots of different companies. That event got cancelled and moved online, but most of the companies I was supposed to interview with paused their search and didn’t even end up interviewing me. 

One company that I had done a screening interview with pre-pandemic continued to communicate with me and explain where they were at and what their plans were for the upcoming season. They felt like a good fit for me and seemed to like me. I did a few more virtual interviews with different staff members at different levels of their company and every interaction was overwhelmingly positive. I would have had to relocate for the position, but I did my research about the area and felt like I would really love living there. I really started to see myself in a new life with this incredible company. The position was basically my dream job for right after finishing my degree and everything about it felt so right. 

Cut to about 2 weeks ago and the HR rep called me and told me the most heartbreaking news: they absolutely loved me and wanted to hire me but COVID cases are rising in their area and they need to re-evaluate their plan for the upcoming season before they make any hiring decisions. She described it as a “brief pause on the candidate search” but assured me that if/ when they are given the green light to move forward, they’ll call me and that I should keep them updated on if anything changes on my end (like if I get another offer in the meantime). 

I’ve been continuing to apply and interview with other companies but haven’t had anything get further than a first round interview with any other company. The more time passes, the more it seems like that dream job at my dream company really won’t work out because of the pandemic. 

I know not to hold out for anything, and I’m still applying to as many other positions as I can, but I just feel so angry and frustrated and devastated. It’s almost worse than a rejection because if they didn’t want me, ok fine, but they DID want me. And I wanted to work there so badly. And no other company has given me the same feeling that they have, like that feeling when you just know that something is so /right/. 

I’m sad and angry all the time now and have been feeling more and more like a robot, just going through the motions of getting up, applying to jobs, eating dinner, and going to bed. At this point, I don’t even really care where I work. I have this mentality of “well I didn’t get what I want so now nothing matters anyway. I’ll literally work anywhere I guess.”

It weirdly feels kind of like a break up, and I just don’t know how to get through this and stay positive/ motivated. Any advice related to either the job search process or my emotional well being would be appreciated.",09Jul2020,2

During this time I started talking to a guy who is a cop and is also a student of a University I'm interested in. Since the BLM movement is going on I thought I'd ask him about what's going on since that would be first hand information. 

Let me clarify, I am not familiar with the discrimination that takes place but I do understand that whatever happened was extremely cruel and the certain cop was at fault. I tried discussing this with the guy I'm talking to and he didn't seem to criticize the act at all.

First off, I’m spanish and I really don’t know much english. I learned in school and didn’t surf the way much beyond whatever spanish community. 

Keeping it vague, I made an amazing friend this year. He’s really sweet, attentive, and overall a great guy

636,"Hi . I'm a 16 y/o in 11th grade. I live in India, we have a different education system from other countries. For us, we have to choose subjects according to what degree we want to get from 11th onwards. I hadn't discovered my passion back then.

 I had these options for the courses: maths (physics, chemistry and maths), biology (physics, chemistry and biology), commerce (business studies and maths) and arts (social studies and other subjects). I absolutely despise maths, so I couldn't choose that. I had zero interests in commerce. I definitely didn't see myself as an artist in the future. I didn't want to get an MBBS degree either. What other options were left? Being a dentist. Specifically an orthodontist. They have a good pay almost everywhere around the world and they live good lives too.

I initially didn't see any problem with being an orthodontist. So having no likeable choices, I took biology so I could get a degree in dentistry. Little did I know that I absolutely dont give a shit about teeth or whats being taught to me right now and I realised it within 2 months of having started my course. I literally have 0 second of attention span towards my lectures.

 My family was very supportive and had told me to choose or do whatever i wanted as long as id put efforts into it. I thought ""its okay, I'll choose bio because I dont have a passion in any single thing. If what I am being taught is nothing interesting or something that I care about, it'd still be my only option for making a living."" So I decided that i'd go through it no matter if I hated it or liked it.

Both luckily and unluckily I found my passion. Acting. After i realised it, I started to feel that putting in efforts in 11th and 12th for a dentistry degree was absolutely useless. I don't want to drop out because it would make me feel like a loser.

Since this field is a very competitive one, I am given a hell amount of workload. I have very less time to focus on anything related to acting. Even if I did use that much time, I would not be able to get any results because I am just feeling so numb and my thought process have slowed down so much because of all this.

What do i do? I dont want to die sad when im older and I dont want to be depressed right now either. The film industry is a very unpredictable one too and I dont fit in the general category of height and look preferences in the industry either.

I dont know what to do and I am so anxious about everything.

637,"Man this is kinda hard to explain but pleasee read. Me and my friend are really close but very different. She’s a really big overachiever, to a fault sometimes. She was really overweight when she was younger, and I think it has shoved her into a box of perfectionism ever since. She is also very personable and constantly making connections for anything she’s working towards, which I think are amazing qualities. On the other hand, I am very laidback and probably a little lazy, also to a fault. We fall on complete opposite ends of that spectrum. I sometimes get a little jealous when she does all this stuff, because people really like her and she does get a lot of ppl opportunities. But it’s definitely nottt fair to be jealous of stuff that she earned, so I really don’t let myself sulk about it. 

Her constant work is fine, it’s her choice. But, it feels like she’ll subtly shame me for not doing as much as her, constantly inquiring what I’ve been up to. If I’m like oh just chillin, she’s like “wow just chilling doing what? I’m sooo busy and overwhelmed with my new job.” Like bruh we just graduated in a pandemic can I please relax for a few months? And even at school it was the same old story. I think if I had an average roommate, I would never be judged for not being busy with schoolwork all the time. I wouldn’t even worry about that thought. Whereas my friend literally said “I don’t understand how people ever finish their work before midnight,” as I was home chillin, with my work finished before midnight. Midnight? Pls relax 

Every time I get upset about this, I tell myself to shut up, because it’s just a little jealousy. But a very real part of me feels like she can be so condescending in such sly ways and I shouldn’t shut myself down and say i’m just being petty. She told me the other day she’d been “praying for me.” ......I know maybe that’s a nice thing but am I crazy for also thinking that’s like kind of....an insult lmao?? Like do u wanna make me feel like I need praying for...? Her new job is also very similar to what I’ve always planned on doing with my life, something she had never ever considered.

When I told my friend how it went, I texted her and said thanks it was really helpful.

After a while I asked her for an apology as she though I had forgotten about it and she had the audacity to tell me that I didn't deserve an apology.

639,"My dad and I are close, and I care about him a lot. He often goes out to dinner with his friends or colleagues (at least once a week), and when he does this, it's almost guaranteed that he will come home drunk. He becomes really irritating to talk to and it's really frustrating when I need to discuss important things with him because he acts super childish when he's drunk and won't give me clear answers. One time a few years ago I had to basically drag him back to our hotel because we were on a trip together and he got super drunk, sat on the sidewalk and refused to walk and was too drunk to talk to me in coherent sentences.

He went on a business trip recently and the night before he left, my mother and I got into an argument with him over how he drinks too much and how it could put him into dangerous situations especially when he's far from home. He tells us that he drinks out of necessity because he's often meeting with company higher-ups to discuss ideas and they are more likely to listen to what he has to say if he makes them feel comfortable, and that requires alcohol. He also tells me it's because he's a man, and when men go to meet their friends they must drink. I would be fine with that if he didn't drink so much. Plus he denies that he's drunk every single time even though its absolutely clear that he is. 

I'm worried because he's going out and getting drunk more and more often. When I was younger I would go with him to his dinners with his friends to watch out for him and make sure he doesn't get drunk, but now that I don't really have time to go with him anymore, he gets drunk more frequently. I love him a lot and I know he loves me too but I don't think he takes me seriously because I'm only 14.  I've tried to tell him so many times to please drink less when he's out for dinner but he never listens. I just want him to at least try and reduce how much he drinks because I'm concerned about his health and safety.

Both really enjoyed those work experiences! As said before, I always thought about education, but was always scared I couldn’t do it. Education has always been in the back of my mind. 

I have decided to go back to school to peruse my masters in elementary education but my friends who are education majors/teachers, are scaring me. They are confused as to why I want to all of sudden make this change and telling me that it is really difficult. Right now I am studying for my GRE so I still have time to think about it. One of my friends (who is getting their masters in education) is putting a lot of pressure on me. She continues to ask where I see myself in 5 years (I am 24), what exactly I want to do, and told me I should pursue communications instead. It almost feels like she does not want me to do this. 

Have you ever gone to school for something completely different? Have you ever been confused with what career you want to do? Have people ever doubted you?",09Jul2020,1
648,"Let me preface this by saying that I know I am lucky to even have a job because there are so many people out there that don’t have one and I’m extremely grateful. 

I’m 32 and five months ago I moved out of state to take an entry level job that had potential of being promoted faster and making more money. I got the job through a friend that I’ve known since elementary school and is a couple levels in the company higher than me. Between him and the HR manager, they both said that the last few people were promoted with 2-3 months. I’m working in construction, so the area that I’m at, they’re expanding like crazy (which will open up positions) because there’s nothing but space to build here.

The job that I left, I had been there for over 10 years but a lot of the time towards the second half of that, I was unhappy. It wasn’t until the last year where things started to turn around due to a new manager stepping in. Although I knew I had something good going on, I think in my head I didn’t like the job for years and thought I had to leave. 

So here I am, about five months into the job and all I want to do is move back and take the job I had. My brain is telling me to stay here and wait it out because everything has pretty much gone right with the new job. The regional manager said himself that many people have spoken highly of me already. When I moved out here, my friend said I could stay with him just to get settled. I planned on moving out because it hasn’t been ideal living with them but they’re only charging me $500 a month for everything. If I do get promoted here, it’ll be about a $20k a year pay bump and have weekends off.

On the other hand, due to the corona virus I haven’t been able to meet new people and make friends. If I did move back, I would be moving to Florida and we all know how terrible that’s been with corona versus where I’m at now isn’t so bad. Even when I took the new job, I knew I would move back eventually but planned on staying a few years, get promoted and then transfer.

The reasons why I want to move back are things that can’t exactly be weighed. I agreed with a lot of the values and enjoyed the culture with the old company versus the new one. Looking back, it was more stressful but I think I strive in that more versus now it’s laid back. The way that the company treats their employees seems so backwards to me and the company I worked for previously. Being someone that’s worked in management and has now taken an entry level job, I see things a lot differently than other people in this positions. The company I’m in, they reward the people making $80k-$90k a year with bonuses and rewards for getting houses built fast but nothing for the entry level employees who make a mediocre hourly wage.

It’s weird because in these few months I’ve changed a lot and appreciate different things because I’m upset about the idea of how the company views their employees versus the money that’s going into my pocket.

I’ve kind of rambled on and tried to get all the facts across because I’m not sure what to do. I can stay, probably make more money for a company I don’t care for as much for as much and eventually move back or move back now to work for a company that I like, the people seem to care for me more but have a slower career growth. I’m an open book so if I left anything out, let me know and I can fill in the blanks.",09Jul2020,1

650,"My boyfriend is 20 and was recently diagnosed with OCD. One of his main symptoms is confessing to any bad or weird things he has ever done. Sometimes his OCD even makes up memories to feel guilty for and we've proven some of them wrong.  Most of the confessions are laughable but this isn't. He confessed 2 days ago and I'm so disgusted!! He admitted to having a phase of really liking incest porn when he was 13/14, and losing interest in it by the time he was 15. He said he recalls thinking about his mom in a sexual way a handful of times. He reckons he might've read something about mom/son sex and maybe he just thought ""oh what if?"" and that's all it was. He is adamant he never would have done anything with his mom and was never attracted to her and is ashamed of all this. 

He put it down to 13 year old desperation, that maybe he thought ""if no girl ever shows interest in me would I get desparate enough to do something with my mom?"". I am so repulsed reddit. He has apologised over and over and has made it clear he never creeped on her nor  thought about her while masterbating nor stole her underwear and liked girls his own age or celebrities at the time.

653,"TL;DR: my druggie felon neighbor that has violent tendencies won't get arrested or evicted despite illegal activity and being in violation of parole. I'm a single woman living alone and don't feel safe. Any suggestions for how to handle this.

Hey guys! So I need some advice. I am a young woman living alone, and I have a neighbor in my apartment complex that makes me feel uncomfortable and unsafe.

I've avoided him and his girlfriend since I've lived here (a few months) because they honestly just seemed like weird druggies, the guy scratched my car within like a week of my living here and denied it, and they just argue a lot and are super loud in the parking lot at night pretty regularly. Just seemed like people I didn't want to associate with, but no biggie I guess.

A few days ago though, I woke up to crying, screaming, and banging at my front door after the guy apparently tried to beat up the girlfriend. I ended up having to yell at the guy to stay away (was a bit scary because he was obviously on drugs and had just been beating up the gf), calling 911, and sheltering her in my apartment until the cops came. While the gf was in my apartment, she told me A LOT that made me feel so unsafe that he had been living right next to me this whole time. He ended up being arrested, but was out the next day--I don't know if the gf dropped the charges or what.

I emailed the property manager to tell her about that night's events and ask how this might be handled. Was told this needed to be handled ""within the household."" I emailed her again, saying I legitimately did not feel safe that the guy was living there (don't care about the gf) and asked if it mattered at all that they were in violation of the lease by possessing, using, AND selling drugs (like hard drugs, not weed). Was told that they would only be evicted because of that if the police were constantly being called because of it basically.

I was upset by this, but was not too concerned because I had been led to assume that the guy would move out and the girl would stay, but last night I learned that the opposite was happening.

This guy is a felon on probation in another county, so he is in violation of that by even living here. Not sure why he wasn't kept in jail because of that.

I feel unsafe because he clearly has mental issues going on, the drug combo probably heightens this, and I cussed him out and harbored his gf the other night. The landlord won't evict him, the police didn't keep him despite probation violation and general illegal activity. So like, what do I do? He's unemployed, but his parents have been bailing him out financially so I don't see him getting kicked out based on that.

I'm buying pepper spray and a stun gun today to hopefully sleep better at night, but my lease isn't over until October so I'm kind of stuck here. Any advice? Either legal suggestions or just tips to help me feel more secure appreciated!",09Jul2020,1
654,"Please read! (I'm down to reward the best advice-giver in some way. Consider this a business consulting gig😁)


What's up? I am very new to reddit so I hope I am doing this right. I decided to turn to here because I (and my family/friends) have been looking at my situation from MY perspective for too long and I would really value an outside opinion.

Some Background:
•I love cooking+went to culinary school
•I started a business I'm highschool that offered cooking lessons and cooking parties. (It was fun but I didn't make that much)
•During quarantine I decided to change things around a little and offer my services online. But how? I did my research and ran the numbers and chose to offer an online ""Culinary Boot-Camp"" of 20 pre-recorded videos for $50. I would release them every week day for a month, and people that joined in the beginning would follow along, and people that joined late could watch at there own time. It seemed like an awesome idea (and I got 10+ pre-registrations in the first few days of test-marketing.) Hosted on Uscreen which costs $100 per month but would have been worth it.
•BUT: I don't really know how to film/edit professional looking videos so my first try was trash. Also I was extremely nervous and it took me forever to film and edit. Like there was no way I could create one class every day. Very stressful. So I postponed the class start for a week. 
•So then I tried again, and again, then postponed again and tried again, and again. And it still sucked and I was upset and depressed. Every time I tried, it sucked. So I decided to say ""we're not starting for a while, I need to figure things out""
•I bought a better camera, bought a better software, and took  a month to teach myself the basics. (And to get more comfortable speaking in front of the camera). 
•I finally finished the first video and it came out amazing! It's not perfect but I realized its time to move on and get going. I am actually super happy with it. 
So here is where I need your advice.

What do I do now????

I know that if I try to do the original plan it will fail again in some way. There is no way I could make good videos (that are worth people's money) in one day, everyday, for an entire month. It was an unreasonable idea.
Also, I want to start soon, because summer is almost over and while this could be offered as an after school activity, I feel that there is a better chance at marketing it as a summer camp.

I could try to post 3 per week? But that would still be pretty crazy and the class-quality would not be as great (because I would be rushing). And I would be stressed out for the next month.

I could do it all on ouTube, for free (which would give me more freedom with when I could post and what I could do and allow me to be more mentally stable). But this risks not making any money, it takes a while to make anything on YouTube, right? But maybe this has even more potential..of eventually building into a real channel with sponsorships? 

I could create all of the classes first and then post in August/September?

Am I charging too much/not enough?

What do you think? What am I missing?  Please let me know! 
Thanks❤️",09Jul2020,0
655,"So I like this guy from my previous research institute. He used to help me with some stuff with my work and we had nice conversations but never got to hangout besides work (except for twice maybe, that too with bunch of other friends).

He's really sweet and nice and soft spoken but he's also very shy and focused in work (he's a theoretical physicist can you blame him). He's cool though, progressive and liberal, reads plenty of good stuff, once straight up threatened to resign in protest when some injustice was done to another student. You see I very much admire him.

Anyway, last year around this time I had left the institute so our small conversions that we seldom had on corridors stopped. I didn't have his number and he is not on social media.

Three months back I found his twitter and messaged him. Our conversations we a bit different. It was like writing long letters. We spoke about our likes and dislikes and other things but typically he would reply a week later. It's like writing letters, there was substance (long messages, multiple topics) and the wait time. 

So I would take the time he had taken to respond plus few days extra and he would reply in exact same days I took (no extra). And his replies would be long and intrested, not aloof at all. It's like a weird old school flirting game we are playing.

Last time he said that he doesn't use twitter much. (it's not that popular in our country, even I use it once a week to see what's going on with other people in the scientific community, we're still using Facebook and Instagram for social media). So I asked him for his number.

He took like a month to respond this time and gave me his number amongst following up with other messages. This time he apologized for the delay and said it was because of the internet disruption. Which is true because, there was a natural calamity in his town and even my friends from there who message me regularly couldn't communicate. So I know he's not lying.

Now my question is how long should I wait till I message him on his number? Should I wait ususal time and message one month later or just two weeks later so that I don't come off too desparate.",09Jul2020,1

We mutually decided that I should come to his state and 14 day quarantine in his bedroom since he is military and we would have access to a hospital if either I or our 2 year old daughter ended up getting sick.

I asked him if I should stay because my state has the highest surge in the nation at this time and he was dancing around it without directly saying no I don’t want you to stay.

660,"I dunno where to go except for here( I don even want to bug my best friend about this):

A little background,  i am M 18 and i am struggling with my education, not financially but academically. I failed ALs on my first try and didn't go back to do it ever since. Instead do a foundation course at a uni to prepare and obtain enough marks for  my Mechatronics engineering(robotic/programming/electrical) degree. Last month i failed at my first try at a  simple Math test (less content in the test  than Cambridge math).
I am currently working to make ammends for the resit this month. but my history of failure is known well to my parents. instead find myself loosing interest, concentrating and focus all to sloth day by day. 

I am very passionate about Digital art and love  drawing and painting for hours and still im not sick of it. I also love building things and tinkering (hence I chose Mechatronics engineering)
 I met this girl who i really really like.  we were close friends for 2 years and went to the same school. we never wanted school affairs because they were really just overrated with everyone doing it. we liked each other near the end of the school year. for 8 months we had a thing going on (we like it slow) and we agree we're not gonna be dumb about it. she's smart, shes very very kind, adorable, shy but funny and silly (with me) and i love how open we are.... we are polar opposites in a way but still love each other. i started to change for her :) ever since meeting her and because i wanted to. i love her so much i love doing stuff for her more tha  she does me and i enjoy that. my parents know and hers know briefly about this. she makes me happy and reminds me that the world is not such a bad Place after all. ive had rough patches before. i love her too much I can't describe it and i know some things dont last forever but i want this to. It will be a long distance relationship because her parents and she wants her to go into the field of medicine for 6 years. It will be tough but i will do my best to keep us together :)

FFW to now my mother had previously lectured me on how i failed ALs and i cant afford to fail my Foundation. I understand nothing is easy in life and i started working at least even a little bit to make ammends for my slacking off. she cried and said not to force her to give up on me (i  have a sister and my parents are both retired and we have limited finances.). Few moments ago when i sat down to start work she came up to me and asked me what im going to do with life. i stayed quiet. i mean i loved digital art but can't see it as a stable income and the other part of me wants the college education to prove everyone wrong rn tho I can't see my life going anywhere. ive always loved the idea of being an entrepreneur. i always wanted a college education to see how far id get in life. now not so much im just on the fence but scared about falling on both sides. 
she then told me(im just breaking it down for u) im gonna flunk the resit as well then id have to get a job and suffice for myself and pay back my parents for everything they spent on me. she said that my girlfriends mom will never accept me because I won't have a college degree. she said I won't have a future and i made the wrong decision loving her. tbh i saw some truth in that
i was hurt but this isn't the first time .

my parents and several ppl repeat the same things;
im dumb, im annoying, i talk too much(A crush once said that and i felt so bad ever since), i am a failure.( even my girlfriend says these stuff(except failure and dumb) when she's ticked off , but she never means it. sometimes it hurts because i know its true even when she says she's sorry.)

being told these things made me insecure. my gf on the other hand was bought up in the most loving family u cud find. theyre united and she lives them. my family is blurry. my mom and dad barely speak, show love etc. i used to cry hours on end about insecurities involving friendships, happiness, my parents imsults at me and my self image. My father is disappointed. i wont lie ive wasted so much money, time etc.

now with what my mom said before it makes me think if im ever enough. what if noone will ever want me. the feeling that makes me cry sometimes is loneliness. i feel so alone in this. i sometimes dont know who to talk to about it until i force myself to. what if i fail again , what if her parents dont approve. what if we never end up together (ik its dumb and cringy to assume we wud but then again its a waste spending time with ppl u dont assume ud end up with) what if she'd end up with someone else? where will that leave me. i feel like such a mess, a failure i might as well die rn. only thing holding me back is morales. i feel so alone it haunts me sometimes. sometimes thers  this feeling or voice telling me consistently they don't want you. that fills me with anger, ego and sadness. i am a wreck and idk what to do with my life. what if i fail college? what if my moms words are exact. its shameful to say I don't have a college degree i just work. how far will that take me ik i camt get well paid without one. i just feel 

lonely. and no amount of hugs can ever make me feel good.




sorry. If u made it this far thank you. im so sorry for the vent.... thank u for reading i really appreciate it.

Tl;Dr: My gf is gonna be a medical student. im on the fence about college and my mom says ill fail and her parents will never accept me (if it comes to that) im seated here crying feeling the most alone. im slightly ok for  now, afteri wrote this ...)

I emailed them at the beginning of May asking what I should do and if I should be concerned about getting my car towed, and I never received a response. We had also tried to call the office a couple of times with no answer. 

This morning I walked outside to find that my car had been towed. I called around and found it and then called the office to basically say wtf.

670,"My background: I'm a proficient programmer, I used to work as a game designer for a free-to-play video game (that I am no longer affiliated with), and I have some basic knowledge of other technical fields that you need to create a video game (art, 3D modeling, mathematics, creative writing). I had previously participated in minor game jams, making simple game prototypes in Flash, Unity, or Godot, most of which are lost to time by now. At the same time, I'm utterly clueless about the more social areas that an indie gamedev needs: marketing, management, social media, etc.

Right now I have an unrelated job that leaves me with quite a lot of free time, and I've been thinking of putting this time into making a video game. I have an idea that had been gestating in my mind for quite a while, and I would very much like to make it a thing. Problem is, it's not a small idea that can be prototyped over a weekend. It's an RPG, most similar to West of Loathing, but more story-focused. There is nothing about the game itself that is outside my proficiency; I'm pretty sure I can make it *eventually*. But I have no idea how much time it would take. 

And, much more importantly, I don't have a plan beyond just putting hours into it until it's done. Browsing around this subreddit, people's success stories, or relevant Youtube videos, I see people doing things like building a community, getting into Steam wishlists, getting people to test it, reaching to publishers, or running Kickstarter campaigns. A lot of people say that you should start promoting and marketing your game long before it's released. And I just don't know how to even approach this. If I don't have a game to show, how would I get people interested? If I don't already have a reputation as an honest developer, would people really contribute to my Kickstarter campaign?

671,"I think the title is pretty self explanatory...

Me: me
friend: B
Crush: C

Basically, all three persons in this scenario have been in college together because we were part of a select few to still come in, and so us as well as our other friend O (m17) and J(nb17) so we’ve all been in college spending a lot of time together. 

Me and B have been friends for ages, we went to high school together and in the last two ish years became good friends, at one point we were best friends but since then we have different lifestyles where she’s more hippy/chill and i’m more preppy/party, but we still get on super well. 

Me and C have been friends since college started, but we’ve become really close in the last 10 months, almost considering each other best friends but not quite, just close friends. 

But he’s been the only person i’ve properly seen during lockdown and we’ve got closer so i’ve developed mild feelings for him.. 

So we’ve all been spending time at college together, and obviously me and C have been spending a lot of time together because we’re closer with each other than the other people who are in; our “group” who have hung out has been me, B, C, O, and J. 

Me and B had a video chat thing for a college application today which we attended together, and while our mics were muted she starts laughing and saying she needs to tell me something, so i asked her what, and she said “i know you guys are close so you can’t tell him, but C’s kinda cute”, and i just didn’t know what to say. I’m not mad at all obviously, she doesn’t know i like him and he’s a charming guy so i’m not surprised she does after spending the week around him, but i was just kinda shocked because obviously i also do, so i just asked about it and then started getting excited for her, and then she said she kind of liked him but she’s not sure. 

Sorry it’s so long. But i guess my advice i’m asking for is what should i do? Me and B always fall for the same guy, it’s happened probably three times in the past, and she’s dated my exes, and one guy ended up going out with me instead of her, we’ve never taken it personally and theres no hard feelings because we know people like who they like and i guess we just have a very similar taste in guys, but i just don’t know if i should tell her i also like him? 

Is it best to stay quiet and see if her or my “crush” on him passes? Should i tell her? 

I love both B and C to pieces platonically too so i don’t want to do anything that could potentially hurt either of them. 

Thank you!",09Jul2020,1

673,"What I'm saying here only applies during summer vacation. I currently have a summer camp that I attend that starts at 1pm in the afternoon, so I don't think it's necessary for me to be up really early. My parents always want me to sleep before 10pm on both weekdays and weekends and during the school year, I completely understand, but I think I should be allowed to sleep and wake up later as it's vacation. They it's because when I stay up late, I often wake them up when I move a chair or switch off the lights, just making noise in general. However, when my younger sibling wakes me up at 8am, they say it's ok because it's 'time to wake up'. I don't think I need to be awake that early as I take a bus at 12pm, and I've tried telling them that I consider myself to be a night person but either they don't understand what it means to be a night owl or they don't believe me. They say that people should be awake in the morning and asleep at night, but I don't see the reasoning behind it.

676," For context, he lives on the other side of the US, but we met through shared interests and now after a little over a year, we're best friends. We talk daily and voice chat, are learning a language together, send snail mail, etc. My mom knows he exists and knows his name, and I've told her a little about his past (his father was a high-up oil guy, raised him on a large estate in the woods, and my friend inherited much of it after his death just a few years ago) so I think she's vaguely aware he has money. I didn't know until about six months into knowing him when he was talking about buying acres of land and building a house when he's a little older, and I said, ""Where are you going to get the money? Do you have a rich aunt?"" and he told me, ""I am the rich aunt"" and explained his situation.

On the other side of things I'm (17M) trailer trash and my family has been on the brink of eviction a few times in my life, although things are a little better/more stable in recent years.

He just told me he's sent me a watch in the mail, a g-shock tactical sort of watch. And my 18th birthday is also in a few months, and he's told me he's going to send me money but won't say how much. He told me if I'm uncomfortable with how much, to keep the appropriate amount and donate the rest to charity. I don't know for sure, but my intuition says he's sending me a thousand dollars. For much of my life, there hasn't been a thousand dollars to my mother's name. That's more than a month's rent.

I wish I could say I was against the gifts and just tell him not to send me things or give me money, but I'm not. I just need to explain to my mom, and she was upset just learning that he's a few years older than me. He's not my sugar daddy and he's not a catfish.

677,"I posted this on another subreddit but I'm posting again because I want a lot of feedback.  We moved to a sleepy Colorado mountain town about two years ago, kind of on a whim. We were van life people at the time, and driving through the town, we just really enjoyed the winter, and the skiing, and two years late, we're still here with an apartment and jobs and two dogs. 

My husband is an electrician, and I work for a ski resort, but I have worked in a bunch of different fields. He's kind of reached the plateau at his job. There are like three total electric companies in town, and they're all relatively small, and he's only getting paid $16 an hour (he's still technically an apprentice, but still that's really low pay for an electrician) and even before COVID he wasn't allowed to work overtime because they just can't afford to pay it. 

I'm not attached to my job, and frankly we're both a little over it with the small town life, and there is very limited housing here because it's a mountain town in Colorado, so the little housing there is seems to cost a fortune. We have two friends who currently live in Portland, and they keep telling us how amazing it is, and we want to go. I've been to Portland before, as a tourist in college, and I did like it a lot. Also, Portland is a bigger city than where we live now, which is what we want, it's close enough to hiking and Mt. Hood and I've looked online, there's like two or three ski slopes within a 2 hour drive, and according to our friends it's not too far from the beach either. 

The one friend we have is a buddy of my husband's who is also an electrician and has confirmed he can definitely get him a job. I don't have the same assurance, but I've been nosing around job sites like Indeed, and I think it's possible for me to find some work, though granted it might take time. We have like $6500 in savings right now, and we wouldn't leave until like September, so we can still save up a little more. Are we insane? Is this a bad idea? COVID has me second guessing all my life decisions.",09Jul2020,0

694,"For this story to cut down on the confusion and pronouns I will use letters

M= controlling mother

F= Friend

me= me

My friend, F, has a mom, M, who runs her house like a dictator and doesn't listen to anyone. M has actively gone out of her way to make F feel like she is less than her and has no say. If they get into an argument M doesn't let her speak and won't listen to F when she does. If F ever tries to get her point across M just takes things away from her. Whenever F tries to bring in someone else like her dad or sister or favorite teacher to help M just acts like she is attacked and then takes things away from F. M also pulls the I'm your mom and what I say goes card whenever she doesn't have an actual argument and just want things to go her way. It seems to have gotten bad enough to the point where F's dad is as she put it ""scared to argue with M"". F has tried going to her grandparents but M won't listen to her own parents and is controlling of them too. M is just controlling the family like a dictator.

I've tried to do my best to give F advice and help her find a way to get a solution but F doesn't seem to think anything will work, and is afraid she might lose me too if she argues too much. I hate to see F like this because she seems so miserable, and I want to help but I don't know how. F and I are both 17 so its not like cutting ties and communication will work, and I can't see anyway to have an intervention occur without M feeling ""attacked"" and taking things away from F. Other reasons why I don't think an intervention would work is because the only people its really affecting is F's family and M already doesn't listen to them. 

I've heard F complain about her mom before and I've tried to do the best I could, but I'm running out of ideas. I don't want to say just wait until you can move out and away from your mom and cut ties with your family because F still loves her family and I don't want to see F throw her family away. I also don't want to wait until that time comes because I want to help her now, and I'm tired of seeing her feel helpless and sad.

700,"TL;DR Live in city&gt;expecting shit storm from societal collapse in next few months&gt;should I stay or should I go?

With the future so uncertain, I have devised several options for me to be able to avoid or at least lessen what I see as a very difficult future. I live in a medium sized city in a decent area. I came here for school and was fortunate enough to be able to pursue that alone. I signed up for Internship (which was supposed to start May 5) but have seen nothing, ZERO, bupkiss from the school.

When ppl start running out of money and the 20+% of the out of work population start getting evicted there will be an increase in the already tense social situation. When people get desperate for resources they become violent. I do not want to get caught in the middle of it with armed groups going house to house kicking in doors and taking whatever they want and raping whomever they choose; which if you know anything about how militias, solders, or citizens operate in war zones when they have nothing to lose and all the power, that will be the case.

So, the options I am trying to narrow down are thus:

1. go to the small school I got accepted to. It is in a 60+% republican area up north where it gets really cold and the town has zero to do. The school keeps saying they will have actual classes but keep hinting to going all online in November. My degree really needs to be in a studio situation. I won't have instate tuition for a year which would hurt because its double
2. stay here and see if nothing happens, in which case I'm cool with that but if it does it would not be a good place to be. I have a decent affordable apt. My school is shite but also all online and I may be able to parlay into a better school in this state when I get instate tuition rates in a few months. And It's warm but; I think things could get ugly real quick if the shit starts to hit the fan.
3. trade my 6yo car for a boat and move to a marina. The slip rent is about a quarter what I pay. I like to be on the water and if things get real bad in the remainder of the year I could just sail away. I like the freedom of being able to just leave and I love to sail.

701,"(WARNING: Mentions of sensitive topics, and Self-harm)

This is my first post and English ain’t my first language, so take it easy on me. A little info about me: I’m a 13 year old girl (ik ik don’t @ me), with extremely over reacting parents.
I’ve been showing signs of an anxiety disorder growing up, and have started having panic attacks about a year ago, every attack stronger than the other. I also tend to over think so much that it often leads me to crying. I have stage fright and get extremely nervous during social situations (I tend to sweat, stutter, bounce my leg, sometimes even get dizzy in extreme situations). Which lead me to believe I might have some sort of anxiety disorder, but I, of course, don’t want to jump to conclusions but instead see a professional and get a proper diagnosis, the only thing stopping me are my parents.
I doubt my parents are very educated when it come to the topic of mental disorders, don’t get me wrong tho, my parents are amazing and have raised me in the best way they possibly can. The only reason that’s stopping me from telling them is how they reacted to my self-harm, to make a long story short, my mom started crying and hitting herself, and instead of talking to me she took away my electronics, my dad decided to talk to me while my mom calmed down, but I lied and told him that stress is what led me to do what I did, and yet he told me ‘You’re too young to know what stress really is.’ So you can tell that that slightly effected me in telling them about how I feel.

707,"Super long story so let me sum it up.

I was abused very badly for the majority of my life. I have extremely bad jealousy issues and a need of acceptance because of this. 

This caused alot issues with my  boyfriend and I. He basically dropped me for some stupid game and lied to me multiple times regarding it despite me being supportive. This has left me with an extreme fear of being replaced by a video game and him finding other people who are better than me on there. 

Recently, my dad kicked me out and disowned me 2 years after my mother did because of this, My depression has been extremely bad. I'm honestly extremely close to suicide. 

Today, after a 6 month break, he announced he was thinking of playing again and began playing 5 hours after saying that. I had no time to prepare. With everything else going on, I feel extremely worse. I feel like we're going to go in a circle and hes going to start ignoring me and lying to me again. Hes going to replace me. 

With any other game, I have no feelings. I dont mind him playing video games jnfact, i encourage it. I want him to have fun and to have time for himself. Its only fair. It's just this one specific game that's caused so many problems. 

I want to get better so he can have fun. I just honestly feel like I cant deal with it. I cant go through that again. If anything bad happens regarding it I honestly think itll be the breaking point for me and I'll be in serious danger. 

How do I get over this fear? I feel like he brought it up at an extremely bad time and gave me absolutely no time to prepare. I'm terrified. Please help.",09Jul2020,1

Hey reddit here’s a bit of background to my situation. I’ve been dating my girl for 13/14 months. We both wanted kids in the future but not at such a young age because we wanna be able to sort our lives out first and be stable. I’m just starting university and don’t live with gf (we both still live at home). 
She’s currently pregnant with my child (definitely mine) and it was accidental. We were having regular sex but tracking fertile windows and cycles to deliberately avoid having sex on days with pregnancy risks. However she still got pregnant. We’ve had some arguments in the past but totally disagree on the pregnancy front. She wanted to (and ultimately chose to) keep the baby and said well if you don’t like it then walk away. This to me was not an option because I feel I should provide for any child I make but I am not happy about it really. Even after explaining all my reasoning to my girlfriend she still chose to go against my wishes and she’s now 25 weeks. I can’t help but resent her for doing this, it’s completely knocked my life off course and I just feel it’s a bit selfish for her to disregard me, my feelings, plans and well-being for only her own when we are supposed to be a partnership. Hearing her complain about the inconveniences that she has in her life now she to having the child, like what she will do for work, really angers me.

I’m not attached to the child and probably won’t be for some time, I’m sorting out things like my finances to help contribute but don’t know if I can stay with my gf due to the feelings I now have towards her, I know this won’t be constructive for my baby, how/should I move past this? I can’t help my feelings atm but hope to resolve them, any ideas on what may help?

He is a great swimmer and says he doesn't need one, and also doesn't care about the law. He is extremely frugal and lives way under his means. I think he doesn't want to spend the money on one and doesn't want to look ""stupid."" This seems really really absurd to me and I feel he is going to ruin my experience somehow, like maybe a water cop will come by and tell us to leave if he doesn't have one.

Before that I used to be out the house morning to night and my family understand that I’ve been really struggling to stay home but still do so anyway. 

My parents and siblings refuse to social distance however and they just say that if they catch the virus or die from it that they’re going to die eventually. Most of us (inc. myself with multiple health issues) in the house are vulnerable (part of the group that should be taking even more precautions) but they still go out anyway. I’ve expressed to them on multiple occasions that they shouldn’t, so now they don’t tell me when they’re visiting someone/ going to family dinners at other peoples houses (with more that 10+ people). They just tell me to stop getting annoyed and that they won’t catch it.

It’s so exhausting, they’re acting like teenagers sneaking out the house and not taking precautions. I can’t move out and can’t stay with another person who’s taking isolation seriously.

Is anyone else struggling with this and how are they dealing with it? Any advice? talking to them will do nothing as I’ve used every approach. I feel anxious everyday and it doesn’t help when I’m taking multiple medications already to deal with already present health issues

736,"This ended up a bit long.  I'll put a tl;dr at the bottom and the title pretty much sums it up.

  


My fiance bought his (now our) house about three years ago and I moved in within the last year.  He never really got to know his neighbors but I have been introducing myself so there is a baseline relationship there. It's mostly elderly ladies that hang out on their porches all day long. 

Next door to us, right up against our house, is an empty plot of land owned by one of our neighbors.  My partner and I looked into the property and we really want to buy it.  It would give us a really nice outdoor space one day.  We're not in a rush or anything, but we came up with a plan.  The original plan was to not be pushy in the slightest and to just let the neighbor know that if and when she is interested in getting rid of it to please let us know first.  We also were considering offering things like buying it but still letting her have full use of it or tending it until she's ready to sell since it was obvious she is having a hard time keeping it up herself.

This was what we were going to try before we met her and now we need to rethink.

Walking by the other day she was outside and next to the sidewalk and I finally got the chance to meet her; she actually spoke to us first asking us about our dog.  Her brother was there next to her helping with some stuff.  First off, this 86-year-old woman is awesome.  She's witty and interesting.  It was quickly revealed to us that she has dementia.  She's still pretty with it but you can certainly tell she's advancing.  Her brother got my number to keep in touch in case of emergencies and I think I have his number (I got it from her yesterday...should have thought of it while he was there).  For the most part I'm sure he's taking some care of her but he definitely put me off the way he talked about her like she wasn't there...but that's a bit of my own personal hang-up.  My grandmother, who was the biggest thing in my life, like a mother to me, had dementia.  Anyway, the brother said she will likely have to go to a home soon.  

Yesterday, the woman was out gardening while I was outside and I went over to talk with her about nothing in particular.  I thought she would like to meet my new little dog.  She was planting. She's got a crap ton of plants she tends to I don't know how she does it; I have one plant and it's...not right.  I offered our help with the weeds in both her yards, but I don't think she understood.  I got the impression it's *possible* she doesn't want it messed with. I don't think I mentioned that the large vacant lot she owns is reeeeally overgrown. If it weren't for the pandemic she would be facing mucho fines.    


Unprompted during our conversation she told me that she only bought that lot originally to have a place to park her car and because it was packaged with her main lot.  She didn't have much interest in it. She didn't say anything about her car but I've noticed it hasn't been there for weeks; I'm assuming she can't drive anymore.    


She also told me about some folks she's been helping out that have taken advantage of her kindness.  Like, seriously. She wasn't bitter or anything it was just a conversation.  It raised my eyebrows, though.  


Ok. So,  


Now I don't know how to approach this.  How do we let her know that if she decides to sell we would like first crack?  


Here are my concerns:  


\- I could ask the brother but I don't want to go over her head like she doesn't matter anymore. 

\- If we don't ask in time (and it could be soon) it will be sold before we know it. I mean, probably not, we're not in a super high-demand area, but I like to be prepared.  
\- What if we ask her and she just consents because (as she told me) she loves to help people? I want to approach this in a way that is not taking advantage over AT ALL.

\- I'm quite concerned that if we approach this the wrong way she might get angry (that dementia angry, if you know, you know).  She might think we're trying to take something from her.  Again, this is not the case at all; we are purely interested in buying it when she absolutely no longer wants it. This is my biggest concern, especially since if we tick her off she might stay mad at us and I like her...

\- A back-burner concern is paying a fair price; the lot is not valued very high.  I don't want to over-pay but I feel like talking the price down is not really an option in this case.

My bf is a really nice guy so he would tell a ugly girl she’s pretty to help boost her self esteem. The whole reason we started arguing was because I told him I wanted to be curvier so I would be more attractive. He was like I like you the way you are I think your beautiful is that not enough. I then explained to him he’s only telling me that bc I’m his girlfriend and that’s his job...also that he sees beauty in everyone so I can’t take his opinion seriously. He says I’m in the wrong here.. so do you think I’m wrong or he’s wrong?,09Jul2020,1
745,"I honestly have been so fuckin annoyed lately. One of my friends who I viewed as being very close with is slowly drifting and both of us know. But I don’t want that to be the case and like a good friend I’ve admitted my faults but I’ve also reminded them how I’ve been a good friend and how I’m willing to improve. I’ve tried fixing things and at some points I thought it was working but.... it seems to not. 

We’ve had a few recent fights in the last few months and we’ve gotten past it but now things are different. I asked them if they want to be my friend or not and they’re like “idk” and they sent me this whole paragraph reminding me how I’ve not been a good friend, how other people have done better than me in being a friend, and to top it all off, a side of shit to make me feel like crap. We talked on the phone to clear stuff out a few days ago but last night he came back with these screenshots he took when I retaliated saying “I’m done trying to prove myself to you...bye.” (I needed to end it as there was nothing good coming out of it and I needed to clear my head) but now it’s back and it’s like nothing I said left a mark. 

He’s acknowledged my good points but is still upset with me for whatever reason and still insists he doesn’t care if I leave or not. 

But when I threaten to leave  and have basically one foot out the door he guilt trips me and says I can’t maintain a friendship cuz I’m not chasing after them🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️ ummm wth?!?!? Why do I need to chase someone who makes me feel unwanted, after someone who would turn on me like that and say stuff to make me feel bad and have the nerve to ask other ppl leaving my side out of things. 

I don’t want to block cuz I know he’ll use that against me with our mutual friends but at the same time he needs to understand his actions has consequences and he’ll get what he asked for. I do care about them a lot or else I wouldn’t be feeling so torn, and I know I’ve had great times with them. But the fact he’s turning on me and is making me feel like this is just so frustrating and I can’t end a convo cuz it’s like he secretly wants me to stay when I go. Like no, you asked for this so don’t expect to pull me back when you’ve treated me like this. 

I want things to end slowly if it’s not meant to be and not messy but idk what to do. Please send advice, I don’t feel comfortable asking anyone else cuz I know it might lead back to my friend making things worse and I don’t want to be a snake. Please send advice please🙏🙏🙏",09Jul2020,1
746,"Sorry if this isn’t the right kind of post for this place. I’m just stressed and need to get it off my chest.

I recently took in a (now) 6 week old kitten that a coworker rescued from the road after I was tossed from a car. No one else in the office would take it, and I was somewhat peer pressured into just taking it.

I’ve had it for 2 weeks now and, honestly, I just don’t think I can keep it. I’m living in a different state temporarily for work, and I have a tiny apartment that it has to stay in all day. 

When I get home, there is not a moment where it’s not biting me or scratching me (playfully but painfully) or crying because I put it in a different room. It was cute at first, but it has made me legitimately miserable at home now.

I’ve considered “oh it’ll grow out of this”, but then I think about the fact that it’ll have to come with me to an apartment back home, and I’ll have to pay yet another cat fee/cat rent there every time I sign a lease, and I’ll always have to worry about it being miserable in a 1 bed apartment by itself all day.

No one around me has been able to find him a suitable home, and I’m starting to seriously consider taking him to the local humane society. Am I just an awful human for resorting to this? Do I have any other options besides keeping him? I don’t want to do craigslist or something like that due to the abuse stories I’ve heard.

I know it’s not really a deep question and I know what most people’s answer will be, but I’m just really feeling down about myself for wanting to get rid of him.",09Jul2020,3

748,"Hey, 20 male here

So I'm about to enter my senior year at a good private university and then I'll graduate. I'm majoring in Engineering + Econ. I got through my classes in Engineering actually learning very little and still managed to do well. If an employer asks about what I did in my classes, I won't be able to say much.

Last summer, I was dabbling my foot in the Actuary profession and passed an exam. I interviewed at large insurance companies in the Fall but didn't get an offer from any. I think it was my attitude that was the problem, like sometimes I can come of as arrogant or a too independent.

I was having a tough time socially in college. I saw different therapists in my junior year and was frustrated I couldn't pinpoint what was wrong. Eventually I got on to online therapy in the summer and have been feeling a lot better with my current counselor.

I'm not working yet this summer. I realized I needed to distance myself from my parents because they were toxic. I moved to a sublet apartment for the summer. I worked a lot of jobs in the past and have built up savings. I'm able to finance myself until I graduate. I get a lot of financial aid so it's possible. However, I just keep spending money now and have some doubts of my ability to work a normal job.

Most of my work experience is in the customer service field. It's hard to imagine myself working in a grocery store or something this summer but it is an option. It's a little strange, I have many credentials but what I'm doing is working in customer service.

I go to a good private university and most people have a remote internship for their junior summer. These days, I spend a lot of time thinking, relaxing outside, getting groceries sometimes, and working on some of the social stuff with my counselor.

I've been thinking about my career for the last 5-6 years. I've never been able to focus on one thing. My freshman year I dreamed of writing online Ebooks and selling them and generating enough revenue to quit college.

Sometimes it's at the point where I can't bring myself to even interview anymore. Like if I go into an interview, sometimes it's hard to shake the feeling of not caring. Like if I got a tough question, I would almost be comfortable just saying, ""you know what, I really don't know."" I know this is wasting everyone's time but I want to say I did try in the past.

I know for the Fall I'm probably going to go with an Engineering job, but if I blow my chances like I did my junior year, it's very easy for me to end up unemployed, and run out of savings.

Lots of my peers are going to work in big companies, banks, etc. And it kind of feels like I blew a lot of opportunities that were just handed to me. Also really uncomfortable too, I tell my peers I'm working part time, but I can't say like, yeah you have this internship and we're in the same major and school but I'm working at a grocery store or something.

Anyways, I am on the search for customer service roles right now, but if something really happens, I might have to go and work in grocery stores. I have about 2 months left of summer and I need to do something productive/make a bit of money to lower expenses eventually. Also on the search for simple remote work, like data entry positions.

Thinking about my career probably won't help but maybe I could briefly interview random people I meet on what their career is and how they feel about it.

753,"I suddenly remembered that at some point in time I took a video of myself in a very private moment out of curiosity. I therefore deleted it immediately.

For the past month I've been going crazy about that and I'm super scared that it is somehow going to get back to me and its going to get published and ruin my life forever.

At first I was afraid that somebody hacked my camera or phone and got the video like that. I then realised that that is ridiculous.

But then I suddenly got scared that I somehow accidentally saved it to google photos, because even if you delete something from your gallery, it's not gone from Google photos 

Now I have to note, that for some reason I used to reset my phone quite a lot and also make me google accounts each time for a fresh start. That combined with the fact that I don't know when I took that damn video  (sometime between 2017 and mid 2019) means that I have no, seriously no way to check if I ever had google photos or if I saved it or what Google account I even had at the time.

I am now just 24/7 trying to remember when exactly I took the video, what google account I had at that time. The problem is that I don't remember and that's what's driving me crazy. I'm pretty sure that I never had google photos, but I'm scared that I maybe set it up once and forgot about it... I can't check now, the uncertainty is killing me.

I'm scared that somebody could hack my old google account, gain access to the video I thought I deleted, then somehow track me down and blackmail me with the video and publish it and send it to my contacts.

754,"I am a 23-year-old male who is in a relationship. I am very happy with my partner and we are coming up on our first-year anniversary. 

I am seeking advice on dealing with friends who are somewhat anti-relationship and the norm of not being in a relationship in your 20's. 

My two friends are both single, one for cultural reasons and the other to get laid with multiple women.  Both of my friends are into making travel plans as we all love to travel. However, as much as I'd love to, I need time to see my girlfriend as we live in different countries (I met her while she was on a working visa). My friends are mostly understanding about this, but one of these friends sometimes cracks jokes about me being in a relationship (the one for cultural reasons).

I'm also faced with the norm of not being in a relationship in your 20's which mainly applies to my generation. I perfectly understand the concepts of self-discovery and being perfectly happy with ourselves.  However, I went into my current relationship with these concepts in mind and practice them. My girlfriend and I have even established boundaries where we can be our own individuals and are not co-dependent on each other's company, so far it's been working very well.

757,"I’m 18F. Just got accepted to a university in the US where I live. The average cost after aid is 13K. The predicted cost I was shown was around 25K, with expectations that my parents would pay around 17K and I would come up with the remainder.

Turns out my situation isn’t applicable for most grants. I didn’t qualify for a Pell Grant at all. My parents make a lot of money (around 100k) but it’s mostly my stepdad. They can’t pay for very much of it. I already had 28 hours of classes due to dual credit and I graduated with high grades. I got accepted only earlier this week so all the university’s scholarship deadlines have passed. March-May my life was just my online classes and I did nothing outside of them so I probably missed out on many opportunities. I applied for scholarships beforehand and didn’t get any. I’m still applying for many, many scholarships but I have a sinking feeling I won’t get any. 

I’m an artist as well and have been trying to get social media attention through my art and it’s been relatively unsuccessful. I also have mental issues that have been untreated my whole life so I haven’t been able to do a whole lot. I wanted to do commissions full-time but haven’t gotten a single one. 

I figured I would have to take around 10K of loans. Now, I figure I will have to take quite a bit more than that. I feel very defeated. I’m going to apply for a job at my local gaming store (I already applied at a local tool chain). I don’t even know if we’re going to have online classes or not which will affect the cost greatly (housing is 9K). I would rather not take up sex work but I fear I will have to.

759," I am being continually harassed by an ex girlfriend from 18 years ago over a 5k+debt. What to do?

About 18 years ago I broke up with this woman after dating somewhat seriously for a year or longer..  She still has a small business today, that I helped her begin with my experience in the field.  We worked together and lived separately. I had no green card and had overstayed my visa. I was stuck there  and was quite poor and had children from a previous marriage. I had two daughters and shared custody  from a different relationship,  and we all lived in the same big American city.

In the start up of the company, I had ten years experience in the field.  She gave me a credit card for personal and daily expenses ( I clearly realize I shouldn’t have but was trying to survive).We both knew this would take awhile to build and it was her idea to help me while we started the business. Once things were rolling, we both agreed i could continue with my visa issues as our projections saw us earning a very good income. I found clients and jobs and found enough work to start us up.  My ex was to take care of all billing and accounting. After about seven months I had accumulated 5500+ in debt on the card Including my personal purchases, living expenses,and materials for jobs etc.  She was aware of all items purchased.

Work was fine after a few months of start up, then she didn’t get to work till after lunch, sleeping in some days TIL noon. Clients were expecting us to start early in the am.I couldn’t keep up alone and after about 4 months of this I angrily quit. She wasn’t pulling her weight at all and I was getting more stuck financially every day.
 
We broke up and lived a few blocks away from each other.  I had reluctantly agreed to pay back the $5500. I was clear that I needed some time to pay back some money.  She became angry and started harassing me.   First, she called Children’s aid and caused  disturbances like that.  Started calling my new job and telling everyone, including my new boss that  I was a ‘conman’ and talking about how much money I owed her.  She had her new ‘boyfriend’ and other people try to come to my work and intimidate or try to talk to me. She would wait outside my apartment to stalk me. She got  into my apartment (somehow convincing my landlord)and took back all of our shared work materials  and some of my personal items to try to blackmail me. These items exceeded the amount ‘owed’. She had all of her friends email me. She even posted on Craigslist my personal information and that I was a ‘thief and conman’, which I got removed after four days of staying up online. This happened twice. I am sure I am forgetting things but the stress was horrible.

I made small repayments as best I could for over a year but was struggling so hard I decided to return to Canada as my two children were returning as well.  The ex didn’t stop and would contact my family and tell them everything she could including many blatant lies.  The best I could do was avoid her, being in contact with her in anyway resulted in more harassment and abuse. Then it finally became quiet for about ten years until six months ago when she started calling my family saying I owe 80k now and started spamming my business email and phone.

I realize that if she had merit in money being owed to her, she could have easily gotten a judgement in my absence in an American court and either given it to a collection agency or presented it to a Canadian court. I spoke to a lawyer a few years ago and was told a cease and desist order might only encourage this person...

Any thoughts or ideas?

Thank you.",09Jul2020,1
760,"Hi everybody!

I've been staying with my parents since the lock down started, about 4 months now. Not a great situation, as I'm 29 years old (F), but generally we're all very close and get on quite well. It's me, my younger brother (20), and my mom and dad.

The problem is, mom and dad aren't getting on very well at the moment, and may be heading towards a divorce. They are seeing a counselor (tomorrow is the 4th session), which is good, because neither of them are great communicators. Dad is very bad at expressing himself, and mom is not always great at hearing what people are actually saying! The main issue seems to be that my dad has started drinking again. 

He stopped drinking about 10 years ago, at my mother's request. No-one else in the family ever thought he had a problem, but for my mom it was an issue (She grew up with an intensely alcoholic mother).When he wasn't drinking, they got on so well, they were so happy and in love. Now that he's drinking again, their relationship is so strained. I understand why he wants to drink again - he spent years going to parties with mom where she would get fairly tipsy and he's have to drive her home. Or we'd have a family gathering and he'd be the only one drinking orange juice. I think he felt infantalised. Also, we live in a rural area, so drinking is one of the few ways people socialise around here, and when he stopped, he lost touch with a lot of his friends.He also used to drink secretly, every now and then, when he would come to visit one of his kids. (there's 4 of us all together.) I guess the secrecy and being told what to do finally got to him, and last year he told my mom that he wanted to start drinking again. I think mom is majorly triggered, which I understand, but he's really not a bad drunk at all, he's chatty and happy, and he only has 2-4 cans of beer whenever he decides to have drink. None of my siblings sees it as an issue, and neither do I.

I've heard them talking about splitting up and selling the house. I'm not sure this is what either of them wants, but I think they don't know how to fix this.I'm worried that they will split, sell the home that they spent 30 years building, decorating, perfecting, paying the mortgage on, and then realise that they've made a huge mistake.

I suppose the advice that I'm looking for is - is there anything I can do? Something in me (perhaps just my inner child!) tells me that I can somehow  fix this. That if I could just figure out what they both wanted, then I could make it better. But I also know that they are adults, and their relationship is extremely nuanced in ways I could never understand, and maybe I should just stay out of it altogether?Any advice would be so greatly appreciated!

761,"My mother and father are getting a divorce and my mom and sister both moved out. They won’t talk to my dad at all, they left and shut him off. He comes to me about his sadnesses and I listen because I’m the only person that lived around them when they were together that he can talk to. 

Last summer, I moved away to my grandparents house because my mom started getting extremely rude and just hurtful to me. My dad saw me just broken down so he said I need to move to my grandparents. Well, when I got to an actual good household, I understood what all was wrong in my life and it turns out, most of my life, my mom had tried to shut me off from a lot of things in life like my dad by telling me he was messed up, etc. She was just rude...

Well, my dad’s house (the original family house until 6 months ago) holds a lot of memories, some good, but the bad seems to outweigh the good. Every time I walk into the house, I just feel depressed, sad, and like the energy is sucked from me. When I’m at my grandparents, I don’t feel that way. 

Well, the previous few days, I’ve stayed at my dad’s house and I feel just terrible now. The house is nice, my dad is nice, but I just don’t feel right here. I told my dad I might go back to my grandparents house and he just sounded annoyed and irritated (and a little disappointed). He lives by himself and I don’t want him being depressed either because he’s alone.

I have this worrying suspicion that maybe all of my irrational thoughts and feelings are true. I feel like an idiot constantly. I fear that my iq or other measurements of intelligence are far below average. I am worried that I will never be happy with myself. 

I am a junior in high school and soon I will be 17. what if all my life ever equates to is failed attempts at social interactions? What if I never experience deep and meaningful friendships that I carry with me for a lifetime? I haven’t had a friend since I was 12. It‘s not that I get bullied. My peers treat me normally, but I have the hardest time being vulnerable. I know that friendship, when basically analyzed is a swapping of information. You share intimate details with someone else, and in that way your platonic relationship feels, and is different than the ones you share with random people or acquaintances. But, I can’t seem to commit myself to that. My lack of vulnerability with others leads them to get bored of me, and I completely understand. It is my fault, not theirs. 

I used to attend therapy a year ago, but stopped. After 3 sessions I quit. It’s not because I didn’t like my therapist. They were very kind and I actually liked them. But, the truth is I lied. I lied to save myself perceived embarrassment. I lied about how I want to kill myself. I downplayed my morbid thoughts about death. I downplayed my social anxiety, and how much it does interfere with my relationships and day to day life. Therapy became a game of, ""let’s show the therapist I am ""normal"" and don’t need therapy."" 

I have never had those hallmark teenage rites of passage. And I know it is stupid to get caught up in these, but I want it so badly. I want to feel normal. I would rather peak in Highschool knowing that I collected all the teenage rites of passage. If I have peaked(which I believe is true) I am absolutely pathetic. 

I don’t know how to help myself at this point. This feeling of destiny is overwhelming. I feel doomed(which I know is so pessimistic), but I can’t seem to help it. I know that from a objective perspective these thoughts are irrational, but I still let it control me. I have so many intrusive thoughts.",09Jul2020,1

So I'm a private tutor. I help college-freshman kids with their subjects at school. One of my students sent me a text today, saying she urgently needed a class. I had free time today so, I told her I'd be there. The student's mom has always been flirty with me, but she's a single woman in her 40s, it's understandable. 

Fast forward, I arrive and knock on the door. The woman answers. She's only wearing a very thin bathrobe. I was a bit confused. She grabbed me by the arm and pulled me inside. She then pushed me against the wall and started kissing me. After some seconds I react and pull back, asking what she was doing. She just put her finger on my lips and unzipped my pants. I told her this wasn't going to work, because I'm gay. She then pulled away, my pants were already down, I was in my underwear.

She took off her bathrobe in front of me. She was completely naked. She massaged her tits for a minute in front of me... Without noticing it, I got incredibly hard. My dick was bulging in my boxers, and she realised. She immediately jumped onto me, pulled down my briefs and started sucking my cock. I tried resisting, but my body wanted it so bad, I couldn't do anything about it. She kept on sucking until she realised I was about to cum. She edged me slowly, and then kissed me again. I moved my head sideways, trying to avoid her, but as soon as she inserted her tongue in my mouth, I lost it and answered to her kisses.

After a heated make out session, she threw me on the couch behind her. She got on top of me, slid my dick into her pussy, and started riding. I told her I was gay once again and that I wasn't going to cum. She pushed my head in between her breasts to sort of ""shut me up"", and rode me for several minutes straight, until I blew my load inside her pussy. I couldn't believe what had just happened. I started getting up and gathering my clothes immediately. She told me she had wanted to fuck me since I had started working for her. I was shocked as to how this happened, and told her I'm gay and this wasn't going to happen again. She ignored me, kissed me, and told me she'll ""see me again soon"".

Again, sorry if I went too much into detail, I thought it'd be important to understand how it happened. I'm still shocked as to what happened and why I physically enjoyed it so much, taking into account the fact that I'm gay.

I am currently a paint desk associate at Big Blue Box Hardware Store. I am still technically seasonal. I have been here since February, and I really enjoy the job. For a while I was being overworked to the point of actually developing a stress related ulcer, but since I told my managers and supervisor about it, they've been really kind and let me reduce my hours drastically. 

Before developing the ulcer, I was coming to a screeching halt in this job because I was feeling so burnt out. I was working 8 or 9 hour days, sometimes 6 days a week, and only rarely had a single day off before I had to come back and work 4-5 days in a row again. 

I had applied to a few secretary and work from home positions, and one work from home position just got back to me. The position in question is a personal assistant position, work from home, 9 hours a week/$300 a week. 

Essentially I'd be making $30 an hour to stay at home and just do whatever I'm asked (make appointments, budget stuff, etc.) 

Currently I'm making ~$12/hr at the paint desk, and sitting at probably 20/hrs a week. 

I've made a pros and cons list, but I feel like I'm not any closer to figuring out an answer, and I think I need one by the end of the day.

Help? Advice? Anything?",09Jul2020,1
767,"Thirty year old male here

3 years ago, my friend saw what looked to be an excellent deal for a rare pinball machine and messaged me all excited about it as he knew I wanted one. It was an obscure listing on eBay that I wasn't even aware of. I  was suspicious of that deal initially, but my friend was somewhat confident about it so I took the plunge

It turned out to be a big, fat scam, and I lost $1000. Without going into details, the scammer had enough experience and skills not to have Paypal/eBay refund me the money

My friend was very apologetic, and I assured him I didn't blame him for it

Deep down however, a part of me still does. As much as I was an idiot for not doing my homework properly or being more careful, the fact is that I wasn't even looking for pinball machines on eBay! My friend put the scam on a collision course with me, and encouraged me to make the deal even though he lacked the experience and expertise in that area.

I won't let my friend know about my resentment and I often tell him I am over it even though I am not. How do I move on from this incident and not blame my friend? He did what he did with the best of intentions",09Jul2020,1
768,"I took a new job last February. My old job was pretty terrible and I dodged a bullet when the pandemic arrived in March where they furlouged 1/3 of my team and cut everyones hours. 

My new job I make an insane amount of money compared to my old job, which is the main reason I took it. My last job was essentially a call center job, and this one somewhat is too. I regret getting into this field, but I'm stuck in it now.

This week my team lead has been really on my ass and rude to me. Its been a very stressful week at work and I worry about this continuing. I am constantly anxious about this job because I constantly worry about them firing me for not being good enough at my job. While it is another call center job, the clients are from an industry that I had no prior experience with.

The problem is I can't find another job without taking a significant paycut, which I cannot afford right now because I barely can afford my car, apartment, and student loans (which are destroying my life) without the money I make at this job. I am trying to not let this job and my dick head team lead wear me down so much, but it's difficult. I am someone who wants to feel like he does well at his job and is doing his part for the team. No matter what i do at this job, it feels like i never do well enough and I always feel like im one of the least intelligent members of the team. Its been crushing me lately and I am struggling to manage that.

Since the pandemic began, my 84 year old grandma moved in with us so that she could be safe and have access to hospitals. She has a lot of health conditions that leave her bedridden and wheelchair bound: diabetes, high blood pressure, 2x stroke survivor, to name a few. She's been through a lot and due to growing up in WW2 she has problems with regulating her emotions. She will shake with anger or tremble and cry over small things, I think it is PTSD. She knew my aunt was in the hospital and they FaceTimed earlier today. She always asks about my aunt and wants to call her.  We've been hiding it from her for now because we don't know how to go about this. She has to know sooner or later. How do we tell her without giving her a heart attack?

772,"At my old job we all got made redundant by the main site, but another company is taking us over. Most of us are going to keep our jobs and me and my dad was on the list for the new owner. It took him 2 months to ring my dad and the rest of the people on the list yet he never phoned me. He phoned my dad again and my dad asked why he hadn’t phoned me and he told me to ring him the next day. I eventually got in contact and he just asked me some basic questions and gave me the start date. 

I thought it was all going well. Then my dad got in contact with him again and he emailed him his contract. I also know he emailed somebody else their contract on the same day. But not mine, my dad asked him if he wanted my E-Mail and he said he would ring me. Which he still hasn’t, also I have no idea why he wants to ring me again when he doesn’t anybody else. I’ve left it 5 days and today I’ve tried getting in contact. It’s like he is ignoring me, he’s turned his phone off after I tried ringing him (or stopping the call) and won’t reply to my text. I’m not being pushy about it just 2 calls and 1 text. 

I am just so stressed and my anxiety is going mental. Why is he treating me different to others, it’s giving me doubt if I have even got a job or not. I mean why give others their contract and not me? What am I even supposed to do? It’s annoying me how this has been going on since March. I actually turned down going back to an old job because of this. I was guaranteed that I would be involved and would have a job.

774,"Hi guys, I hope you could give an advice to me who's a 22 year old fermale professional who's currently lost. I'm feeling lost because recently, I received an email from my Team Lead that I'm one of the least performing among the team. My team lead claims that I've been in the list of the top aging ticket resolver (we have a ticketing system) for more than twice for the past ten months (I counted, I was only on the list for 2 times). I replied to her email, I attached artifacts to prove her that I wasn't consistently contributing to the downward of the metrics but rather upward because I was on the top ticket resolver list for 9 out of 34 weeks and 3 out of 10 months. I know in myself that I shouldn't be one of the ""least perfoming"" because I worked my ass out since the last time they placed me there. I was tagged as least performing last year (that was my first time) for unauthorized OT (for helping my teammate on her rest day OT) and sleeping during working hours (I don't do that unless I'm done with all my work for the day). They presented to HR a different reason, that I didn't sent a daily report assigned to me for 2 whole months, which is not true because I even have the copies of the reports in our shared drive until now. I was so scared during that time that I just let them do that to me. But now I'm so frustrated because I know I did so well and worked so hard so that I won't be in that spot again and here I am now. On my email, I asked my team lead if she could show me the data that proves that I am not performing well. She didn't reply to me until I made a follow up and looped my sublead in the email (thankfully my sublead knew my struggle). All my team lead said is look at the metrics that's been sent to the team. That metrics was where I based my artifacts. It made me even more frustrated because it seems like she didn't read my email. I cried my eyes out because of how frustrated and demotivated I feel. Even now when I remember it, I get teared up because I feel so helpless and I don't know what to do. I even went on a leave today because I don't have any motivation to work. Like, for what now? Because it seems like even if I do my best or not, I would still be seen as the least. There were so many teammates of mine who were consantly in the top aging resolver list but why me? I'm lost because I don't know what should I do now. Should I resign? Maybe ask HR if I could get transfered to a different team that's not under my current team lead? I also didn't tell my family because I don't want them to feel as frustrated and stressed as I am. Much worse, I wouldn't have a year end cash bonus for Christmas.

776,"Hello, I am a 18 y/o female. Ever since I was little, I considered myself ""a smart kid"" (i love math and science, won math contests, scolarship, etc...). However outside from the academic realm, I am useless. I am very clumsy (VERY CLUMSY, forgetful, awkward social skills, etc), and sometimes I feel that I might never accomplish anything in my life. I also suspect that I might be autistic, but I'm not really sure. I often get in big trouble when I'm in my house and forget lots of thing and constantly screw up everything I do. My parents think I do/forget everything on purpose to make them angry, and think I am a rebel kid. To prevent my parents taking me seriously and scream to me, I have started to act really dumb, using a weird accent I invented and saying simple things in awkard moments, sometimes acting weirdly affectionate towards them. I guess I tried to convince myself it was a personality trait of mine but I can't do that anymore. My parents were always really strict, and I feel like the things I have worked for aren't enough. What should I do? I just feel they aren't open minded enough to accept or even explore the possibility that I have maybe a condition.

777,"I’m starting to lose my patience and feel like I invested my time and memories with the wrong people. (some) Not saying all but I just noticed. Today, I lost another one. I don’t care about followers. I don’t even have a lot but the fact I’ve been friends with these people since elementary school hits me the most. Everytime they needed someone to talk to. I was there. It’s not like I’m holding them down but it’s the same thing over and over again. I’m actually thinking of considering to stop having male friends. It’s basically impossible without getting blocked/unfriended at the end. 

When my friend texted me today. He said, his gf told him to block me. I asked him Why? I’ve known you since you were 4. Bro I never flirted with you. Checked his insta. Everything is deleted. Only following 106 or something. Most is celebrities? In my head I was saying WTF? I think his gf is controlling him. I replied, “Ok cool, I wish you two the best in your future.” Then, he proceeds to say “you can still text me.” Tf. ????

Sounds like I’m needy or something. I don’t like the vibe. I just blocked him and then he messages me on kaokao. He told me social media means nothing. I’m like whatever. I’m just frustrated. 

I understand some people need to do this to have trust in a relationship with their future wife/fiance but goddamn. This is the fourth time. 

2 of them did come back to me because both got cheated on. Also, their in our friend circle so we can’t really run but the fact it keeps repeating... I’m starting to think I’m off. I don’t find any of them attractive. We just all played a lot of sports together growing up. I just feel that throwing these friendships is a waste but at the same time I think it’s best to move on and leave.

I’ve already arranged with someone extremely close to me to let me stay there a bit, so the matter of having a place to stay is taken care of, it’s just the matter of moving out in secret or just moving out.

I plan on getting a new phone on my 18th birthday, as legally it is my parents. So not only will they won’t be able to charge me for stealing, they won’t be able to track me or contact me. (Hopefully.)

784,"Okay guys so this is my first time posting this and at this point I need to vent out my frustration 

So a lot of my younger years I have depression and anxiety.  I was literally forced into a mental institution.  I gotta admit I wasn't the best kid but I never did drugs or alcohol but I felt like I was dealing with some deeper that I had never told anyone until I was 19.(  I was sexually assaulted at a young age by my cousin and kept it a secret as if it was my fault but once I got in my 20s I have learned to deal with my).My mom in the other just makes everything worse. If anything she is worse and won't even admit it to it. I seriously think she is bipolar or she just really wants attention that she didn't get when she was growing up. 

So anyways my whole life my mom kind of took over while my dad was at work all the time. She doesn't work but like she never wanted me to drive even though she was having a panic attack trying to teach me and I freaked out and started crying because she was stressing me out too much. I wasn't  allowed to go anywhere. Once I graduated I got a job but basically all my money went to her because I was living with them. But there were always fighting and arguing. I was stupid enough to be convince to help my sister and her kids while her boyfriend would just do drugs. I was always depressed during all this and it was tough and I just felt taken advantage because I felt trap. So i kept dealing with all this bs until i was 21. 

I started dating this guy. We will name him Nick. It kind of moved fast and honestly I just wanted to get away and he just was already settled. He basically didn't need anyone to help him but he is actually really a good person and doesn't take shit with anyone. So I spent a lot of time with him. More than I did at home and I could tell it was getting to my mom because she was used to getting spoiled and had no problem with getting money from me. At that point I already saw what was happening and I just never really saw them anymore . But as time went on,my grandparents had a place opened up and so we decided to rent it out since it was cheaper and bigger than what we had. During that move my grandmother fell ill and passed away. Soooo guess who moved in with my grandfather, of course,my mother.  So Nick and I were going to be living next to her.  My sister ,her bf, and her kids took over my mom's houses (my mom was pushing me to move in with my bf. Was making it hell for me anytime I was home just so she can move her in) . It wasn't so bad in the beginning but then she would do her little episodes and would have a full on panic attack . She did it so much that my grandfather and dad just rolled their eyes. The first time Nick was reallly concerned and told me so I just told him to ignore it. Then it happened. My mom and I got into this huge argument because I made my nephew ""cry"". He is only 7 years old so of course he was gonna make up this whole lie so he wouldn't get into trouble. So my mom screamed at me crazily and demanded I leave.....its my grandfather's house . I am not gonna leave lol seeing that I wasn't gonna put my foot down she crazily left with my nephew. About 5 minutes go by  so I just started walking with my bf back home and behold my mother drives back in the driveway lol she just made a whole loop around the neighborhood or possibly went to her house for a few minutes.  Either way Nick saw her crazy side so now what. 

Months have passed and I am engaged. My 2 older sisters don't live with my mom. My youngest sister is deployed . I have a wedding that I am planning in 2 years . So time has passed and i am trying to make amends with my mom. She has been good and not crazy anymore lately so I thought it was a good idea to get her involved in the planning since she and my dad offered to pay for the dress. Any ideas that I have she isn't interested in . Like she seems to not care . Anytime I bring anything up it's like ""the wedding is in 2 years,you don't need to plan it right now"". The only person that actually seemed interested was my aunt but she lives in a different state but my mom of course got really jealous that she was excited trying to help me. Physically she can't help and that's what I need and Nick's mom works a lot so basically on my own. We don't have that much money to begin with becauss of covid19 so I feel like I am going over my head because I know I don't have that much. So fourth of July comes around and I find out she is excitedly planning my cousins baby shower. So then I bring up my wedding and everyone is invested in on it except my mom. At that point I was doing it on purpose because I had enough. Nick and I aren't there long . We basically ate and left so a week goes by. I get major headaches and pressure under my eyes. Mainly due to allergies so I call in work and rest for the day. My mom wanted me to go to the doctors because she supposedly scared and because she is getting her colon checked like I am sure any normal person would do. She automatically thinks she has ""colon cancer"". I am not saying she doesn't or does but anytime she goes to the doctors it's this dramatic illness . I tell her no because I am sick so when she got home she was blowing up my phone that i am not allowed at my grandpas house and convinced everyone that I have covid19. I am annoyed because honestly I have this before and she knows this because i have bad allergies. I don't go anywhere or hang out with anyone. If anything she goes everywhere and has a bunch of parties like wtf. Plus coincidentally it my birthday this weekend...Soooo what's the issues now. My sister is getting deployed back to the Us for 9 months. She is my maid of honor. This was a conversation with my fiance and I had about moving it to December this year about a month ago. But at this point I am just tired of it like i don't even want a wedding anymore but i feel like that's what she wants so I am just giving in. So now I just want to throw this bomb ass wedding so I got a job. But what else is the problem. My fiance and I could possibly be having a baby. But I also feel I need to cut ties with my mom . Like I have had enough. But I live next to them and she lives in my grandfather's house . And I won't cut him out of my life but I also feel like she would start this full on war and I just don't want to deal with it because what if I am pregnant . I don't know guys.

So now now I have a lot to think about as far as the wedding and baby but I just wanted to get any of your opinions  and will keep you updated as time progresses .",09Jul2020,1
785,"I’m a 27 year old male.

Early in 2019 I started a new job at an IT consulting company. Nearly everyone at this company works remotely and those that don’t are usually in-office by choice or on a contract at a company we have contracts with.

It’s a good company, small, and lots of access to the executives. One of the reasons I like it so much is that the “higher-ups” are all very accessible and personable. The company is also extremely remote-work friendly. A big selling point for me.

When I started this job, I told the hiring manager and the CTO that I was moving at the end of the year to a town out of the area, about 100 miles away. 

I moved to help support my girl friend who is pursuing her doctorates. She’s in school or studying nearly every hour of the day and I am here to help her with house work/cleaning/ dogs/ emotional support when she’s stressed.
This was all disclosed prior to taking the job.

Towards the end of 2019 I get told I’m being put onto a 1-year contract at a company with a strict on-site policy, in the city that I was moving **out** of. The contract started just a month after I move.

Naturally I’m angry, sad, and hurt by this. I make this known but I get told in a polite way that it is what it is. 

Covid-19 was helpful in that it forced remote work, so I only needed to commute 200miles round trip a day for 3 months instead of all year. But now we are preparing to go back to work, and the contract is coming up for renewal and all signs are pointing to me being renewed for another year.@

I cannot commute 200 miles daily to a full time job for the next year and a half. For just the first 3 months before covid forced everyone remote, it took a huge toll on me mentally, it strained my relationship with my girl friend, I never had time or energy to do anything during the week, I never was able to work out, it kept me sedentary for basically the entire day (driving 90 minutes, sitting at a desk, driving 90 minutes again). 

What do I do? From what I understand, putting me in this position is very profitable to the company and between the clients strict non-remote policy and my company not having any other assignments for me, I feel stuck. 
Changing jobs is possible but that would be difficult to do given that most companies are just trying to stay afloat right now due to the virus. Plus, if not for this commute I’d be very happy at this company.

788,"My boyfriend is 20 and was recently diagnosed with OCD. One of his main symptoms is confessing to any bad or weird things he has ever done. Sometimes his OCD even makes up memories to feel guilty for and we've proven some of them wrong.  Most of the confessions are laughable but this isn't. He confessed 2 days ago and I'm so disgusted!! He admitted to having a phase of really liking incest porn when he was 13/14, and losing interest in it by the time he was 15. He said he recalls thinking about his mom in a sexual way a handful of times. He reckons he might've read something about mom/son sex and maybe he just thought ""oh what if?"" and that's all it was. He is adamant he never would have done anything with his mom and was never attracted to her and is ashamed of all this. 

He put it down to 13 year old desperation, that maybe he thought ""if no girl ever shows interest in me would I get desparate enough to do something with my mom?"". I am so repulsed reddit. He has apolosgied over and over and has made it clear he never creeped on her nor  thought about her while masterbating nor stole her underwear and liked girls his own age or celebrities at the time.

This leaves her largely reliant on me to accomplish her goal of eating healthy and losing weight. It is not ideal for either of us. She has said that she wants to cook some of her own food and regain some control, but that's easier said than done!

I have managed to teach her a few basic skills, but she won't let me teach her any more because she says I am condescending while trying to instruct her (which is probably true). When she does cook, her feelings get hurt because it's not often very tasty. 

Simply not cooking is not an option because she will just order something unhealthy. She is not interested in cooking classes (which are cancelled now anyway). 

Every now and then, she will agree to cook something new and fun together. We made sesame chicken and egg rolls (healthy versions!) a few weeks ago. She got tired of it after a bit and ended up just assembling the rolls with me, so while I was grateful for the time we did get together, she didn't learn anything that was applicable to simple, everyday cooking.

The thing is, out of curiosity, I researched their profile online to get a better idea of other interests they have for the sake of future discussions. It turned out that we shared a lot of very niche ideals, but I also found out that they have a very large following and with several seemingly popular online friend circles. I'm really not a fan of the 'popular side' of this community online and always treated it like a social taboo to be simply avoided. I brought it up afterwards and, well, disappeared after messaging.

It turns out that they sent me a number and asked me to call them, but I was just too worried and exhausted to even take a look at our chat after my daily work rounds at the clinic. That was earlier in the week. Now, I'm just too afraid to even call. I wanted to message back asking if it's still alright to call, but I'm paralyzed by anxiety.

For some background, I’m 18F, about to head out to university in the fall. I have a twin sister and an older brother, with a mum and dad who have been happily married for 25 years. I love and care for my father deeply but there are things he’s done that have scared me deeply. 

Some background info on my dad. He’s a very needy person. I often joke with my mum that she married a baby. He’s constantly asking for cuddles, which we’re usually ok with giving, though in recent years i haven’t been. Even though we constantly tell him no, he’ll always ask or pat the spot next to him. This has caused me to be reluctant, annoyed, and kinda concerned with how much he’s constantly asking for cuddles. This is usually after dinner, when we’re watching something on the tv, so obviously there have been many occasions where everyone gets sick of his insistent asking and snaps. My dad often doesn’t recognize a no, and simply doesn’t accept them at times, though I’m sure he’d say otherwise. Now I'm gonna explain some incidents that have happened over the years. 

Years ago my father liked to kiss my neck. I felt it was fine when i was younger, and it wasn’t like a making out kind of kiss. But of course as I grew older I found it to be very uncomfortable. I realized the only person I would want kissing my neck in any way would be a boyfriend/husband, definitely not my dad. For a couple years I simply tried to show that it made me uncomfortable, by pushing him away and turning away, eventually leading to me telling him it made me uncomfortable and that I didn’t like when he did that. I had to tell him maybe 2 or 3 times but he has since stopped. My father doesn’t like taking no’s easily, and hes twice my size and a lot taller than I am, so it’s physically hard to push him away. This’ll be important. 

One of the big moments that comes to mind happened about a year ago. It was right after I got out of the shower. I went to my room to get dressed, towel wrapped around me, when my dad comes in to surprise me. He often does this (mind you not when I just got out of the shower), usually when I’m on my bed watching something, and likes to kiss my cheeks and sometimes tickle me. I’m ok with this, though for this kind of stuff he usually knows when to back off. However me having only a towel on, and very obviously naked underneath, he freaked me out when he tried to kiss my cheeks. I begin screaming at him to get out, pushing him away (again he’s very big), and instead of stopping he grabs my arm and begins kissing it (like I was Morticia Adams or something) thinking I was joking. My towel slipped, and I’m desperately trying to cover myself with one arm while trying to wrestle my dad away with the other that he's latched on to. I was 17 at the time. Even though he’s my dad, I found it inappropriate for him to see me naked. It wasn’t until I kept screaming at him to get out, and continued to do so, that he got the hint and quickly left. My mother wasn’t home, though if she was I’m sure she would’ve stormed up to see what the hell was going on. I’m always surprised my siblings didn’t come in, considering I had never screamed “get out” (especially in such a panicked way) to him before, only mildly yelled like a typical teenager. Later on when I went to say goodnight, he said he was sorry, and apologized, and it did genuinely feel sincere. He hasn’t tried to do anything like that since. But it still frightened me. 

Another incident was a couple months ago, after we had finished dinner. Everyone was in a playful mood, and me and my dad were messing with each other. He began tickling me, which I was completely ok with. I was laughing and having a good time. However that quickly stopped when my dad brushed over my crotch area. At first I thought it was a mistake, I mean I was squirming all around on the ground, but when he did it a second time I gave him a surprised and what I felt may have been scared look, though me being surprised may have taken over that factor. He made a funny face, though one like he was acknowledging what he did. Like one where you raise your eyebrows and look at the other expectantly. I still laughed, though made sure he stopped after a couple seconds. I thought about what he did in bed that night, and though it made me uncomfortable to think about, I was still confused about it all. I’m only 90% sure he realized what he was doing. 10% of me doesn’t. 

My dad being physically big and tall also means he doesn’t recognize how rough or strong he’s being. There have been times where we were messing with each other, or I wasn’t facing him, and he’d grab my hips and turn me to face him. He would grab so hard that it would leave a good pain for a couple seconds afterward though I usually don’t hold this against him. But there are other times where I do. Once when going up the stairs he kind of tried to hit my behind. It’s important to note that whenever he does this I’ve never taken it in a sexual way, or thought he was trying to be sexual. However there have been plenty of times where he has hit my behind and I get pissed, saying I don’t want him touching my butt. This time when he did it though, he forgot his strength and was too fast, and it felt as if he had hit me with a rolled up wet towel. I obviously get mad as I’m trying to go up the stairs, and he scared me. When I tell him it hurt he gets very offended, even when I tell him I had to rub the spot to make it stop hurting. My mum is on my side, and when he sees this he says “I’m sick and tired of their bs, I’m sick of it”, basically saying he never does it hard enough to hurt. Whenever me or my sister get upset over this type of stuff, and he realizes we’re not joking, he gets very offended and hot headed, saying he was only playing and to stop complaining. I believe he genuinely thinks this, and him saying this stuff is trying to make him the victim, so we stop talking. 

Tonight had me thinking about all of this again. I was in my room, while my mum, dad, and sister were all in my parents room. I believe my dad was tickling my sister, and she was giggling, and then decided to go for my mum. My mum doesn’t like getting tickled. Never has. It always ends in her getting pissed cause my dad doesn’t know how to quit. So obviously my mum is telling him to stop, when suddenly she yells/almost screams ‘no’. I get freaked out, and go to their room, piecing together what happened from what I was vaguely hearing. When I get there my mum is visibly upset and my dad looks very surprised. I’ve certainly never heard my mum yell like this before so it’s not hard to imagine why. I ask what the heck is going on, and my dad is saying it’s ok. As I was turning away with my sister, as we can tell my parents needed to talk, I see a tear go down my mums face. This gets me pissed and very upset, though I simply walk away cause I know it wouldn’t be good for anyone to try and yell at my dad. As we walk away my sister said “he took it too far”, and I say “he always does” hoping he can hear. I go to their room to say goodnight a bit later, and as I kiss her goodnight I quietly ask if she was ok. She says she is, explaining how tickling makes her panic, and assures me she’s ok. She reads at night, and when she does, she’s always facing my father. Tonight she wasn’t. When I kiss my dad even though I don’t want to, he gets upset that I don’t cuddle him. I usually just lay my head on his chest for a couple seconds and then straighten, though I didn’t tonight obviously. I say no, and he asked why. I say because I said no, and he asked why 3 more times, each time me saying because I said no in a gradual “I’m getting pissed” tone. He finally gets the hint and stops asking. 

After tonight’s incident, I was laying in my bed, when I began thinking everything over again. All the past incidents came swarming back, and when I thought of the towel incident, I began having a panic attack. Idk what to do, I love my dad, but I still feel he needs to be held accountable. This isn’t something as serious as rape, I definitely understand that, but these things have made me wary of him. I don’t want to get any type of authority involved, I’d never want to ruin his career or hurt anything in his life (I don't think it's something that can even have authorities involved in). I just want him to feel accountable and understand what he’s done to me, and that it’s psychologically impacted me. But if I try to tell him, he’d do what he always does, and say I’m being too serious. Even then I’m still confused over whether or not this would even be considered a type of assault. How am I suppose to go about telling him without him getting mad?

TL;TR incidents over the years with my dad have made me confused on what he did. and if it would be considered assault. I'm not sure how to confront him about it.",09Jul2020,1

806,"Hi! I wont bore you with extensive details, but let me get started with a short summary:

Ever since I was a toddler, Ive been fascinated with science. I used to read science textbooks, astronomy books, and other books (obviously at a level I could understand at the time, I was like 5-6). Around 7, I got a massive inspiration to invent.

Years since then, Ive written, designed, (and as I progressed in my knowledge of technology) blueprinted hundreds of ideas Ive come up with over the years, and haven’t stopped since.

I truly believe I have found my purpose. Im 15 now, and over the years Ive developed college plans, a very extensive company plan, and much more, basically planning out my whole life.

After just recently coming out of a severely depressive phase of my life lasting around a couple years, I finally decided to get serious about all of my life plans and ambitions. The quarantine helped me escape a life filled with anxiety, and helped cure me of my depression.

Ive moved during quarantine, so when I start back into high school I can forget about all my past anxiety (since it was highly situational, and I moved away from it all.)

Over quarantine, I feel I’ve finally become who I’m meant to be. My beliefs have become more solidified, my work ethic and drive has gone through the roof, and so much more that will help me in my ambitions.

Around a month or so after quarantine began, and I had just started experiencing all that I’ve said above, I decided I needed to figure out what I needed to begin studying in order to improve my knowledge enough to have a better chance at all my college plans, and to improve my invention realism (which is already pretty decent in my opinion) enough.

So to summarize, after a few days of rigorous researching, I planned everything I need to study over the years.

Since quarantine gave me so much time, I have been studying 6-8 hours a day on a minute-exact schedule. I have every minute from 6am to 6-7pm planned out.

Obviously Ive edited my schedule overtime, but its goal is the same: Study 6-7 hours a day on various subjects important to my future career through various means, have a lunch break, and an hour or so (Used to be 3 hours, but Ive edited it since then) to study business books and relax my mind in order to improve creativity. “Creative break” I like to call it.

Ive been on this system ever since about a month into quarantine, and worked every single day (except a few Saturday’s) and haven’t stopped.

As in the past few days, Ive experienced symptoms of burnout. I try to take a break, but I get bad anxiety, and I just cant bring myself to do it. In my mind, what I’m doing it all for (my company plans, my purpose) is far too important to not spend every day on.

For the record, I had the idea of my company and building a company around my ideas before I knew about the whole craze on entrepreneurship.

Anyway, I need help finding it in me to take a break, even for a day or so. If you could please help me find the courage to, I would very much appreciate it.

Thank you very much for your time.",09Jul2020,1

So there's this woman around my age (mid 20's) that I admire as a person, but I don't know if I want to be in a serious relationship with her...

I know her from work... we work in different departments, different hours... I messaged her last year a few times and we briefly talked and have things in common.

I also should say that I came on a bit strong last year and messaged her a few times, asking her to get coffee, then a few weeks later to this carnival...

I just wanted to get to know her better. but she probably thought I was asking her on a date.

anyways that was last summer and I've shown by my actions and I've messaged her clearly explaining how I've learned and am much more grounded now.

I know women usually want things defined, like if it's a date or not...
but is this expected when we haven't even hung out in person yet?

I want to get to know her, but honestly don't know if I want to date her yet... what do I do? 

Asking her for coffee without specifying it's a date may push her away because I""m not being clear if it's a date or just friends...

I don't know what to do. Should I just take his word and hope that once ""our family is stable"" that he'll stop? If it ever happens?

811,"So, I ended up making some poor decisions and sent a nude of myself (without my face) and a picture of my underwear to two strangers I was sexting on the internet. The intensity of what I did kind of hit me in a delayed way and I cut off all contact with them. I am pretty sure that I was catfished as well.

Now I know in themselves they're not *that* insane, but I can't stop thinking about it. Its constantly at the back of my mind and although I've been alright during the day, every night all I can think about is what I did, and how it makes me a disgusting human being. I keep thinking about how will I ever be able to be a mother if I've done things like this (I'm still in my early 20s). I know in reality that this will not determine anything but I can't stop thinking about it. I know sending nudes isn't a big deal but I think can't help thinking I've done something really dirty and gross and this will make me less of a human being than I am now. It's even affecting the kind of person I see my self ending up with.

Honestly, the scariest part is it seems like it might be making my anxiety come back. Although unlikely, since I never revealed any personal information, I am afraid these are going to be linked back to me somehow. I'm studying medicine and I don't want to be disadvantaged in the future. I know that since none of this has been a positive experience I should never do it again, and I won't. But I don't know how to move on beyond this. I've tried to journal and get it out, and I'm not comfortable enough to speak to someone about this. I am hoping that in writing this here I will be able to get some sort of a release.

In reality, I know that this doesn't make me worthless or disgusting and I'm still exploring my sexuality. I think it's just taking me time to process these feelings. Any advice from someone who's been through a similar situation would be very much appreciated.

824,"I’m at a complete loss.

My father is turning 70 in just a few weeks. I’m 23, and my sister is 25.

My dad has suffered from depression for... god knows how long. After doing the same profession for two decades, he retired. He said he needed some time to rest and relax and do nothing before finding a new hobby through retirement. So he settled down and to watch TV, the news, HBO, Hulu, Netflix, whatever. All day. 

That was 3 years ago. He’s rarely varied for years. And it’s just getting worse. He‘s refused time and time again to see a therapist, to look into medications, to go to marriage counselling.

It’s a draining household. My parents’ marriage has been terrible for years, and it’s extremely difficult to watch my dad sitting there, mouth agape, sleeping at the TV.

I’ve been abroad since December 2019, and am on the brink of moving to this country until things calm down in the United States. Currently, my family is all hunkered down together in my parents house. I texted my sister today to see how things were going at home.

She confirmed that all my dad does is sleep all day and watch the news. It’s difficult to get him involved in any other activity, and even then, he has to finish his news segment before he’ll even get off the couch. And he won’t help himself. 

Having lived there for so long, I know that there’s a boundary and that it’s not my responsibility to take care of him all the time. I know if he won’t help himself, there’s not much I can do. I know that depression alters your brain. I know he’s addicted to the screen.

But I can’t live with the guilt of knowing he was like this for years before he died, and I did nothing.

I’ve talked to him directly about being worried for him, tried to involve him in other activities. He always says “I’ll do it later,” or laughs off the fact that I’m trying to provide structure, and won’t follow through with it. I’m a full time student and I’m trying to build my own life out of this messy time we find ourselves in. I can’t be his babysitter, and he’s not asking me to.

836,"I graduated college in May and was lucky enough to get a decent job. It's temporary and will last as long as covid does, so idk how long it will be. I'm struggling to find a new place to rent for the next year. I want a place that has its own washer/dryer since I need to wash clothes/linen a lot and leave it in overnight sometimes since my schedule usually only allows for that. I also need a place that accepts pets. I do not want a roommate anymore since I want to distance myself from having guests over and my current roommate won't do that (part of the reason why I am moving). 

The problem is that rent is a bit more than I would like. I currently pay $400 with my roommate, and most places that fit my description will be $830 without a roommate (especially since I am renting so late). 

Thankfully, my parents are willing to help me out with some cash to help pay for stuff. I originally didn't want their help since I relied on them throughout college, and was looking forward to being independent (excluding health care costs). But now I might need to accept their help. I was looking forward to having my own place and feeling proud about using my own money, bit it would be helpful for my parents to contribute half of rent. 

Idk. I feel guilty for accepting help. Like I should be more independent. I can afford it on my own, but it would be better for help. But I also don't like the idea of the apartment isn't completely my own. Idk. I'm just stressed and venting since idk how long my job will last and I don't want to financially rely on my parents anymore; it makes me feel guilty. Any advice will be great.

I don't have any way to get to a doctor to try and get on medications or anything like that to be able to handle my depression better because I don't have health insurance and I can't get health insurance without a job but I'm worried that I'm not going to be able to hold on to a job long enough to even be able to get health insurance.

838,"This is kind of a minor thing, compared to all the other issues people are having, but I don't know what I should do.

My mother always seems to have a reason to criticize me, for example this morning I walked in and my mother and my brother were talking about some guidelines my mother got for work regarding COVID-19. She was told to use disposable paper towels to dry hands in the bathroom. I piped up and said ""oh isn't that because hand dryers can blow germs around?"" This was the first thing I said to her all day. She and my brother talked over me before I was even done (very hypocritical- she is always telling other people not to interrupt amd always interrupts me anyway). I am so tired of this happening so I said ""did you guys hear me?"" and repeated it. She replied ""yes, but I'm tired of hearing you talk all the time you talk too much"". This really hurt me because it is not even true. I only ever talk to her when she asks me a direct question or I need to ask her something because I've learned that the majority of our conversations end up making me upset.

Whenever something like this happens, my mother will tell my father only from her perspective, and he feels like because she is his wife he has to always take her side, so I always end up feeling like everyone is against me. Also, I know it's not only a problem with me because this never happens with my father or anyone else.

There are also other things that happen a lot, like my mother will yell across the house for me to open the door to let my dogs inside when I am taking a nap or working on something when she is sitting less than 10 feet from that door on her laptop (this often results in me not hearing, and she will come all the way to my room to tell me to do it, when she easily could have since she got up anyway), or she will refuse to get up until someone gets up first to make her a cup of coffee, but will never make coffee for my father. My father is always selfless and helping the rest of the family and doing things for us, but the only thing she ever does is make dinner, which she is always very bitter about and waits until the last second to do.

I always hear from my friends and other people about this amazing mother-daughter relationship they have, but I never have and I don't think I ever will get to experience that with her because any time we have conversations or spend time together that would be an opportunity to get closer, she gets upset about something or makes me uncomfortable.

Anyway I'm not sure if it's just because I'm frustrated that it seems like she's always against me, or if she might have other things going on, but I don't know what I should do to possibly improve our relationship and prevent this kind of thing from happening.",09Jul2020,1

842,"I’m 23 right now turning 24 in the fall. 
The story goes: I’ve originally earned a bachelor in fine arts degree when I was 21 from an outstanding art institute. I’ve worked in live entertainment as a tech person since. I like my job and I think art is changing the world. But about a year ago I started having this feeling that I need to do more. I wanted to be an EMT and work for local fire department. Before I could make the decision to give up my going pretty well career to receive training the whole pandemic thing hits. 

Now I’ve been out of work for 4 months and facing deportation maybe pretty soon due to the immigration policy changes in America. 
I still want to do more and help physically but seems like It’ll be hard to do so in America. 


When I was applying for college back when I was 16, I also got into university of Edinburgh for English literature and I’ve always wondered what my life would be if I moved to Scotland rather than California. 
So the idea of getting another paramedics/social Heath studies or any degree that will allow me to become a social worker/rehab worker and anything along that line popped up in my head. University of Edinburgh does have some majors that fit the description and they do allow mature students to apply. 

It’s a 4 year degree and if I apply this fall (and lucky enough to get in) by fall 2021 I’ll be entering the school as 25 yo. 
I grew up with the knowledge you are suppose to graduate college around 22 and have a solid job by 24 the latest and have a happy family by 30.  
It just kinda shatters me that I’ll be spending 4 years of my life studying again rather than I could possibly be earning money saving up. 
But I also REALLY want to do it. I want to help more I think I need to. 
My concerns are, what my life goals changes again during my study? I thought I wanted to do theater for rest of my life when I was studying for my last degree. 
And what if I fail? The money I’ll be piling up for another college degree is not little. And I’ll probably have to work a lot for living expenses on top of school.

Everyday I get home from work, I walk into a kitchen with the trash cans spilling over, dirty dishes piled in the sink, and used pots and pans just sitting on the stove.

845,"Hi All,

I feel like I can't go to my friends or family on advice on this one, so turning to Reddit.

My BF (26) and I (26) live in NYC - we moved to a tristate suburb mid-March when Coronavirus started. I am super thankful we did at that point given everything that was going on. His mom was pushing for us to come a week earlier but with my work situation in flux (we were still expected to go in up until the third week of March technically) I wasn't ready to leave just yet (and I know she holds this against me / thinks I dragged my feet on the decision, but that's an aside point).

It's been OK living here - I am of course super grateful but the situation has become less than ideal as time goes on.

It's a small house so there is not much privacy. Any time we get into the tiniest spiff everyone tends to get involved - my BF doesn't compartmentalize and won't stop arguing even if his parents are right there.

The mom and I get along fine. I have made an effort to be positive, I have purchased some nice stuff around the house she has been wanting (coffee table, etc.) and some games to increase activity but 1) she is quite overbearing (does EVERYTHING for my BF who seems to have no issue slipping back into having every meal made for him, being attended to on hand and foot - this has caused a strain on the relationship in general) and doesn't let us handle our own packages, food deliveries, etc.; and 2) has OCD - which has made the situation extremely anxious, particularly with the dad being at an at-risk age (\~68). I understand her anxiety given this latter point - I would do everything in my power to lower any potential exposure risk in her shoes as well. 

However, it's been an increasingly unbearable situation. We dont leave the house apart from going to the backyard or an occasional walk around the block. She watches every movement outside and live reports (the deliveryman wore/didn't wear a mask, a neighbor walked too close to the porch, dad is sitting on a chair too close to the neighbors who are playing in their backyard) and it causes daily freak-outs (screaming, hour long episodes, etc.). We are not allowed to see anyone else (not that I could as I am not from the area - but his friends have been meeting up and recently spent July 4th in one of their backyards - we didn't attend) and can't go anywhere that poses even the slightest risk.

I have broached the subject of moving back to the city with my BF multiple times but it's met with strong blowback. I even suggested maybe getting away to an AirBnB and he freaked out at me and couldn't believe I would suggest something outlandish. His mom doesn't let him drive the car (being in the city he hasn't driven in some time) so we can't even take a drive just the two of us. Everyone else I know has moved back and begun adjusting to the new normal (albeit, maybe not being completely safe). We had a group talk (really a 3 vs. 1 convo) and they basically firmly said that we should stay here until work forces us to be in-person (which won't be well into 2021 at this rate).

I just feel like I am trapped here - my BF is adamant to stay. It's putting a strain on our relationship and I've started thinking about breaking up (that could be a whole other post, but comes down to the immaturity I've seen and our general difference in handling this situation). I dont want to be rash or foolish but 4 months in and I feel like it's time to start moving back to the city and be cautious. COVID and this way of life is here to stay, and I think we need to start integrating. On top of this, I haven't seen my parents apart from FTing - and I feel like the city is safe enough to transition back. I dont want to go back to go out and party with friends - I just want to be in my own home and have the potential to see my parents (keeping in mind being socially distant).

The problem is the entire room is carpeted. I have only cooked a handful of times and no matter how careful I am, I tend to get something on the floor. Any ideas for an inexpensive way to “re-floor” the room? It’s around 12x14 room. 

The “kitchen” area is super tiny but I am building a rolling island so I can have more area to actually cook. I also have a dinning table and chairs, which I’d kind of like to have something under as well. Because food on carpet is gross.

849,"TLDR: Aunt hasn't told son that his father isn't his biological father, should I be the one to tell him? 

C: Cousin 
A: Aunt
CD: Cousin's ""Dad""

My family is all kinds of messed up, but in this post I want to know if I should tell C (18m) that the man he's been living with isn't his biological father. When C was young, A and CD fought for custody over him after they split. A lost the battle because she didn't fess up that CD wasn't the real father, also other personal reasons but I digress. 

Anyway, for years CD has been using A and C for child support money, and now that C is old enough, he can't wait to get rid of him. In short, CD is a piece of sh*t. 

C has been through all sorts of bad things, was even pushed into running away for a week because CD was so controlling. More details can be provided if needed. 

A while back, I was informed that A lied about C being CD's son. However, I was told to keep my mouth shut. That it is A who should fess up about lying to her son for his entire life. I'm at a loss here, because C has been telling me all the horrible things CD has done, and he's even asked me if I have room in my house for him (of course I do). 

C is finally rebelling agasint CD, and even A when he visits her. He's going into the army soon, so I guess he doesn't care about living with them for a while. But I'm plagued with the knowledge that C has been stuck with a man who used him for money and as a free babysitter for CD's actual kid. 

Now C's biological father is a nice man with a stable life and loving partner, but he doesn't want kids. And I'm assuming that's why A didn't tell. But now C is an adult, and I don't think A is going to say anything at this point.

I am so tired of being guilt tripped to be the bad daughter or sibling. I have 3 other brothers that don't get treated the same way. One of them moved out years ago and doesn't even do anything for my mom, not even take her out for lunch or dinner. Another one doesn't do as much either, just only when it's small things for her but not as much as I've done for her. I take care of everything for her, my mom is not very good with technology so everytime she has issues in general it's always me that's handling it. I get frustrated sometimes because I would teach her stuff but she would often forget the next day but I don't get the appreciation for the things that I do. I take care of her meds, I mostly get her groceries, I help her cook her own meals, I clean the house regularly, I take care of her dog which she's allergic to, I bring her out to the mall to hang out, i take care of government stuff for her because she can't understand English or read English well. My brothers never got to do all of these and they think it's so easy dealing with her.

History: I've always been or to me I was always the ""bad"" daughter, the one that has the ""attitude"" when sometimes it's just the time of the month and I don't get the same understanding as my brothers. My dad left her years ago and I took responsibility for a lot of things for her.

I've never felt the same love that she's given my older brother. I know he's her favorite and yet, I'm the one with her and he's living with his gf. I've never left her, not even once. Everytime we argue I end up getting riled up so much that I cannot control my emotions and I end up feeling guilty at the end like validating that maybe I am a bad daughter.

She's manipulated me so much with guilt trips. We had an argument last weekend and we started yelling at each other and she told me that I can move out (which I honestly been wanting to do but couldn't because I didn't want her alone and she doesn't see that), I'm just so stressed. Everytime we get into arguments, she would always tell me to move out. I really want to but I can't get rid of the guilt. None of my brothers will help her when I'm gone. I don't get why she doesn't see this.

858,"I’ll try to make this as brief as possible but I am 34 with a daughter from a failed abusive marriage and when I got divorced my wealthy parents helped me out in a massive way by buying me a house and paying it off completely.  About a year later, my boyfriend moved in with me because he lost is job and I let my parents know we would contribute rent for property tax and maintenance [editing to add that I told him we would begin paying when my boyfriend got a job as finances were very tight on one salary of 30k per year] . This was six years ago and my boyfriend still has not gotten another job.  

I and his parents have begged him and he just hasn’t budged.  I suspect he has some mental hang up and despite my frustrations, he does contribute to taking care of our two daughters and does the majority of the housework.  It is frustrating as he is otherwise able bodied and hasn’t made an attempt to find a job.  When I try to talk to him about it he is extremely defensive and accuses me of being money minded.  He is otherwise loving and does provide free childcare while I work.  

My dad retired about a year ago and has been struggling with anger over this and he feels I am wasting my prime years of my life by allowing him to live here for free while placing a heavy financial burden on my shoulders. I don’t disagree with him but the pros outweigh the cons for me and so therefore I am happy overall.  

Long story short,  my dad wants my boyfriend to get a job and pay him rent directly.  He intends to talk to my boyfriend about this directly. Based on past experiences I am scared that my boyfriend will get angry with my dad and lash out and that he will choose to move out due to anger.  

I know rationally that this would be very telling about how he feels about me but I feel like a child stuck in the middle of two men having a problem.  I understand my dad’s position and I would like it if my boyfriend got a job, but I am feeling a little like I have no control over my life.  

I am struggling with whether or not I should warn my boyfriend before this confrontation so he is mentally prepared—I’m leaning towards not because I don’t think it will help matters but I also feel like I will being betraying someone either way.  I also think it would be best for my boyfriends dad to be with my dad while this conversation takes place to mitigate the reaction (my boyfriend seems to take tough love from his dad better than most other people).

862,"Hello, I didn’t really know where to go with this so I thought here might be good. Please let me know if I should post somewhere else. 

Growing up I was raised by my mom with the help of her immediate family, her sister and her family. I never knew it at the time but when I got older I realized how much my aunt helped us out throughout the years. I’ve always been close with my aunt and her family to the point where her daughter is more of a sister than a cousin to me. 

My aunt unfortunately also had the burden of taking care of they’re mother, she had problems of her own and was shady about her dealings with people, while also trying to run her own business, I’ve never known how she always managed it but I’ll always admire her for it.

Unfortunately a few years back my grandmother passed and after the funeral the task of sorting through stuff and deciding who wants what and what will be sold began. This went well for about a year but things came up and selling the stuff fell farther down the list of things to do.

Cut to a couple of years ago and I move off to college. Things are going well but I notice I’m getting more calls and texts from my mom than normal, like more than would be expected of the mother of a freshmen in college, but I don’t think anything of it at the time.

Flash forward a year and my aunt decides she wants to finish selling my grandmothers thing, which she’s made no secret of this entire time. When my aunt begins making steps to sell things my mother got upset because “she was being left out.” Again my aunt didn’t hide that she was doing this she just didn’t think to ask my mom to help set up a display of items for a store in a nearby town.

Then a couple of month later I get a call from my mother crying saying my aunt sold “her bronze.” A bit of context, by grandmother had many bronze statues made by a family friend and there was one she supposedly said my mom could have (I don’t doubt that I just never heard my grandmother say it.) My aunt knew this but after he bronze sitting in my grandmothers house for over 4 years she went ahead and sold it. My mother was very upset by this which I understand but what I didn’t understand was why she didn’t ever go get the statue during those 4 years when she had a key and a different bronze from the house.

This essentially began a feud between my mother and aunt. This all happened right before quarantine so during that time and since she texts me everyday, which I wouldn’t mind but she also calls me at least once a day and often more than that. Then she gets mad at me for not sounding excited to talk to her. She sometimes try to plan to come to the city where I live and see some of our other family but something usually happens and she calls me and says she never wants to speak to them again but that she’s still coming so that means whatever plans I have are now including her. 

I’m just tired of having to deal with all of this but I’m afraid to confront her about her behavior. Like my grandma and most of the rest of my family we both struggle with depression and I’m afraid she’ll see me talking to her as “choosing a side against her” when I don’t want to choose sides at all.

Around the time all this began my aunt called me to talk about her side of everything I think I pieced together what happened. Since then I told her not to worry about me or contact me, nothing ill-willed just afraid it would stir up my mom, but that didn’t help and she still calls me to complain about my aunt and try to see what I know about their plans/lives.

I’m sorry for the length and formatting, I’m writing this on mobile because I needed to just get it out there. 

Does anyone have any idea what I should do or how I should try to go about this? Like I said I want to talk to her about this but I think she would see it as an attack instead of trying to mend things.",09Jul2020,1

Yesterday (Wednesday) when I saw him, he already knew I was leaving.

But now I'm nervous my boss might tell the kids before I get the chance and I want to be the one to tell them. I don't want them to get upset not hearing it from me and I want to give them the chance to ask questions and talk to me about it.

How should I go about saying this to my boss? I was thinking something along the lines of ""whenever we decide the time is right I want to tell the kids. Just so they can find out from me and maybe ask questions if they want. A coworker found out through someone else and that bothered me so I don't want it to happened to the kids too since they're more sensitive to information like that.""",09Jul2020,1
865," Hey everyone,

I'm about to move to Bethesda, MD, and a friend and I are looking for a place to live near the NIH. I'm currently down to the following two options, and I could use some advice and insight.

**Option 1: Bethesda Hill apartments (an apartment complex)**  
Duplex  
Unfurnished  
2 bed / 2.5 bath (bedrooms have attached bathrooms, with a half-bath on the first floor)  
$2461 rent  
No utilities included (\~$200/month for the whole unit)  
Lease breaking policy -- 60 day notice, 1 month rent penalty  
Gym included  
Pets allowed (I wanted to get a cat later)  
Mostly carpeted  
I'm in touch with two people who rent here, and they enjoy it a lot.

**Option 2: A duplex I found on a website specifically for govt. employees (since I'm working for the NIH)**  
Unfurnished  
It has 1 landlord (a dude)  
2 bed / 2.5 bath  
$2250 rent  
Utilities included except internet  
Pets not allowed  
Mostly wood flooring  
I don't know anyone who has rented here before, and there are no reviews.

Commute is comparable. Both are unfurnished. Both have a lot of natural light.

I think that covers it -- feel free to ask me if you need clarification or further info.

Option 2 looks like a better deal. However, my concern is that that having a single human as a landlord rather than a staff might be more difficult to deal with; also, there's no sort of security system in the place (the landlord said the area is safe but I don't know for sure). And no pets allowed is kind of sad, but I'm trying to focus on the more important factors when deciding.

**Based on y'all's experience with renting, what are your thoughts? Thank you!!**",09Jul2020,1

Alright so, I’m 19 yrs old, never grew up with a parental figure/bounced relatives houses majority of my life, no guidance, all that, blah blah. Dropped out halfway through sophomore year due to my terrible mental health/everything else. Spent a couple years after that doing absolutely nothing but playing video games. I moved an hour and a half away from the rest of my family to live with my biological father almost a year ago, expecting some help getting my life started here.. and I was just told that I need to “google everything and figure it out” lol 
So I’m not really sure where to go from starting my GED studies I guess? 
No license and no driving experience whatsoever either. I have crippling anxiety. 
I guess I need help with.. everything? Lol 

I feel silly coming here for help because I’m typically one of those people that scoff at others for asking strangers on the internet for help with their personal problems.. but I genuinely don’t know what to do

I don’t know how to explain it all that well, but I’m pretty sure you guys on this sub understand what I’m talking about. He barely gave anyone the time of day except people he wanted to think he was cool. Always trying to get attention and talking shit on others.

How can we legally free a 17 year old in New York State from their abusive family? Can we retrieve their neglected puppy?

So for context I am 17 years old as well, my family life is great however I recently met someone who’s 17F.

Long story short I learned a lot about their life and just how horrible their family is, they constantly berate her and fat-shame her which has caused her to become slightly bulimic and harm herself. Her parents are constantly fighting (verbally and physically) which causes the police and CPS to be called over there **very often** yet every single time the police do nothing and CPS does nothing.

She has no other family nearby besides her own parents and her sister who’s moved into a nearby apartment (mid to late 20s). I have tried my absolute best to keep her away from her family as much as possible, I let her have a position in a family owned business and I let her stay over as much as possible.

Her birthday is in December, so originally we were going to wait until her birthday and then do whatever people would usually do to move out legally. However what’s made me feel the need to write this post is the fact that her mother has become very hostile with her recently and threatened that if I (OP) don’t spend more time with her and her family at their house she’s going to cut all contact with me (her mother has done this with other people before). The issue with this is that I genuinely don’t feel safe at all going to their house or feel comfortable at all spending any time with them, her mother has been to prison before and her father is a very scary, threatening person. Even if I had the guts to spend time with them and satisfy them, my own parents would not let me go as they don’t think it would be safe for me to go either.

Her parents don’t have a job and the only source of income is her fathers disability checks. Her parents don’t even own the house they live in, the owner is her grandmother who doesn’t speak to anyone at all, the only reason she lets them stay is because she feels bad for her (not the parents), however they never talk at all, the grandmother doesn’t want to do anything with anyone. Since I gave her a position in our family owned business, we would pay her under the table in cash (wasn’t necessarily by the hour, it was light general labor), however her own parents would steal the money from her, so we had to buy her a reloadable prepaid card with a pin that she hides.

The only form of ID she has is her SSN, she believes her parents don’t even have her birth certificate (however it’s definitely out there somewhere). She doesn’t have a permit or a drivers license because she fears that her parents will force her to drive to bars and back so they can get wasted as they are alcoholics and drug addicts, she doesn’t want to be a part of that.

She or anybody can’t report anything, even anonymously, the reports **never** go anywhere, she literally lives in the middle of nowhere in the woods, there are no neighbors nearby that can even see their frontyard, so the problem is that when a report is filed and the parents find out, they assume it would have to be their daughter because she would be the only one who knows about anything and she would be “punished for filing a report”. Even if I filed a report, the parents would find out I did it and then cut all contact with me which wouldn’t allow me to help her out when she turns 18, I don’t understand why these reports go nowhere.

Last month they drove from New York State to Ohio to get a puppy, the mother was completely against getting the puppy but the father was all for it. Long story short when they brought the puppy back it’s been in **constant neglect**, the mother won’t do anything with the dog and the father won’t do anything with it either. They put the dog with a leash on a pole and just keep it there for hours, she tells me that the dog cries for hours on end and nobody will do anything with it. The only person who cares for the dog is her, she told me that her father forced her to play with the dog and she was outside for 5 hours, she came inside simply to get water and as soon as she walked in the door her father became very aggravated at her for coming inside regardless of what she needed and the father exclaimed that he was “sick and tired of himself being the only one who cares for the dog” (of course with harsher language). She feels terrible for the dog but as far as we know there’s nothing we can do.

As recent as a few days ago, her parents brought her to a river with kayaks they recently purchased with their disability check at 6PM, it was fine and normal until around 9PM, where her family pushed her far into the river in the kayak and then proceeded to purposely abandon her on the opposite side of the current, she tried yelling for help to no avail, she rode the current until she got to some cornfield where she had to abandon the kayak and then try to call for help (her phone suffered water damage so the battery was draining abnormally fast), she called both of her parents and neither one of them answered, so she called one of her friends if she could walk to her house and charge her phone but her friend said no, she then decided to keep walking until she found a road (keep in mind she’s in a bathing suit this whole time), she eventually finds the highway, so she is now a 17 year old girl walking by herself beside a highway in a bathing suit at 10PM. She eventually gets service and calls me explaining what happened and where she is, I immediately get my parents and we drive down to where she was, we drive there and she’s in her bathing suit crying, she was behind a building because she was scared someone would take her.

My parents didn’t want her to go back to her house, they didn’t feel it was safe, but at the same time they couldn’t let a minor stay at their house without her parents permission. So my mother calls her mother, and she picks up with only one attempt at calling (keep in mind 17F tried calling her parents multiple times, yet her mother picks up an unknown number the first time they call, blatantly showing they were trying to abandon her), we explain to 17F’s mother that we have her daughter, then her mother just starts going on this whole “thank the lord” “god bless you” type ordeal and then begins to fake cry (it was painfully obvious), 17F then tells me that she fake cries all the time. 17F’s mother then gave permission that she could stay the night at our house. To be fair, she’s bipolar.

My worry is that her mother is going to cut contact with us and it’s going to put 17F is a major depressive episode that could lead to something bad.

There’s a **ton** of more detail I’m leaving out but I’m not sure if it’s relevancy. Please help.

TL;DR: I’m 17M, she’s 17F, we’re in New York State. Her parents are very abusive towards her, her parents got a puppy to which they simply neglect, her parents are alcoholics and drug addicts, her parents constantly berate her causing her to harm herself, can’t report anything due to no anonymity/security, her parents trying to blackmail me.",09Jul2020,1

876,"Here’s a bit of background info: 

My mom married when she was 20-21 yrs old to a 30 year old man (in my culture, it’s common for arranged marriages and so age gaps like these are quite common). She quit her college career in order to raise me. Unfortunately, my moms marriage was the complete opposite of a healthy one. My dads side of the family is completely ballistic and has been physically/verbally/mentally abusive towards her for 20+ years. My mom put up with it because she hasn’t had a job and she also had to raise my brother (he was born when I was 6yrs old). Financially, my father takes care of the family so it’s understandable why she put up with my dads family.

Sadly, my father has been just as abusive. I recently found (a few months ago) that my father had kicked or hit my mom when she was pregnant with me. He has even been disgusting comments based on her and comparing her with my aunt. The physical abuse did not stop until me and my brother were old enough to actually understand the situation. As of right now, my father is vulnerable and old (he had heart surgery) during this pandemic and he doesn’t abuse nearly as much as he did in the past (obviously this is still wrong). Whilst he does not “abuse” like he used to, he still lies behind our backs. 

Recently, my mom found out that my dad is filing some VISAs for his family so that they could all come live under our household. My mom was extremely furious and as usual they argued again. This morning she came to me to tell me that my dad kept this hidden from 2013 which is when he actually filed for it. So it’s only a matter of time until they actually come. 

My mother for the last decade has stated she wants to divorce but I think she is too afraid because she doesn’t have a job or financial means to take care of me and my brother. Now, my brother is 13 and in middle school, I’m a sophomore in college. My mother’s plan is too divorce (she seems very serious unlike all the other times), move to where I go to college (upstate NY), and stay there until she gets enough money to find a place all the way in California. 

I’ve been on my moms side of this the whole time and have defended her numerous times (although I told her I would not move to California with her, she was angry at me but this is besides the point). 

Anyways, I’m just really out of options on how to handle the situation. 

I mean if this all truly comes to fruition, it would affect me in large way and my father pays for my tuition. It would also hurt my mom financially (I will obviously help her as much as I can). 

Just a really tough situation. What can do I as the oldest son, is there really anything I can do? It’s like I want to solve this family drama. The divorce will hurt me, as much my father abused my mother, he has kept a roof over our heads and fed me. I respect him as a hard working man and I do love him so it would hurt me to see them split but I also love my mom and respect her feelings and the years of abuse she went through.

My company is fairly large (about 12k employees globally). Some sections of the business are not doing as well right now, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, my section is doing really, really well! We've signed so many new contracts in just the last month alone. I think that's why everyone has been feeling so overwhelmed. We have all this new work coming in and we're not hiring people! Which honestly in a way is frustrating in and of itself, because the unemployment rate is substantial right now... I think the company is taking advantage of its employees; people are scared to leave since it'll be difficult to find a new job with the state of the current economy.

I think because a lot of revenue is coming into our section of the business, it really is not fair that they are doing nothing to help us out. I had a call with my boss today and she definitely beat around the bush when I brought up how overwhelmed I was and the possibility of hiring new people.

887,"This person who was my junior in school used to bully me by hurling homophobic/transphobic slurs at me because I have been struggling with PCOS since I hit puberty and had a lot of facial hair as a girl in school. He used to pass remarks like I was a man wearing a skirt as my school uniform and so much more. This bullying and mental harassment went on for years. 

Now I had put it all behind me as all this happened to me when I was 17 and now I’m 22. But today I came across this person’s piece of editorial somewhere on Facebook where he was bashing misogyny and homophobia, and was championing dignity and integrity. It was quite surprising as I was taken aback by the irony of it. 

I’ve been in a dilemma since the morning that whether I should confront the person or let it be? Please help me out! Thank you.",09Jul2020,1
888,"This year has been trash. On every possible level. In January I fell out with my best friend (let's call her A just to keep her identity secret, I know no one would find her but at least if she discovers this she won't know if it is actually her) then corona came around and none of my friends have spoken to me for a long time except one and I kinda like her, I think she kinda likes me, but I'm too much of a dumbass to know for certain. Then one by one friends would text me and say they didnt want anything to do with my anymore and block me, and I still to this day dont understand why! 

Me and A used to talk all the time, every single day. If I didnt answer she would be pissed, if she didnt, so would I. And we would call every weekend and read stupid stories to each other trying to get the other person to laugh and we spent all day together at school, (we are both teenagers lol) we were basically inseparable.

Since we fell out in january I had about a 12 week period of crying and upset days. After that first part was over I thought I was okay, but then broke down at a party and ran to the bathroom to clean myself up cos I'm a guy, and I rarely ever cry, so if someone saw me they would know it's bad yet I would be too embarrassed to tell them cos yanno, I'm just a silly teenager 🤷‍♀️. I locked myself in the cubicle and composed a long text to her apologising for whatever I possibly could have done wrong (I still dont understand why we fell out to begin with). She didnt open it for 2 days and then left me on read, by which point I was ready to pull myself together and move on.

However just a couple weeks later we were put into lockdown and suddenly my rock was gone, I had no one to talk to, or to vent to and suddenly the world seemed to go dark and become a horrible hell hole that i couldn't wait to escape. I resorted to self harming and self deprecation just so I could feel something.

Since I stopped speaking to A, my entire life has felt empty and meaningless and no one had been able to come even close to making me feel how she felt, and that's just platonically, let alone if we dated. I also want to make it known that none of this has been her fault and that this is just me ranting on about my bad coping mechanisms.

Anyways, we had to go back to school and she has been friendly, she has spoken to me and we have gotten along well. The only issue is that I know even if I do fix the friendship, it will probably never be what it was, not for a long time, and I dont have a long time because I'm going into my final year of school and this time next year, she will be completely gone.

People say things like ""get over her"" or ""there are plenty more fish in the sea"" but these sayings come from people who always end up with what they want, they are loved and cared about and they feel fulfilled, yet my life since I turned 12 has been a series of downhill event and I'm only 15! Hell I'm scared to turn 16 in november because of what might come. Either way what these people who say these quotes dont understand about me, or someone like me is that I dont have anyone who genuinely wants me around, let alone give off the same vibes and energy as A - and I dont have the social skills to make more friends like her.

I just feel so empty after all of this and I dont know what to do anymore. And I'm sorry for taking up all this time, and I've you've read this far you're am absolute legend and I cannot thank you enough for listening to my crap.",09Jul2020,1

891,"I'm a 17 year old transman from England. In early 2020 I began sofa-surfing as my mother was unable to pay for me to live with her, in early March my cousin discovered that I was doing so and placed me with my grandparents. My grandparents, grandmother and great-grandmother specifically, have a long history of bigotry and mental abuse. When I was living with them, they never let me forget how much they disapproved of my life choices and never seemed to pass up an opportunity to voice their degrading opinions. In late March, shortly after lock down began, I was taken in by friends as my depression had become exacerbated, I had a severe mental breakdown and became suicidal. They had said I could live with them for as long as it took for me to get on my feet. Several days ago they told me I have to move out by the end of the month. I cannot go back to my mother as she cannot afford to care for me and will be moving in with her boyfriend, who refuses to take me in, and so I must move back in with my grandparents. I have no other friends I can stay with and I have already been told by social services I cannot be put in supported accommodation or care as my grandparents have (reluctantly) offered me a place to stay. I am currently unemployed and not in education, though I have been job hunting. When I do return to my grandparent's house I will not have an internet connection nor will I be allowed to leave the house (as they are vulnerable to COVID) so I will not be able to continue applying for jobs or college nor have any means of online related distractions (i.e video games or music) and limited contact with friends. I am also a freelance artist with a newly formed clothing brand and I will not be able to continue this work. I want to protect my mental health however it feels like I have no other options to take.

892,"This is going to be a lot, and I am just glad no one personally knows I have this. 
Please forgive me for inconsistency in my speech as I am getting a LOT off of my chest at once.

I (f20) have been sexually abused and emotionally manipulated since I was 15 by my oldest brother (who at the time was in his late 30s). 
It went on for about two to three years and now that I am 20, I've realized just how messed up it made me. 

He did it at a time where I stopped talking to my father, and was living with my single mother (who I am the only child for) who was struggling immensely financially and was relying on anyone that could help her as not only was she unemployed, she was and still is, suffering from a major disability called anemia (serious enough to get weekly transfusions, often ER visits from collapsing, and get in a ton of medical debt). 

I think my brother used this to start becoming depended on by my mom, and get closer to me, and eventually it led into me staying over at his house, paying for bills, eating dinner with us, taking me to school, etc. She of course, thought he was just being a wonderful big brother and I hold no animosity towards her. 

He had always made me uncomfortable, saying comments about my body, nudes, relationships, but I didn't really see a BIG problem, until one night, while I was staying over at his place before school, he started giving me alcohol. Now, I was a kid, and although now I know I shouldn't have drank any of it, being treated like an adult and given alcohol because I'm ""so adult"" is a kids dream more or less. I kept being given more, and I'm pretty sure he put something in it, as I become unable to think clearly and move appropriately. He then broached the topic of incest, and began to force himself on me. 

I'll spare the details, but it got to a point where it was common, I would be given something to drink, I feel woozy/different, and I would be taken advantage of. I had a irrational fear that if I told someone, or said no, he would take away all the financial help he was giving my mom. I also didn't want my mom to know that she was basically allowing me to be in this situation by letting him pick me up from school/work, and that knowledge would destroy her, and I just can't do it to her - ya know?

It has gone as far as being picked up from school to be given birth control just in case by my brother, and I felt so ugly, used, and like property, that I didn't think I had a right to say no after a while to his forceful approaches. It just hurt more then, and I just wanted it to get over with quicker. 

I KNOW I should have said something then, but I just didn't know how. 

Anyways, five years later when it started, (my brother ended up stoping at before I turned 18, I was living with roommates and thankfully I got strong enough to start saying no to being alone with him, and being smart about people always being home with me) I ended up talking to my dad again, and it all spilled out on the table during this past father's day. Now apparently, my brother has been accused of something similar to this, such as attempts, but not actual rape. 

Now my father has been pushing me to see a therapist (which I agree with), has told my step mom, and my step sisters, within the past three weeks. He wants to eventually tell everyone, and I am scared. 

My brother has a family, and although he has done unspeakable things to me, I have a hard time thinking of ruining his life. At least right now. I haven't told anyone this (besides my AMAZING boyfriend of two years how has been incredibly supportive) and now it feels as if it is being ripped open for all to see. 

 It feels too fast, and I feel as if somehow he can do something to hurt me again. He is the kind of person that would go after revenge. I don't want people to know my shame, but I also don't want other people to be hurt by him.

I don't know what to do right now, and I could really use some help in figuring out my next steps.",09Jul2020,1

896,"I don’t know how to say this without making myself sound terrible. I am 19F. I have a little dating experience and no relationship experience. I really want a boyfriend because I’m one of the only people to not have one from the people around me. I haven’t even kissed anyone yet and corona is making that more difficult. I feel like society has brainwashed me into wanting romance and relationships, when in reality it is not something I am suited for. I want it, but I don’t see myself as a girlfriend or a wife. I’ve always wanted to have children in the future, and I feel like I’ll make a good mum. However, I can never imagine myself in a successful relationship. 

I am currently in a pretty dark place, I have been for the past two years since I found out some really surprising news about how both my parents were cheating on each other, but refuse to divorce (it’s a long story). I feel like marriage is a sham, or that I don’t know what a successful marriage looks like. I also feel that as an individual I am currently in a place where I cannot care about anyone. I feel incredible apathy towards people’s problems. It makes me feel like a bad person, but I cannot find it in myself to care about something that doesn’t concern me. Sometimes people complain to me and I just think « Wow I’ll pretend to care, but I can’t wait till you stop speaking about this because I don’t care ». I become obnoxious when the problem concerns me though. 

I dislike most of the people I meet and am in a pretty toxic place. I am mistrustful of every guy and at the same time jealous of every happy couple. I just don’t see how my toxicity can go away and I will have a happy relationship with someone. I cannot imagine caring, making compromises, being intimate and vulnerable with someone. I feel so uncomfortable with trusting anyone. On top of that I am incredibly stingy and unwilling to share anything. Sometimes I wonder if there are people like me, who simply shouldn’t get into relationships. I’m sure there are many people like me who realise it, but get into them anyway and it’s just terrible. 

At the same time I am rushing myself into dating, since I will be 20 this year and I find it so scary that I’ll be that age without any romantic experience. Having a boyfriend feels like something I just want ticked off a list and not something I need or want. But I don’t want my peers to think I’m weird. Should I date a guy and get into a relationship, just so when I have a proper boyfriend and I’m in a better place he isn’t weirded out.

TLDR:
I am too uncaring, apathetic and scared to be vulnerable. I’m in a pretty toxic place mentally due to some family issues. I have no boyfriend experience and I’m scared it will look weird because I am turning twenty this year. Should I date a guy and get into a relationship just so when I meet an actual guy and I’m in a better place he isn’t weirded out.",09Jul2020,1

899,"My life is literally my own personal hell. It gives me constant headaches and panic attacks I can’t sleep I always feel sick I can’t get out of bed. 

I’m trapped in my shitty small town and it’s hell on earth. My parents are extremely poor and don’t care about anything but beer and cigarettes. My roof is leaking I’m paranoid of there being mold because I always feel dead. The weather here is fucking garbage literally the worst in the world. It’s like -20 degrees in the winter and then in the summer it’s like 90 degrees with blaring sun all day long. I mean literally 18 hours of pure sun months on end with zero clouds in the sky. The sun directly hits my window 10 hours a day and it makes my headaches and stress even worse. 

I have ptsd from my family and my shitty mom makes it even worse. She constantly sets me off for no reason or is an ass hole and then just makes everything an even bigger pain in the ass. Sometimes they get drunk and my retarded mom just flails around on the ground and shit and my parents yell and scream swear words at each other getting piss drunk. I fucking hate them!!!! 

I got trapped here WAY fucking longer than any person should ever have to be. I tried doing the right thing going to college, working shitty jobs it got me nowhere. My depression and fatigue got so bad I took a few years off and it kept getting worse and worse. I finally got a bunch of money saved up and had my life going perfect everything was good finally getting out. NOPE!!!!!!!!! 

My life got fucking worse than ever. I got arrested for a crime I didn’t commit and got the most strict severe punishment for fucking nothing trapping me in this hell hole. Constant shit I have to worry about meetings fucking 10x as much stress. I got the longest strictest harshest probation sentence I’ve ever seen for a minor crime I didn’t even commit. It made my ptsd worse becuase now I’m full on fucking stuck with my parents with no escape I have daily nightmares and I’m fucking sleep deprived as fuck 24/7 and the constant stress of worrying about mold and 24/7 shining sun makes it all worse. 

I cant do anything. I cant go outside cause I have a 24 hour migraine every day and the sun hurts my head. I cant even talk I avoid conversation and if anyone talks to me all I can do is respond with one word monotone answers and look down at the ground. I’m always sick my life is hell. This took away all joy from my life because weed at least stopped the nightmares and I could laugh sometimes now I just get overwhelmed by depression until I crash into a headache and stuck in bed. I’ve been stuck in bed for a year now. 

I lost my entire youth to this. All of it gone just stuck worrying stressed in bed. The only last 3 friends I had were fucking lunatics and they just yelled and snapped at me and always tried to start fights over nothing and that gave me MORE ptsd.  I literally have like 8 different forms of ptsd now. I’m constantly on high alert of my parents coming around the corner with more ptsd or getting in trouble and having the cops show up so I can never relax. 

This is my life. I’ve never had a car. I constantly lose my license over shit that’s never my fault and poverty. My house is a death trap with health hazards everywhere. Ptsd from every angle. Trapped here. I lost all fun. I’ve never even been on a vacation. I’ve never had a trip or the beach or anything fun no happy memories. I tried going on vacation one time with my parents and my mom just got drunk and started screaming at me for no reason so it was just an 8 hour car ride of screaming and then my parents abondoned me and I just sat alone the entire time until they went home. That was my only vacation. Bad shit ALWAYS happens. Literally always fucking the worst shit happens at the worst time every time. 

Plus I’m totally fucked in the head from women. The only way I had to talk to girls was over the internet and my depression was so bad I could barely keep a conversation. They all just ghosted me or cheated me or whatever. This happened for 5 years in a row. Like daily for 5 years. I cant talk to women anymore after this and I’m too depressed to even try and im fucked in the head from it. 

Literally the worst life in the world. I talk to people from third world countries and even they can’t believe how poor my shitty parents are and how bad my life is and every third world country looks like literal paradise to me. I have never once in my life met anyone with a worse life than me. I live in the middle of nowhere literally. 8 hours from a major city 2 hours from a single thing. My parents are too poor to literally every go to the city or do anything so my entire life has just be loneliness in a small town. Every single person has it better. 

I’m too tired to do anything.  I just sit alone in my room in bed trying to block out the sun because any light gives me migraines. I’m constantly worried I have mold in my house killing me and it stresses me out 24/7 I can’t even sleep or relax. I had all joy ripped away my life. I have lifelong irreversible ptsd that will haunt me forever. My last and only friend died and we never talked for years on end before that either. I have like one friend online who’s life sucks almost as much and they just never talk to me. 

I just want to get the fuck away from my parents and even if I manage that I have MORE BULL SHIT TO WORRY ABOUT. I have a cat who’s literally my only friend and I don’t know how I’d move states with my cat but I don’t want to leave him here with my parents in my shitty house and have to worry about all that and then have to come back and get it.

907,"Hello reddit

So for a little back story :

Me and my dad always get into these stupid fights about everything. Mostly because both of us are super stubborn and I am 15(girl) (you know what that age does to you) .

Actaul story :

And not long ago I started to practice for the a1 motorcycle license. My teacher, my dad, me, and everyone else agreed that it would be a lot cheaper if we bought a motorcycle that I could practice on when I'm at home.
Because one driving lesson is about around 90-100 dollars (from nok)

So anyway we buy the motorcycle and practice driving. (we had some friends who helped us out once because I was scared of doing it illegally, I didn't want to get a fine and wait for 18 years old in order to be able to drive again)

Saldy those friends don't have much time and can't help me out anymore. And on one of our trips with only my dad, I we got into this fight and he said

'I'm done paying for your license, and I'm done practicing with you, and if you don't practice, I promise, I WILL sell that stupid motorcycle. ' along with other things but its not that important.

The thing is. I only have a few hundred dollars left, and I could sell the motorcycle for about 15 000 - 17 000 kroner (around 1500-1700 dollars)  that way I would have enough money to pay for the driving lessons.

And ok to be fair, he says these things a lot (I will not pay for you anymore blah blah blah) but this time he really ment it. My mum isn't helping either, we don't talk much lately for some rare reason, but that's not important either. 

I also am looking for a job. , but selling that motorcycle would be of much benefit to me.  So is there any adults who can help me act ""adulty"" in this situation?

I didn't realize that after I apply online, I must call them. I tried that and they said they don't need me. I applied to many different places. When I applied to one job during Feb. 2020, I got declined the next day and I don't know why. In 2016, I delivered above average performance at my job. 2017 was another story. I'd like a job so I can have some income before I get my career started.

During college, I ran a travel photo business using my photos. I sold greeting cards with my work and payed sales taxes on the customers' behalf. It stopped after graduation as I sold face to face on campus. I thought about running the business on the side after graduation. I'd like to sell large prints and photo murals but I'm insecure about the camera's limited detail (I use a Nikon D3200 and proper technique). I thought about different solutions like image stitching, renting a full frame with a better lenses, using extremely high resolution 35mm black and white film (I do black and white and color with digital currently), and large format film. I have a portfolio website but no social media accounts dedicated to it. I'm low on money in general.

Like many of us, I have done some terrible things to a lot of people, quite severe, and I didn’t even feel one bit of remorse, nor do I now. I’m not sure what to do anymore. I don’t feel guilty. I’m just really, really lonely. I have no1.

I don’t relate to anyone, I’m not compatible with anyone, I’m just an outsider. Everyone just calls me names, like, “an abomination” or “ despicable”. But no one understands me, my suffering, hurting people genuinely makes me feel better. Hurting others, their egos, it boosts my ego. It makes me feel powerful.

I’ve gotten more interested in that idea, power or control. People call me insecure, but honestly, I see myself as above others. By comparing myself to the average person, I think I’m better, better than most, if not all. This might get deleted, might not, but I guess I can understand how they cannot understand my actions. I just want to feel like a normal person. 

I want to live a day, happy, without the chronic need for stimulation from my boredom which just leaves me feeling really hollow. I can’t do what other people can, I can’t feel. I can’t feel basic human emotions, I don’t feel remorse, guilt, love.. I don’t feel any of it. Even if I did start to feel it, I wouldn’t know, I wouldn’t be able to tell. My whole life I’ve just been overlooked, ignored, I would try so, so very hard just for other’s to acknowledge my presence. 

I feel like a stranger to myself and everyone around me. It’s like I’m watching life through a video on my phone, I’m not actually participating, I’m just watching in, viewing others as they excel in life. I’m tired of my presence being taken for granted. I’m tired of the constant neglect, it’s killing me. My own mother told me I should kill myself since I was a child. 

She constantly left me alone, by myself, to whore around. She did the same when I was put through 4 years of my alcoholic step-dad torturing all of us. He would, eh, I would wake up at night, a lot of the time, to shouting. 

I would always remember just waking up, hearing his drunk ass banging on the glass sliding door at the back of our house, (he lived next door for some time with his parents). And his parents were away a lot of the time. Whenever I heard they were going away, I would constantly just be filled with paranoia, anxiety, sadness to the likely experiences of him being even more abusive. Most of my childhood was spent, just, sitting on the stairs, listening to him hurt her, her screams, him punching walls, kicking in doors. Not to mention the constant bullying I’d receive from school to school, simply for always moving and being “the new kid”. 

Some of their rumors could be true, but I don’t remember, that time in my life was so traumatic that I don’t even really remember. I mean, I have vague little flashbacks of the neighbor, (at the time)’s daughter, forcing herself on top of me, touching me and shit. Using me and stuff. That went on for 3 years, (I was very young at the time, hence why I didn’t really know what she was doing at the time was wrong), and when she got bored of me, I started to actually develop a crush on her, and she used that against me, by neglecting me and purposely making me jealous. I wish I had my dad. 

He was the only true parent I’ve ever had, but yet, he died on my 10th birthday. As well as my grandmother, who died on Easter. And now look at me, Dad! Aren’t I just excelling in life? I mean, how can I not be when I spent my childhood, cooped up in my room with thoughts to suffocate me and pollute my mind. 

Now, onto more about me. People say that sociopaths, well, have no moral compass, or it’s lacking. I’m not sure if I’d say I’d have none. When people say certain things are bad, I don’t understand the stigma. I don’t truly understand why people find these certain things so wrong. 

I understand and know that they’re wrong, but I don’t really see them as *that* bad. Whenever someone expects an emotional reaction out of me to a certain thing, I just think logically how I could pretend to be affected by it. Whenever I do something wrong or something bad happens, I don’t have some intrinsic feeling of guilt, sadness,  etc. so I have to kinda pretend to be affected by it in order to not get caught. Thing is, I get lonely, really, really lonely. 

I don’t know if it’s love that I want, attention, or validation, I don’t really know. I guess I just like being the centre of attention. That’s the reason for why I tell some people about this kinda stuff. It usually makes them more interested in me, and I like when people show that concern. It can get kind-of tiring always pretending, forming enthusiastic responses, etc. 

I mean, I sometimes mimic more.. righteous fictional characters and manifest their personality traits in order to charm my way into other’s trust, only to fuck them over for whatever they’re worth. But yeah, I still don’t know what I wanna do. I don’t know if I wanna try get a diagnosis, well, because, going undetected sounds a lot better. I’m not sure if I should or shouldn’t. I’m not sure what I should do with my life. 

I kinda just wait for days to pass and do nothing productive. I’ve been more drawn to the idea of manipulating others for money. I already have money, but it’d be nice to trick others into buying stuff for me, and saving my own money.

Anyways, life, hobbies, all that shit just bores me to death. I’ve no passion for anything, but I guess deceiving is pretty fun. To be more serious; I have no idea what to do.

918,"I (20f) had my dog for almost 12 years. I watched the mother dog give birth to her when i was 8, you could say i grew up with her. When i was away and unable to come back home because of covid, my dog was killed. She was literally my best friend and one of the things helping me keep myself together. 

My sister went on a trip to our grandmas house for the summer, and im watching her chihuahua. Her dog and my dog always got along well and ive always liked him. My mom also has a newfoundland, which has always been an outside dog. Since my dog died, ive been letting the Newfoundland inside. I also watched my brothers pitbull over the weekend. Theyre all really good dogs, i just have no connection to them and dont like dealing with them. Yet i feel bad if i neglect them (as in not doing more than just giving them their basic needs; food, water, a place to stay indoors) 

I think i was so used to my dog being the perfect fit for me, that i always thought i liked all dogs. Now that i dont have her anymore, all dogs irritate me but i put up with them. Im still nice to them and i feel bad that i feel anger towards them. I dont see myself getting another animal of any kind for a long time. Sometimes i just look at the other pets we have, and cry because i hate that i feel this way towards them. Is there anything i could do to make myself have a better mindset when it comes to pets?",09Jul2020,1
919,"Okay so this is such a complicated and stressful situation, but I'm gonna start off by saying that I'm not defending this guy. I'd preferably like karma to kick his arse. 

So Mike (m26) is one of my partners oldest and closest friends and when my partner and I got together we integrated into each others friend groups, as we met each others friends really early into the relationship. I didn't have an issue with an of my partners friends initially, as I wanted them to like me and accept me as his new girlfriend and all that. Mike was always very nice to me in the beginning but after a few months I noticed my boyfriends friend group had lots of skeletons hidden. The main issue being what a deeply sick individual Mike is. 

I've only know Mike for a few years but during that time I have seen a horrific deterioration in him. He works at an animal sanctuary where kids come to visit to see the animals and a local college sends students to work at the sanctuary during the summer, anyone can also volunteer. The sanctuary itself is also super dodgy for multiple reasons one of which being that its nickname is _____'s sanctuary for pedophiles. Obviously I didn't know that until recently. 

Mike started dating one of the college students working part time. He brought her to all the friend group events and parties, she even came on a group trip with us. He told us she was 18, we were already weirded out to be honest because everyone else in the group is mid to late twenties, I was the youngest at the time at 21. After dating her for ages and her becoming my friend, I was confused by his and others in the groups behaviour. He treeted her like shit, constantly talked badly about her behind her back about how she was apparently clingy and he was getting bored, but then everyone else in the group was just like oh that's just how Mike is, a new girl every summer that he fucks and then kicks to the curb. I was like okay that's awful. But the worst part was that she's not 18. She was 16, and only just 16. I was mortified.

I found out from others in the group after this that everyone he dates is a child, he only dates girls under 18.  He's the one in charge of selecting the college students that get sent to the sanctuary and he admitted to searching them on social media to see if he thinks they're ""hot"". He only likes little blonde girls. Not only is he one of their bosses but he's their teacher as well. It makes me sick. I expressed my concerns to the group and was shot down, they refuse to accept what he is. Their excuse is that he was messed up by a girl when he was a kid so now he's taking out his issues on these girls. He's hurt so many girls. One of the girls in the friend group was the first girl he manipulated and abused, he's been messing with her head for 7 years. She's now incapable of having a normal healthy relationship. Her current boyfriend won't controls her and won't let her go out. 

The girl Mike was seeing he ended up dumping and now treats her even worse than before. He told her they couldn't be together right now but can in the future. The poor girl is utterly convinced she's in love with him. She comes from a bad home life and seeks out approval from men so she was an easy target for him. When he dumped her he told all of us to stop talking to her. I refused. He's now trying to do it to again to other girls and because my friend still works with him, she feels like he's rubbing it in her face. The poor girl has never too this day said a bad word about him, despite everything. I want to tell her everything, the truth about him that everyone is making me keep from her. I've told them to stuff it but the only thing holding me back is that she's so emotionally unstable and I'm concerned of what she'll do. She has already had one suicide attempt in the past couple months.

Her mother is awful as well, the narcissistic woman apologised to Mike the pedo for any inconvenience her daughter caused him! So that should give you an idea of who she has to go home to. Every time I've tried to tell my friend what's really going on, others in the group have lied to her. My partner is only just starting to realise that his friend is a pedophile which I sympathise is incredibly difficult for him, he can't comprehend that someone he thought of as a brother is this evil. Up until now they've all been protecting him and pretending it's not a problem. I can't stand by any more. The entire reason I work in the profession I do is because I want to help kids. I had a rough start and I want to help kids who went through similar things. I feel like an awful hypocrite, working with abused kids and preaching that abusers are bad even though one's in my damn friend group!

I've escaped my share of abusers and I want to help this girl, I want to stop this man but I don't know how. I've been checking in on her, making sure she keeps up with therapy and whatnot. The age of consent in my country is 16 but there's a grey area when one party is over 18 and the other is under. I know he's sexted with her and made her send him nudes and pimped her out to people all of which is illegal in my country but without her cooperation I've got no case and she's too infatuated with him, he's still telling her they're gonna be together on day! Once she ""fixes herself"". I would try and get him fired from his job which would loose him his staff housing but like I said before it's literally called the sanctuary for pedophiles so that's gonna be no help. Mike over the course of lockdown has gotten increasingly angry that the group don't go out and do drugs and party and drink every night like they did when they were 17. He still behaves like a child and has gotten angry at all of us for moving on with our lives and settling down. He has also expressed recent views on being pro concentration camp so he's 1000000% scumb.

I want karma to bite him in the arse, I've spoken to my colleagues about it but they have agreed that if we go to the police with no evidence and a victim that won't cooperate we're just gonna push her away and most likely closer to him. Her mother is on his side, so is his work, his friends are pretending it's not happening!!! He's done this to a different chd every year since he was 18, I feel like I'm running I'm circle's trying to get people to understand. I tried to explain to his friends that all it takes is one girl who's emotionally strong enough to go against him and then he's done and if they care about their friend they need to get him to stop. If one girl reports him then he'll probably get arrested for child pornography, endangering the welfare of a child, all that stuff. Then they'll have his phone and find out about the other girls. He'll never be able to work with animals again because pretty much all sanctuaries and zoos have kids come to them and he won't be able to work with children. Obviously him going down for all this is the goal but I currently don't have any willing witnesses and they're starting to get suspicious that I'm up to something so they won't tell me anything now. I don't even know the other girls names. 

Any advice would be appreciated please!",09Jul2020,3
920,"So a few months ago now I (19M) went over to my friends house because him and his gf were having a little party. A little bit into it my friends gf introduced me to one of her friends, for the sake of the story we will call her “R”. I talked to her (20F) and thought she was a pretty cool person, she had a lot to say, was super nice to everyone and always welcomed others to the conversation so people didn’t feel weird. 

Anyways that night passed and about a week later I get off work and my and my friend plan to hang out. We were just planning on going to McDonald’s then heading back to his place to place some video games or something. So I hop into the front seat and who’s sitting in the back? His gf and R. At that point I was pretty happy that she was there because I never actually got her number or Snapchat at the party because the conversation kind of just shifted away from just the two of us. We go back to his house, hang out and everything’s great and this time I actually got her number. After that we all hung out in a group a few more times and I was thinking about asking her out. 

So end of June rolls around and my friend is having another party because his parents were gone for the entire month up north visiting family or something. I showed up pretty early to help with whatever I can and I tell him that I’m probably gonna ask R on a date after tonight and that when he dropped a massive bombshell on me. He tells me that she has a boyfriend and she lives with him and his parents. Her aunt was moving like 10 hours away a year prior and she didn’t want to go with so she moved in with her boyfriend at the time. The worst part was I knew who he was too because I used to go to school with him. I really dislike this guy, he’s rude, angry, manipulative and only looks out for himself. I was really shocked when I found this out, but what was even more shocking is that they were purposely trying to set me up with her so that she would get rid of that asshole. I felt pretty betrayed by everybody. I kind of pushed to the back of my mind when people started showing up because I didn’t want to think about it. 

R showed up and I decided not to mention the bf thing yet. After a while she kind of suggested that she wanted to hang out with me alone for once so I thought it was probably a good time to talk about it. When I brought it up she said she was sorry for not telling me and that she wants to end things with him, but she’s just stuck. If she breaks up with him she’s pretty much gonna be living on the streets. I don’t like the guy either he’s awful, but I told her that I can’t do this if they are together. I’m very against cheating and if I tried to date someone knowing they have a bf already I basically am cheating. Her situation is shitty and I do like her, but I feel like I’ve been a puppet this whole time. I really don’t know what to do at this point. I kind of feel like I’m just too young to be doing this sort of thing. Do I try my luck or do I just forget about her and this whole situation?",09Jul2020,1

937,"(I just want to note that my boyfriend recently became a legal adult, so that's why he hasnt been able to do much about any of this until now) 

My FIL (kinda FIL, using the term to not have to type ""my boyfriend's dad"" a bunch) and his wife have four dogs, and three cats. Three of the dogs skin and fur are in terrible condition, and the three cats live in the dirty basement that I assume has pee and poop everywhere and the litter box isnt changed often as far as I know. The only human interaction they have is when his step daughter feeds and waters them everyday or when his wife does laundry. It's so bad my boyfriend and his dad refuse to go down there. 

Theres one dog they have that is way too old. His quality of life is gone. He cant walk, maybe sometimes if hes helped to his feet, but he can barely walk even with that. His hips are basically just bone, like my boyfriend says he can either actually see bone from him laying down and dragging himself around all day or it's just really bad skin or something. He can't even go outside, so he goes to the bathroom on the floor and they clean it up. They put a cushion under his hips, but STILL. One of his front paws is also bloated, but my boyfriend says he doesnt know why. (My boyfriend lives between my house and his dad's, but hes usually at my house or work). 

My FIL's wife doesnt want to put the poor old boy down, so I doubt she could be convinced. This is actually the second time this has happened with a dog she's had... 

Now, heres another problem. 
I've already decided without a doubt I'm going to send an anonymous tip to animal control. However, one of the dogs is technically my boyfriend's, and he wants to bring her to my house and do better for her. We're currently saving money to take her to the vet for her skin and fur, and to get her spayed, and whatever other costs could come up. But if we take her, and then call, that would be very suspicious, and we really dont want his family to know it was us. 

So, I'm asking if theres any way we could go about getting his dog if animal control takes them? If we have to, we can accept if we cant take her because we'll know she'll go to a good home, but we really want to give her the life she deserves with us.",09Jul2020,1

So, I live in a state where marijuana are illegal. I went to my post office to check my box and I had a package slip for some fabrics that I had ordered, so I went to the counter and gave the slip to the worker and told them my box number. They came back with a package and scanned it and gave it to me. I left and went home. When I got home I started opening it up and the package was in a lot of bags, which I thought was a weird way to package fabric. Well, I open the 2nd bag and realize what it was.... definitely not the fabric I ordered. I checked the box and realize it wasn’t even addressed to me or my box. So I have no idea how or why the postal worker gave me the package. 

I have no idea what to do. I can’t really take it back to the post office and just pretend it was the wrong package, because it reeks now. I really don’t want to call the police and hand it over because I don’t wanna get in trouble (I know this is unlikely since it was given to me by mistake and opened by mistake, but the fear is still there). But I’m also concerned what the intended recipient will do. I’m sure their tracking says it’s been delivered, whatre they gonna do when they go get it and it’s not there. Given the amount of product, I assume they have a lot of money sunk in this, but it’s also illegal in the state I live. So do they just let it go as a miss or press the post office to find the package. I’m just so confused on what to do.",09Jul2020,3
943,"I need to finish high school I always never liked school but I don't know a lot of people who love it either. 

   But I literally slacked off

 FUCKING ABOUT THREE YEARS. 

    I was smoking weed and I gradually stopped smoking it used to be every day to few weeks then three or  two times a month I'd have a smoke or usually only with friends. I am in a charter school where basically I could cram a shit ton of work if I wanted to pass before I turned eighteen.

   I'm sixteen now and I don't know how much time I have left at this school to try to get my diploma but I'm considered a 9th grader work wise I haven't even finished half of the credits I need to do for freshman year. I was doing well turning in credits I was supposed to turn in two a week (and still have to) but now if I wanna catch up I need to do three a week.
I KNOW I have to do it.

But you know what?

  I don't. Fucking. Do. My. Work.

I will start and never get shit done when I'm home cause of quarantine it fucked me in the ass I do better in the fucking zombie work environment than my own room. I just can't get shit done in my room or my house. So I'm falling behind again and I haven't done any work nor turned in a credit for two months now. And I'm pissing myself off for being a lazy fuck.

I know I don't like school so that's why I don't wanna do the work the work they give me is busy work I don't learn shit from this school and to put it simply

   I just don't want to graduate. I don't want to put in this effort that won't get me anywhere. 

I don't know what I'd do weather or not I did graduate I know that'd my options would be very limited for work and such but I doubt I'll graduate in time so I'll try to get work done but look into what I can do without a highschool diploma.",09Jul2020,1

We met and became friends in my hometown. We first met on tinder and had a really bad failed hookup and ever since then we have been purely friends and nothing more. 

We’ve spent a ton of time together and I consider us close friends 

He also was in the army and was deployed overseas until this May. So he has been back in my hometown for about a month. 

The last time we spoke was on July third about our plans for the 4th. 

We didn’t fight or anything out of the normal. 
But ever since then he’s been totally silent. He’s never ghosted me or ignored me and I don’t think there’s a reason to. Also I’m not blocked on anything so I don’t think it’s that. 

His phone goes straight to voicemail when I call it. I’m honestly getting pretty concerned, because he struggles with depression I believe. He was regularly meeting with a therapist while deployed but when he went back home he told me he was really feeling bad because everything reminded him of his ex, whom he really loved.

948,"Hi! I run a bakery in a small town and because of that I know a lot of my customers personally.

She always apologizes, but I’ve had it, and she realized that and told me that the next time she orders, she will pay upfront. Well, she ordered today, and I asked how she was paying. She said etransfer. Great. That was 6 hours ago. Her order is ready, and I don’t have her payment.

951,"I (17M) am a very reserved, extremely introverted person. I have been for as long as I can remember, which happens to be about 11 years. I have never been exactly friendless – I usually get along with a (limited, but reasonable) number of people from school – but I very rarely hang out with any of them. It's never been a great pleasure for me to be around other people when not necessary (i.e. outside of school).

&amp;#x200B;

Lately, however, I have felt as though some of these friends are trying to 'connect' more with me. I suppose there's always been room for me in these social groups, and it was always up to me to step in or keep out. My problem is not that I don't know how to step in – it's that I don't know whether I actually want to step in.

&amp;#x200B;

I believe that my extreme introvertedness may be due (at least partly) to my family situation. I'll make it as short as I can: my sister (22F) has been suffering from mental health issues for over a decade. During this time, she's had her highs and lows (the former brief and not very high; the latter longer and tremendously low); she recovered from the illness she had in the beginning, but now has new, different problems, which have resulted in self-harm, non-stop crying and constant wish for death. (My mother is currently keeping her on a sort of suicide watch.)

&amp;#x200B;

When she first started having these problems, seeing a psychologist, etc., my mother (understandably) didn't want me to tell anyone, or the other kids would've told their parents and the rumor would've started spreading all over the neighborhood. I always obeyed, of course, but I think it might be time for me to break the silence.

&amp;#x200B;

I am now much older than I was back then, and my sister's problems have also lasted far longer than my mother would've hoped. All my mother's friends know about what is going on, obviously – there would be no way for her to have any of those friends if she wanted to keep it a secret. None of mine don't, and I'm still not sure I want to tell any of them.

&amp;#x200B;

There are two things that keep me from telling them:

1. How they might take it
2. That they might tell somebody else, who would then tell somebody else, and so on and so on

&amp;#x200B;

First: how they might take it.

I don't know how they would react if I were to tell them about all this, but I feel like it would be terribly awkward if they knew. The people that I'm considering are all wonderful people, and I am sure they would all stand by my side if I were to tell them. I fear, however, that they might see my opening up about all this as sort of a call for help? Maybe they'll think that I need a shoulder to cry on or something, but I really don't. This has been going on for so long since I was so little and it has been so terrible at times that I have become desensitized. When people ask me how it's going and I say I'm fine, I actually mean it. This is normal to me. I'd tell someone not for emotional support, but just to sort of let them know. I really, really like some of my friends and I feel like they deserve to know such a big part of my life. It might also explain why I have always been so secretive and avoidant.

&amp;#x200B;

Second: that they might tell others.

Those few friends whom I would tell are the ones I trust the most. This doesn't mean, however, that I can fully trust them. They all have close friends who are also my friends and I'm afraid they would tell at least some of them. The last thing I want is a bunch of people (no matter who they are) pitying me for my situation. I don't want this to be out in the open. I don't want people to know. But at the same time I feel like I should tell someone, if I am sure that they can keep it a secret.

952,"so there’s me and this girl. we like each other, but she’s been dating her current boyfriend for 7 years now. recently the boyfriend has started doing less than cool shit at the expense of her, i won’t get into the details.

she’s ready to leave him and move out, but she can’t find a place cost-effective enough that will also take her pets. there are places, but they’re in a less than ideal part of town.

her friend has asked me up front if i’d help her out and let her stay at my place. i’m just not sure it’d be a good idea for me to do that because of the way we feel about each other and the fact that she just got out of that long relationship.

954,"It’s been most prominent during this lockdown. I will curse behind people’s backs for even just greeting me in the mornings. It’s only with family. I just despise their presence and it’s really fucking stupid because they do a lot for me, but I always throw it back in their faces. 

I have tried to change this, but I have ADHD, which doesn’t help when trying to commit myself to a big change in routine and lifestyle. I will instantly go back to the dumpster fire that is my bedroom if I can’t be bothered. 

I have a stupidly high amount of screen time, and do NOTHING productive. And when I try? It’s so tiring to me that I can’t focus enough to study/process information properly. I’m lazy as hell. For example, I love the electric guitar. So much. The sounds. The comfort. It’s fun. But I’m too lazy to speak up about a passion, let alone even start working toward a goal. 

I even tried learning coding since it seemed fun. But my lazy ass decided “no, screw that, watch YouTube all day”.  This has a resulted in a seemingly endless loop of bitchiness, laziness and generally getting nothing done. 

Another problem I have is: I can’t accept that I’m wrong. I will automatically argue until the other person stops. I HAVE to have the last word for some stupid unknown reason. My family point it out regularly and I’m really ashamed of it.

I had a full-on breakdown the other day after I shouted at my stepdad (literally just because he was showing concern) as the realisation sank in I began feeling horrible feelings. I even had suicidal thoughts for a few seconds, a first for me and hopefully a last, though those were dismissed quickly. It was the first time I cried all year.

So basically the last month or so my friend (13F) has been really distant and hasn't been texting me (15M).

This whole situation when she wasn't talking to me had a severe effect on my mental health (not gonna go into details) and left me feeling like she abandoned me. I expressed this to her but as any friend would do, forgave her wholeheartedly and without hesitation. She's been really down on herself for hurting me but I keep telling her that it's all okay and I forgive her for everything. The problem is that she isn't forgiving herself. Now she is saying that she thinks that we should stop talking to one another and being friends so she doesn't hurt me again and I reminded her that everything is okay and I forgave her and that she shouldn't have to feel guilty. She hasn't responded to my text and I just need some advice on what I should do.

963,"I’m in my early 20s, I’m male, and I live in the UK. Sorry if this post seems pretty disjointed but I’ve found it difficult to put this all into words.

I was abused and bullied a lot as a kid. For my whole life I’ve had a strong fear of social situations and people in general. It’s very stressful to be in view of other people, whether I’m at a place, or walking down the road, or talking on the phone, or whatever else. I feel very distant for most of the day and find it very hard to concentrate on anything. I can barely talk properly to most people, and I don't know why I can talk to the few I can.

I started becoming (what I call) addicted to gaming and the internet in general about half way through secondary school. I can hardly concentrate on anything, and I pretty much completely gave up on all my studies and hobbies and friendships for around the next 8 years up until today. 

I still live with my abusive father and manipulative mother today. I’ve never felt safe to talk to them about any of this. Due to my social issues I found it very difficult to find a job, but eventually I found a very mentally and physically taxing job that pays minimum wage. I pretty much only go out to work and the rest of the time I’m distracting myself at home on my computer.

I have tried to resolve my mental health issues, I’ve been to a counsellor before but I didn’t find it useful at the time. I would find a therapist but I fear talking to them, and I don’t know where to find one, and I’m afraid that at the end my problems might not be resolved.

I really want to go back to school and achieve something but I don’t know where to start. I don’t know what subject I want to do, and I wouldn’t be able to concentrate. One of the only things I wanted to do as a kid was be the first person in my family to go to university, but I don’t think that’s going to happen. I feel like my life is already over and I have nothing to show for it.

I don’t know what is wrong with my brain, but I feel like I just don’t know what I’m doing. It feels like all the other people just know what to do and where they’re going, but I never learnt any of that. I don’t know what kind of therapist I need or where to get one. I don’t know how to start a career or what I need to study. I don’t know how to make and stay in contact with friends. I don’t know what I’d tell a doctor or if they would even help me. 

Every time I feel like I’m making some sort of progress, I always fall back into a game or just get sucked into my laptop. I have made some positive changes recently (like tidying up the house) but any routine or plan to learn something new never sticks. My sleep is better but still inconsistent. No matter how much I sleep I always feel completely exhausted.

First it was, I can help you network if you move here (which I couldn't afford and he and my aunt wouldn't provide me with any kind of housing more than over night), so of course I had to turn that down. Then he sent me someone who needed freelance work done, but the work they were looking for was completely out of my skillset (and not something I could pick up in a weekend). So I ended up being placed in a super awkward position of ""well I can't help you, but this other person I know can."" Like it not only showed that he didn't even look at my resume (which I sent him) and it made me look pretty unprofessional. I honestly feel like I was better off without his help.

Hello, I also posted this on r/fibromyalgia. I’m currently 20 years old with no job or Heath insurance and I think I have fibromyalgia. It all started over 2 years ago when my boyfriend noticed my ribs on my left side sticking out a lot. It didn’t hurt but I was still concerned. Then within days I noticed it became difficult to breath and then the pain started. It just gradually got worse and worse until it got to the point where breathing and doing anything was extremely difficult. I decided to go to an urgent care clinic. I don’t have insurance so I was very hesitant to go but thankfully it was only $300. I was diagnosed with a lung infection and Costochondritis. They gave me medications and I noticed my rib going down and slowly the pain decreased and then went away.... for a month. Then I noticed the pain came back but differently. It started with occasional sharp pains in my ribs then it moved on to my chest, stomach, knees and hands. I go through periods of lightheadedness and breathing difficulties. Speaking of periods, the sharp, random pains throughout by body feel way worse when I’m on my period. Also, morning are the worst. It takes me like an hour everyday to be able to move. After a year of this new, different pain my mom told me to go to a hospital. I was very hesitant because I was afraid they wouldn’t believe me and I don’t have health insurance, but she said she would pay for it so I decided to go. That was a mistake. The nurse was extremely sexist and the entire thing was just miserable. He said it was just a UTI and gave me some medicine. The doctor believed it was more and was actually going to refer me to a rheumatologist but the nurse kept telling him that was unnecessary. The nurse kept insulting me so much I ended up crying on the way back home. Now I’m over $8,000 in debt and my mom won’t pay for it like she said she would. I ended up doing my own research and I stumbled upon fibromyalgia and suddenly I found something that explained exactly how I felt. I told my mom about it since she is an OR nurse and she said she thought it was that the whole time but didn’t want to tell me because she “didn’t want it to be true”. So that was over a year ago. My pain is still really bad. I can’t work because of the pain and I still don’t have health insurance. I want to go to a doctor to get a proper diagnosis and hopeful some medicine so I could live my life again but I can’t. I guess I’m just asking for some advice. I’m sorry this is so long I just wanted to explain everything. Thank you to anyone who can help.",09Jul2020,1
975,"I need advice on me (17M) and my girlfriend’s (17F) relationship

Hi, I’m in a quite toxic relationship with my girlfriend of almost a year and a half and I don’t know what to do. At first thought you might instantly think just leave her but I’d like to explain because my first thoughts are quite bias towards it all being her fault. 

I don’t really have the energy to type a long message  because we just had an intense argument but I’ll try my best. 

My girlfriend constantly says things to me that hurt my self esteem, little comments like “why don’t you just dress nicer” or “you act like an old man for f*ck sake” and she says much worse sometimes and other times not that bad but it hurts me a lot. 

She constantly calls me out on how I’m always wanting to be clean with my bedroom, how I always think everything through and just stuff about how I dress. She says it’s weird for a teenage boy to be so clean and be the way I am naturally. 

The thing about this is I never say anything to her because she has bad depression and anxiety and I’m very cautious about not hurting her feelings. But because of this I feel like I can’t say anything to her about this stuff. 

Most importantly recently she has told me basically with the p*rn she watches she’s only interested in the girls and she’s not gay or bisexual but she’s more into girls sexually which I didn’t even know what to say to because that makes me feel very insecure for some reason. Another thing she said was she liked getting our sex out the way so we could cuddle and sleep, like how the hell does she thinks that would make me feel saying “I like to get it done with so we can relax”. It’s hard enough to find time without her siblings running in and out but when she tells me that it make me very insecure because it’s hard enough to finish with our business with her siblings running around outside the door. She has also told me things I could do in the bedroom to make it better which I got worried about if I wasn’t good enough and when I do it she seems like she doesn’t enjoy it. 

I’m not sure if I’m just thinking things through to much but I’d appreciate some advice on how to talk to her and possibly how to make aspects better",09Jul2020,0
976,"Hi,

Long story short, I'm a 26 year old guy in Ireland. I have a Bachelor's degree in English with a Sociology major. I also went back to college and graduated this year with a qualification in HR Management.

I was forced to resign from my last position in January 2019 on the recommendation of 2 doctors, one of whom actually worked for the company I worked with. I've been out of work since with panic attacks and severe anxiety and depression. For context, my ma was an alcoholic with severe mental health issues so, for context, it hasn't been ruled out as genetics. 

I've had multiple job offers since, but I just couldn't seem to muster up the fuckin balls to get back in the game.

I was finally given the all-clear just before Covid hit and I'm feeling much better and I'm eager to get back to work, but all potential employers see is a big gap in my CV that's sort of difficult to explain so I just get rejected immediately.

Does anyone have any advice to help me get back on the wagon and back to work? Thank you in advance for any responses I get.",09Jul2020,1

979,My (m21) girlfriend(f20) and I have been together for about 2 and a half years and we have been in a very serious relationship. We have spent a lot of time together and recently she has made it a point she wants a little space in the past 6/7 months or so. I haven’t minded i miss seeing her all the time but whatever makes her happy. But recently I found these stories or “movie scripts” she writes in a Facebook group. I was never in the group but I joined recently and she’s not aware I’m in the group. She basically has been writing this story about herself and the life she told me she wants to live. On a farm with her horse her dog ( she even went as far to write them as the same as the one’s she has in real life) and she described herself as she is in real life. And even wrote she drives the car she always dreamt of. And in the story the only thing left out is me. It’s she lives alone. In some of the stories even this girl meets a farm guy that she falls in love with. Which is not me I’m a college student I didn’t grow up on a farm or around horses.

981,"(For the context, I am french, so some things might be specific to the country!)

I am 19, and have recently discovered new things about myself (I'm non-binary and want to start HRT, buy a binder...). Pls use they/them when referring to me.

For years, my family has been emotionally and mentally abusive and manipulative: gaslighting me, criticizing every choice I make, every thing I do, etc... Sometimes, even physically I think. 
I had to put up with this because I was still in high school, then I went to university and started trying to be more free (had my own apartment, went out, etc...). They have been paying my bills since I started university, 2 years ago. 
With the pressure and blame they always put on me (with my little sister also doing it), I have been more and more in my apartment city and less in the familial city, which they don't appreciate. In January, I have stopped university, since I realized it wasn't what I wanted to do; I plan on starting a new cursus this fall.
Since then, I've been searching for a job to pay my bills and put some money aside, unsuccessfully. That has made them mad because they refuse to ""throw money through the window"" if i ""don't do anything"" while I'm away from them. 
It is extremely mentally tiring to be here, and I am searching for financial help that I could use (for example, here you can have help paying rent, if you are a student you can have some money to pay for your studies, etc...). My mental illnesses have been weighing on me more than before, and I still have to get diagnosed for medication.
There is a problem: I am trying to get my driving license quickly, they are paying for it, so I still have to put up with everything until I pass the exam.

I have planned some things, as soon as it's done:
search for a cheaper apartment, but also a job; ask for the money I can get ; among other things... 

I am scared to cut ties definitely, because I know I will be struggling even more with my money. The main thing I'd miss, if I were to cut ties, would be the family animals, who make me feel loved, they are adorable.
I have the emotional support from my friends, but I know I'd be struggling with the emotional impact anyway. 

So, my question is: has anyone done this, and how? what were the main consequences? what did you do, and are you okay now? What would you tell me, that you wish younger you had heard?

982,"Hi everyone, I'll try to be brief. Also sorry for any mistakes, English is not my first language!

Basically I (F21) am the youngest of three sisters. My home has always been very controlled by what my father thinks about anything, so if he doesn't like something (or someone) it's going to be obvious.

My eldest sister (F29) is, admittedly, a very difficult person to deal with, but ever since she was little she has favored my dad way more than my dad, and now that she is pushing thirty she's still the same, desperate for his approval no matter what. I'll not lie, I love her but it drives me nuts how much she's willing to sacrifice for my dad to like her.

Then there's my other sister (F23). She's basically my dad's favorite. She looks a lot like my grandma (my dad's mom), and he adores her mom so he adores her. She is truly beautiful, intelligent, kind... she's not only my sister but also a friend and we have a great relationship. That's why our family situation buggers me since his preference for her mas made me resent her a little bit, which I hate because she has done nothing wrong.

And then there's me. The problem is that I am a bit like him in some ways (we're both introverts and a bit moody sometimes), but I actively try to change and make amends when I fuck up. And my dad, I have to say, is a bit of a dick. Both of my sisters have agreed in the past and even my mom is a bit fed up with him (their marriage is very toxic, but it's a complicated situation). He's a chauvinist, he's homophobic to an extent, he's racist, he thinks he can boss us around and that my mother is his maid (he still believes women should be willing and obliging to their husbands). And I have a strong character, so I can't help but snap every time he has to make a comment or treat me or my mom and sisters like shit. I just can't.

Since I am the one that stands up to him the most, it's pretty clear that he doesn't like me. Sometimes we are nice and laugh but then out of the blue, he will make a mean comment about me and leave me feeling like shit. He is also constantly pushing me to ""be better"" and ""have better self-esteem"" but as soon as I try to do so he humiliates me. I've spent years hating myself mostly because my own father mocked me for liking things or being myself.

Now, I know there is no way this is going to change. You can't talk to my dad, he doesn't want to hear anything, I think he just feels incredibly insecure and that's why he has to tear down everyone (except my middle sister, and even sometimes he has been pretty shitty to her). His personality won't change and I've made my peace with it.

The problem is that I am still at home and since I have to graduate and find a job, it may be 2 or 3 years until I can move out. And lately, I've been going through a rough patch and I feel like I can't take his humiliation anymore. I know he's just that way but it really hurts me deep inside when my own father clearly states that I am insufferable and that in no way I'll find a man who will want to put up with me (he literally just told me that). How can I cope with a dad that doesn't like me? Is there a way for me to try and look at this from a different perspective? If you've gone through a similar situation, does it get to a point where you just don't care about his dislike for you anymore?

TL;DR: Dad doesn't like me and is constantly comparing me to my sister and humiliating me. How can I cope with the years that I've got living with him?",09Jul2020,1
983,"I’ll try to make this short,

Basically I spent nearly 1 year with a guy, we weren’t dating but we weren’t not dating of that makes sense, I helped him through a lot of rough times ( jail bail, rent, mental health, career )
One day we got into a huge argument ( which was normal but we were never apart for more than a week - but the pandemic happened so we ended up not seeing each other for 4 months )

Last weekend, we arranged to go to a festival ( my country has barely any cases of the virus ), but my sister bailed , and it became very expensive for us to afford to pay for 3 places whilst only two of us would go ( reservation stuff - not important). So I was like, why don’t we just road trip the two of us to a far away city and go to a party on the maintains, so he agreed. We had the most amazing 3 days of our lives.

Anyway, I found out he moved in with his girlfriend ( yes apparently he has a gf?!). But my problem is not that because, honestly our relationship was the weirdest thing on planet earth. 

Ps. When I picked him up , he randomly blurted out that he a room mate and the person was super weird and nerdy etc , and that they barely get along. ( at first I thought nothing ) but then I realized something’s up so I asked a friend which confirmed the “ living with gf bit “. 

So I got truly upset because I honestly thought we were close friends , but he just made a whole lie up for no reason.. 
can someone give me some time of explanation or theory? 
Also what should I do about this? 
Lastly, I know I’m a fool, but I’m honestly really confused as for I’ve been in therapy for my mental state - and I’m not sure what’s right from wrong

I will try to be as clear or precise as possible, so the more detailed the problem, the better chance I have of getting help.

*Note: I don't know if this is the right or perfect subreddit for this post, I apologize for that. If you think my publication belongs elsewhere, please let me know and I will make the change.*

I really don't have any hope that anyone can help me, but I need to hold on to something, at least for a moment.

**What's the problem?**

I need to get a place at the (public) university, but I lack the resources or the intelligence to do so.

I have taken the university entrance exam twice before, and both times the results have been insufficient/unsatisfactory.

On both occasions I prepared on my own, that is: without any friends to teach me what they know, without having any private teacher, without attending any extra classes; and with my own resources, that is: my knowledge of the school (useless), a few books (useless), all the information I could find on the internet (which is very little) and hours and hours of study (which apparently do not serve).

I can't do it alone. I'm not smart enough/ I don't have enough knowledge, at least as far as the system is concerned.

My parents don't care, nor will they help me.

\-First chance: The exam has been around for at least 5 years, 3 of which I was in high school (decisive period). Knowing this, they have never tried to find out what the exam is about, much less save up to pay for a (necessary) course.

\-Second chance: I graduated from school a year ago, by now I should be in university. My score was not enough. From the moment I was notified that I didn't get a place, the beginning of a savings had to be established, so that I could be ready at this time. They didn't do that either.

**Do I have more people to turn to?**

No, not that I know of. I don't count on my parents, who are supposed to be my first choice. I don't have any friends to help me or teach me or tutor me. I have no idea if I could make a loan or who I could ask.

**Are you in school? Doesn't school train you to take the exam?**

I also don't have the (very basic) support or advice from the college, because I have already finished high school.

**How much do the classes/course cost?**

I'm not sure, but I do know that it goes from 500 dollars to 1000 or more.

**Do you necessarily have access to a course or classes?**

Yes, it's strictly necessary. Of my former classmates with no extra training, they all scored low/unsatisfactory and are not in university. Of those who did manage to get a place, either had access to private training or went directly to non-fiscal universities (paid, no requirement to take an entrance exam).

Here's the thing: I can do it, I think I can do it, but there's no way I'm going to do it alone, without help.

**Can you get a job to get money to pay for your course/classes?**

I have been looking for a job since 2018, with the intensity of the search increasing in 2019. Nothing has worked. Nor is it a logical or reasonably viable option, even for small or informal jobs; I am too young, with no formal education and no experience in any field. Add to that that the COVID-19 pandemic has completely wiped out any chance of getting a job.

If there is another way to get the money, I don't know it, or I am too stupid to realize it. I'm desperate and I swear I don't know what to do.

**Is paid university or scholarship an option?**

No, as I said, my grades were only good, not excellent (minimum requirement for a scholarship). Besides that, it is very common (at least here) that universities ""give"" a HALF scholarship, which actually serves to trap students in their universities so that, once the scholarship is over, you are forced to stay even if you can't on the basis of endless and unpayable debts.

My family is poor, my parents are stupid and don't plan their lives, and they've been out of work for months. Apart from the extraordinary situation, none of them have a formal job with monthly pay, nor do they have a university education. The only reason I have Internet is because of the state of exception, but when it' s over we will be up to our necks in debt.

*Please, please, please*

I don't need anything else in my life. Since I finished school my life is a DOUBLE hell, my mental illness has gotten worse and I currently think about suicide every day (note that this is not the subject of the publication, it is a powerful reason that is related to my problem). My life is absolutely meaningless and worthless. I have no friends. I can't and don't WANT to live another day like this. I NEED to get into university. I only need ONE thing, ONE chance, from that one thing everything will come and grow. I swear every day that I won't waste it, for my life I won't, but I can't do it alone.

**When do you have to take the test?**

During the last week of August this year.

**Where do you live?**

I don't live in the United States or Europe, so advice clearly related to situations or events in those places is not useful.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't know what else to say (please ask a question if necessary). I think I'm hopeless. I hammer my head in thinking of a solution, but I can't see any. Maybe someone here knows what to do. :-(

992,"**This might be quite long, sorry for that -** **TL;DR at the end**. So I'm not straight (biromantic and demisexual if that's relevant), and my parents are aware of this. I have a great relationship with my mum and she has been really kind and supportive of me coming out. I took this to mean that she supported the whole LGBT+ community, but I don't think that's the case. It is definitely not the case with my dad, who I love but do not really get along with at all. He's hugely racist, xenophobic, transphobic and homophobic. His approach to me coming out was to not speak to me for two days and then pretend like nothing at all happened. I just went along with it because I was so hurt and just wanted it to be okay again.

Recently, a lot of very prominent authors have written an open letter concerning ""cancel culture"" and freedom of speech after JK Rowling made several transphobic tweets. There was a huge backlash on twitter and then the open letter was published as a sort of comeback to advocate for freedom of speech. For the record, I have no problem with that, everyone's entitled to their opinions and I do think cancel culture can be a problem. However, I do feel like she's acting like she didn't think there would be any consequences for her actions. If you're a bigot, you'll get treated like one - and rightly so.

My parents agree with JK Rowling. My dad because he does believe in free speech (but also because he hates transgender people and believes they're mentally ill) and my mum for the same reason, but mostly because she likes JK Rowling a lot and says that she's not a bigot. She won't hear a bad word said against her.

Both my parents have been bringing up the bathroom thing, and how they think that transgender people could be dangerous and preying on people. I countered them, saying that they can't make arguments like that with no evidence/figures to support them and that they're wrong, ignorant and transphobic. It caused a massive shouting match that has resurfaced every few hours over the past two days. 

My dad and I aren't speaking, and my mum has tried to make things better. She has tried to talk to me and admitted that she doesn't really know what trans people even are and that she's confused. I'd understand and try and explain to her if that was the truth - she's fully aware. I told her to talk to me once she's informed, and that I'd have time for her once she could prove that transgender people are dangerous (and that JK Rowling isn't a bigot) with facts and evidence. 

I told her that she can't accept me and not accept everyone in the LGBT+ community. She said she'd always love and accept me and I told her that she can't pick and choose who she supports. She left. I confronted my dad again and reminded him I'm not straight which led to him scoffing at me in disgust. I feel like both my parents don't love me and think I'm gross and disgusting.

We've been sniping at each other about other things because we're all still angry at it. My parents are livid and say that I'm treating them awfully and disrespectfully. My mum says she doesn't even know me anymore, and she's livid that both of my brothers support me and are upset at both her and my dad.

**TL;DR:** my parents support JK Rowling's transphobic tweets and not the transgender/LGBT+ community (which I am part of). We have argued and our relationship is the worst it's been in years.

How do I get them to accept me and the transgender community? How do I get them to be more tolerant? How do I fix things? Any help would be appreciated. I'm in a dark place right now and will be leaving to stay at my aunt's house with one of my brothers tomorrow. Thank you for reading.",09Jul2020,1

For background we’ve been dating for almost 2 years now but me and her have kind of felt the love fall away and now it’s just meaningless talk that we have. I just don’t know what to do or how to peacefully break up. I’ve never done it before,09Jul2020,1
996,"our last cat of 3, he was 18, died about a month ago. I really want another cat. I loved teddy so so much but I've accepted his death very quickly, and so have my parents. I REALLY want another cat, l love having animals around they make me so happy and give me so much emotional support. I don't think my parents get how much I need an animal to calm me and reduce anxiety. 

I'm only here for 2 more years before I'm off to uni and I want to enjoy my time here, I love having a pet during uni and after I won't have any pets because you can't keep them in your accomodation and then after if probably travel. I NEEEDDDDDD A CATTTTTT.

they say we can't get another one because they don't want to have to deal with another death and losing a cat eventually and all the vet expenses... :( 

help how do I convince them thank you!!",09Jul2020,1
998,"My dad is overweight and diagnosed type 2 diabetic. He has been overweight my whole life but recently with covid and being trapped inside I’ve seen its gotten worse. He’s barely getting any exercise and always mindlessly eating out of stress (he’s a big time stress eater) and I guess boredom. All the activities that get him on his feet like traveling, going to concerts and social activities that he loves to do are now obviously not an option. So his days are all spent sitting on the couch working on his laptop during the day and then watching Netflix on his laptop at night. 

I see him breathing super heavy or having trouble getting off the couch and it scares me. He’s in his mid 50s and I know he’s approaching the age where issues relating to his weight can start to really have devastating consequences.

However he’s a old school came from nothing kind of guy with way too much pride for his own good. He is super stubborn and doesn’t take criticism of any kind well at all, to say the least. Because we care about him we’ve tried to have little interventions for him about his anxiety and temper and also about his health. But they never go well. He always gets upset and stressed out and it never leads to any kind of breakthrough, he just sees it as an attack on him as person and goes deeper into his unhealthy habits. 

How do I get him to make a change in his lifestyle to start losing weight? How do I approach him it in a way that resonates but that he doesn’t take as a judgement of his character as a person? He’s a super smart man in other ways, he has a PhD from Harvard that he got on a full scholarship and is acclaimed in his field, having taught at places like Oxford and Princeton. But  for some reason he’s so frustratingly stubborn about denying or not dealing with any problem relating to himself and issues he has, even if he’s knows they are unhealthy. He’s brilliant at analyzing the world around him but it baffles my mind how he seems fully incapable to look at himself and his issues critically and objectively.",09Jul2020,1
999,"Helle People of reddit, first off, english is not my first language. I am pretty new to reddit respectively I just looked at the content without having an account. So this is a very long and complicated story that requires alot of background information and Im not very sure this is the right thread. I already tried the find the thread directory, but am still unsure.

 I‘m gonna try to cut this short. Featured characters: Me 25F/ BF 27M / Ex 31M / deceased ex boyfriend / deceased friend

About 5 years ago I left a kind of toxic relationship with my now deceased ex boyfriend, I got closer with a long term friend of mine who lived a few hundred miles away. Months later we were falling for each other, planming to meet and talk about it. Before any of it happens he dies in a motorcycle crash. After this everything was kind of hard for me, I had lost members of my family before, but back then I was a kid. That was the first death of a close friend that I really had to deal with. More months pass, I start to just date people, when me and my ex went from friends and colleagues to friends with benefits.

He was having an open relationship at that time, in which he was sort of unhappy. He told me his gf would know about everything and that it was okay to her. I knew her and I liked her, met at a few parties back then. Weeks into the fwb thing I find out he lied to both of us. I dont clearly remember in which order things went on then, I tried to end the thing, he instesd broke up with his gf and told me everything was fine now. Again, months later he tells me wants a serious relationship. I tell him I think that I‘m not ready for that, that we should go back to just being friends and sort things out. He manipulates me over weeks how I would loose him as a friend, he could never work with me again and that kind of stuff.

Something about 3,5yrs from now I agree, I try to commit to the relationship, we move in together, get a dog we both wanted for years and another 6 months pass. I then realize that I am very unhsppy with the overall situation, the relationship itself and I do not want to live with him anymore. Everything got complicated after a few weeks of little talking and body contact we talk about it. Dog got diagnosed with terminal sickness at that time, I was in professional training back then, not getting paid very much. So we decide to sort things out once the dog passed and I try to find a place to live or even stay until end of my training.

2 Months later the dog had passed, I had been sleeping on the sofa mostly, we had agreed on breaking up but didnt really know how to part ways now. A good friend of ours broke up with his gf at that time and moved in with us, which got me back to sleeping in the bedroom. This friend is my now boyfriend. Yes kinda predictable, even more taking in consideration that I had been crushing on him years back (about 7 years from now). So my ex knows that and tells me, no matter what I cant or shouldnt fall for the friend, he couldnt take it. A few weeks pass and my bf and I start to get closer, we are spending much time together and decide to tell my ex. To cool the situation down I leave the appartment and move in with my bestfriend and her husband.

Things went kind of crazy, my ex freaking out that we cant do this to him, a few days of arguing and everything when the situations cools down. I think about a week after we told him that we were planning to try and date each other, my ex starts to meet someone new(his new gf til now). I had moved out completely, my bf staying at my new place most of the time. I ended the training, switched workplaces, everyhting fine until, I think about a year ago.

My ex and I had messaged each other occasionally, small talk and that kind of stuff. Then he suddenly stop replying. I didnt think much of it until in march I find out by coincidence that he had blocked me, deleted me on social media etc. Same thing with my bf. I was planning to switch back to the old workplace, which I did in June. My boyfriend works at the same place, got “promoted“ in March and now is sort of the supervisor for me and my ex.

After my ex and I met several times at work I realized that something changed, my bf told me a few days ago that my ex is now going nuts at work, telling everyone how big of an asshole me and my bf are and tries to set up the people at work against us.

I really dont know what to do about this situation. My bf already thought about just quitting and finding a new workplace. Talking to my ex is not really an option, as he would just deny everything or freak out about destroying his life.",09Jul2020,1
1000,"I am in an absuive family live in the third world, the worst of the worst. It's an absolute hell and beyond anything you could possibly imagine. The things I've faced, the things I've dealt with...I can't even put into words. I had an opportunity to make it out 6 years ago. It was a golden fucking opportunity. I literally had everything sorted, I just had to work out a couple minor things. If I had literally just sat down for 10 minutes and thought about those things and worked out the details, I'd be chilling in NYC or something right now.

...but I didn't. I didn't take 10 fucking minutes because I was so fucking stupid and lazy. Yes I know making it out of here won't solve all my problems, but it'll be an unbelievable help. Well the good news is I now have another similar opportunity coming up and I could make it out this time too. But I just can't bring myself to work on it. This one is like a billion times harder and I am actually gonna have to bust my ass off for it.

So whenever I try to sit down and work at it, I just get bombarded with massive amounts of regret and rage. Because I had the perfect shot so long ago when I didn't even have to do all this bullshit and I just let that go. I worked out the exact amount of time it cost me and it comes out to 2,221 days.

I wasted 2,221 days of my life because I couldn't tear myself away from reddit and my tv shows for 10 fucking minutes. I had to spend 2,221 more days in unbearable heat, pollution, filth, evil, corruption, overpopulation, fear for my life everyday, and a thousand other things. Because I couldn't take out 10 motherfucking minutes.

I know, I know...tell me what a little bitch I sound like. Well, that's what I fucking am. I'm a worthless loser. loser. My parents fucked me up so bad that that's what I've always been. It's not my fault. They destroyed my life. And, well, since then I've been doing a pretty good job of doing what they taught me and continuing to destroy it even more. I honestly don't even deserve to live. I am so fucking beyond idiotic. I wish I'd never been born to begin with. Or at least I wish I was born with a silver spoon so I didn't have to work my face off just to get barely 1% of the stuff that other people are just born with. How is it fair? It's not fucking fair. It just isn't. Why should I play the game if it's so fucking rigged?

How do I even function anymore? What the fuck is the point of living? That's 2,221 days gone. I'll never get them back. Ever. No matter what I do. They're gone forever. I'm that much older, weaker, and closer to my grave. And my situation is just as bad, if not worse. My life is in absolute ruins, I'm nothing but a quivering pile of regret, envy and rage, and now somehow I'm supposed to put my head down and grind for an eternity just to get an opportunity that I was getting practically for free 2,221 days ago? How do I do it? What's even the point anymore?",09Jul2020,1
1001,"My situation:  I've been furloughed from my regular job (in the travel industry) since early April.  Initially the furlough was intended to last only 60 to 90 days, but as Covid-19 got worse, it was extended to early October.  6 months total.

Important notes:  there is a possibility I might be called back earlier than October, based on business need.  On the other end of the scale, I might get to October and discover my employer doesn't have a place for me at that time.

I predict I have about a three-quarters chance of being called back to work at some point.  I work HQ level for a major hotel company.  My job is really specialized, and centralized, and I have a couple of specialties that will be relatively hard to replace from scratch once business picks up.  My team was also cut in half due to a reorganization last year, and all of our contractor-level coworkers have already been terminated due to Covid.  Only us direct employees are left in the hopper.

Here's the dilemma:  I found out from my state unemployment office this week that in order to keep my unemployment benefits going, I have to start an official job search starting next week.  If I'm offered any interviews, my personal ethics tell me that I'd have to disclose my current furlough status to the interviewers, that there's better than even chances that I'll have to quit their job within a couple of months and go back to my regular job.  Hiding that information would feel dishonest and unethical to me.  But, if I were in the interviewer's shoes, there's a good chance I wouldn't hire somebody in my situation, who isn't guaranteed to stay on.

My question is:  what's the best way to frame my situation for a potential job interviewer, to let them know that I do take them seriously as an employer but they come second place to my ""regular"" job?",09Jul2020,1
1002,"So I’m turning 16 in Sep4 (yay) and well,it’s a big deal. I’ve been waiting for my sweet 16 for years now and obviously the quarantine thing already ruined my graduation but I’m not giving up on my birthday. Thing is,no one seems to care much? They know how much it means to me but they don’t seem to put much effort. My last two bdays we just ate food at the same restaurant (no gifts) so I wanted smth special. I would like fancy gifts but at this point I just want to feel like they care. I had to work hard to even get them to start planning early,and they still half assed a plan (when I gave them some ideas too) at this point I’m not sure if it’s the gifts that I’m sad about but the lack of love and attention. The fact that they only thought of gifts because I had to convince them makes it disheartening. I wanted it to be a special day but I’m not sure what to do,they won’t listen if I say that I feel uncared for and they’ll think I just want fancy gifts when I just want some actual thought and love behind them.

1003,"There are many shoe sprays like reshoevn8r, Jason Markk, Kiwi, and Crep. These sprays all protect against water and stains. Then there are generic sprays that aren't aim towards shoes but can be used on shoes like Neverwet, 3M Scotchgard fabric, and 303 fabric guard. Which also prevent stains and water. Is there a reason why I should get a shoe spray over a generic spray not aimed towards shoes? What are the differences between all these products? I'm asking because when I walk out on the street and it's a sunny day, dust, soil, and dirt from the ground will get picked up and it will look very dirty on the side of the soles or in the heel part of the sole.

1004,"Hi I(F26) am apartment hunting. Ive been living with my partner and now its time for me to find my own place. A little backstory my mom and I were renting a unit together. When my partner and i got together we decided to get our own place. My name was still on my moms lease. After I moved out she had a hard time paying the rent on time which caused an eviction to start. Her terrible boyfriend at the time stole her mail which caused her to not know when her court date was. My mail was still going there at the time so i hadn’t received anything either. Since we missed the court date and we couldn’t prove anyone had taken our mail despite having a broken mailbox I now have an eviction on my record. 

Moving forward how do I rent an apartment with an eviction. Ive always known that evictions are what makes it so hard for people to rent. I have an okay credit score it needs work for sure but i pay all of my bills on time i have a few collections from when i was a kid that Im trying to pay off and some college debt.

I’m a guy in my mid-20s, and about 8 months ago I told a friend that I wanted to move to the city where I’ve previously spent some time, and we decided we would become roommates. Our search was a bit difficult and eventually we decided it may help if we found a third roommate which we did. Fast forward a few months and we’ve found a few places of interest. However, one roommate has pretty terrible credit which I’ve found out fairly recently, (and seemingly poor finances) and the other is permanently unemployed as of today due to coronavirus... I’m really not sure what to do at this point. I care about both of them, but to move across the country and potentially be saddled with more than I am signing up for is really stressing me out. I make enough money thankfully and can work remotely and I have great credit, but I just don’t want to repeat previous financial mistakes I’ve since recovered from. What should I do?

So my mum was tired and decided to lay her problems on to me. Except I have zero social skills so i resort to the internet for help

My mum went to uni for marketing and got a job in marketing then worked there for 5 years (i think) 

I wont go into detail but a lot of things happened in that job (she divorced my dad).   She a year or so later got a boyfriend lets call him Chris...

Now chris was extremely passive aggressive to me when she was around and straight up aggressive when she wasnt.
But hey my mum loved him so i made do.

In late 2019 they decided to have a baby fast forward a bit and my mum gets maternity leave.

Quarantine starts...

My mother is already knows she is going to be made redundant she was thinking of resigning anyway so it didnt matter)

Fast forward a bit more and she is made redundant then the baby is born and she gets a job job again this time its a cleaning job with minimum wage around £5/hour.

About a month later she tells me that she's lost all self confidence and she thinks that no one believes in her. She also believes she wasted her time in uni 

This us mainly because 1. She worked in an office and now does minimum wage cleaning.    2. There was almost a year gap between the two jobs.

I suggested online therapy but she just shrugged it off.

1010,"So basically, I'm an idiot. The person is completely anonymous and I'm assuming does this type of thing to make money through extortion and blackmail. Last night this person added me on snap and it didn't look too suspicious. Things already went a bit too far before I picked up on how sus everything really was. When i backed out and blocked this person they added me on a different account which i ignored and then several different accounts. 

They then found my instagram (which was public at first) and sent me a dm of the picture and told me to add them back on snapchat and ""apologize"". I immediately blocked that account and went private, then changed my user name, bio and profile picture to prevent them from finding my profile again on a new account (which was succesful). They then added me with maybe 10 more snapchat accounts with names like ""do you want this to stop?"" and ""say sorry"". The first thing I did was contact my closest friends and told them everything. I added back one of these accounts and they told me they were going to send the pictures to my friends if i didn't follow their instruction and then mentioned some of my friends instagram names and snapchat names. 

They only ever contacted 6 of them, all whom im very close with and were people who were tagged in my instagram posts. Had i not blocked them so fast and changed everything on instagram i feel it would have been worse but I lucked out there. I talked to everyone who was messaged by this person. Only one friend replied before i got to them and this friend was spammed with i would say maybe 30-40 friend requests on snapchat and I was aswell. After an hour and a half of this happening relentlessly it stopped and I hopped it was over and went to bed. But about 30 minutes ago I got another add on snapchat and as im typing this got another from who is clearly the same person. I don't think they are cappable of really contacting anyone else that I know because of the fact they are just spamming me and some friends with friend requests and ignoring them but it worries me. I thought they may have just moved onto their next target but maybe not? 

I'm still kind of worried about this and don't know what to do. I might make a new snapchat account but what bothers me the most is that someone has this picture and I don't know what they are capable of.",09Jul2020,1

Not really sure if this is the right place for this post, but I could really use some advice. Also sorry if there are any grammatical mistakes, English is not my first language.

My friend is going through a hard time right now. She recently gotten an abortion and the procedure made her past traumas resurface. On-top of that all she broke up with her boyfriend, whom she cares for but wasn't giving her the support she needed. This would be overwhelming to anyone, but I fear her depression and anxiety are making it even harder. My friend is very strong, proud, and caring. She will go the extra mile to help anyone, but she really struggles with reaching out.

It seems she's isolating herself; barely sleeping, eating, or socializing. I've been trying to reach out to her, hangouts were cancelled, calls postponed. Even my offers to drop off food were appreciated but not accepted. We text everyday, but I feel like it's not enough. She told me that in the past, when her depression got really bad, her friends barged into her place and cleaned and cooked for her. I am thinking of doing that with my partner (who is also her friend) to show her she's not alone, but I don't know if she'll be comfortable with that; or even if I am comfortable with that approach. I've always let people come to me when they are ready. It feels wrong to come forcibly and unannounced, especially after she told me she's ashamed with how dirty it is. I don't care about that, I just want to be there for her. But do I take the risk with barging in, or do I continued with long distance support? Any advice?",09Jul2020,1

Earlier this year (March-ish?), my family was in the process of planning a vacation, which fell through due to the pandemic. At the time, I asked my partner if he would like to come with us and he said yes. This would be the first time we would be going out of town together. Fast forward a few months, and we've booked a place to stay and everything. At the time the place we're going wasn't on our state's travel ban ""shit list"", where if you go you have to self-quarantine for 2 weeks. (I'm not sure what it's called, but I call it the shit list). I get a text a few days ago saying that if our vacation place isn't off the shit list, he'd have to quarantine for 14 days unpaid, which I realize is awful for him. However, this is the first time in my entire life that I've been truly excited to go out of town. Since I found out, I've been in a really awful mood, and I've been super short with the people I live with, along with holing up in my room like a hermit and resorting to old, unhealthy coping mechanisms. I feel like I'm being a raging cunt and overreacting because of something completely out of everyone's control, and it sucks.

1023,"I (30M, the Netherlands) live in a terraced house with neighbours on both sides. This is pretty common way of living here in Holland. Even though the houses were built just over 4 years ago, they're still pretty noisy at times. I hardly ever hear my neighbours talk (and both of them are loud) but you do hear slamming doors, subwoofer low basses and the occasional washer/dryer running at night. It's not so much the actual sound they make that bothers me, which is extremely little. But it's the low frequency that comes with it.

I've always been annoyed by the sounds that come from my neighbours, so I'm afraid that now I'm too focused on it; I hear low frequency sounds ALL THE TIME. It used to be just from the neighbours. But now I'm even starting to notice my own household appliances making those sounds. Whenever my fridge starts the cooling process, it carries to low bass sound via the wall all the way to the couch which is several meters away. We had an AC built in our bedroom, but the low frequency humming that comes from the outside unit keeps me up at night.

I'm starting to feel like I'm going nuts. My partner is extremely annoyed with me because of this. I just can't seem to focus on anything else. I complain about the noises all the time and it just makes me cranky.

Is there any way I can try to work on not focusing on these low frequency noises? I realize it might sound dumb but it's starting to become a major issue for me. I'm genuinely asking for help here.

Tl;dr: I've become prone to low frequency sounds in the last few months. I hear basically everything humming and it's driving me insane. Any advice on how to deal with this?",09Jul2020,1
1024,"TLDR: Ex-BFF wanted to talk about our friendship ending, I was very uneasy but went through with it. It went well, and now I don’t know if I want to go back to friends or move on with my life.

Long story short, my ex-best friend and I had on-and-off feelings for almost 3 years up until December. Basically she liked me but wasn’t sure about whether she could have a relationship ship with me. She later said that she was in love with me and another guy and didn’t know how to choose. I ended up asking for time away from her and she blew up on me. I ended up blocking her and hadn’t talked to her since 3 days ago.


3 days ago I get a message from her asking to meet up and talk and maybe repair our friendship after some small talk. I had just come into town to see family (bad idea I know but I was forced to come) and I was incredibly worried, but decided I needed some sort of closure at least, and a part of me wasn’t against being friends again. 

I end up going to her house to talk. I know that sounds dumb, but for precaution I put my phone on record before I knocked on the door and we basically just talked about what happened. She admitted that she was incredibly selfish for not thinking about my feelings. She was sorry for being so childish and that she had done a lot of growing after the other guy dumped her. I admitted that I held a lot of resentment towards her, and that I don’t know if we could ever be back to best friends. In the end, we ended up having a positive talk. It helped a lot. 

Now I don’t know what I want to do. Close the chapter of my life and move on or try to be friends again. She was my rock for a long time and she seems a lot more mature, but still the friend I knew. I’m confused about what I want, what do you all think?",09Jul2020,1

1027,"Edit: I'm a 24 y/o girl

I love video production and there have been many times where it was the only thing keeping me alive. I would put up with a lot of bullshit if it meant I could keep producing videos. I work for a company as their Video Editor/ Motion Graphics Designer but I do far more than just edit. I concept, story board, script, plan, conduct interviews, do b-roll shoots, set up lighting, audio, all other equipment. I do all the editing, color correction, audio sweetening, cuts, graphics, VFX, all of it. I very rarely have somebody helping. As you can see, far more than just an editor. 

I also tend to come to work late or take afternoons off as it is simply too much work for me. I do my absolute best but there are times where I am so exhausted I can't even drive.

For the last two years I have asked for a promotion and raise as I do the job as a producer for the company. Last year the excuse was I can't be Video Producer because that's a senior level title and I had only worked there for a year. This year the excuse was no one was really getting a promotion because of covid. But today I found out one of my coworkers got a promotion and a raise that she didn't even ask for. (Which she totally deserves btw)

This makes me realize that it absolutely doesn't matter how much work I do or how good I am at doing it, if I'm not sitting in my office from 8-5 I will not get a raise. 

I feel taken advantage of. I bust my ass to pull off documentary style videos that are over 20 minutes in only 3 months. I am 1 person. I'm so very aware that being late to work and taking time off suddenly is a flaw,  I'm not ignoring this. But truthfully this is one of my only flaws in this position so I really believe that I deserve a raise. 

And the company loves my work. I'm often told that I'm great at my job, that it's ""hard to find bad things to say"" about me and my work, that I'm talented, etc.

I'm conflicted because I like the people I work with, they're good friends to me. If I leave I know it would put a heavy burden on the rest of the creative team as we have just such a small team. But I feel like I can't get ahead at this job. I'm never gonna hit this mark of success in their eyes because I'm seriously not an office  9-5 kind of person. 


I don't even know what kind of advice I'm looking for. Would you feel taken advantage of in this situation? Would you try to explain your position to your boss? Would you just leave?

What can I say to my boss to try to make him see where I'm coming from?",09Jul2020,1
1028,"First of all; i am kind of depressed with suicidal thoughts but i am hiding it from everyone except the ones i trust

I met this girl through a good friend of mine. We started talking through Snapchat for some weeks. Conversations go deeper and deeper and i start to feel a special connection to her. I have experienced more depressing moments of my life than most others, and when i was ready to tell her some of the things in my life i havent told anyone else, she actually listened. She didnt pull back and she had my back, and when she was sad, i had her back. I am 17 years old and this girl wasnt just someone i liked, i was in love.

Still making progress. We start facetiming everyday for many hours. We laugh together, talk about that friend of mine and kind of making fun of him (friendly), and i think we’re both enjoying our time together

About two months after i got to know her, we finally met. ( she lives and hour away)I was at the mall with friends of mine and she happend to be there at the same time as me. We just hanged out together; me, my friends and her. It was a little awquard of course since it was the first time but overall i think it was a good first time meeting

Now she is everything to me. She is life and death for me and i dont really feel that depressed anymore. 

After facetime calls and a couple of more meetings i finally thought it was time to confess my feelings for her. I dm’d her in Snapchat and confessed my feelings for her. She told me she liked me back, but wasnt interested in a relationship right now. She said she always questioned herself in a relationship. «Am i good enough?» And she wasnt ready for that so she said that we could be friends.

That literally broke my heart, even though it wasnt a clear no from her. It felt like she was the only person i reached my hand to, but she didnt want to hold it. I started to feel depressed again.

Then i did something stupid, i told her needed time for myself so i cut off all contact with her for about a week. Every day in that week was like hell for me and the thought of ending my life game across my mind, not just because of her, but because of all the pain i have experienced. Picture a glass of water almost full of water, she was the drop that made the water overfill the glass and make the water overfload from the glass.

I took contact to her with some dry snaps and now we are talking again. Not as much as we used to do. We only facetimed once. No deep conversations.

But i still love her. Shes suicidal for me and i dont know if im gonna let her go or not. I dont want to constantly like her when she looks at me as a friend. That can hurt me

What do i do? How do i her as my GF?

1031,"okay, im an 18F 

like most 15 year olds I was excited to get my permit and get my license so I could finally drive the car that my stepdad offered to give me the moment I turned sixteen. soon 15 turned to 16 and 16 turned to 17 when my grandparents (who i live with) refused to take me to the dmv. finally i got to go to dmv a bit after my 17th birthday and passed the permit test with flying colors. 

months go but and it is required that I take driving lessons with an instructor before getting behind the wheel with anyone else. 10 months go by and after begging for it, my mother buys me a single driving lesson as my Christmas gift. I had a great first lesson with an amazing instructor who really gave my the confidence I needed to drive after the hopelessness I felt for months. When the lesson was over my grandparents were no where to be found and I was really embarrassed when my instructor said to me “Well... usually parents want to know how things went.” 

After my first lesson, I needed a couple hours of practice before the next lesson and that was 5 months ago and everyone refuses to help me practice. Now the car I was going to get from my stepdad has been given to my older brother (without my knowing) and when I bring up how I thought it was mine my grandmother makes me feel guilty. She even tells everyone that I don’t want to drive and have no motivation to learn. 

Now it’s starting to effect other aspects of my life because I need to get a job to support myself through college and I would like to open up a bank account but foolishly chose to receive my identification card to be included with my license when I finally passed my test but that never happened and probably never will. 

I don’t know what to do, I feel hopeless and like I’ll never be able to drive or even do any adult tasks. Any advice on how to deal with all this would be appreciated :)",09Jul2020,1

1034,"So I made a new friend a little over 2 months ago, and its clear that this person has struggled socially their whole life (this they’ve told me). They kind of have a very conservative verbally abusive family so I doubt their family has even thought of their health in this way. They have been rejected by people in the past in the name of them being “weird.” It is unclear to me if this person has many friends as well, there are only two people I have ever heard them talk about, one of who is an elderly ish man, and another who is a mutual friend from class. Now when they mention this mutual friend (which they do a lot) it appears as if they and the mutual friend are very close friends, but one time I had a question about the person of interest that only a close friend would know and then the mutual friend let me know that they were only sorta friends. On another occasion I asked who their favorite person in the world was and they told me the name of someone famous that they really admire instead of a person they knew and while they were explaining to me why they picked that person they were tearing up. So these things are what has led me to consider that this person has not only struggled to make friends but may not have very many friends at all ( I could very well be wrong.) 

The part that really layers on to this that makes me think they might be undiagnosed is, this person seems to generally struggle with the concept of appropriateness. In every social situation I’ve been ( and i mean every single one) in with this person, this person either doesn’t talk or kinda unintentionally offends or makes another person uncomfortable. When I met them, they were pretty non-verbal, they never talked in class or in our class group, and when I started hanging out with the person one on one I initially did most of the talking. So now when this person did now start talking, I noticed they slurred their words, just enough for me not to be able to understand them without focusing. This person goes in an out of enunciation and this person pauses very frequently in between sentences at very unusual places to think about the next part of their sentence. This person is also extremely unreceptive to non-verbal cues and facial expression. This person has made all of the friends that I’ve introduced them to visibly uncomfortable at some point by doing or saying something “social unacceptable” and never realizes until I let them know. Then their like *bonk* that makes sense I should’ve thought of that. They are very starkly untidy as well and see no issue with it. I would describe this person as very very sweet and very child like.

This person is very intelligent and successful in my opinion so people might not consider that they maybe on the spectrum but the things I have seen have me wondering if this person may or may not be on the spectrum. I don’t want it to be that this very precious person spends their whole life not knowing something pretty important that can affect a lot of things. 

What do you guys think, and what do I do? I know I’m not a doctor but I really care about this person.

Also this person is in their 20’s if that matters.",09Jul2020,2
1035,"I have had it. I'm 21 years old and I work in a recreation facility under my cities municipal government.

But now, I am stationed at a desk for 8 hours a day. I don't move, unless it's to wipe doorknobs clean. I am on the night shift until 10pm which makes it even worse. All I do is greet people and direct them to different areas of our facility and answer questions.

1038,"so I started dating a guy about 5 months ago, I'm his first ever girlfriend and we were good friends for a while before dating. 

I've never been all that comfortable with physical intimacy so it takes a while for me to get to certain stages of a relationship, but he clearly wanted to move things real fast. He asked over and over again to do things like hold hands, kiss, etc. I really wasn't comfortable quite yet especially in public spaces (I hate PDA) so I refused for a while, but he wore me down and eventually one thing led to another and sex happened. I regretted things immediately and basically put a hold on all things physically intimate for two months, which he seemed understanding about. 

But after the two months, he confronted me and basically said he was tired of ""taking the L"". I was once again uncomfortable and said as much, but he basically guilt tripped me into agreeing to a compromise that I didn't want by telling me he would ""do anything for me"" (so I felt bad about not doing what I guess seems like a ""small thing"" in the grand scheme of things for him). After a couple days with said compromise, however, he came to the conclusion that if I didn't want the intimacy then he couldn't enjoy it either and so we're back to absolutely nothing physically intimate, just talking/playing games/watching shows together. 

I don't know what to do here. I still care about him and enjoy spending non-physically intimate time with him, but I feel like this is just a ticking time bomb of a relationship. I know he will eventually get tired of this situation and will ask things of me, but because of what happened before I don't know that I can ever be comfortable being physically intimate with him again.

1040,"My friend/penpal has been worrying me a lot lately. Just a little background, we are both 27 year old gay males corresponsing from far apart—Miles lives in southeast Asia while I’m in the US. We met about a year ago on a dating site, and although we didn’t quite have the right chemistry for things to work out romantically between us, we still managed to talk every day since then. The first signs of trouble started a while back, but there have been developments in the last month that are really starting to suggest something really concerning. 

Just some background, he and I are both filmmakers. His own films include a touching short he made about online friendship in which he played a character that has an intense correspondence with someone named Skylar despite never meeting in person; I told Miles that perhaps he and I would be able to meet one of these days. Towards the beginning of our correspondence, we would video call Skype a few times a week and use the chat function every day. There was a brief period where Miles set his Skype to Do Not Disturb, which hides when the person was last online and blocks all incoming calls and messages. However, he left me a message directing me to another chat platform that we used for a couple weeks before returning to Skype. I asked him what that was all about, but he didn’t want to talk about it—even thinking about it made him feel sick.

Things remained pretty consistent between us, with about as much flirting and innuendo as you’d expect between two gay guys in their 20s.There were a couple times throughout our chat where I‘d quip, “Just get a sugar daddy to pay for that.” He’d reply, “I already have a sugar daddy,” but then dismiss it with a joke. Eventually I asked if he’d ever had an online boyfriend, since he’d never been in a real relationship. That’s when the tone of our conversation shifted suddenly. Miles asked, “Can you call? I have something to tell you, but it will take about 20 minutes to tell you the whole story.”

What he started out with was a story almost every gay kid is familiar with: always being different from the other and reaching an age where you feel the need to hide how you really walk and talk; coming out to people who can only offer their prayers; and that awful sense of lonliness that comes with isolation. His life was so different from mine, but those same emotions are something that still haunts me. Then he reached the point in his story where he turned 16, the age where he received his first computer with the internet.

Miles posted on internet chatrooms with the header “16/male/gay,” without much success until the day he receieved message from Donn, a 47 year old man in Michigan. Right away, I sensed something was up. Remember that short film Miles made? His character formed a close relationship with someone named Skylar, who we don’t learn much about, only that they live in Michigan. Miles and Donn also became very close, and for his 17th birthday Donn bought him a webcam—soon after, things went in the direction you’d expect and Miles had his first orgasm in his life, right there on camera, for Donn to watch.

Miles told me that Donn became the father figure in his life from that point on. He was absolutely obsessed with him, even writing songs for him on his birthday. There was a period where Miles lost his job, but Donn told him that was okay, he’d take care of him. For two years, Donn would wire over money to cover Miles’s living expenses—not much, considering he lived at home with his parents in a country where you don’t need much to get by anyway, and he admitted that Donn never paid a dime over that— but that is something Miles will always feel indebted for. He paid back Donn by doing things on camera for him—whatever he asked—every time he needed money.

For the past 11 years, Donn has been the only consistent friend in Miles’s life. Throughout the story, he kept repeating, “I love him, I love him so much.” It was at this point that I knew for sure where our relationship stood: I already knew it was doomed because of the distance, but the way he spoke about Donn showed me that our cutesy little chats were nothing compared to how he felt about Donn (or “daddy,” as he calls him). That short film was not only inspired by Donn—it was made for him.

Since that time, there have been several additional developments. One involved a series of screenshots showing a heated conversation he had with a friend, which he started sharing soon after we started talking. The friend said some horrible things towards Miles, not just personal insults but some bizarre racist and anti-semitic comments as well. They were written in broken English, so I just assumed they were between him and a local friend, but eventually it became clear they were written by Donn.

These abusive remarks are apparently common from Donn, but that doesn’t seem to phase Miles. However, he has had to set his Skype to Do Not Disturb about every couple months since that first time. After one of those instances, he called me on Facetime, something that hasn’t really happened much since he told me about Donn. It felt like one of our old calls: Miles showed me around his house and neighborhood before heading back to his room. Our conversation kept going on, but it was clear he had something else on his mind. He couldn’t hold it in for long and burst into tears—he had to turn off his camera because he didn’t want me to see him like that. What caused all this? In one of their arguments, Donn told Miles he never cared about his feelings. “That hurt so much from him. I was so lonely when he came along…” 

Miles called again the next day when he was feeling better and we had another chat like the old days. He even admitted that he might love me. Soon after, though, his Skype went back online and never mentioned those words again. He finally found the courage to tell Donn about me, though—Donn looked up my Skype ID, which has a picture of me with my dog from when I was 18. Miles showed me the screenshots of that conversation: Donn called Miles a “boylover” and in his broken English wrote “Miles fucks little boys!” This made Miles very defensive—he replied that I was “just somebody who plays Sudoku” with him, which admittedly kind of hurt. Miles demanded that I change my picture on Skype, which I replaced with recent picture with a geriatric filter added to it. Donn gave Miles the silent treatment after that; Miles sobbed and begged Donn for forgiveness; eventually, Donn started talking again and they “made up” together on webcam.

Miles admits that Donn is a self-proclaimed pedophile. He apparently lives alone and never lets people into his house—today, at the age of 57, he is still a virgin. That’s not a shocking revelation from a guy who seduced a boy online shortly after his 17th birthday, but what really got to me is during the Facetime call Miles had with me. At one point, he took me into a room with his two adorable nephews. Miles casually threw out, “Donn doesn’t like to see them because he gets turned on.” At first I thought I may have misheard—these kids are 2 and 4 years old—but Miles repeated that again several times in text where there could be no mistake what he meant.

Miles is always trying to convince me Donn is a good guy. I’ve never said anything, but also may be a little too obvious when keeping my mouth shut on that topic. He said that the pedophilia is not an issue because Donn only watches porn with 18 year old actors, something I find hard to believe from someone with his history. (I googled Donn once and saw that he had criminal records, but am unsure about how to access what those may be.) He is always sure to let me know at every chance that Donn is still his best friend and that he loves him.

That takes me to the really concerning development this week. Miles sent me a gif that he “stumbled upon while looking through old photos.” It’s a video of his little cousin’s butt—just a couple seconds of that and nothing else. He also sent me a closeup of a baby’s penis from an anime he’s watching, which was kind of odd, but he sends me all sorts of funny clips and screenshots from that show. It could just be his sense of humor—some countries don’t make a big deal about nudity in children—but I also know that almost all of my chats with Miles are recycled from his chats with Donn: every screenshot he’s sent me of their old conversations includes the exact same pictures and voice recordings he sent in our conversations. It makes me really concerned that Miles may be sending nude videos of his toddler cousin to a man he admits is turned on by little boys. Just a few hours ago, Miles messages me that “it’s okay if you’re a pedophile—nothing wrong with that.”

I just feel so hopeless at the moment. Miles is a good guy, but he’s also completely under the spell of Donn. If I hint at anything, I know whose side he’ll take in an instant. Donn is clearly not the most ethical person, but I also have no proof anything nefarious is currently going on. It just sort of feels like I’m waiting for something to happen that may not happen at all. I do care for Miles and feel sick when thinking about what Donn did to him. Maybe I just needed to rant, maybe there is something I should do—I don’t know, but maybe posting this and hearing the opinions from someone unbiased will help. Is it best to just let Miles figure out these things on his own?",09Jul2020,1
1041,"TL;DR: My father used to invade my privacy and now he wants to do the same with my cousin.

I am 15 years old male and since when I was 12 years old and had a cell phone, my father loves to take it and browse everything, gallery, apps, conversations etc. 
The most normal thing to think about is that he wanted my safety, but he only does it to try to find something wrong on my phone and be able to yell at me, he always does this after we get into an argument and I win, so he asks for the phone and the password to be able to search everything from there.
When I turned fifteen, my father said that as I was grown up he decided to stop doing that, but today he heard some strange audio coming out of my 11-year-old male cousin's cell phone which was a video where two people were fighting and it seemed like they they were doing ""mating"", which was the joke of the video. 
My dad then asked to see my cousin's cell phone and took it from him, my cousin was clearly agitated, because my dad took his cell phone and started to go through everything there and I started arguing with him and it went something like this: 
Me: ""You can't invade his privacy like that"" 
My dad: ""Yes I can, because I'm his uncle and it gives me the right to do that""
Me: ""No, you can't search his phone like that and if his father didn't trust him to give him a phone, he wouldn't have one"" 
So he returned the cell phone to my cousin, told me that I couldn't give him moral lessons and that now He would tell my uncle just so he could yell at my cousin, all this just because I confronted him.

How should I proceed? Should I argue with my father and tell him that he just likes to invade the privacy of others so as not to have his authority questioned or should I just let it go and wait and see what happens?

1042,"My boyfriend's 11 year old son is OBSESSED with his dad and I having sex. Thinks it is happening 24/7,  won't let us be alone in a room, bangs on our door when we are sleeping as though he is catching us in the act, etc. He is constantly saying the weirdest, most disturbing things to me and my SO. Examples: asked how soft my panties were, told me he knew that I was happy all the time because my SO ""squeezes my private parts"", asked if my breasts were purple because of all the sex we were having, and has even called us sex addicts. Truth be told, we never have sex because we are constantly worried about him hearing! 

A little background on the son... He was abandoned by his mother many years ago (around age 5) after a long custody battle with the father. The son, since very young, has had behavioral problems and has been kicked out of various camps/day schools/programs. In preschool, he was assessed by a professional and it was suggested that he was autistic. It was done without permission, so the father disregarded it and has never had him assessed again. I sometimes feel like he is on the spectrum, but what do I know! 

Okay, back to the matter at hand... Advice.... I don't know what exactly I am hoping to hear, but I need something. I am going crazy. Especially with the current global situation. I lost my job and my boyfriend now works from home, so we are all three constantly on top of each other. Our days have turned into just constant bickering and lecturing and crying and screaming. Poor kid just doesn't understand sex and relationships and we just don't know how to talk to him. I've never lived with a child, and never imagined a day where I would be talking about my sex life with a child. 

Is this abandonment issues presenting itself in a weird way? Is this a sex obsessed future psychopath? Is this just normal? I don't know. I just need to get it out there. My social circle has become quite small as of late.",09Jul2020,1

We went and got this girl who is our age and almost an hour in she starts flirting with me in the backseat back pocking me (physically). We were all having a sleepover in the same room. My friend and his GF were in the same bed together. While me and their friend were in separate beds. I invited her to cuddle with me. Then while we were starting to fall asleep, I tried to ask her ""is this okay?"" While I was unbuttoning her pants. She didn't really respond and was likely asleep. I played with her vagina while I was masterbating. I then buttoned her pants. The next day in the morning, I called my best friend and asked if there was a chance of getting her pregnant. The girl I took advantage of told her friend (who I was already talking too, since I met her through a dating app already).

1049,"Hello,

M 22

So I have gynecomastia on my right side and it's getting bigger. I had an appointment in 2019 (pre surgery assessment) but they made the decision to delay it due to needing advice from my psychiatrist to make sure I was mentally stable for any possible side effects ie we wanting more surgery. (I am medicated for OCD, I can assume they don't want to take a risk in case I had any irrational thoughts or desires to have more surgery which is definitely not something I want)

All I want to do is to have the surgery as it is really affecting my confidence. I live in Scotland and I phoned the breast surgery clinic four times but the the receptionist is always on leave/holiday.

To make things worse like psychiatrist is no longer my psychiatrist so I'm not sure who to chase to get an appointment sooner. I am happy to travel to get the surgery and stay in hospital. But I just want the surgery now so I can get it over and done with and be happier in myself.

Sorry for the poor grammar. I'm using speech to text because it would take way too long for me to type it out and I'm almost going to sleep.

TLDR: What is a better way to speed up appointment for surgery to remove growth (in scotland)

Many thanks",09Jul2020,1

I don't care for her family, and they don't seem to have a good opinion of me either. Since 16, I've had a Federal job, and the fiance seems to have a pretty unrealistic view on how life works.

Instead of congratulating me and being proud, they went off on me and told me things like ""You're a cheater"" and ""don't think this little thing makes you smart, you're totally worthless"" They got close to actually hitting me, but I kept enough distance to where they couldn't.

1056,"As the title says, my wife (for internet purposes, we'll call her Erica), wants to start having kids, but I just don't think I'm ready yet. Like I don't think I'm in the right mindset to have kids. We've been happily married for 3 years this August and we've had a dog for about 1.5 of the 3 years. That dog is more or less our child because we got her when we thought that we couldn't have kids because we thought Erica had Endometriosis up until April of this year. Now that we know she doesn't, Erica wants to start having kids because she's 27 and worried that she'll get to the point where she can't keep up with the kids when she needs to because of her Tendinitis that seems to get worse with her age.

The thought of having kids makes me terrified and worried. I don't think I'd be able to take care of them and my wife well enough or provide enough for them financially. I don't know that I'd even be a good father cuz I think I'd lose my mind worrying all the time about problems that probably wouldn't even happen. A small part of me is being a bit selfish saying that I love the life that I have with the money that I have to go and do fun things or buy stuff to entertain my wife and I like gaming stuff (we're both pretty avid gamers) and going out to movies and going to fancy restaurants every now and then. I know that most of that stuff will disappear after having kids and that small part of me doesn't want to give that up.

I want kids, but the thought of actually having them is always a distant thought like ""When I'm older, I'll have kids and we'll be able to do all these fun things with them and then I'll be able to give them bits of my knowledge to help them through their lives like my father did for me."" But it's almost staying like that. A ""When I'm older."" thought. I'm 26 in a week and most of my friends my age have 1 or 2 of their own kids and I feel like I'm falling behind. One of my co-workers said that he's got 4 kids that will all be graduated and could be out of the house by the time he's 45 and that sounds like a friggin dream come true to me.

I just don't even know where to start with getting my mindset into a place where I'm excited to start having kids or even accepting of giving up some of my luxuries so that I can raise a family. Is there some sort of book I can read or therapy for me to help me get to a point where I don't pass off having kids as a ""Somewhere down the line, we'll have kids."" or a ""When I'm older."" thought? How to I get started with this path to becoming a parent?

I have done so much shit for him-- he has a lot of issues, a lot of insecurities, and I would spend hours talking to him about it, trying to tell him to get him to change his mindset. He talks about politics a lot, and at one point, when I was physically ill, I told him to stop talking about it because I was supposed to be resting, but he didn't. When I told him this I literally apologized. But when I told him that I didn't like the way he spoke to me, he just started blaming his mental problems saying that it made him difficult to get accepted. He does that a lot-- that he blames external factors rather than trying to get to change. I'm mentally ill on many ways too, yet whenever I hurt someone, illness or not, I apologize. Now, I know you could bring up the point that most of this is my fault because I talked to him purely out of pity, which is exactly why I'm so conflicted about this. Because it's my fault too.

The issue is they’re getting older and upkeep is tough on them. They physically cannot keep up with this house. Dad (62 M) has to have his knee replaced next month. Mom (69 F) has had one knee and one hip replaced however still needs the other knee and hip replaced.
Dad has also had five back surgeries due to degenerative disks and the doctors have stated that his back is inoperable now. 
They have a stair lift but even just the day to day cleaning and maintenance is rough on them. 

I’m the oldest so it generally falls to me to go help with things. One adult brother is in another state and the other is an addict. 
They know I’m working so they try not to bother me which makes me feel guilty. They’re discussing hiring a cleaning service but they’re retired veterans on a fixed income. 

At this point, their house has a Zillow estimate of $114k over what they paid in 1995. I feel like they can handle the downgrade as it’s the two of them, my 13 year old brother (he’s adopted which accounts for the age gap), and they often have my eight month old nephew since his parents...ugh. 

The issue with getting them to sell is that while Dad is open, Mom loves the house so much. They recently remodeled the kitchen and master bathroom and it’s all beautiful.

1071,"A few months ago I got hired as a delivery driver for Domino's. I have 8 years experience working at Papa John's, so the manager, RJ, was impressed and seemed happy to get me trained on insider tasks on top of delivery.

He scheduled me for an insider shift during one of my first weeks on the job, and I called off at the last minute because of a bad panic attack. It was unrelated to work and, obviously, completely unexpected, or else I'd normally never call in without notice ahead of time. It was already uncomfortable enough being honest about my anxiety and sobbing on the phone. I told him I'd try to come in still if he wanted me to, but he claimed it was okay to stay home.

Ever since then, RJ has stopped scheduling me for inside work and doesn't try to get me trained on anything. I'm essentially a driving dish pig and with my experience, it's insulting. I've felt too embarrassed to ask him if I made a bad impression on him or something.

I've tried to make comments to everyone about how good I was at certain tasks when I used to work at Papa John's, how I used to be a manager, etc. in order to show interest in learning here. I've tried telling another manager that I don't like not knowing how to do much, and she said, ""yeah, they don't really train you here."" Wtf kind of response is that?

This store has some drivers who have worked there for years that don't even know how to take an order over the phone. The only reason I know how to do anything is because I'll go out of my way to ask for help. As someone who has experience in training new employees, I think it's the managers' responsibility to make sure people are trained, rather than making them go out of their way.

I'm thinking about applying to another location since I do want to work for Domino's and I feel like things won't change here based on the way they do things. Call me crazy, but I actually enjoy the fast paced environment, and being challenged at work because I'm not lazy, so even though I'm making good money, I'm not happy because I'm not getting to do what I originally intended to learn.

I'm worried about changing locations and regretting the decision because I don't know for sure how things will be at another store. What if I make less money in tips? What if the people there don't want to train me either? It's also convenient to work at my current store because I live only 3 minutes away.

He also tapes up pictures in our offices (eg he will write our name or draws a picture of a train), tries to video call us when he’s not in the office and generally just pesters us all day (he isn’t there every day but every day he is there it’s like this). He also adds us all on social media even going to the degree of logging into his mom/dad’s account and adding us there too (we know this because of the types of messages that accompany it).

To make this more complicated, his dad (my coworker) is brothers with one of the company owners. His dad doesn’t work in the same area, so basically he drops his son off in one building then goes to work in another, with no oversight. 

I’m looking for some advice on how to handle this situation. I feel terrible because this guy is autistic and it’s not his fault, but at the same time it’s very distracting and in a lot of cases his actions make me and my female coworkers uncomfortable.”",09Jul2020,1
1079,"My nephew is only 6 and has angry outbursts. I don't know what is considered ""normal"" for his age. They usually don't last long. 

For instance when we play games together (usually about 30 minutes a night), he gets really upset if he dies. Today he died on Minecraft and thought he lost the diamonds he found. He almost started crying until he realized I got them. 

He also gets really upset if he loses a game (video or board). It usually only lasts for a minute or so. Afterwards he is sullen or just normal.

Is this normal behavior for a 6yo? He doesn't have many behavior issues in school (he can be a bit bossy and sometimes talks too much).

If not, what can I do at home or when I play with him to help this? I've started letting him walk on the treadmill (while I supervise) because it lets out energy and he feels accomplished when he completes a lap. I've also thought of buying some coop board games (any recs welcome) so he can learn to work towards a common goal.

I thought of trying to get him to meditate/slow breathing for 60 seconds after he has one of these fits. Or maybe just meditate in general. I've never done it though, so we'd be learning together.",09Jul2020,1

I really feel like I could be friends with their group. 

The thing is I’m not a social media influencer. And I know most people probably feel that way with youtubers like they’re friends.

1081,"So, the title pretty much says it all.  Anon account for obvious reasons.

I was surfing for porn and happened upon a gallery of photos that contains lots of personally identifiable information, plus explicit nude photos of a young woman.  It also shows a photo ostensibly of her claiming she didn't want the photos to be up.  I won't name her here, or provide any details that would easily identify her, because the whole reason I am posting this thread is that I presume she doesn't want to have this stuff public.

I don't know her or anybody who does know her, and I want to keep myself anonymous in anything that I do regarding this, but I want to do something to help take these photos down.  This whole thing reeks of revenge porn, and I don't want that kind of stuff to stay online.  FWIW, her email address is listed in the gallery, but it might be perceived as creepy in itself to send something to that address letting her know that the photos are up.

Any suggestions?",09Jul2020,1
1082,"For context. I am fifteen years old. My mother is overseas right now so I am living at home by myself and taking care of myself. A relative comes over at night to stay the night then returns home. I have cousins / aunts living like a block away.

I was walking home when I saw a homeless guy sitting near a curb under shade right next to my house (tbf my home is the one closest to the main road connecting the neighborhood) I asked him if I could get him anything. He said yes, so I ran in and put together a small bag of snacks and drinks.

He said thank you and shook my hand and introduced himself, asked for my name. Seemed nice! But then he started making me feel a little weird. Some of his words were hard to understand, but the question I did understand was ""\[something something\] do you mind if I drop by sometime?""

Obviously, I said no nicely. But considering I am currently home by myself in the day time and I am a  child it made me feel uncomfortable. I am not sure what to do or whether or not I should be scared. I tried calling my local PD and some numbers I saw online regarding homelessness, but somehow they were even worse than my bank and didn't even pick up.

I already told my relatives but I would love to know if there's anything else I can do to keep myself safe and whether or not his questions were something I should be worried about. It's also starting to get real hot out here and I want to know what I can do for him. Already have been doing research online but I see no definitive advice or help.

So i’m 20, about to be 21 and I talk very quiet/quickly. I have a job and customers and coworkers would keep telling me that they can’t hear me, to speak up and honestly i’m tired of repeating myself. I don’t know what to do to fix this issue. I’m very shy and awkward. I never joke with my other coworkers. I always apologize for the smallest things. Oh, and i’m very sensitive lmao.

When I try defend myself or I get pissed off and try to get a word in she says I think I'm always right and always have to get the last word.

A few months ago one of her friends borrow a few of my DVDs. He visited one more time after that and she forgot to ask for them back. She told me she would ask for them back. Then I mentioned it today and she said he moved and she doesn't talk to him anymore. Of course she blames me, telling me I shouldn't have let him borrow them. I reminded her that came to the house after borrowing them. She just said she forgot and tells me to consider it a loss. And that's that. Now I'm pissed. No offer to replace my DVDs, not even an apology or acknowledgement that she messed up but on top of that she has the gall to blame me. If she just apologized instead of blaming me I'd be annoyed but I'd get over it. Now I'm seething. I'm tired of this.

1086,"My best friend [18F] - we’ll call her H - has been dating since we were in our early teens, but none of her relationships lasted longer than a few months. Either her partners would cheat on her, treat her badly, or leave her. I was there for her every single time. 

Things seemed to change around last year. She started dating this guy [21M] who we’ll call J. He was different from anyone she’d dated previously - he was super respectful and treated her well, and I’d never seen her so happy. I thought she’d finally found “the one”. H and J dated for nearly a year and a half (by far the longest relationship she’s been in).

Last week H called me. She told me that she hooked up with a friend of hers [19M] and cheated on J. She didn’t know whether she had feelings for her friend, but what happened was casual at the time. I asked her why she cheated on J and she just said she didn’t know and hung up. As much as I was mad at her, I opted to not tell J. I was hoping H would do it herself.

Tonight H messaged me. She’s angry because one of her friends told J that H cheated on him, and now he’s refusing to speak to her. 

I know this is her fault and I want to tell her that. But I don’t want it to lead to us not being friends. We’ve supported eachother nonstop since we were kids and I don’t want to ruin that. But I’m not on her side with this and I don’t know how to tell her that.

They did my nurse intake and then the intake with the people that forward my paperwork to the counselors that work with you once you get to the residential part of the program. While I was in the second intake the nurse came in and started my Librium a bit early because I have a high risk / history of seizures specifically related to alcohol withdrawal. Everything was fine. I was shaking, but I finally was able to go to bed. I have no idea how long after the Librium the intake nurse came in my room with the head (idk) RN and took me into a back office. 

They informed me that I tested positive on my pregnancy test. I immediately thought it was a mistake because I’m a lesbian and I haven’t slept with a man for like ten/twelve years. So I started kind of freaking out and they took me to the bathroom to give them another urine sample. The second one came back positive. And then the third. I’m freaked at this point, because at no time in the recent past have I consented to any sex with a man. 

I’ve come to the realization that I’ve most likely been raped while I was blackout drunk somewhere. I will probably never find out what the fuck happened.

1092,"I have anxiety and depression issues after a lot of negative social experiences and family issues, now nearly always I overthink every single social interaction and believe people laugh at me, comment what I do or say or insult me.

It definitely happened in the past and now it drives me crazy because I cannot figure it out if it is my mind playing tricks on me or if I sense people being snarky or rude indirectly.

Socializing makes me miserable and anxious for this reason and tend to isolate myself or take stuff personally a lot.

I know my brain really makes it worse that it really is but I cannot stop. I really think it is anxiety because it happens too often and while I am definitely a little awkward my social skills can't be that bad.

Often I have no motivation to go out and meet people for this reason alone and many others too...


For example lately I have been hanging out with my younger cousin I had known for years but didn't see for a long time. We used to be friends then after some family woes and arguments we stopped talking. Also school etc
She has invited me to her place, paid for my drink and my ice cream, wanted to visit etc and tried to get back in contact first. There were other friends too and especially another girl was nice to talk to etc

My cousin tends to have a stronger and outspoken personality and can be a little bitchy but nothing too bad, there was always a general feeling we click and we were close friends years old for a while.

She tends to make sarcastic comments and playfully insults friends so nothing personal about that and conversations were good too.

Today I was at her place and there was her family too, they have a pool etc and her friends was still  there.
She is from another country and made a small fail when I mentioned the languages and how similar they were but she didn't seem to care.
Her other friend was acting a little weird but I already saw him acting like that and I am not sure why, I don't really think he dislikes me but my anxiety made think that.

Anyway my cousin was holding a baby (her cousin) and trying to feed him some bread but he didn't like it. He chewed it but didn't spit it out even people told him so and the girl friend was with a lower voice tone ""they don't know shit"" (in my language they used no pronoun though) and my cousin said ""nah they can't be that dumb/retarded"" then she stopped herself but she also used no pronouns. I was in front of them because we were paying attention to the baby and at first I didn't care but what if they were talking about me?
It was random and it confused me.

I hang out with the night before and talked a lot and there was some drama too with my cousin and a dude etc, she said see you tomorrow and everyone seems nice but they noticed I can be distracted and awkward sometimes.

It's really bothering me because if there were talking about me then I don't want to be the butt of the joke but if they weren't I would look crazy to ask...they are also some other indirect comments too.

Tonight they didn't ask me to hangout but idk when I will them again, maybe tomorrow or later on.

Stuff like this happens to me often because I always misunderstand contexts and stuff and think people are laughing about me etc

But now I am worried that she still has that sex tape that we made and thinking that she will some day leak it to ruin my career or relationship.

1096,"Long story short, I've lived in Florida most of my life, but after some poor choices and events, I've decided to move back where I was born, Michigan, to live with some older family members. Im really not a fan of southern culture, let alone the awful heat. To put it simply, Ive wanted to leave Florida for years.


However, being in a new town entirely - as well as being in the midst of the virus, of course, which I honestly tend to forget as most Americans seem to be quickly brushing it aside ‐ I'm just ridiculously lonely. Everyone at my job is both elderly and rude, I never have any chance to meet people my age, and I'm starting to suffer mentally from feeling totally alone. I spend most of my time on hobbies, which is fun and all, but I miss goofing around and having fun. In some ways I feel that if I continue this path, I'll never have that again.

I do have two options, though. On one hand, I could be brave and stick it out - I have a new job opportunity soon, which seems a bit more socially promising, if at least more interesting. On the other, I could just go home to Florida... i have plenty of friends there, as well as plenty of opportunities, but - frankly - I almost dread the thought of giving up. In many ways, I'd only return to solve my loneliness.

Feeling isolated and disappointing is something I've only ever been able to solve in the confirmation of others, particularly friends, and without any i feel myself losing grasp on things.

1097,"I know this sounds weird. When my bf and I met, he was 29 years old and single his whole life, having friends with benefits and one night stands. 

In the beginning of our relationship, I asked out of curiosity how many girls he slept with (I lost my virginity to him). He said he “ballparked” it at 40. It took me aback and eventually caused some jealousy and trust issues on my end. 

Eventually during a “break” we had, a break I initiated, he apparently actually counted the number of women he slept with. We got back in contact and when this topic was brought up again, he said he actually took time and counted each encounter and he said “I think the real number is 23.”

He did say how he “guessed” when I initially asked and rounded up, hence 40.

Fast forward to today, I discovered his Reddit account.  3 years ago, when he was about 26-27 years old, he apparently commented on a Reddit thread how he “slept with 100+ girls” and how he didn’t have feelings for them, and how he didn’t want to have a relationship with any of them. 

Keep in mind I’m his first girlfriend (so he claims), the first woman he says he loved, the woman he wants to marry, etc. 

Well, I did confront him, and he said that “100+” number was exaggerated and not remotely true. 

At this point, i don’t know what to believe?!

Also, I know my obsessive behavior isn’t normal and I’m already going to therapy so please refrain from those comments; I’m already aware. 

Tldr; BF told me he slept with 23 girls, but on a Reddit comment from 3 years ago, he apparently slept with 100+. I confronted him and he said he exaggerated. What do I believe?!

Recently my dad (51m) and I (24f) we’re discussing the BLM movement. He started telling me things like how the BLM movement was actually just funding liberals in America instead of helping those in need and how it was all a political plot to prevent Trump being re-elected. He also quoted the classic statistics regarding white-on-white deaths vs black-on-black deaths and the like, and basically summed up with “all lives matter.” He is also a fan of conspiracy theories and mentioned something about Trump and that WikiLeaks guy; honestly I tuned out by this point.

I know he watches a lot of YouTube videos and reads about this sort of thing on the internet all the time, and he gets super invested. Sadly, IMO, he’s being mislead/miseducated and is generally missing the whole point particularly of the BLM movement. So I’m here for some help - how do I approach a correction with him?

Other than being pretty good at drawing (but not professional level) and having a BFA degree, I don't have a ton of marketable skills- I don't even know where to start, I just want to move forward with my life and not be beyond miserable for 9 1/2 hours every day (and every 4th weekend).


Sorry. Rant over. What are some good skills to pick up?",09Jul2020,1
1110,"I am a minor and I’ve been doing online therapy for nearly a year now, I’m too uncomfortable talking face to face and the protection of the screen is comforting. My therapist recently changed to an older guy it used to be a woman before. I was telling him about my boyfriend and we got onto the topic of things I do for him ( I won’t go into detail) and when I explain that sexually I do almost anything, my therapist looked down to write notes while nodding repeating “good girl good girl” he was whispering so I guess he didn’t think the mic would pick it up but I questioned him on it and he explain that he was just saying how it’s good I satisfy my boyfriends needs.  Am I overreacting?",09Jul2020,1
1111,"Idk why I just suck at human interactions I tried talking to people at my school or my friends they ignored me a lot  I am just not good at it my parents also ignored me a lot when I was young I wasn't allowed to talk back only went to school didn't play sports ( they really didn't care how this will affect my life ) I just accept that I will never be able to talk to people or stand up for my self so I just shut up and it's actually much better than forcing my self to watch youtube videos like charisma on command etc it's comforting knowing that I am a loser who can't talk or when someone roasts me I can't reply because of circumstances I couldn't control when I was young ( abusive physically and emotionally also I was neglected ) I avoid social situations as much as possible

Also girls are another story I can't even think about talking to  one so I guess I will be lonely for the rest of my life  

I just wish my parents tried to make my life better instead of what happened",09Jul2020,1

1113," I'm not really sure how to put it, but I don't understand anything anymore. I have a close friend of 6 years, and the last four they've been trusting me with their personal problems. You see, I was barely a teen back then, and still I felt there was something off: all the issues had been revolving around the topic of self-hatred and guilt, and this only grew stronger over time. If firstly it was something I could relate to - I too had self-esteem issues and such - now the main points are that they're unable to love and don't feel as a normal, real human, only as a mistake or a bug in the code. Also they're, I'm not sure how to describe, mood cycles, when every once in a half year they become too apathetic, and other times they're overexcited; and yes, they're suicidal as well. I'm no specialist, but this is terrifying and I don't know what to do. I've dealt with this for years, I've been trying to be a supportive friend, to love, but it's like wandering without a map or even any destination. Yes, I've talked about the therapy, but they seem to deny even the possibility of them being ""ill"" aggressively (maybe I just did it really bad). I'm not sure what I want to achieve with this post, just, ugh, it's hard to see your dearest friend saying they don't love you because they're not quite human and thus are incapable of loving. Maybe someone with such thoughts can share what others can do to help them feel better? I don't know...",09Jul2020,1
