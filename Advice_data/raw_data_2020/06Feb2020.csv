0,"Hey! So I'm a 22(f) working a fulltime job. So I'm more or less financially stable. But I do have a slight shopping addiction. Like currently I'm drooling over a pair of stripper shoes, new dishware for my kitchen and small trinkets to make new earrings. But I don't know how to priotize these spendings, especially since none of them are a urgent need I have. I have all necessities in life and am saving money every month for emergency funds and such. I just need advice for how I can stop myself from buying all these unnecessary things",06Feb2020,1

3,"I’m in a sales course right now, paid for by my employer, and we are learning a “script” that basically is a guideline for setting yourself up for the most success possible with the client. My instructor says i have it down better than anyone, and i am great at listening, and asking questions about the answers I’m given by the client. He told me that i seem a bit monotone and not passionate about the client. While i understand that, part of me thinks it’s because I’m trying to remember the script and it takes away from my emotional involvement. But on the other hand sometimes i feel like I am monotone and just go through the motions, as well as i feel discomfort when presenting infront of groups. I care about my job and need it, so please no saying switch professions. How can be more energetic and less monotone without it coming off as fake or forced?

8,"This morning at work someone broke into my fiancee's car (it was unlocked, they merely opened a door), they pulled out a coat touching nothing else, and cut it in half with a razor blade (or fresh scissors). Half of it was left next to the car, the remaining half has yet to be found. 
The area in which she works is a very safe/well off area. My unlocked car was at the end of the same lot (10 ft away), in an area which cannot be seen from the front offices unlike her car and it contained many coats, some cash and an electronic device in plain view. 
We are at a loss as to who would have done this. Has anyone heard of this happening? 
Two of her coworkers do not get along well with her but it would seem bold of them to do such a thing.

Tl;dr Car was broken into, everything left untouched except fiancee's coat which was cut in half, half of it is missing, have you seen this before?

9,"My 5 year old was using our family computer and asked me for help printing something. It was about how cute penises were. I asked her where she had seen that or what made her think that and she wouldn’t answer me. She was obviously humiliated. I told her I was going to have to show her dad and she started crying. She then said boys at school walk around with them out of their pants in the hallway after the bathroom. I don’t see how that could be possible... the school said it isn’t happening.

I have worked at my current place of employment for a year now, and things have drastically changed since I started. I am a hard worker, am fluent in Spanish and have gone above and beyond my job requirements throughout my time working here. 

Recently, there have been some issues among other people I work with, this does not directly involve me, but because of these issues, such as fellow employees avoiding work, not showing up on time, showing up not in uniform and other things similar to this, my workplace has implemented changes to the overall workplace that include everyone. I am annoyed by this because my employers have not directly addressed the issues on an individual basis, but have instead implemented company-wide changes to address the issues.  These changes seem drastic to me based on some other peoples’ experiences (from a limited pool of friends). They include a system where you are penalized for calling in sick to work, even if you have a doctor’s note, installing cameras in the break room and Technician areas, that include audio recording, as well as taking away our earned rewards such as “bonus days” which are given to us based on reaching certain goals each month.

17,"
Ok, I’ll try and keep it brief, but here is the backstory


For me: I (23M) currently work as a delivery guy on the side. There is a woman (34F) near my town who had noted on her delivery, that if I come after ~20:00 I should call instead of ring, because I’d wake up her child. Given that I often deliver up to 22:00 (23:00 for some customers) that happened a few times.
However a few weeks ago I started an internship at this company and after a few days, I was just coming into work and suddenly she stood in front of me. We were both kinda surprised and thought it was funny, we met at her workplace. Given the nature of the job we had to work closely together and got to talk. We got along pretty well and after a few days we „officially“ exchanged numbers. Soon she stopped working there (she had already put in her resignation letter before I even started) but one day after work she texted me, asking if I want to come over for a coffee. I did and we talked (yes. Just talked) for a few hours. The second time I stayed there a little longer, but still normal (however getting a little less insecure I soon started getting a little more flirty, which is kind off my default setting with people I like). Last time I went over, at some point I jokingly said that I could help her „relax“. When she asked if I really would, I said yes, but she noted that I usually am way too young for her. We however started taking the talk into a different direction, talking about each other’s sexual preferences and stuff and she later noted that she has to admit, she was intrigued to kiss me (one of the many hints I now know my stupid ass missed).

Anyways, the rest of the day went nice, we talked a bit more and I probably missed even more hints than I’m aware of. 

So now let’s get to the real advice part. Looking down on me, there is lots of hair. I have relatively long but „thinned out“ chest hair, a bit of armpit hair, even thinner belly hair. Going further down there is lots of thick long pubic hair as well as relatively thick and long hair on my legs. I think that’s about it. Anyways, neither of us want anything real serious, but if I get a chance to hit it off again, I don’t want to throw her off with anything, potentially ruining my first time having sex in about 2 years.  Since I only had 2 relationships until now and just a few more sexual partners, I’m not to experienced when it comes to grooming and others preferences. She would also be my first partner that isn’t younger than me, so this one goes out, especially to the more mature people of reddit.

What would you recommend I do? I usually just let it all grow as is, except for when I’m expecting to get laid. If so I usually just shave my pits and balls blank, because that’s already a ton of work, and anything else would be even more. However at this point I’m curious how you people do/prefer it

TL;DR: Might get a chance with an older woman and need advice regarding grooming my body",06Feb2020,1

20,"I want to start this post I'm not making this post to flex or anything like that I'm being up front I am normally uncomfortable talking about my family's finances. So my girlfriend and I are long distance she is in Maine and I'm in Hawaii. A hour ago before she went to dinner we were face timing well next month she is coming to Hawaii for the first time to see me as the rest of her family have a vacation. Today we got on the topic of my house. She has kind of seen it when I'm walking around my house while we face time but I never gave her like a tour or anything. Well I have her my address and she looked it up on google maps. Which came up a really tall building which she was like woah and all of that stuff I stayed silent. Then she looked at my condo building and saw the other condos in my building were going for 4.5 million. So the rest of the time we talked she only wanted to talk about my house. Saying stuff like ""I knew you were wealthy but you are fucking rich babe!"" And I tried to give signs I was really uncomfortable but she just wasnt taking the hint.

21,"One year fresh out of university with a Marketing  Degree I managed to get an internship in a corporate company and I am now 6 months into my contract. 

Things have been going well, the marketing ""team"" is not so well established, it is not serving the division as it should be which means there's a lot of work to be done. And based on my work ethic, soft skills, enthusiasm and willingness to get things done it seems I have secured a role, though nothing is official. 

Little backstory; Ever since my second year I have been wanting to change majors and study IT but I stuck it out because my parents had already paid for tuition and I felt guilty about changing my mind and since then varsity was just a drag - except the final year when we had a lot of research to do for a mini dissertation. After discovering programming I did a lot of learning on my own, almost flunked many of my modules because I got distracted learning programming instead of studying for what I was enrolled in.

The dilemma. As mentioned, in my current marketing job I seem to be warming up to it and things are looking pretty, pretttty, prettttty good in terms of job security but I am now being given an opportunity to be a software developer in the same company but different division. It will be a training opportunity/internship, they know that I am self taught and that my current knowledge is not on the same level as some of the interns who will be joining the program and have studied CS as a major. 

Do I take the risk? Make the switch and try out what I have always have thought is a passion or do I follow the ""bird in hand"" philosophy, considering the unemployment rate?",06Feb2020,1

23,"So I live alone in a semi-secluded area, and I’ve  recently began wondering if anyone would notice if something awful happened to me. I do have friends who I hang out with a couple times a week although we don’t talk everyday. My main family have a group chat I use to stay in touch but are two hours drive away. I have a job and am certain if something happened during the time I’m supposed to be there they would notice, but what about on my days off?

The last few days I put it to the test - haven’t touched social media at all, didn’t open messages, and haven’t left the house. Not a soul has tried to call me or asked if anything was going on. And now I worry - if something did happen, I have a cat and a dog. They would be stuck without food/care, if the door was left open my dog could run away. What can I possibly do to ensure their safety in case something happened to me? Especially without telling my friends/family about my ‘experiment’ and potentially upsetting them or making them worry about my sanity. 

To be clear I’m not depressed or planning anything, just trying to be practical.",06Feb2020,1
24,"I'm a former model who was invited to model for a fashion show. The main reason for me saying yes to this was the money, as I really need it right now, but also because I didn't want to let down my friend who was so exited when she found out I would be there. 

Earlier this week while doing a show, I was called fat twice (I'm not fat at all, my BMI is underweight), had to wear fur (I'm against fur, I was told there wouldn't be any) and put up with the fakest of fake people who trash talk everyone behind their back. I'm supposed to go back tomorrow and I really don't want to. Problem is that everyone's already counting on me being there, including my friend. There's a reason why I don't do modeling anymore, it makes me feel like shit, like I'm being judged all the time. I was actually feeling good about my body until my weight was targeted during the show earlier this week. I'm careful about this because I went through an eating disorder from age 16-20. On the other hand, it's a job that pays well and I only have one more day to go. Plus there's free food/drinks and I get to hang out with my friend backstage.   


Any advice on what I should do here? If I don't show up they'll never ask me again and I don't know if I want that either cause I feel like they'll hate me. And my friend would be disappointed as she had a part in me being invited in the first place.",06Feb2020,1
25,"Hey, so I don't really post on reddit much but I think I need help, please forgive me if I don't know how this works. I've been an artist all my life but the only real place that my art has really accumulated is Instagram.  I had my Instagram privated until fairly recently; and I just started selling my work because I'm REALLY down on my luck, like I'm staying in someone else's dorm and can't afford food kinda thing.. i don't have a job, I haven't had one in over a year (long story, but I've had bad experiences in the work place and find it hard to find new work. But I'm actively trying) have a laptop and a drawing tablet; the little wacom intuos one. and I've been trying to get a job in the city where I am. I don't drive and can't walk far without it being unsafe. Basically,  I'm stuck in a room all day. So I thought it would be smart to start doing commissions and the like. Made a fiverr, made a redbubble, opened for commissions on Instagram and realised I don't have nearly enough of a following thats interested in art (mostly just followed by friends from highschool) and I'm probably not reaching the right market. I wouldn't say I'm great at digital art; I have a long way to go definently.  But I wanted to know if there were any other art sellers out there who know what they're doing and can help? Any information will mean a lot and probably boost my knowledge on this a great deal because I'm really new to this.

26,"This is my first post ever on reddit so idrc if this blows up or not just at least one response would mean a lot to me.

So for some background I dated this girl online for about 8 months and I was getting really into it, I genuinely thought I had a future with her but then out of the blue she dumped me one day and it hit hard. She brought me to a discord server and publically humiliated me in front of them and spammed me with Ls before blocking me on everything. To this day I dont know why she (I dont think they were a she) did it. It caused me so much grief and i was distraught for days.

About 3 weeks later, I start hitting it up with another girl who helped me through the first ordeal and now im in a similar situation where I feel like i'm falling for her too. Our relationship is only a few months old and I know that I was left really vulnerable after incident 1 and probably just latched onto the next best thing.

Here is where the plot thickens.

Today I got a message from my first girlfriend, aka the one who dumped me saying that they thought I was cheating and they wanted to apologise, as far as I can tell they just want to be friends again but a part of me still misses them. I have many options ahead of me now:

Do I stay in a relationship with gf 2 and potentially miss out on the person I feel more strongly about? Do I even give gf 1 a chance to prove they are who they say they are, and even if I do  do I forgive them? Because what they did to me cut deeply and im not sure what they did is excusable in any way.

30,"Hey y'all. I'm 17F and idk what tf to do. I just got out of a mental hospital after being there for two weeks, before which I was in the er for about a week. About a month before that, I was also in the psych ward for about a week and a half. It was for self harm, crazy fluctuating mood swings and suicidal thoughts. Also a whole lotta other messed up weirdness but whatever. 

Anyways because of that and the trial and error wackness of meds I was plummeting at school. I usually get good grades and my GPA is still a 3.7 but my motivation is just gone. 

It feels like too much work to talk, get out of bed or even look at someone when they're talking to me. And I've been like this all my life but any little failure triggers such anger. I feel like I'm either feeling too much and I feel on the brink of snapping or I'm numb to the point where I would go back and deal with the shittiest things in my past just to feel something, anything. 

I  either can't relax, or I feel like I'm sleepwalking through life and I couldn't care less. 

This past year has been absolute shit. I was broken up with after over a year long relationship with a guy who I told myself I loved because I needed someone to love and to feel loved in return. I eventually fell for him and I would have sacrificed my happiness for his but I only gave me a year to do that and then left. Cliche and dumb as shit ik, but I was destroyed. He didn't so much as look at me after. 

Around a little less than a month later, a really close guy friend opened up to me. He made me actually laugh and feel alive again. He had been my friend for a while but I was starting to feel something more. Not like romantically, it was way too early. To this day I still have times where I don't feel quite right. But I really felt a strong affection for him and I felt happy around him. He told me he liked me romantically and I was terrified. I loved him as a friend and I couldnt bear losing him. The thought of a hole replacing him in my life was horrifying, so I tried to stay close to him without crossing into the romantic aspect. It didn't work. Almost a year later, we talk so much less than we did before and I miss him so much it hurts. 

Fast forward to now, guess what, parents are divorcing! Mum took us, without any warning to us and now we are 1600 miles away from what we called home about two months ago. I'm so conflicted. I don't know what to do. I miss my dad, even though he's hurt us all, I miss my friends so much. I have to go to a new school which absolutely terrifies me. This guy who I was never romantically involved with won't get out of my head and I think I'm realizing too late that I'm in love with him. I'm lonely, tired depressed and so confused. Right now, the only things keeping me holding on are my mom and my dog. I have to be strong for my mom because ik how stressed she is. I love her to pieces. What do I do to stay sane? Is there anything? How do I keep these feelings in check? What should I do with my life to keep it from becoming one shitty rollercoaster in which I have no access to the fucking control panel",06Feb2020,1

34,"So I'm trying to handle this in the most adult and nonviolent way possible but day the situation escalated.

Back story, about 18 months ago I (26m currently) took a new position at work. Basically spear heading a new department. I was alone and set up an entire new system in about a month and things are progressing smoothly. That is until I was given a partner (50s m). There's no too many words I could use to describe this man but just imagine a self important neanderthal. Stunningly lazy so makes this entire process go from smooth and steady progress to a babysitting position. His babysitter. Refuses to learn anything. Now we don't have a lead, supervisor, or anything we work directly under an ""executive level manager"".
In quotes because this was a recently acquired company and for mom and pop operation.

Now my boss quickly notices that I still do all the hard work but for some reason keeps my partner and just assigns me the harder tasks. This is where the trouble begins because these tasks involve a lot a computer work and I'm not able to be on the floor to assist with the everyday things. So one day about a month into this position I have an entire binder of work, hundreds of items to either create or adjust existing items to fit into the new computer system. Partner repeatedly barges in and demands I help but our boss is there and tells him no. That's very simple in my opinion, this needs done. But when our boss goes to lunch he rushes in again, grabs me by the face, and tells me that ""He isn't a slave"" and I need to do my job. So I was in the military and if that taught me anything it's to maintain composure. So I tell him to get his hands off me and he backs up and leaves. I tell our boss, there is no way that is continuing. Our boss reports to HR, HR says that we are to be separated but that never happens. 

So through the next five months we persevere. Get a new partner, which he made do everything until they quit and then I choose someone who can fill my shoes. Many arguments and complaints later until I am transferred, finally. 

I avoid working near this man, talking to, even acting like he exists. Separate from me, he verbally abused a receiving clerk in front of many witnesses, called a quality technician a ""Fucking spick"" and all that equates to nothing. He even complains to our former boss that this is somehow my doing.

Brings us to this evening. My manager this morning tries to get me to clean up his mess because he just can't do the job. I have no idea how he's lasted this long. I argue with my manager and his supervisor. Telling them exactly what HR said over a year ago ""We are not to work together"" it is just in everyone best interest. So I helped for maybe five minutes and another team took over. Had no other interactions with him and have kept my nine-ish month record or not speaking a word to him.

Finish the day and clock out, see him, don't care. However when I pull out of the parking lot and head home, this fucking genius floor's it, follows me and blows on his horn. Through much practice I am ignoring. Still he persists, keeps blowing his horn until he months the curb, rolls down his window and repeatedly yells ""IM GONNA KICK YOUR MOVERFUCKIN ASS YOU HEAR ME"" This is the first time in nearly a year I've even made eye contact with this subhuman trash and I feel disgusting. Don't day anything but call the police. Police say I should have pulled out my camera, so there is a big mistake on my part. Sheriff meets me and explains that there is nothing they can do as of now but that I need to speak to HR again and explain that this is work place bullying. He I was thinking that bullying was reserved for school and not professional environments with someones grandfather. 

Now to the advice. How should I go about handling this dilemma? He seems untouchable from HR, my bosses don't seem to give a shit. I'd rather not shoot this man but he decided to take this out of the work place and bring it into my outside life. And I hate to even write it but I get the increasing feeling this is simply a race issue. I am caucasian, this man is African American. He can verbally and physically abuse, harass, and use racial slurs and nothing happens. But I feel if I even thought of using a racial slur, the all African American women lead HR department, wouldn't even hesitate to fire me on the spot.

Just at a loss of how to handle this without violence or running away to another job. The latter probably being the right choice but they hand out overtime like candy and I ducking love candy.

One day, I noticed dollars being stolen from my piggy bank (it was transparent and it was more like a used container that used to be filled with candy. I got paranoid and hid my money in places I know someone won’t find. I know it was my mom, my dad is too honest to steal. Call me bias, I suppose.

As you can tell by the title, I told on my mom on my dad. The last time I told on her was when she ‘accidentally’ took a pinwheel because my sister liked it. When I told on her, she complained, “it’s only 50cents!” Dad replied with “I don’t care, it’s still stealing and if you get put to jail, you’re on your own. I won’t bail you out. You too [ME].”

She yelled at me after dad went somewhere. Told me that it wasn’t necessary for me to tell dad about it. Told me to just ignore it.

One day, dad asked for a couple of dollars since he needed to vacuum to car. I said okay. He followed me to my room but I said that he should stay there since I need to take out my ‘secret money’. He looked at me weirdly and said that he would never steal from me.

“I know.” I said, “it’s just, I got paranoid  that dollars were going missing and hid it.” 

He looked angry, like he knew who it was. Generally, I panicked.

“It’s okay dad, since she’s my mom, it’s okay for her to take a couple dollars.” I said.

“No, it is not okay. It is your money. I will fix this shit.” He left after I gave him the money.

I was worried, call me stupid for worrying about something like this I guess. But I’m afraid my mom will be angry at me. She’s not abusive. I love her, but sometimes she overbearing and pestering and angry, which makes me hate her sometimes.

She hasn’t arrived home yet, but I know once she does, dad will talk to her, make her angry, say that I’m lying (maybe) and they’ll fight. And I’m afraid.

Will I be able to mend my relationship with my mom? Was it the right choice to tell on her? I don’t know.",06Feb2020,1

Greetings r/Advice, and thanks for taking the time to read my post and (hopefully) provide some advice.

Heres my situation:

I get the train to college every morning, and most days this really cute girl also gets the same train as me, but she gets on at the next stop. We walk the same route from the final stop to our college each morning, and she seems like a really cool person, so I’d love to strike up a conversation with her to get to know her better. However, as your fairly average, socially awkward male teenager, I’m pretty garbage when it comes to any social interaction outside my friend group and friends of friends. Unfortunately with this girl, none of my friends know her at all, and I don’t see her around campus as she is in a different department to me, and each courses lunch time is different, so I never see her in the cafeteria. The only time I’d get to speak to her is during that walk to college, along with a bunch of other people who walk the same route. Seeing as we all have the next few weeks off, and I don’t see her walking on Fridays, today (Thursday) is the last day I have to talk to her before we all go on break. I really want to try to talk to her so we can hopefully continue talking, either when we all go back, or over the holidays on social media. 

My question to everyone is, how do you start a conversation with someone you barely know? I don’t want it to be super awkward, but I also really want to step out of my comfort zone and stop being so nervous. Any advice on the subject would be appreciated",06Feb2020,1
38,So me and my girlfriend broke up around 3 weeks ago. She told me she wanted to be friends with benefits and I agreed but she told me She doesn’t want me to be with other girls but she told me she wants to explore with different people. Like wtf.. what should I do?,06Feb2020,1

40,"Last weekend I went out with some friends, along with some other people I didn't know. One of these was the girl in question. (let's call her Lily). Lily seemed pretty shy to begin with, but as the night went on and the drinks kept flowing, she seemed interested in me (I think) and we were dancing with each other for a little bit. Naturally, being drunk and kind of dumb, I forgot to get her number or snapchat or anything. I did find her instagram with some sleuthing skills, but I feel like it'd be weird to contact her on instagram out of the blue. Should I do that, or should I just hope I see her around again?",06Feb2020,1

I have got in contact with my teacher and she has only said that is has been stolen and nothing else to her other classes. She told me she is not trying too hard because she wasn't a witness. I have signed an incident report at the lost and found and they said that I should just wait.

45,"Hey guys, first post. I’ll cut to the chase with this one (or at least try, lol). So, back in December I gave birth to my first child. I’m 21 y/o., still in college, and had to move back home once I found out I was pregnant in school. I turned my life around for the better once I found out. I got a new job and finally got my license and was excited to start driving. I’ve never had my own car, and the one I used to use was my mothers but it eventually got repoed because she missed a lot  of payments on it (she’s not really good with finances...at all). Because of this, I was stuck riding the train and bus to school, work, etc. while pregnant. Now don’t get me wrong, there’s nothing wrong with riding public transportation, but I’ve done it for years and I’m really not a fan of it, and especially wasn’t a fan while I was pregnant. I promised myself that I would get a car so that my child wouldn’t have to experience being on public transportation at such a young age (I have my personal reservations about this, and I’ve made this abundantly clear to my mother).  Anyway now that tax time is around, I realized I’m going to get *way* more than I usually do this time of year (even though I knew I would get more, just not this much more). I made the mistake of telling my mother how much I would be receiving and then eventually told her my plans for the money which involved the car. She’s very against it, and thinks I should keep relying on public transportation. Her opinion is fine, but I can’t help but think there’s an underlying motive to it. In the past my mom has asked me for money and always takes months to pay me back. She knows I’ll give it to her because come on, she’s my mom and I love her to death and would do anything for her considering all she’s done for me, especially in the last year with me being pregnant and all. Basically what I’m saying is, I feel like she doesn’t want me to get the car because she wants me as a type of “back up” just in case she needs to borrow a large amount of money. Another reason I think this is once I told her about my plans for the money she said “don’t forget about your mama” in a joking (but not so much joking, ya know) tone. Also, I’ve figured that if I don’t get the car now, it’ll be next to impossible for me to get it at any other time of the year, considering what I get paid and then factoring in bills, childcare, things for my child, etc. . Anyway, what do you guys think? I feel horrible for thinking this but I can’t help it. So much for keeping it short and sweet.

50,"Background Info: I am a director of a children’s program at a small nonprofit. My co director, James is the director of other programs within the nonprofit. His father in law, Jude recently joined our board of directors. I have no problem with this and think he will be a great addition to the board.

The issue I need advice on: Jude was going to bring by treats for the staff, but he didn’t show up when he was supposed to. I asked James if he knew when he was going to come in front of another staff member. James said no, he didn’t know when Jude was coming in. Later, after it was just James and I in the building, James said not to call Jude his father in law in front of staff. He wants to keep it super professional, and that Jude joined the board because he was interested in the work we do, not because of him. James was a little rude in saying this. I said ok that’s fine, I won’t say it again. But after thinking about it, I don’t see the big deal in staff knowing Jude is related to James. I think it would be a bigger deal for staff to find out later. It would seem like they are hiding something. What do you guys think? Should I broach this with James or just leave it be?",06Feb2020,1
51,"So a week ago I gave a girl my number who I'd like to get to know better, however she hasn't shot me a text or anything. I figured that she wasn't interested or whatever. However today she walked by in the hall real quick, but said hi before she did. I had reason to believe that her parents took her phone away, but that's just speculation. I told myself that despite it being a possibility, I shouldn't jump to that conclusion and just assume she wasn't interested. Now ik all she said was hi, but I feel like I wouldn't acknowledge a person that likes me, that I don't feel mutual about unless I'd have to. Idk I'm probably looking too much into it and just trying to find hope. I feel like it's better just to leave her alone, if she isn't interested at all, me talking to her in person would be awkward for her. Thoughts?

52,"Alright so I love my friends, I'd do anything for them and they'd do the same for me.

I love them as family. 

But one of my friends is something else, she is unavailable, I respect her greatly and value her as a friend, but my heart burns when I think of her.

Sometimes I manage to change my hearts mind, but it doesn't last long.

Like I say she's my friend and I enjoy that, why can't I just be happy with that?

How do I kill this burning love?

Its irrational, she has a boyfriend, she lives a very different life to me yet my stupid fucking heart desires her love.

I can't even articulate why I love her, it's like a spell has been cast, it is beyond reason.

All I know is if I tell her how I feel it'll hurt us both, if she feels the same way and cheats or leaves her bf that'd make an extremely unhealthy relationship, if she doesn't feel the same way she would likely end our friendship, which I just couldn't risk as I value the friendship so much.

Was on my way back to work where I teach marital arts classes to unload the car from all our equipment and we passed someone giving CPR to a man on the street. I made a u turn straight away and parked up and we ran over to help. There was a other lady who was on the phone to the ambulance service.

The guy must of been in his 20's, I'm not too sure how he died, suicide or accident, he was at the bottom of a 5 storey parking lot and a building with scaffolding on it. Not too sure which one he fell from but he must of died on impact. His leg was broken badly and he had blood coming from his mouth. He was completely unresponsive.

4 ambulances and a rapid response car arrived as well 5 police cars. They gave him cpr, adrenaline, defibbed him but he didn't stand a chance.

56,So about two months and some days ago I broke up with my long term girlfriend and having been struggling to get back on my feet mentally ever since. I go to school 4 days a week and work 5 so I have not had a lot of time to focus on myself and doing things that would put me on a better path emotionally. I nearly had a breakdown at work today and that’s what put the idea of taking a break for my own sanity.

It’s (insert #) o’clock on (insert day of week). He would seemingly be saying this to himself, as if he was annoyed that I wasn’t already up (I don’t think he knew that I was laying awake in bed). First, if he has a problem with me, why doesn’t he speak to me directly? Second, why would he care?

College might be my only way to get into Hollywood, or at least the only way I can think of. I wouldn’t mind leaving college halfway through if I get a start at my career.

Well, my mother didn't take any of that, and now my grandma is evicted too. The shitty part is, my grandma does not even have her car and shes expected to be out by tonight. She literally has nowhere to go and no money for a hotel; my mom kicked her out immediately with no notice.

If I try to talk to my mom about this, she'll kick me out too. It's happened before.

60,"I'm at one of my Meetup events right after the new year starts, and this girl walks into the establishment to meet up with the group for the first time.  She's pretty, she's outgoing, she's smart, she's got a good sense of humor, and she seamlessly fits right in with the group.  Through indirect conversation (translation: listening to her telling other people), I find out things like where's she's from originally, she's a vegetarian, etc.  You can tell, though, that she takes an immediate liking to one of the guys in the group, and this guy has become one of my better friends since my move.

Now, this girl and my friend are just about the same age.  They have similar interests inside and outside of the group we are all a part of.  They have even hung out at ""unofficial Meetups"" with other people.  My friend is kind of an awkward, goofy nerd-type, but very outgoing and not totally unattractive.  Despite knowing him for only six months, I would say that he's not the type to go out of his way to flirt with every pretty girl he sees (translation: not a playboy - I should talk; I'm far from being one).  In fact, I had never seen him even attempt this in the times I have hung out with him.  And yet, this pretty girl with his same interests and same sense of humor just walks through the door.  In baseball terms, he got a hanging curveball right over the middle of the plate without having to do anything.  In layman's terms, fate just dropped the perfect girl for him right into his lap, metaphorically speaking.  It even took him a few weeks to ask her out despite the obvious chemistry (including her flirting with him), and I'm not even sure if that's exactly how it happened.

Me on the other hand?   I went to another Meetup just because she was going to it - didn't go well from my perspective (thanks, awkwardness!!).  I went to her birthday gathering last week - for the most part, it went worse (awkwardness strikes again! - I'm not good in party-type situations).  I'm 8 1/2 years older than her, which I know is a little bit of a gap.  We have very little in common - I like Disney Parks, sports, certain TV shows; she.....does not.  I believe (not definite) that she has a lot of other people's phone numbers (male and female) from the group and these events, yet I do not after a month of hanging out in groups on and off.  So, clearly, we're not really close friends.  I don't even think we share the same beliefs in some of the other aspects of life.  **We're.  Not.  Compatible.**

And yet...I can't shake it.  I have told myself over and over and over again that she gravitated to the right guy.  Her and my friend are totally compatible, and I'm happy my friend has found someone to share his goofiness and nerdiness for some things.  They just started dating, and I want them to continue.  I know that if it doesn't work out for them, I can't just swoop in because A) she doesn't like me in that way *at all -* if she even considers me a friend and B) it would probably fracture friendships and/or future group gatherings.

But yet, it's all I think about.  When I wake up, when I'm playing a game on my phone, etc.  I'm not working right now, so I go walking 6+ miles every day in order to not be sitting in my apartment all of the time.  Maybe it's because I'm alone with my thoughts for these 2+ hours each day while walking; this might be why I keep rehashing things.  I keep telling myself to let it go.  Accept it.  Be happy for them.  Hold out hope that the same thing will happen to me at some point.  Hold out hope that a girl closer to my age that shares *my* interests will walk through that door or show up to another event or something.

It's not like she flirted with me and I was oblivious, or that she liked me but someone beat me to it.  I'm playing a game I was losing from the start, a game I had ZERO shot at winning, a situation where coming out on the short end was a given from the start.  I'm lamenting over this like I lost a long-term girlfriend, while the exact opposite is true.  It's getting better as time passes, but I still think about it daily.  I know my feelings will come back when we are all in future meetups, despite all of the above on why it wouldn't work.

**Why can't I let it go?!**

TL:DR; a girl I feel an attraction towards is quite a bit younger than me, we have very little in common, and we're just barely casual acquaintances.  We are not compatible and I know that if I was lucky enough to date her, it probably wouldn't work out.  She is instead dating one of my good friends who she took an immediate liking towards and with whom she shares a LOT in common.  I'm happy for my friend.  And yet, I can't let it go.  It's all I think about.",06Feb2020,1

I'm pretty sure most people don't even think I exist. I'm really nerdy, just today I picked up ""Capitalism without Capital"" from the local library. I listen to Peter Zeihan(I think he wrong about a lot of things I'm not just a mindless drone) and Industry 4.0 about emerging economic trends. I fucking hate that about me.

I keep up on her doctors appointments, asking how it went and what not. I wish her luck on interviews, and follow up on how they went. I keep track of her personal issues and follow up on them. I'm always offering to help, going as far as decorating her house this Christmas because she had hip surgery. I went with her two hours away for all of her pre-op appointments, and helped take care of her post surgery. But I've noticed now it's a very one sided friendship. She never asks what's going on with me and I can't bring it up because something is always going on with her and doing so would just make her say I'm making things about myself. When I said I wanted to go to school she literally encouraged me not to, I told her I had an entrance exam and she never wished me luck or followed up.

I feel unappreciated and I've been making a genuine effort to be a good friend. Now she wants to act like besties, but she has no idea, and seemingly no desire to know what's going on in my life. Should I pull back? Am I doing something wrong?",06Feb2020,1

Our teacher does a curve where he take the highest score and raises that to 100 and raises everyone else proportionately. This student straight up searched the question on google and got an 80 while the vast majority of the class scored 50 and below, including me. This means we are all getting a 70 at most and we can do nothing about it.  There are 2 problems: this guy is my friend and I’ve already jokingly said I was gonna snitch so now if it comes out that the teacher found out, everyone will suspect me. What should I do?

76,"I am double majoring in both Software Engineering and Engineering, two things I am genuinely passionate about. I spend $10 on the gas a day going to school (approx. 160 a month) and I have to pay the truck payment for the car I take to school (it is my father's). I don't have a problem doing this seeing I will use it 100x times more than he would since he only uses it only for taking trash to the dump, which I took the role of since I started driving. I owe $300 in car payments to my dad and spend $300 a month in both gas and insurance. I took up a job at a Taco Bell working as much as I can to pay for this, I just got off a 10-hour shift the other day without a break. 

I have 17 credits this semester and take 2.5 classes online (.5 because one is half online and half in a lab). I have had to learn both MLA and APA format after work and wrote 2, 3-page essays in 2 and 1 hour after work and just barely turned them both in on time with minutes to spare. I have to learn how to use 'pseudocode' for a continuous project in my Intro Programming course, which is surprisingly more difficult for me than actually coding since I am struggling with this and not when I learned some HTML and c++ in my free time in middle school. I have missed 3 chemistry tests because I can't figure out the website I have to use to turn them in or view them in the first place (Canvas). 

When I finish my classes for the day I usually have to head straight to work and get off at 10pm, which is a problem since most classes require assignments to be turned in by 11:59pm. With the only exception being my online chemistry that requires assignments and tests to be turned in by 4:03 and 4:30 pm (randomly switching between these), and I cannot contact my teacher because she never filled out her 'about me' on Canvas with her name and/or email. I have considered working ahead to 'bank' assignments, but a lot of my classes lock their assignments until a certain time and even then I would have to get up at 3-4 am some days to have time to complete the assignments before I inevitably fall asleep due to exhaustion. I have 'crashed' almost everyday this week and woke to panic because I almost overslept or I didn't complete an assignment fully. 

I don't know where a counselor is at my school or even if they can help me at all. My college is really slow with anything and I am locked in a constant struggle with my financial aid department because I should be fully covered by my FAFSA due to my mom's death recently but I keep getting charged up to $6,000. I have other issues that aren't related to school or work, but rather past traumas so I want to see a therapist but I don't have to money for that and I can't use insurance since I am on my father's plan and he is a major cause in a lot of my issues. I have checked with my college and they don't offer and therapy sessions since I heard other colleges have that sort of thing.

When I am home and don't have to worry about work/homework, I have to clean my house, do laundry, do the dishes, and whatever else my dad needs to be done while he is at work. I am falling behind on housework due to my work and school schedule, and I am constantly told I am not doing enough and all the times I relax I should be doing really well in my classes. I am constantly told I am lazy and that when my father was my age he had 2 fulltime jobs so I can't complain about stress, and my future stepmother constantly berates any accomplishments I have by saying she did better or knows someone who did better (for example I scored 1270 on my SAT after having to cram 3 days before the test as my only study time since my schedule was packed with constant chores since I live on a farm. She immediately started telling me how my stepbrother scored 100 higher than me and my other step brother's girlfriend scored 200 higher than me, which turned out to be wrong and I scored 100 higher than both of them. She ignored that and never brought up SAT scores again.) She also says she had 18 credit hours every semester except one where she had 21 (even though she never went fully through with her career) so I can't complain about school.

I am really sorry for the long post, I just recently said 'fuck it' and I am going to hunt down my counselor and see if I can get any extensions on tests/assignments since my schedule is full. The 2 tests I should be working on now were due at 4:03 today, but I ended up oversleeping and I am incredibly sick so I ended up sleeping most of the day. I also have to give a sick puppy medicine and do my younger brother's chores because he is too sick to do them, but doesn't have a fever and is currently playing a video game (just needed to get that out sorry). I have to now catch up on today's chores before the night is up so I don't have 2 days worth of them tomorrow after I get home from work at 11pm.

85,"For context, I’m currently in a committed, monogamous relationship with my partner, D and have been for ~3 years. 

The recipient/cause of my unexpected feelings (let’s call them G) has reconnected with me online and has asked to see me in person.  

G and I have had a spotty history of being spotty, we were both younger when we met and had been casually on-again/off-again, platonic, hyper-emotional and all combinations of the above factors for a few years. Eventually we’d amicably called things off, they’d moved away, gotten into what appeared to be a successful relationship, and we didn’t speak to each other for more than 5 or 6 years and I hadn’t really given any thought to it because I’d felt that I’d moved on. 

Case closed, right? WRONG. 

As it turns out, I apparently still have residual feelings surrounding G. There wasn’t anything special about they way that we were; at the point where we were still seeing each other I never felt as though we were deeply compatible or even that I could see a future with them. I don’t think these feelings are coming from wishing to travel back in time, but I think they’re coming from a place of hope— if G couldn’t have been the person that I wanted them to be at the time, are they now about to admit that by some miracle they’d never lost their feelings and thought that they would search the world in vain if they’d never confessed their undying love for me? Again, highly unlikely, but I can’t shake my feelings about them. 

I love my partner D, we’re stable and happy, and we have detailed, practical plans for a future together. I’m not interested in giving up what I have, but the thought of not knowing what might be feels like it’s trying to swallow me whole.

91,"So I'm 22 and about to transfer to a 4 year college about 45 minutes away. I currently work as a accountant assistant and make a decent buck, have insurance and there is definitely a chance for me to work my way up in this company. I however am not a fan of accounting. I find it tedious and utterly unfulfilling, as well as the people I work with are fairly toxic which is really my biggest issue at the moment. It's not unbearable persay but I am definitely one of those people who sleep walk the week to get to the weekend and dreads going back on Monday.

I work 30 hours and take 12 units currently and my boss already seems frustrated with my lack of hours. And so I see almost no way to make a schedule work where the college is 45 minutes away while keeping my sanity, but I told my mom I'd atleast look into it to see if there would be a way to make it work. 

But the problem is I don't really want it to work, I honestly just kinda want out. My mom says that I will make good money and have everything I need, I say that being happy with my job is important to me to which she replies ""no one is happy with their job"".

She usually ends the conversations with ""its your life do what you want "" which she does truly mean, her and my dad will support me no matter what I decide, I have no doubt about it and I am beyond thankful for that. My dad seems to be more on my side and just usually says ""do what makes you happy""

I see my moms side, I just think she's being a little dramatic. I'm only 22 and working on a finance degree. I'm not planning on joining the circus or anything, but it feels like she thinks I'd be throwing my life away. So I figured I'd look for some outside advice.

92,"I honestly don't know where to start, honestly there's so much to unpack that I'll try my best to do it chronologically. Me and my boyfriend (S) have been dating for over 7 months, but have been friends for almost 4 years. Honestly, he is one of the biggest influences in my life, getting me into a lot of what I am into now! We have had a pretty good relationship, since we had that friendship to build off of. My mom is friends with his, my brother is friends with his. We've been fairly solid and open with each other about everything. S is an all around great person, doesn't do drugs, top of our class, very kind and a great person to be around in general.

So my 2020 has been off to a rough start, my dad decided to leave on January 2nd. I knew this was happening beforehand for a while, but I didn't think it would be so soon.  S has been there for me through it all. Helping me with so much. His birthday was the 14th and the day after we hung out and everything was great and normal. The 16th I see him at school, but I leave early since I had work. Later that night I get a message from his mom off of his phone saying ""S is in big trouble, he is grounded indefinitely, I'll let him call you soon and explain, but right now he is on complete lockdown lol""

I was honestly not thinking about it too hard that night, I would see him at school tomorrow. I did stay up pretty late hoping for a phone call that I never got. He wasn't at school the following day. So I message his mom asking if he was okay. And said ""yeah, he got in trouble over some school work and he got sick last night so I sent him to his dad's."" She then went on a whole over explaining about his phone and why she wasn't responding and such, despite me not messaging on his phone since she did. Monday and Tuesday come and he's still not at school. So I took the initiative to message her once more and ask if I could take a care package up to his dad's house. (something I am known to do when there is something going on) She never responds but comes into my work the next day so I ask her. She said I didn't have to and I'm not too sure if I can go up to his dad's, but she will message me if there was an issue. I snuck a letter in there asking for him to talk to me through a google doc but no response.  Upon arriving, he seemed fine, not a sniffle, fever, or scratchy throat to be seen or heard. I didn't get to see him alone at all since his dad was with us the whole time.

His mom posted a picture of him and his family celebrating him and his sister's birthday. It was a big party and my feelings were hurt I wasn't invited to it, since it was such a big date for him. Last Tuesday my mom messages his mom asking if everything was alright, from both seeing me emotionally sad and knowing I still haven't heard anything. She said they unenrolled him from our school and is taking online courses now to catch up with the school work. She then said I ""went behind her back to see S and went around the rules. She found the letter to the google doc and that she was very upset with me."" Then she said something about the divorce going on with my family that caused an argument between my mom and I. That night, I apologized to S mom about the whole misunderstanding with the care package and owned up about the note. That was January 28th, to this day I haven't heard anything.

We have the same friend group and we all kind of dispersed, processing this all our own ways. It's honestly taking so much of a toll on me. I haven't felt motivated to go anywhere, and I'm generally an active person. I am more concerned about him, I am completely drawn to a blank on what's going on. I honestly do not believe it is school, like I said, he is top of our class, and was taking easy courses this semester. He is not affiliated with any drugs and is fairly against them.

Like alot of work I'm doing is like open-ended, research stuff which we have to implement in the labs since we're general engineers in first year so we don't fully specialize in something. It's really hard to know where to start. I usually try to start at the basics and develop but I just don't know where the basics is. Another annoying part is that I have a huge habit of over-thinking things, over-complicating things and this could easily be me doing that. I just don't know. Most of the time I find myself opening tabs and skimming through them and not understanding anything, and this doesn't just apply to the research, literally anything, I did this when I was trying to figure out my time-table, I opened fucking tabs on tabs, different timetable, different scenarios and at then after like 45 mins, I took a screenshot of my timetable on my app, edited in the things I wanted to do, when they were on and just looked at that and decided this is what I want, this is what I can, I can always switch it up. Simple. I even catch myself doing this and I just can't stop it. My worst fear is that because of this I really fell behind in an assignment last semester which I just bearly got finished and could improve on as god sent an extension on the dead-line as a blessing.",06Feb2020,1
108,"I am a college first year. I have a great group of close friends that I very much want to room with next year. We total 5- but here’s where the problems start. Our university only allows apartments of  4 or 6 people. Us 5 don’t want to be separated at all, so the easy solution is picking a 6th.

The issue is we have 2 candidates. We like both, but after a very lengthy discussion, We have decided to go for roommate candidate A over B for irrelevant reasons. So here’s the problem: candidate B is a very nice person, he just fits less in our group in general. We have no idea how to break it to him, but we want to do it as soon as possible. We also want to emphasize the fact that he’s always welcome there, it’s just not going to work on paper as well as candidate A. We don’t have any idea how to go about it and we’re super nervous cause we don’t want to be jerks about it, but there’s no kind way to do it.

We need advice. Would my fellow redditors be able to help us break it to candidate B while still being civil and making it not horrible on ourselves as well as him?

TL;DR : We need to tell a possible roommate candidate that we don’t want to room with him as much as another candidate, but have no idea how to do it without being assholes about it.",06Feb2020,1
109,"So for a couple months now I have liked this girl and I was almost certain with the way she acted that she liked me back. Keep in mind this was nothing big and I never showed many signs since I had a terrible fear of being rejected. So I would just do things friends did we occasionally walked together sat by each other at lunch and nothing much more. We had always been mutual friends for a while now. 

Then all of a sudden this week she just started hating me, and I don't mean just not talking to me or making a few rude comments. I mean she legitimately told her twin sister (who to me) that I was following her and that she doesn't want to walk or sit near me anymore.

111,"I have a beagle/schnauzer pup. He is a year and a half old now. I got him when he was six months. I, also, have an Australian shepherd/border collie who is 13, whom I got when he was 2 months old. 

The younger dog has always been dog reactive. For the most part he was okay with my older dog. There was one time about a year ago, right after I moved into my house that the younger dog lashed out at my older dog. The younger dog was under my desk with a bone. The older dog came into the office and got in the younger dogs face and a small fight broke out. Neither dog was hurt and they were separated. We try to keep the younger dog out of these situations. However, when I moved into my house a year ago, I had the younger dog with me outside on his chain. The neighbor didn't have their dog on a leash and the dog came running into my yard and got in my dogs face. I had to pick up my dog to try to keep them both safe. The neighbor's dog looked like a lab or something. It was probablyabout 60 pounds. My dog is 17 pounds. My neighbor was like ""my dog is friendly. It's okay,"" and I had to explain that mine wasn't. The neighbor took his time in getting his dog. 

A couple months later, when I had the money, I put my dog in puppy training. He was doing really  great and was not nearly as dog reactive as when I first got him. The classes ended around July. Then, around August of 2019, I was getting the dogs ready to go pick up my fiance from work. I had them on their leashes on the porch, and was locking up the doors. Next thing I know, this pit bull looking dog comes jumping out of a car window at my dogs and comes up on my porch. My younger dog went nuts and has been dog reactive since and seems to have forgotten everything he learned in training. 

We (my fiance and I) were stupid. We ended up adopting a kitten in October. She is now 6 months old. Ever since then, the older dog is acting more childish. I understand it. I brought in another young animal and he is jealous. I try to show him the same amount of love and support as before the kitten was in the house. However, this is causing him to get into the younger dogs face more. If the younger dog has a bone or toy, the older dog must have it. I try to give them each their own, but it doesn't matter. The younger dog does the same thing. They tend to flip bones and toys a lot. It's kind of funny to watch, until the younger dog is done.

Recently, though, I have been having to send my 13 year old dog (started around December) to my mom's house because I live in a three story house. He has been having issues with the stairs. He always had hip issues, but the stairs are making things worse for him. He struggles getting upstairs and about a week or two ago, he fell down about 6 steps. He, also, limps a lot because the cold is messing with his hips. He is still active and still does okay ortherwise. The stairs are just proving to be an issue for him. This is why I send him to my mom's house. She lives in a single floor home, so it makes sense to send him there. Plus, I know he is safe. He grew up with my mom and knows her. Normally, he was only gone for maybe a day or two, just to give him a rest with the stairs. However, after his fall, he has been gone more. I worry about him falling again and getting severely hurt.

Now, a new problem is arising whenever my older dog comes home. The younger dog, due to being the only dog most of the time for the last week or two, is getting even more possessive. Now, he is being possessive over the couch and people.  Tonight, the older dog went towards someone sitting on the couch and the younger dog began snarling and snapping at the older dog. We got them separated and each calmed down. Most times the younger dog just bares his teeth and growls and we are able to separate them right away. Tonight was a little worse (neither dog got hurt) only because the older dog didn't back up when the younger dog started lashing out and the younger dog didn't stop until I picked him up and took him to his kennel (he is kennel trained). 

I am coming to my whits end with the younger dog. He doesn't know when to stop playing (this resulted in a fight a couple days ago (again, neither dog hurt). Like, the younger dog cares for the older dog. After the fight, the younger dog went and comforted the older dog. Then, tried to start playing again with the older dog. The older dog was having none of it, and the younger dog finally stopped. I am not sure how to stop the possessive behavior or how to get the younger dog to understand when play time is over. I plan on putting him back in classes, but that will be at least a month before I have the money. I feel like an asshole because I sent my older dog to live with my mom for a while. I worry about his safety around the younger dog and I don't want either of them to get hurt. I wish he was here, but until the younger dog learns and/or stops, I worry about the older dog. I would have sent the younger dog away, but my mom has a cat that is an asshole. She hates literally every living thing, except my mom and older dog (she grew up with the older dog. We got her when she was about 2 months and she is 10 now). If I had known a year ago that things would be like this, I wouldn't have kept the younger dog. Now, I feel horrible for my older dog and wonder if I am doing the right thing by sending him to my mom'son a more full time basis? I have thought about rehoming the younger dog, but I also want to try training again. Would training help, or is the younger dog a lost cause? I love the dog and he is, overall, a good boy. I just want to do what is best for him and the other animals. (I may not be able to get him into classes until about the first week in May. I work full time ((from home)) and go to school full time. My fiance, also, works now two jobs and goes to school full time. Plus, she doesn't drive, so she can't get him to classes)",06Feb2020,1

116,"I need some advice on what my boyfriend (29)  should do about one of his new coworkers. He works for a small public accounting firm and he frequently goes out to clients in the area to review financial statements. Recently the firm he works for hired a new employee as a staff accountant (he’s a senior accountant). Since he is new, he frequently goes to these clients with him so he can learn about what they need to complete while they are out of the office. 

Since this new employee has started my bf has been describing some behaviors that his coworker does. From these behaviors, we deduced he is mostly on the spectrum for autism. Of course this is a nonissue, I just have my masters in counseling so he knows I have knowledge about different disorders and such so we discuss it. 

One of the things he noticed about his coworker is that while they are at a clients office, the coworker openly farts in front of him. He can visibly see him lifting his leg and a toot comes out. He does not say excuse me or anything just keeps tooting on. 

My bf is not quite sure on how to handle this considering all that is listed above. He is trying to ignore this behavior but he is finding it hard to do so My bf is genuinely a kind person so he is very hesitant to hurt ones feelings or rat people out to his directors.  I find it hard to give him advice because 1. He doesn’t listen to me and 2. I am not sure how to handle situations in the corporate world.

123,"So I started high school this September. I won't name my school, but my mother has worked there for a few years and was telling me about an I-STEM program they had in the works. Being interested in I-STEM, I decided that I wanted to try it out. I applied, and got accepted into the very first class. Expecting great things, I put all of my faith in this school's system, and it's starting to get a bit worrying. For the entirety of the first semester, we only learned pre-algebra from our math class. We did a few activities in geo, but nothing was really learned. Science was totally bogus; i think the students know more than our teacher does. So now, with semester 2 beginning this week, I took a look back and realized the lack of things I learned from the past semester. I did expect some time to be taken up from projects, as it is a problem-based learning structure. But it seems we're spending time doing useless things that benefit nobody. I'm trying to stay optimistic, but 2 out of 115 students have left already and my friends are starting to complain to the teachers. I know my feedback helps, but I'm worried that I won;t have the knowledge to pursue my ideal career path is I continue on with this program. If I leave, I won't be let back in, as the program's structure bases learning on knowledge from the previous year. I have an alternative high school to go to, so what should I do? Should I leave for the alternative school? Should I wait it out another year and see what happens?",06Feb2020,1

He owns different businesses and she was hired to help keep the books a few months ago.

They left work in his truck since it was slow today and he had work errands to run, so he asked if she wanted to tag along. She said something in her gut felt a little off, but she shook it off as not a big deal and went. After a few errands, he took her out to his house to ""get some things."" He showed her the barn with his animals and at that point grabbed her hips and kept coming onto her. He asked if she wanted to get in the hot tub and go to his room. 

She kept saying no and backing away, saying ""I couldn't do that to Mandy and you're my boss. It's not right."" Mandy is his long term girlfriend. 
He tells her,""I'm not your boss right now."" He grabbed her breast and even tried to lift her shirt up. Eventually he stopped, they left, and he acted like nothing happened. She did too. She got in her car after getting back to work and went home. 

I'm angry and sad for her. She's a single mom with two kids. The bread winner. She won't just quit tomorrow. She said she's got to act like nothing happened. I hate that. He is an asshole who put her in a shitty position.

My question is what can I say or do to help? I live 30 minutes away. We both live in small towns, so her area isn't flooding with job  opportunities. Our area is rural.

I was pretty thrown off because I thought he liked me based off how he acted towards me and now I’m just really confused.

130,"Hello everyone!

So... title says it all. But there’s a catch and I guess I should say why I’m even questioning whether or not I should accept it.  I told my office manager today that I may be leaving starting March 2nd (start date for Tesla job). 



My current situation-
I make about $26/hour and I’ve had my current job for 2 years (2 years this week). Last year, I made about $60k+ due to the constant overtime at my current job. My office manager has told me I’ve reached “the cap” for my position (which is $25). Since January, I’ve been working morning shifts (they needed someone in the morning) and it has taken a toll on my gas since I’ve been driving through traffic. 

Now, my job is in construction (project management/office stuff, not field stuff though that would be kind of cool). I became a valuable asset pretty fast and took a senior position. Insurance people and other vendors knew me by name and some only specifically asks for me and only wants me. 

The benefits are fine. HOWEVER! It is highly stressful and toxic. All the time. The toxicity has died down but it’s still in the air. I’ve told my manager time and time again that it’s THERE but he’s literally never here to know what I’m talking about. And when the toxicity/manipulation happens, he’s not there to witness it. 

ANYWAY! The overtime then becomes expected and not appreciated (because they know we depend on the overtime AND there is always genuinely so much work to do). On top of my main job, I am responsible for screening and answering phones and emails (and oh boy, those go on throughout the day and completely detracts me from doing my MAIN job). 

My office manager is also never there and we are severely under staffed (as in, I easily do work that should be split between 3 people).  Example- he’s scheduled a certain time and he shows up way later, or leaves in the middle of the shift and never comes back. 

He has done some fucked up things that I guess is just part of the nepotism. For instance, my sister flew in from Japan and I haven’t seen her for a whole year. I barely had time to spend time with her since I was at work. It was whatever. BUT THEN! My officer manager’s mom was in town and guess what he got to do the whole time she was here? Yeah, it was really messed up.

Another recent example - last week, I pulled a double shift (8am to 7:30pm). He was supposed to come back. He did around 5:30 pm, saw that I was there, and left immediately when he realized I was going to stay (he was supposed to come back to help my coworker/friend close). 

Aside from the stupid, petty, toxic, manipulative shit, overall, my current job has been fair with me and, though they’ve given me a lot of raises the last two years (I went from $15-$26 in 2 years. I know - it’s unheard of) I’ve been here, I feel trapped in a sense that I now am scared to go somewhere else because they are paying me at such a high rate that not a lot of companies can match. 

A good example is my situation right now with Tesla and I truly believe they do this to trap their employees. 

It has gotten to the point that I just don’t think the pay is worth it.  This job has made me stressed out to the point that I would take my anger and stress at home to my boyfriend. I stopped weightlifting. I just stopped doing things I used to do because my job consumed me. I’ve literally seen almost a DOZEN people get fired or quit/leave during my two years... 


Tesla’s offer-
The recruiter originally offered $20/hr. I asked for a few more thinking I would get shot down. Today, the recruiter got back to me and the hiring managers offered $22.80. 

The benefits are great and they start at Day 1 .  I would also own $10,000 Tesla stock and it’s 100% mine after 4 years (or 25% every year). This job is literally less than 5 miles from me (back roads, I won’t have to deal with traffic at all). Work hours are flexible and reasonable and are not insane (with my current job, I worked 11:00 am to AT LEAST 7:30 pm everyday).  They said I can work starting at 6:00 am or 7:00 am. One of the hiring managers also said that he has a short leash on the department I applied for and is open to remote work and overtime is approved as needed. 

I would only do and focus on ONE job (in my current job, my responsibilities were frequently overwhelming and just not realistic for one person to accomplish). 

It seems like they really want me and I’m scared to take this leap mainly because of the pay cut an difference.  If I didn’t have this much debt (at least $20,000), I wouldn’t be so hesitant. Also, my apartment is expensive as fuck ($2000+) alone and my bf isn’t making as much as me so I carry a lot of the financial weight..

There’s a lot that I left out but, idk man, should I take a leap of faith and accept Tesla’s offer? Should I grind these next few months (save as much, etc), and hope that the job mobility/pay is there and it’ll be worth it?

I did offer my office manager to work partyinr just to help them transition and then, later on, work remotely. This way, I can attempt to bridge the pay difference, plus, I know they need me more than I need them. My job isn’t a “cookie cutter” job and it takes a specific person with a specific personality and work ethic to do it. 

There’s a part of me that wants to say ffffuccckkk it and just leave them on their own and enjoy a more relaxed, focused, job culture. 

TL;DR - Got offered a job at Tesla but would take a somewhat significant pay cut. Should I take the offer to escape my high stress, toxic work environment that pays me significantly more? My boyfriend is extremely supportive and knows also that I need to GTFO of my current job.",06Feb2020,1

133,"o I started a geography class this new year, and theres a girl in it that I thought was quite cute. First week of class, I sat a couple rows back and noticed she was sitting by herself. So the following week I sat at the same table with her and, slowly, we started to open up.

At first I thought she was really shy, but turns out shes just very quiet and is actually pretty open. It took us a couple classes to begin talking more, and specifically this week we did so quite a bit. She is really easy to talk to, and after class ends we are slower to pack up as everyone leaves, eventually we leave together and chit-chat as we make our way to the front doors of the college. 

This is pretty normal as we've done this the last few classes. Except, today I ask her if she'd like to study together at the campus to prepare for our midterm next week. She declines, saying: ""No, thanks. I think ill just study by myself"" Then we said our goodbyes ""see you next week"" and that was it.

I was a bit taken aback, because I was fairly confident that she would say yes. (Which is pretty abnormal for me, because usually I'm pretty uncertain when it comes to these situations.)

I did kind of blurt it out last second as we were at the doors where we split up. And there was a rush of people trying to get outside, so Im hoping It was maybe because I kind of caught her off guard or something..? (Also she doesn't have her own vehicle and takes transit to school, so maybe its difficult for her to get here)

Anyways, it wasn't like a rejection, she just simply said she would rather study by herself. Which is fair enough.

Is this girl simply not interested in me? Sure we were friendly towards each other but that's never always a sign she's interested. Also not everyone is joining classes to meet people.

136,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I already know what the vast majority will say so I guess I’m just posting for my own peace of mind. Anyways I’m one of five siblings. We grew up separated and each had our own forms of abuse, physical and otherwise. My mom and her sister were raped and abused by their birth father and the history of abuse is rooted deeply within our family. I was also abused at a young age by a cousin and so was one of my siblings, guess we’ll call this sibling “Chad”. Chad was the best person I had ever known and all of us in the family looked up to Chad and it appeared that he had everything together. Chad had a seemingly perfect marriage, a family he would work tirelessly for and always seemed to have the answers to everything. That was until three years ago Chad tried to kill himself. I wish I could say that was as deep as this goes... but it’s not. Chad opened up to us after his suicide attempt. Chad was also abused, terribly so. That isn’t my point though. The greater truth that we discovered, without going into detail, was that Chad was a pedophile. I have a child myself. I always thought of pedophiles as the absolute scum of the earth and should die or have their dicks chopped off.. but now that it’s my own sibling those convictions are wavering. I guess this isn’t a morale problem at all because I know I should tell the police. I just can’t. And I feel like I’m losing my soul if I do and losing my soul if I don’t. I wish I never knew but even more I wish it never happened.

139,"So, a bit of backstory. i got together with my bf about 3 weeks ago, and we we're already pretty close before we got together. We've already told each other that we love each other, and we know a lot about the other's personal life issues. He's the first guy I've truly loved, but I'm worried he doesn't like me the same way. I know he liked me and my bestie for a bit, but he doesn't like her anymore. On a discord group chat, he linked something to his reddit. I saw it, and it was a cute post about how we got together. I started scrolling to things that he's commented on other posts, and I stumbled upon something that kinda made me suspicious. It was a post of him asking for advice, and he said that he's liked a girl for 1 and 3/4 years, but her standards are too high. The post talked about how he has been trying to change and become a better person to meet her standards, and he asked for advice on what he should do. He said it was pretty obvious that he liked her, and everyone could tell, which described my bestie perfectly. The only reply was from someone saying that they also had crushes on people they could never get together with, but this person started looking at other girls, and got together with a girl that was his friend. The advice was basically to look at other girls. This was posted about a month ago, or a week before he asked me to be his gf. The only issue is that when I played t or d with him about a week ago, and I asked him when he realized he started liking me, and he said he liked me for a while, but only realized it a week before he asked me.

I don't know why I feel a bit hurt, but I don't want to ask him about it because I don't want to create tension, and I don't want to accuse my bestie because none of this is her fault. I guess I feel like I'm the back-up and that he thinks my standards aren't as high as my bestie. What do I do? Do I ask him about it, or do I just ignore it?? I don't want to be a back-up because he couldn't get my bestie. He literally taught me a new definition of love, as I was always so scared of it, and now I'm unsure what to do because I don't know if this means he loves me back or not?",06Feb2020,1

The first time they came it was an issue with the water pump that distributes water through the washer. They replaced the pump no questions asked. The second time they came it was a clogged hose preventing the water from draining again, no questions asked.

Both times a hefty amount of blue lint and dark brown hair from my girlfriend were removed from the washer. Tonight after coming home from work we received a message on our door stating that we need to not wash sheets or pet bedding due to pet hair causing clogs. We do have two orange cats, but as stated above both times large chunks of blue lint and human hair were causing the clog. They’ve threatened that the next time they’re called for the same issue, if any parts are damaged, we will be paying for a brand new washer/dryer.

151,"So for about a year now my sister has been seriously ill. It's not like she's in danger of dying or anything, but it has been severely impacting her life. She has severe chronic pain, digestive issues, and  anxiety/depression; in my understanding, that is. My parents don't really tell me much about this stuff,  only what to do if she has a bad day.

I just hate how I'm feeling right now. I'm frustrated because I want my sister to be happy, and it's stressful to see her in pain every day and not being able to do anything about it. At the same time, I feel guilty that I'm not doing enough. My parents are always asking me to do more around the house to help, and I know I could be doing more, but I'm not and I hate it. It won't kill me to take out the trash or do the dishes once in awhile, and I know that, and I know that I'll feel good about myself for doing it afterwards, but when it comes to it I always end up making excuses. 

I hate how it's affecting my family. My mom is a published author, and writing is what she loves most, but because she's taking care of my sister all the time she hardly ever has time for it. Every time I catch a glimpse of her life that I usually don't see, I always think that I should be doing more, that I can make things better for her, but I haven't. I know there's only so much I can do, but I'm fifteen! I'll be an adult in three years, I should at least be able to do something! Then there's my dad, he's been dealing with my sister while also dealing with a 2-year-long crisis at his work. he's always so tense and unhappy, and when he's had a bad day he starts yelling at us, mostly about stupid things like cleaning up clutter.

160,"I'm training a new team lead to do basically my current job. I'm not bitter about this, it is not an issue for me. I have a great development plan between myself and my production supervisor. I just went to the production supervisor about our team lead not wanting to learn new things from me and take responsibility, basically having me run the team for him. She just addressed these points with him yesterday.

The new team lead tried to take more responsibility today. Unfortunately, he has an issue where he cares more about how people think of him, than of how he does the job. When I give him a chance to make a decision between a certain customer complaint, vs ""bothering"" a coworker in another department-- he always chooses to risk customer complaint. I figured fine, he'll have to take the fall for those decisions in a couple weeks.

Today, he decided to not make a very quick call and very slightly inconvenience our maintenance department..... to make a decision that is \*massively\* against our company's rules. We work in RMS. The biosecurity of our department is crucial. He made decisions that repeatedly violated the biosecurity of our department, even with me letting him know about the policy of biosecurity for our department. A contamination of our department loses jobs, customers, is a point toward getting our site shut down, and to get our department running again is literally a multimillion dollar task. He risked that to avoid a one minute phone call, and some bitching and moaning from maintenance.

In reality--- I'm sure no serious contamination happened. Maybe we have slightly more salmonella in the room or something but probably nothing significant. I have worked at this company for several years and management has always been impressed by my ability to solve issues on my own and train people. Reporting this new group lead was my first time ever in giving management negative feedback about an interpersonal issue. I'm worried about giving myself a new bad image as a ""tattletale"" or ""petty"" to management over this person, who I'm totally fine training to do my job, I was JUST in my supervisors office about him.

Should I risk my own reputation as someone self-sufficient and good and managing people to whine about this guy again?

My question is: “albeit drawn out”

  I met this girl over the weekend. Total knock out, funny, confident and intelligent. A bombshell in other words. 
I try not to judge but drugs are bad in my area, so after enough bad relationships you pick up the heebie geebies from anyone that uses harder hitting drugs outside of social settings. 

During the exploration phase we are currently in, she very much up front let’s me know, she has a semi regular cocaine usage. Most everyday, if not every other day so I’m told, which honestly just makes me think it’s an everyday throughout the day habit. She’s got some of the warning signs of a habitual user, but not the signs of someone in too deep as of yet. 

  I worry I will fall deeper into a romance with this woman clearly over looking what I see as a red flag, because of her many other attractive qualities. 

I feel I’d be overstepping my current place in “ our early romance”  if I said I didn’t like her using it outside of social settings. We’ve not been talking long enough for my opinion to really matter at this point anyways. 

I want to be honest, but I’m not sure of the timing or if I’m being a hypocrite because of my daily marijuana usage.

165,"So I have diagnosed GAD and chronic depression, which I’ve been on medication for since April 2019 (citalopram). 

 I won’t go into details but it stemmed from the break up of a controlling relationship where he wouldn’t let me drink or socialise with friends.  I have also recently been pre diagnosed for ME, as it takes a while to confirm.

Since that point I felt my drinking getting out of control, initially I thought it was a ‘freedom’ response to the relationship and enjoying being the life and soul of the party. But in the latter half of 2019 I was averaging a bottle of wine an evening. I have put on a lot of weight, made bad decisions, let my health suffer - and and this is both when drinking at home alone and out with colleagues and friends. My job is very social and involves a lot of drinks and dinners out with clients and well as team mates, it’s always expected people will drink on these occasions, but this isn’t the driver for my bad drinking as is only a couple of times a month normally. 

Since New Years I have tried to make a positive change and have reduced to two or three bottles a week maximum, usually this is always on the same days as I cannot have one glass, so always drink the whole bottle when I open one. My weight is still an issue- I’m 170 pounds which doesn’t sound extreme, but I’m 28 and have previously never been above 135 pounds and have put on over 2 stone in a year. I’m sure the drinking has had a huge part to play on this. 

I’m asking for advice as to how I can help myself in this situation and to make steps for myself to be healthier and happier?

174,"To start off, I’m on mobile- mandatory apology. 

I’m freshly 18 and ever since I was young, I’ve had issues with strep throat and tonsillitis. It typically happens once a year and I handle it pretty well. I’m amazed my mom never made the choice to have my tonsils removed when I was a child. My cousin is a medical professional and she said I’m going through another bout of tonsillitis. 

I come from an actual middle class family, so money isn’t always there. Over the summer I had a really bad spell of it and luckily (I was a nanny at the time) I could still work my job while I was sick. It went on for about 3 weeks and I ended up having to take a break from my two jobs for about 2 of them, and ultimately lost one of them during my absence. 

After my cousin told me I should go to an ENT and seriously consider getting my tonsils removed, I informed my mom who looked me dead in the eyes and asked if I had the money to do so. We have insurance, the co-pay for just visiting an ENT would be about $50, and I know that removing my tonsils would cost anywhere from 2k-5k. This would absolutely drain what little savings I have finally managed to build up. My mother and I fought about it and she wrapped up the argument by saying I have more money than she does.

I’m worried if I don’t get them removed my sick spells will only get worse. I’ve also heard the older you are, the longer it takes for you to heal after getting them removed. If I pay for everything I can’t manage to miss work for that long and take the risk of losing my job due to the healing process.

179,"So I live on the bottom floor of a house and I have 1 upstairs neighbor who has a small dog. I've been wanting to report her for animal abuse for a while now but I'm really afraid to do it, because even if I report it anonymously she is going to figure out it was me. 

Here's the info I have. Basically whenever she is home the dog is in a cage next to her stairwell and the poor thing cries pretty much non stop (and drives me insane but that's not the main point). I've seen the cage and it's the smallest possible thing she could keep this dog in, no blanket or anything, and there's most likely no heat in that part of the house and I live in a northeastern state. She let's the dog out and seems like occasionally she let's him upstairs with her, but 75% of the time she keeps him in a tiny cage with no human contact except when she periodically yells at him to shut up. The dog is always disgusting, she clearly doesnt bathe him or take care of him at all, and the worst part is I've heard her talk about kicking and hitting the dog and it had a limp for a while that she probably never got fixed properly. 

My options seem to be 1) report it anonymously, but she will know it's me because how else would anyone know these things? The reason I'm scared is because she seems to be an aggressive, abusive nutcase and who knows what she'll do if she knows I reported her, I have cats and I fear her doing something crazy. 2) tell my landlord who I am friendly with and ask her to say something or possibly report it for me, but this pretty much presents the same problem.

If anybody who is familiar with animal abuse and can offer any other tips that would be much appreciated. I also wonder if what I have is even enough to qualify as animal abuse, I have no way to prove what I overheard her say but the tiny cage and the fact she keeps it in the cold for long periods of time seems like enough",06Feb2020,1

There’s a few things I’m a little bit worried about:

1. My biggest issue is changing a resident with a colostomy bag. She is particularly feisty and (no offense to anyone) the sight of it is not very pleasant. In fact it’s really gross to deal with. The smell is really bad and the thought of having to do it every day is kind of stressing me out.

2. The residents are mostly incontinent (meaning they wear depends and have pee pads) and a lot of times they poop all over themselves without saying anything. Poop doesn’t freak me out too too much but it is really nasty. 

3. I’m 5’8 about 125-130 pounds and before this job I had a 2.5 year desk job so I’m not as strong as I’d like to be, so picking them up and moving them is hard. 

4. They can get annoyed and combative and hit you.

It crushed her, not only cause that was her boyfriend and she loved him but because her family tried to “water it down” and not tell and then tell lies and then finally the truth came out. This was over 2 years ago. 
We’ve been friends for over a year and dating for just over 3 months, so I know a lot about her. I can’t seem to help her get past it or learn to “deal with it” ig. She still seems to be grieving and I have no idea how I can help. I don’t think she’s accepted he’s truly actually gone yet, and she’s holding out hope that he’ll say “haha just joking”. I feel like I shouldn’t be the one to have the “he’s actually gone” conversation and be blunt about it cause it might damage our relationship. One example is recently she saw someone who looked like him and she got really excited thinking he cane to visit, but it wasn’t him, then she was acting sad and weird the rest of the night. 
I don’t know what to do, I need some advice on how to help her, help her cope and help her move on

Also, in the back of my mind it’s hard to talk to her about it because I feel like I’m being compared. Yes it’s stupid, he’s dead, I can’t really feel like he’s gonna steal my girlfriend, but I can’t help but thinking that I’m not as good as him, and it kinda makes it hard to listen to how amazing and wonderful this other guy was, so if you could throw some advice on how to help with that mindset, I’d love it

There’s a lot that goes into it, and we’re both to blame, but what I’m struggling the most with is that there hasn’t been anything catastrophic in our relationship that led to this. There is no cheating, no violence, no abuse. Just years of built up resentment, lack of effort, and general incompatibility. I got pregnant 3 months into dating (I was previously told I couldn’t conceive so we didn’t think there was any reason to use birth control), and if I hadn’t, I doubt the relationship would have lasted more than a year. I don’t know how he feels, mostly because he hasn’t spoken to me in days, but I don’t think he expects it to have hit this point and I don’t know how to break the subject. Especially with the silent treatment. I feel like just blurting “I want a divorce” is so cold and unfeeling, but I guess so is getting a divorce in the first place. 

We do have an 8 year old son, but he also has 2 older children that I have always treated as my own, and I hate to put my youngest through this as is, but now my older children will be put through it a second time.

I guess what I’m looking for is advice on how to approach this subject and maybe some perspective on whether I’m being hasty. I have asked for counseling in past years, but he had no interest. I grew up in a very conservative family, my grandparents have been married for 60 years and we’re marriage counselors themselves in the Catholic Church so it’s hard not to feel guilty about asking for a divorce without a “good reason”. In my head and heart I know that I’m done, but on paper it doesn’t look as bad and that’s my struggle - justification for what I’m about to do to my family.

I cannot fit into the premise of Love whatsoever. I have gone on several horrible dates all my fault because I suggest male activities that girls hate. (aka shooting ranges and pool) There is not really a purpose to any of this and I feel like I have to force myself to open up to really find love. But I don't really want to put that much effort into any of it. If our lives are pointless why bother correcting yourself, going to the gym or doing anything. I just cannot enjoy life anymore and the past 3 working years have been awful I'm honestly ready for death, and not because of a lack of a loving partner. But because 2/3 of my day is sleeping, relaxing doing nothing, eating, shitting, doing chores around my house. The other 1/3 is filled with work.   


I do not know how people continue on in this miserable existence. I've tried hard to give love but its quite difficult. The only nagging sensation keeping me alive is the thought of all of my friends and family grieving over my worthless corpse. Is it really selfish to end it all? or is it more selfish to grieve someone dying because they made your life a fraction better. I feel like I have zero emotional permission from those around me to die. I hate all of it. This life is overdone. I want out. Even now that I've rediscovered Jesus fuckin christ (for the 7th time despite not believing in his ass). The government robs us our freedoms get more limited as years pass on. (I already think its shit I can't imagine what the next generation will experience May the universe have mercy on their lives.) Just needed to vent. The need to die still remains strong even though all of that has been gotten off my chest. A bullet to the brain is the best way to cheat death. You only get pain for a few extreme seconds. Better than getting stabbed and bleeding out.  


I know this whole paragraph will lack fluidity to make proper sense. Its just a whole emotional spit-up. I hate this fuckin life. Is this supposed to be purgatory? Apparently the mainstream thought is to believe that this life is pointless as is my death. So there is absolutely zero reason to continue on. Why persevere through the struggle? I'll tell you the only people that try to live through old age and danger, are those that are intertwined with love of their family and kids and are emotionally bound to a primitive desire to protect their kin, idiotic enough to believe in an afterlife or just hoping   
to die quick enough without pain.

As you can imagine, I've been getting a little worried and trying to discourage it by always asking the price first whenever he tries to show off something he got at a garage sale or thrift store, but things really have taken flight and this is why I am here, he disclosed to my mother (his ex wife) that he had spent approximately $20,000 in 2019 on thrift stores and garage sales. TWENTY-THOUSAND DOLLARS!!!! He doesn't want to sell any of it and he put all of it in his will giving each kid their own ""collection."" What can i do to help him stop and find a sane hobby. He has no friends and most of his kids are now moved out or living with mom. I see him every weekend and I've gone numb and don't notice any new additions anymore. There's dust everywhere, it smells like animal piss because his dogs are untrained. Help.

230,"My 16 month old daughter has rsv. (I think that's the letters). And is very sick. I was late to work today cause I had to rush her to the doctor. 

Then while at work my wife called me thinking her breathing was irregular and that she wasn't responding right. So I told work I'm going to the hospital and rushed home. Turns out. False alarm my wife called the nurse and it was fine, just a side effect of the medicine. Now my work is asking me to bring a Dr note tomorrow for leaving work early to go to the hospital. Problem is .... Now we didn't have to go to the hospital. If I don't bring a note I lose my job. 

Do you think I could call the Dr office in the morning and they give me a note for tonight? Since my wife was in contact with the nurse? I understand I didn't have to go to the hospital. But now I'll end up losing my job over a false alarm if I can't get a note to bring them.",06Feb2020,1

235,"Today I was “promoted” and they added a dollar and change to my pay rate. At the time I felt very pressured and in the spot so when my boss said “this is the rate, is that ok?” The first thing I thought of is how excited I was that I was getting a raise and also how I wanted more but I was to scared to say anything. So, I just accepted it. 
Later in the day my other manager that I guess can be considered a “friend” told me that I should of negotiated. The kind of person I am is... I overthink.
So.... it started and I thought “could have I gotten more??” I was so torn from moving on or going to my boss and explaining to him how I felt to see if there was a chance of get a little more. 
After overthinking, taking a walk outside, I decided to speak with him and see what he says...
He ended up telling me they couldn’t give me more for the specific title I was promoted to and I explained to him that I didn’t want him to think I was ungrateful or anything I just never have negotiated pay before and didn’t really know how it worked. I was so scared that he would take me going to him after accepting as idk rude? Or ungrateful. I appreciate it so much but I feel like maybe I should of stood quiet?

236,"My boyfriend is very loving and is good to me, but he is honestly just awful to himself. He doesn’t prioritize his well-being and expects things to just fall into place. This has put me in a rough situation emotionally and financially. I’ll give some examples: 

1. He hates his job and has worked for his boss for 13 years. She doesn’t really seem to understand how much is on his plate and hasn’t compensated him for it. He was due a review in October of 2019 and has heard nothing about it to this day. Instead of pushing the issue or bringing it to her attention, he just sweeps it away and continues to be miserable. He has a lot of work experience, a great education, and is a total professional. He can literally go anywhere with his skill set, get paid more, and get better benefits. Due to this, I’ve offered to help him with his resume, offered to seek through Indeed/Linked In with him, and he turns all these offers down. It’s really shitty to hear him complain about his situation at the same time as he isn’t willing to take the first steps in order to move into something better. 

2. He has always had anxiety and stress (to a normal degree when you have an important role in your workplace), but his anxiety has gotten worse due to increasing financial pressures, a change in his commute, and his own pressures he puts on himself. He had a big panic attack a few months ago and hasn’t been the same since. I offered to pay for him to see a doctor to get medication and to help with the hospital bill (which came out to be a huge bill of course) and he took me up on that. The doctor prescribed a SSRI and an anxiety medication. He tells me they don’t work and I explain that medication alone doesn’t solve problems having to do with anxiety. Therapy is needed too. He says he can’t afford it so I then invest in pre-marital therapy to try to get him used to the idea of seeing a therapist regularly and to allow me to cover the cost. It’s been helping him, but every session is entirely about him *which I’m totally fine with - I talk with my therapist multiple times a month so I’m working on me separately* and even our therapist told him he needs to see someone on his own. He has made bare minimal attempts to do so and pretty much gave up after only contacting 3. I can’t do this for him, even though I’ve offered, and it’s so frustrating. He even stopped the SSRI abruptly even after our therapist and I not only explained that he needs to do therapy WITH medication, but that it’s dangerous to cut meds like that cold turkey. He told me “I wasn’t feeling any different on them than without them.” I told him he needs to contact his doctor about it because that’s the kind of shit we pay them for! 

3. He got in a car accident in the end of December. Not his fault, got into an fender bender with another driver who hit him while changing lanes illegally. He’s okay, car is totaled. He calls his insurance, they say he has to pay a deductible in order for them to even begin to process a claim. Wtf! Of course it’s a huge deductible, so his only other option is to call the other insurance company himself. Low and behold, their client isn’t responding to all the ways they are trying to contact her. So, pay the deductible of his own shitty insurance company to *possibly* get his car fixed/cashed out, call the other insurance company every single day to get it processed sooner, or just hope it all gets resolved on its own? Yeah, he chose option 3. Well, I own my car and I own a motorcycle. He has to commute to work multiple days a week, so I let him use my car and I use my bike. Despite the rain, despite cold weather, I’ve been doing it and I’m sick of it. My bike is a weekend plaything, not a daily commuter, and my job as an area manager requires me to drive/ride almost 90 miles per day. So I decided to buy another car and give him my owned car because I can easily afford a car payment. It gets delivered next week. I haven’t even spoken to him about it because he’s so stubborn about believing that the insurance companies will come through and “fix his car”. It’s fucking trashed. They’re not going to fix it and when they total it out they will give him $1.5-$2k at most. Oh, and the cherry on top, his phone with all the insurance info, pictures and contact info on it? Yeah...that broke. No he doesn’t have it backed up to google or a sd card because of course he doesn’t. 

I could honestly list 3-4 more things, but I think I’ve complied enough to show that I truly don’t know how to help him anymore. I’m so heartbroken. When we first started dating he had all his shit together and in the years since he has seemingly fallen apart at the seams. He’s a good man, I’m in love with him, but I can’t figure out why he doesn’t give a fuck about his own well-being at all? I love him, I want a future with him, but he can’t even do basic adult shit. I know all the things I mentioned absolutely suck - job woes, medication, insurance - but it’s life! Life isn’t easy, but it’s worth the fight. Isn’t it?

I need to know how to break through to him. How I can show him I’m still here, that I love him, and that things can get better. Any advice out there? Please, I really love this man. I want this to work. He’s worth it to me.",06Feb2020,1

My parents, along with my two sisters, are going out this Friday for a very long time (there's a Rex Orange County concert). They leave at **5:00** (PM) won't be back until at least **1:30**ish (AM).

They know I could invite some people over, so they pulled me to the side not long ago and said; ""Hey, don't try any bull. The neighbors (who live directly in front of us) let us know whatever goes on here.""

That's the problem; **I need to sneak 10 to 25 people in my house without the neighbors seeing it**. 

**They have a direct view to the house and can see who goes in (and out), and they also know everyone in the family besides me will is gone.** Even if I turn all the lights off, they could still notice people going through the gates on the side of the house, which is still my best option here. Cutting through connecting neighbor's backyards is NOT an option, due to fences.

One solution would be to pick people up with my car (can fit 4 other people including me) and park in the garage. Then, everyone would get out of the car when the garage is closed. This could work, but it would still look sus with me taking many tips in and out of my house.

Rides home is another issue, but that could be solved by having them order ubers set to addresses on another street very close to mine. This would be at around **12:30** to **1:00,** so it would be far less likely for my neighbors to see it.

245,"Long story short, my husband has a past with dope. When I first met him, he was abusing. I wasn't going to marry him unless he was clean and sober, so he got help. Six-seven months later, he's clean and five months sober and doing good. Shortly after our marriage, he relapsed. We got him the help he needed and he's been sober ever since...or so I thought. 

Within the last two weeks, my husband has been hanging out with my cousin who abuses and I've been picking up on the signs he's used too. He has barely been sleeping, and this is a man who will sleep ten to twelve hours a day on average undisturbed. I monitored his sleeping pattern these last few days and I'm talking 48 hours without sleeping a wink. There are other signs too...lack of eating, tongue clicking (one of his ticks), behavior, etc. I've picked up on everything he used to do when I first met him. 

Tonight, my cousin's gf (whom I don't like) sends me a lengthy message explaining she caught my husband with my cousin doing a trade off and screenshots of my husband telling my cousin ""Listen, I did not come by your house today."" He sent this text right after I called my cousin.
Though I don't like her, I took her advise and bought a drug test for my husband. One of those 20-35 dollar tests. 

He should have tested positive for THC and Opiates. The results came back positive for THC and Meth. Opiates was negative.

I'm pretty upset so I'm not thinking as clear as I should be...Im a little skeptical only because the Opiate came back negative and I know he's taken hydrocodone in the last two days. Shouldn't opiate come back positive if hes taken hydro? 

What should I do? Buy another test?",06Feb2020,1

My parents are currently getting a divorce and it has been going on for quite some time. My dad's a functioning alcoholic and he was very abusive when I lived with him. He had bipolar disorder, anger issues and depression and took alot of medicine for it. My mom has undiagnosed anger issues and she's an extreme narcissist. I have an older sister and a younger brother. My sister is 17, 18 soon. And my brother is 12. My sister has a job, a car, works alot and is obviously my mom's favorite child. My mom does everything for her. Buys her clothes, takes her places so my sister doesn't have to drive, buys food, takes her out to movies, fair, and other places. My sister is very narcissistic aswell. She cares about nothing but herself. She treats my little brother like her world. Its always been like that. Same with my mom. My mom spoils the hell out of my little brother. Buys him everything. His room is filthy and he never cleans it. But she lets him do whatever. Go out, borrow money and buy what he wants. But my room is untidy once and I'm grounded for a month. My sister does what she wants anyways, moms permission or not. My dad and I talk occasionally but not alot. And I get so much shit for it. My sister , mom and brother hate me for it. I get told almost everyday that I'm useless, fat, hated and that I should kill myself. My siblings tell me all the time about how much my mom hates me and wants me to live with my dad. But I don't want to live with my dad. I want to stay here. My dad lives all the way across the country. Today, my mom and I got in a huge fight and she basically told me to kill myself and to go to hell. Everytime I tried to say something she told me to shut the fuck up. Then I said ""well at this point I might as well take my life, just like everyone tells me to, huh?"" And she told me to go ahead. No one would miss me. She blames their divorce on me. She blames her depression on me. She blames everything that ever goes wrong on me. And after everything, she tells my sister every fucking detail. And she uses it against me. She'll make fun of me over it. Honestly I'm thinking so hard over everything.

The descriptions of it, while not claiming to treat or cure any disease or illness, uses language that suggests it has some special ability to do so.

261,"My (20M) girlfriend (20F) and I have a good relationship. We have been together for a bit over a year. 

Over the course of the past few months, she has brought up many times that she feels that she has lost herself in the relationship and sees it as a pattern where she will stop focusing as much on herself and, will instead, seek validation from a partner over time. She says this nags at her, evident in her still being bothered by this since a few months ago.

Neither of us ever have any good solutions in these conversations, because she brings up possibly spending less time together, or at least being more conscious about the time we do spend together, and then neither of us really want to actually do it because we love each other and don't want to purposely separate ourselves.

Recently, we had this conversation again and she was more sure that this is what she needed to feel more herself again and to be able to have her own stuff that she does when we're not together. Evidently, this may be an important reason that she feels this way. I write and record music, and play in band, etc. whereas she has no hobby that creates something from nothing. We each have our own good friends and academic stuff going on, but she feels that at the end of the day, when I can go back home and make music and things like that, she is stuck still wanting to be with me while also conscious of the importance of her having her own time so she can work on and develop herself.

264,"
So I'm 17, and I believe my mom has had some undiagnosed issues that cause her to behave the way she does. To give a little background, she hasn't been doing very well mentally and has had episodes since I wasn't even born yet. I was told of episodes where she purposely hurt herself out of inconveniences, and it doesn't sound far fetched from the things she does now. When she doesn't have ""episodes"" she still behaves weirdly, she tends to use a manipulative way of speaking, only sees her side of things, she blames everything on others (and I believe she truly thinks it's someone else's fault) from the smallest things like something falling from her hand, it's someone else's fault because they were talking to her. Now onto what I call her ""episodes"", I remember witnessing them since I was around 6 years old. It can start from something small like her not liking a chair my dad brought home, my dad saying something she didn't like, or generally something small that obviously isn't the underlying problem but it's what gets her episodes started. Then they proceed with delirium; crying, crying on the floor, screaming, walking back and forth, repeating the same things, being restless. It's mainly those but every time is different because more things can add to that, and become more traumatic. One of the most traumatic ones that stuck with me was when she broke a plant (that wasn't on purpose, happened from the havoc) and I got out of my room to see her laying in the mess while screaming and rubbing the dirt on her face. What I started realizing growing up is a pattern where it seems like she might do certain things for attention. (HEAR ME OUT, I love my mom and I'm not denying that she's I'm pain. I wanna write my truthful experience here)  I saw that pattern in these certain things: whenever she cries it's usually where someone has gotten fed up and isn't giving her attention anymore. It's never in her bed alone, if my dad is in the living room she goes and has her episode there. If she's upset my brother wasn't paying attention to her, she starts pretending she's cleaning in front of his room and she cries and talks about him there so he hears. These past few months she has been upset over my dad not giving her attention, and not long ago during an episode she did this thing were she ran on the balcony and put her leg on the fence simulating to jump. The door to go on the balcony is in the living room where my dad was, and my mom admitted to me she wasn't going to jump but she wanted to prove my dad doesn't care. That was very traumatic for me, I was about to call for help for the first time but as I tried to she immediately stopped crying. That episode went on for awhile and I couldn't decide wether to call for help or not because as soon as I said I was going to it would stop. My mom throws the idea of killing herself out like it was nothing. She says things like ""I could kill myself right now and you wouldn't care (referred to my dad, often more explicit)/I wish I could watch you grow old but I can't anymore (to me) "" and it makes me extremely uncomfortable. Before she used to leave the house and run on the streets and my dad would have to goo look for her and take her home. I was much younger when she did that once and left a letter for me that only now I realize was an intended suicide note as it said to younger me that she loved me, to not let my dad talk badly of her and that she's sorry. It was something I learned from a young age that my mom wasn't going to actually kill herself, it was just something she did and the next day it would be like it never happened, until the next time it actually did.  My role in the episodes was always to make her some tea, put her in bed, clean her face from the snot. It wasn't easy as my mom would reject help, send you away and say that you don't care about her. That last part is something I had to deal with that simply hurt my brain, I had a period of time from 12 to 14 where I wouldn't leave my room orI would pretend I was sleeping because I was simply terrified of being around her, and I would be told that I'm selfish, that she won't care for me anymore, that I only care about blank. I did feel guilty but I felt so terrified that I couldn't leave my room. In the last 2/3 years I developed a better relationship with her as I started to find myself as a person and mature. I started sharing with her the things I would learn, spending more time with her in general.  Growing up I've dealt with anxiety, depression, self harm, all things that I would hide and go through on my own. Everything I learned now on how to be a better me it's what I learned on my own and I'm proud of that. Having that better relationship with myself helped in being able to help my mom more as well. But I finally get to the whole reason I am writing of all of this. My mother has always given me some sort of anxiety, growing up I noticed how I had to work on being affectionate with her because it came off as something uncomfortable to me even tho I'm actually someone that loves giving and receiving affection. I personally blame it on these episodes that although are very painful for my mom, I believe witnessing them has been traumatizing me since a young age. It has gotten out of control recently. During an episode that lasted days I did my best to talk to her, I tried to deliver things a little harsher so she would see things the way she doesn't and she said she appreciated it and I was right but it happened again tonight. I felt the need to leave the house and when I came home I felt extreme anxiety having my mom around me. I explained to her that I'm not upset with her but I need her to give me some space, and thinking about how she didn't makes me want to burst in tears. She came not once or twice, but several times in my room to say that she's sorry and and I said that it's okay, i get that she wasn't feeling well and I really just need some space. I needed to be alone and calm myself down. But all night she came in my room to ask me to stay with me, to hug me, to sleep in my bed, also told me I'm acting like my dad and I'm honestly going crazy. I just needed some space. I do love her, I do. But she was giving me so much anxiety and it made me cry that she couldn't respect the fact that I was so anxious and needed to be alone. I had panic attacks and I still am having them. Every time she came in my room she told me ""but I need to sleep next to someone, but I need a hug, but I need affection"" and I would love to give all if that to her when I feel good but in that moment I was feeling traumatized and I just needed her to understand I needed to be left alone. Having anyone touch me would've caused me a panic attack. If I tried to explain to her now that I understand her pain but I feel like all my childhood it traumatized me and now it's causing me to feel extreme anxiety when being near her, she would turn my words around. She wouldn't understand, and I know for sure because I already had that talk with her in the past. Any type of contact with her gives me anxiety now. I feel guilty for feeling the anxiety I feel as well. I wish I could have more patience and help her more but I also feel hopeless. Like my help is useless either way but due to the anxiety I also feel unable to give her the support I tried to give her before.  
I know I'm gonna be okay because I've learned how to be mentally stable on my own and just deal with things by my self as I realized I have the strength to within me. All of this just feels sp exhausting right now so I just wanted to ask for anyone's opinion, advice and thoughts. I wanted to make it a topic of discussion because I don't want to keep it in me anymore",06Feb2020,1

270,"Question: Would you ... Leave Southern California to buy a beautiful, affordable home in Phoenix or Las Vegas? 

I live in Southern California ... pretty much on the beach. I live in paradise. I have a nice career, get paid very nicely, I am in a Master's program but ...

The BIG issues with SoCal (as everyone knows ... this is nothing groundbreaking) are (1) the traffic (I can deal with this) and (2) the housing prices. 

I am about a year away from graduating with a Master's degree ... and probably 2 or 3 years away from home ownership ... but my goal is to own a home. The problem with this gorgeous paradise that I live in is ... like, seriously the housing prices are absolutely cray cray. I can't even tell you. I'm originally from Nebraska so ... imagine my sticker shock when I moved here 4 years ago. 

But ... SoCal has become home. I seriously absolutely love it here. What's not to love. 

But I live in 600 square feet with no garage, the tiniest closet and the tiniest OLDEST (crappiest) bathroom on the planet ... and I still pay like $2100/mo for rent. I get parking tickets all the time for all the stupid parking rules around here!!! OMG! And how I would DIE for a private little backyard space, a place to park my Vespa (that I don't have ... but if I had a place to park it ... I would get one!) ... and OMG ... dream of all dreams ... a full size washer and dryer that is MINE ALL MINE (not in a shared laundry that I fight for!)

You get the picture. I'm growing out of this space. I want to own a home. But I can NEVER afford anything (that isn't OLD, rundown and tiny) here in SoCal ... sooooo ... I look at pictures of beautiful kitchens and bathrooms and I dream of them being mine. Once I graduate from school ... I will be free to look for a job WHEREVER I want. I am single, and don't have any romantic ties to this location. 

Would you ... Leave the beautiful paradise of the beach to buy a beautiful home in Phoenix or Las Vegas?

272,"So a long story short; I've had a friend move to Germany from Australia with his Father. They moved in with the Father's Partner but have only been there for a few weeks before things went south. The partner decided to break it off with the Father after they had just spent $12,000 on shipping their entire lives worth of possessions over.  They expected financial support whilst setting themselves up in Germany, which they no longer have. They have about 3 weeks to find a way out of this situation before they become homeless. Neither of them speak German and their current goal is to borrow $20,000 AUD to purchase tickets back to Australia where they have a support network, and to ship their belongings back. 
However, they cannot borrow money due to a bad credit listing. 
Do they have any options at all? I cannot borrow that large amount of money because I haven't had a secure income for a long period of time (uni student). I won't be able to reply for hours at a time due to work, but I would appreciate any pointers at all.

I don't need criticism, I've already given them plenty. I need help.

275,"First off all, I posted the same thing on r/friendshipadvice. I didn’t know which would be the better subreddit to post on.

To set the scene, I’m a female high school junior. First of all, I do have a solid group three friends outside of this friend. I’ve had those friends since elementary school. At the beginning of this year I befriended a senior and freshman through band (both girls). We will call the freshman Blake and the senior Deborah. Blake, Deborah, and I quickly became good friends, since we were all clarinets and had to interact a lot. We hung out during band, outside of school, and during classes. We would go to each other’s houses, have sleepovers, go to the mall, all those girly things. 

To preface, Blake is openly lesbian and Deborah is openly bisexual. They always had a slightly romantic relationship, but claimed they were just friends. I believed they were just friends, but always wondered. I’m bisexual myself but never felt attraction for either of them. In fact, we often had conversations about how weird it would be to date a friend. 

Anyways, as time went on, they started to pull away from me. They just wanted to hang out with each other, and not me. They both claimed I was crazy for thinking that I was being excluded. Yet they hung out most days of the week and didn’t mention it to me. And when we hung out all together, they would cuddle and not talk to me. When I would hang out with one, they would call the other the whole time. I don’t know how I didn’t see that they were in love with each other at the time. But I guess they didn’t see it either.

The day before winter break, my anger came to a boiling point. I couldn’t stand feeling excluded any longer. I wanted the friendship trio to go back to how it was, I didn’t want to feel left out. I wanted us all to hang out together like we used to. I confronted Blake and told her that I wanted to be more included. I said that it felt like her and Deborah were really attached to each other and maybe they should back off. I admit, it may not have come out the nicest, but I didn’t mean to hurt thing. Blakey got angry at me and called me manipulative. 

I quickly went to Deborah to tell her about this, but she said she didn’t want to hear it and she wasn’t picking sides. Remember that she said this for later. I forgot to mention that Deborah and I are cheerleaders. I hadn’t talked to either of them for about a week, but then we had a game. I assumed Deborah would be nice to me, even if things weren’t great between me and Blake. I was dead wrong. That entire game Deborah completely ignored me and wouldn’t make eye contact. After the game, I asked her if we could talk and she said she didn’t want to, and she just walked over to Blake and they walked away.

I thought that was really weird. So I texted both of them asking what was wrong. I didn’t really get a response. Just Blake telling me that she needed time and Deborah saying she didn’t want to be involved. But she was involved, she was obviously choosing Blakey’s side. Throughout the rest of winter break, I slowly made amends with Blake, and by the end of break we were back to being friends. Deborah had ignored me most of break, but I just assumed she was busy. 

When I got back from break, Blake and I were fine. So I assumed things with me and Deborah were fine. Nope. She ended up telling me that she doesn’t like me anymore. She was very mad at me and didn’t want to talk to me outside of what was required. I was hurt. I considered her a great friend.

I talked to Blake, and that’s when she told me that they were dating now so she wasn’t picking sides. But I know she was really picking Deborah’s. She said that Deborah had her reasons and she didn’t want to talk about it.

It’s been weeks since then. Deborah says she’s done being mad at me but won’t tell me why she was in the first place. She still won’t really talk to me outside of what is necessary. Blake and I’s friendship is still a bit shaky. I’m still kind of mad at her because while we were fighting, she was talking shit to Deborah about me. I’m assuming that’s why Deborah got mad at me.

Currently those two are attached by the hip, they can never stand to be apart. That means I barely see Blake anymore because Deborah doesn’t really like me. I don’t even know what to do at this point. I’m not sure if I should just drop both of their friendships. I like Blake, but she is so obsessed with Deborah.

My grades are falling and I’m really worried, but I don’t know what to do. I’ve tried using a planner to keep myself organized, but it didn’t help at all. Even in the subjects I’m most passionate about, foreign languages, I don’t do my work (and it’s arguably the most important to pay attention and do my homework in).

282,"I've spent my entire career in the software industry, and there is a definite gender problem. There are plenty of successful women in the industry, but the gender ratio is very skewed towards men, and a lot of software shops have a strong dude-bro culture with undertones (and often pretty overt overtones) of sexism.  


I've found you have to choose between dude-bro culture (which I've avoided because ick) and companies with a kind of uneasy women-and-men-can't-be-friends problem. It's not too bad at junior levels, but if you're a man in a more senior role (that's me) you have to be careful to avoid even the appearance of paying too much attention to the women you work with. Posing for a photo at a company event with your arm casually around the waist of a female co-worker is risking a serious chat with HR (even if the pose wasn't your idea) - not because anyone complained, but because how would it look to potential hires if they see a man with his arm around a female co-worker's waist? ""It's sending a message.""  


I get all of that. I want to see the gender imbalance fixed, women-hostile dude-bro environments eliminated, and a future where the software industry is just as welcoming to women as to men - from junior roles to C-level execs. A future where women aren't harassed at work.  


But I'm tired of it and I want to tap out. Can I tap out? I just want to go do some time somewhere where women and men can be friends at work. I realize this is selfish of me, and maybe I should stay and keep being a robot around women while we try to make the industry more equal. But I'm tired and I want an environment where we both hire and retain women (because it's a woman-friendly place to work), and don't have to be constantly weird around each other. (This is not about me wanting to be able to flirt with co-workers. If I want to flirt with women I'll jump on Tinder and find people who want me to flirt with them. I just want to not be on edge around some fraction of my colleagues.)

Are there other industries where men and women can be comfortable around each other? Or does this exist everywhere to some extent? Or am I just working in the wrong type of software company or the wrong geographic location?",06Feb2020,1

300,"My Dad has cheated on my mom when my siblings and I were still babies. This year we find out he is cheating once again. It is the only instance of cheating that we know of where I am old enough to actually know what it entails. At this point, my parents are staying together and working through it though I would much rather have him leave. Now, it has me questioning everything. 
Will I ever find a relationship that doesn’t involve cheating or will I have to suck it up like my Mother had to do? 
Is there even a point in trying so hard in my relationship when they’ll just hurt me in that way too? I feel like cheating is everywhere.

I know it makes more sense to finish because it pays well and I will finally have a stable job and income, but I’m having doubts because there’s other things I’m more passionate about. 
My main interests are psychology, photography, writing/research and animals. 
I had always envisioned myself either working with animals or within the psychology field, more specifically forensic psychology... or criminology, something related to law/psych.  
Idk, I’m still young and all (21) but I just feel as though what I really want is unrealistic when it comes to a career.. this schooling is long and I’m I’m not the best student. I’m feeling super conflicted on my choice, I just have this how or never feeling to decide. 

Anyway, my point is... has anyone else had this experience and what did you do to decide, did you regret any decision? Stability vs loving your career? Is it even possible to love your career? Idk I’m stressing. 

Also if anyone has any suggestions for careers related to psychology/law + research or writing that doesn’t require insane amounts of schooling please let me know :)!! 

Thank you!",06Feb2020,1
302,"So first her dad killed himself, then her aunt a few months later, all of which got her a lot of time off work.

So now lately she had been dumped by her boyfriend, and she's been struggling with that - but now she's saying that her ex-boyfriend ""basically killed himself in front of me"". I called her to see what happened but she said she doesn't want to talk about it - she was clearly crying when I called her, but since she didn't want to talk about it, I wasn't sure what to say. I just said I'm sorry and asked if she had told anyone in her family. She said she hadn't. Then she said she was going to call me back later.

I like this girl and want to trust her, but this is a lot of tragedy in a short span of time, and - not that this means anything - but not a peep about it on her social media. Facebook, snapchat, no mention of any of these deaths at all.

Obviously it would be outrageous to ask her for evidence that this happened, right? But at the same time that's a great reason to use them as an excuse. I want to say that's ridiculous because she seems like she really wants to be friends with me, I've had her come over and stay the night before (platonically), and so I'm hoping she wants to remain friends for a while at least. And if she does, she can't exactly hope to hide such lies as these, right? I mean I'm eventually going to find out if it's really true or not, and if it turns out she lied I mean...she's obviously nuts and I don't see why someone would lie like that.

But at the same time this is just so much tragedy for someone, and not to have any mention of it at all on social media (she does post things on there too), is just really bizarre.",06Feb2020,1
303,"The problem is I rarely get my mom to buy me stuff. No I’m not poor. I’ve seen my dads paychecks he gets paid a lot more than average. Yet my mom acts like our family is so poor. She denies we are poor but whenever I ask for her to buy me something she complains about the money. For example, let’s say I want her to order me a hoodie. She’ll make me wait till it goes on clearance. Then after she finally buys it I’ll have to wait another 2 months of begging to order another hoodie. Another example, last year I was getting fed up with this cheap Android I’ve had since 8th grade. I’ve been begging my mom since 9th grade to get me an iPhone but she would always say it’s too expensive. Yet she bought both my siblings a new iPhone not too long ago. Anyways I had to wait until practically the end of the first semester of 10th grade to get one. And to top it off I got her old iPhone while her and my dad got the new iPhone 11. This pissed me off but I was just happy and grateful to have a better phone so I didn’t complain. Another example that’s currently happening, is that I’ve been asking her for a new skateboard. And I’ve been asking for at least 3 years but she’s always complaining about the price. She has been telling me to wait that she’ll buy it for me yet I’m still here borrowing my brothers board. This has really been pissing me off because I know once I finally get my own skateboard Ima have to wait god know how long for skate shoes. And I’ve been using my brothers old skate shoes :(. And one last example, I’ve been eating a LOT more than before and I need to gain weight for wrestling so I obviously need to eat more food. I have been telling my mom this for months but she always says she can’t spend this much money on food. 
I’m getting really annoyed with this because everyday I never get full. I’m always hungry and my stomach is always rumbling at night. I haven’t gained a single pound for wrestling.Yet no matter how many times I explain it to her she just doesn’t seem to care. This behavior from my mom has really messed with me. I feel like it’s what’s affected my effort in school. Because I used to be a straight A student in middle school and would always get honor rolls in elementary which is when she would regularly buy me stuff. But now that I’m in high school and she’s been acting like this, I sorta just stopped trying so hard because I feel like there’s no point to it since my mom doesn’t really reward me any more. I barely passed my classes last year with C’s and right now i’m failing 2 classes. Sometimes I get so fed up with it that I just feel like breaking down and crying sometimes.

308,"I want to talk to my Boyfriend about moving

Hello! I (21F) have been dating my boyfriend (22M) for six months now. He’s in the army and he’s getting stationed to Seattle, Washington in December. I currently live in Georgia, and he lives in North Carolina. We see each other every couple of months, we’re both just so busy especially with me in school.

I’m having some issues with myself, I have no idea how to talk to him about moving closer to one another without feeling like it’s being too rushed. I would love to move to Seattle and be closer to him (not move in of course, I will have my own place), but I don’t know how I will be able to openly talk about that without coming off as if I’m moving too fast and scaring him off...but he has mentioned before that our relationship wouldn’t work out if we weren’t closer to one another.

I see him next week during the weekend of Valentines, and I would like to talk to him about this casually in person. Just so I have an idea about where my future is heading also. But, do you believe this is a good time to talk to him about it? This is my very first real relationship so I have no idea how to handle this to be honest and would like some advice to the people who have been in longer relationships.

If we continue to date, in December of this year, will be our 1 year and 4 months, and thats the time when he moves, it will be pretty much reasonable to move with him (but of course separate living), and we will be much more closer. He knows I’m looking at other cities to move to like Miami or Baltimore, and he also knows that if we ever moved closer to one another and it ended up not working out between us, I will be able to move away because I have nothing attached to me (I take school online) and I just have much more freedom than he does.

318,"Background: I’m a junior in high school, and there is a freshman that appears to be very lonely. I wouldn’t have noticed this particular person if it weren’t for them following me to the bathroom all the time. I usually go to the bathroom during lunch at the same time every day, and i pass by them sitting alone in the hall. After a few days of them observing my pattern, they started going into the bathroom about a minute after me. I even started going to the bathroom upstairs instead, and they followed me there too. This behavior of theirs made me wonder if they want me to talk to them. Either that or they are curious as to why i go to the bathroom every day. Also, i had one class with them last semester, they were very quiet, and i would sometimes see them looking at me from the corner of my eye. I just get the feeling they want to talk to me for some reason. Anyway, i’ve only ever seen them talk to one person before. Other than that, they’re always alone, sitting on the floor at lunch. I feel very sympathetic towards them, and they remind me of myself as a freshman. I sat alone at lunch too (and during sophomore year). I kinda want to talk to this person, and ask if they need a friend, or anyone to sit with at lunch. How should i approach this/ what should i say to them?

She also has severe anxiety and I know how it feels to think you're judged and it be confirmed. I don't really know if I should bring it up at all or just survive until the end of the semester. I've started being more cold hearted just because things are getting emotionally difficult, and I think she expects me to be an emotional dumping ground.

320,"So a coworker of mine (we work in an elementary school) is going out of town tomorrow and Friday.  She asked me if I would be willing to pick up her 2 children and take them to school (our workplace). Not so strange right? We've worked together for 3 years and change and we hang out regularly with other coworkers; I consider her a good friend. I just think it is a little strange, weird, awkward for me to pick up her kids from her husband and take them to school with me. I tell myself it's solely because of convenience but I feel it's going to be strange getting them from her husband in the morning lol. Regardless, I agreed to it because she truly is a friend. 

The following is a little bit of back story. 

Now for the interesting parts...

1) She's (unhappily) married and said I am more reliable than her husband. 

2) We flirt back and forth occasionally at work and outside of work. 
I know I shouldn't but she makes it so easy.  

3) Every time we hang out outside of work. She complains about her husband not only to me but our other coworkers. It's gotten to the point where it's a running joke that she doesn't love him anymore and that I'm more of a husband to her. (he doesn't work or help around the house). She's been stressed the past year and a half because she's been basically supporting her household alone and swears up and down she doesn't love him anymore but doesn't want to be alone or for her little girls to blame her for causing a ""broken family"".

4) There's been times where she has been close to kissing me but I always stop her. 

5) I find her very attractive and she is one of the sweetest people I've ever met. HOWEVER, I don't want to be the catalyst for issues in her personal life. I've met her husband on multiple occasions and he seems like a decent dude. But her stories of his drug use, irresponsibility, and immaturity have tainted his image in my eyes. I've messed around sexually with many married women before AND other coworkers before but I've been doing my best to curb that destructive behavior the past few months.

331,"So tomorrow will make 3 weeks since my boyfriend (17) broke up with me (16). We met freshmen year and started dating the second semester. After 7 months of dating I moved an hour and a half away. Before I moved we were inseparable. We would see each other 5/7 days of the week and we never got tired of each other. Everyone thought we were perfect for each other and we both dreamed of living together and traveling together. After moving we put in the effort and we FaceTimed, texted, and saw each other about 3-4 times a month on weekends. 
The last 4 months have been off between us but I just assumed it was because we were busy since it’s out junior year. But then I started lots of arguments because It felt like I was the only one putting in effort. He’d text me like 3 words and then be too busy to FaceTime me. I know we’re busy and tired but all I wanted were a free updates throughout his day.
He broke up with me on FaceTime because he said he wasn’t happy anymore. He said he didn’t love me anymore. He said that I drove him away by being toxic. He doesn’t want to put in effort anymore because he doesn’t see this relationship worth it. 
I’m trying to be honest about both sides and yes I realized I was toxic. But I did it unknowingly. I wasn’t toxic where he was never happy with me I was just 15 and I never had a real boyfriend until him. The couple times he’d go out with friends I’d get jealous and mad because we could of been talking. I realize I was childish but I never meant to be that way. I still supported him in everything, made him laugh, and loved him. 
It hurt when he broke up with me because after 1.5 years of long distance he decides it isn’t worth it anymore. He broke up with me a couple days before we would of made 2 years. I think he might of gave up too easily. And it hurts. It hurts to be in my own room because he helped me move. He helped me set up my room how it is and I have so many things of him setup. He was close to all my family to the point where he’s met all my aunts , godparents, and gone to their houses. 
We have so many memories. We’ve done everything together and we know each other inside out. We text everyday. We’ve FaceTimed a couple times. I’m supposed to him Saturday but he told me not to have hope anymore. I’ve never felt this much heartbreak and since I moved I haven’t really found close friends here.

335,"Really dumb question but lately, all I've been able to think about is that I've been gaining weight. I've only gained like 3 lbs and my bmi is fine, but it's like my head won't shut up about how fat I am. It sounds edgy but it's genuinely making me change a lot of my diet. I don't starve myself only cause that wouldn't help me lose weight and can make you gain it instead when you do eat. I'm glad I'm eating a bit healthier and less but it's really making the day exhausting. Counting calories, sugar, and reading labels. Is this normal? And if so, how can I make my brain not make me feel like total shit when I do look at the mirror?

338,"I need advice, any help i can get. I feel like im losing my mind.

Ive liked this guy for a few months now. ive literally never had a crush on ANYONE the same way ive liked him. ive never met someone ive clicked so well with. a few weeks ago, I had a bonfire at my house and he came. it was just me, him, and another friend. he ended up getting very tipsy and word for word told me ""I like you. have you ever considered being more than friends? youve been the biggest light in my life when all ive had is darkness."" I was so overwhelmed, knowing ive had a crush on him for 4+ months. I didnt even know how to react, but we sat in front of the fire for almost 5 more hours flirting and cuddling. hes very shy with girls and has a reputation of that (even though hes 29) so I decided to call him about what happened at the bonfire the next day. when I called, I asked him if he meant everything he said the night before. he said ""I dont know what youre talking about"" clearly I was confused. so obviously I repeated everything he said, and he said ""oh. I look at you as a sister. im sorry if I lead you on.""

as you can tell from what happened before, hearing this was extremely confusing. my theory is hes shy and was scared of rejection so he was trying to protect his feelings, because I did come off strong by calling him so I think he just assumed I wanted to tell him no.

our mutual friends have agreed he really likes me and has been obvious for months (while ive been oblivious of it)

I want to tell him I like him, but im so scared of losing what we have, we also see each other often because of mutual hobbies/friends... plus hes a coworker. what do I do? and what do you think hes feeling?",06Feb2020,1

I don't gloat except for very occasionally I let something slip to my close friends but I do keep tabs on it.
But damn, I think I am the bees knees. The hard part is I excel at lots of stuff so I feel it is justified. I was in foster care in high school in a very tough situation and still graduated validictorian. I completed 2 majors and 6 minors in college with a great GPA. I think I'm an awesome mom. I donate a lot of money so I think I'm super cool for doing that. I don't think I'm the best at stuff, I know there is always someone better, but that doesn't matter to me. I think I'm doing so awesome and am kind of dumbfounded at all my friends who are not doing so great. I also think all this stuff was because of my hard work and I don't contribute it to luck or anything.
I don't like thinking this way because I'm constantly trying very hard to be humble during conversations when I don't actually feel that way.

343,"I have known this guy for a couple months because we work together. There have been a couple times we have worked alone together and we started talking and flirting. Eventually we started texting each other and hanging out occasionally outside of work. A couple days ago we went to the movies and he kept trying to kiss me for the first time but I wouldn't let him. After the movie we drove to a park and kissed there for a couple minutes. Last night we drove to the park again to make-out. 



A few hours ago we were hanging out at my place and started kissing again. Then he asked how long he was going to have to wait and that he's horny. I told him that it's too soon but he kept telling me how hard he is and that he wants to do it. He asked me if I was afraid he was going to get me pregnant and I told him I may not be able to conceive which is true. I also told him I'm afraid it will hurt and he replied that he won't hurt me. Eventually I gave in and we did it. I know it was a bad decision but he didn't use a condom and I don't take birth control. I don't have regular periods and only have one ovary so I just don't keep track at all. 


I just don't know what to do. I wanted to do it but I wish I would have waited like I wanted and I want to cry. What am I supposed to do now? I know he's had sex before but this was the first for me. We are both in our twenties.

345,"My younger sister (11) and I (15) go to the same school, except, she’s in the elementary building while i’m in the high school building

For the 2 years we’ve attended the school, she struggled to make friends and eventually a lot of her classmates turned on her. We only recently found out because she’s been hiding this away from us. I have to fend off kids making remarks about her weight on the bus and now we find out she’s having the same exact problems in class, all day. The teachers do absolutely nothing about it when she reports the bullying and gave up on it, is what she told us 

But the thing is, my dad isn’t doing much about it either other than offering the same exact advice everyday: “stand up for yourself.” so you know what she did? She faked an illness to get out of going for 3 whole days! And it literally tears me up inside knowing that she’s going to such great lengths just so she won’t be harassed. She even said told me, while crying may I add, that she’d rather be back in our old school because her classmates weren’t as harsh on her, and, she’s getting more insecure of her own body

My dad refused to switch her to a different school for a reason unknown to me, and said he’d have a talk with the principal but he hasn’t done ANYTHING yet. I argued with him about it and he yelled at me. This situation sucks because I really can’t do anything about it since we go to school in different buildings. I really don’t know what to do???

348,"I'm on mobile so I'm sorry for formatting. I've been dating my girlfriend (17F) for a year and almost 2 months. We've had an amazing run. My family adores her, and her parents love me. We've had beach trips and picnics and movie outings and Polaroid pictures and everything that would make a high school romance golden. I've never seen anyone in the light I see her. I love her .ore than I've loved anyone. Now here comes the loop. 

About 7 months ago, she had a speech tournament. She's so talented in what she does she made it to Canada's national tournament. Naturally, they had it in a province a bit further away, so they flew out for a week and stayed in hotels. This is when she met 2 guy's that we'll call Jim and Bob. 

At first I was happy she was in a far place having a good time meeting new people. She told me how nice Jim and Bob were and how cool they seemed. Me being a teenage boy, this made me a little jealous, but I trusted her, so I held my tongue and was happy for her. Later in the trip, they started to hang out more. 

Jim and Bob both had girlfriends they seemingly adored. But they still made their moves. My girlfriend confessed they told her she had kissable lips and an amazing body. This is where a red flag was raised. I told her I didn't want her hanging out with them anymore. She called me too controlling. So I stepped back and trusted her. 

On one of the last nights they were gone, my girlfriend dropped a bit of a bomb on me. She said that the boys were going over, and that her friends wanted to sneak them up to the hotel room. I freaked out. I told her to find somewhere else to sleep or something, as she had other friends that were there. She said she would find a comfy place to sleep. I, of course, believed her. Then paranoia started getting the better of me. At about midnight, her texts were spaced out by about 30 minutes. This made me suspicious. So I started texting her frantically and vented my thoughts. I immediately terrible and I apologized to no end.  She opened these messages and let hell pour down on me. She called me controlling and psychotic and told me that she didn't know if she could continue dating me and that we would have to talk when she came back. I felt like shit and I left that as it was. 

We never had that talk. We went out to dinner and I apologized. She accepted. Then in mid August, she called me in hysterics. She told me she couldn't live with herself and she needed to confess to me. She told me that she snuck the boys up to the hotel room and hung out for about 5 minutes before she left because she was uncomfortable with how sexually insinuating they were. I was appalled. I was upset. But I forgave her and tried not to let it effect our relationship. 

Now, over 6 months later, we talked about it again. I told her I wanted some closure and felt ready to talk about it and clear the air. So we talked for about an hour. She gave me about the same story she gave me the first time, but calmer and more steady.  I asked questions and got answers. I felt absolved and light. Then later tonight, she texted me. 

She told me that she was a horrible girlfriend and a liar and I needed to dump her. I was confused. I asked her to go on, and she eventually did. She told me after she snuck the guys up she didn't leave. She stayed and played truth or dare with them, and ended up cuddling with one of them while they rubbed her back. They hung out for an hour and a half and the boys eventually left. After 7 months of lying and deceit, I knew the truth. I'm angry. I'm upset. But I love my girlfriend and don't want to act irrationally. But I need advice. So, reddit, what do I do? How do I proceed in my relationship?",06Feb2020,1
349,"I read this article [This one](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/understanding-narcissism/201810/are-narcissists-bad-people)

It states that some narcissists are doing their best to be good people, others don't care.

My fiancé goes above and beyond to be good. She follows morals that she doesn't seem to understand. Her sister kind of explains right from wrong to her and she just follows it even though she doesn't get it. I also got her to go to a very good therapist ""for her anger"". She goes sometimes.

On the other hand, she doesn't care that she's selfish, goes from love to hate in an instant, hates everyone except the people she currently REALLY REALLY REEEEALY likes. She only really really really likes them for a short while until she hates them (most of the time). She completely lacks empathy and kind of treats animals as if they're disposable. We've had  13 dogs since she's lived here in the past 7 months. Right now we have 2.

So here's why I'm struggling with this. I have my own very serious mental illness so serious that if I disclose it people never take me seriously (I'm on very good  meds that seem to have calmed it 98%). I understand that Narcissistic Personality Disorder is a mental illness as well.

Less than an hour later I received a text message from someone at the company wanting to set up a phone interview. The phone interview took place the next day, Friday Jan 24th. The phone interview went well and they scheduled me to come in for a face to face interview on Monday Jan 27th. I went to the interview and thought it went really well. The next day, Tuesday Jan 28th, I receive a message saying that I missed my interview and asking if I was still interested in a position with them. I responded that I had shown up to the interview and who I met with. They texted back an apology and said there was miscommunication on their end and that they’ll let me know if they’re interested in moving forward with me. This past Monday was a week since my interview, I was told I should reach out to them as I hadn’t heard anything back yet, so I sent them a message. No response. On Tuesday I figured maybe my message didn’t go through or make it to the person I was trying to reach so maybe a phone call might be a bit better. I called and left a message, stating my name, phone number and just that I wanted to touch base with them after my interview. Again no response.

However, now she has been leaving the stove on a lot. Sometimes she has food on it on high and goes to our room to watch tv and comes back 30 minutes later. Food always boils over and she doesn’t clean it and the whole place stinks. What’s even worse is sometimes she’ll just “forget” to turn it off. Like who forgets to turn off the stove FOR TWO HOURS.

This is a major fire hazard . I want her out of the apartment in the first place, I can even cover her rent.

She worked in the Coffee Shop section while I worked in the front end aka bagging. There was this one girl (20F) who was my first friend there who was a checker but we never really hung out outside of work, but definitely were close in the store. My sister and her actually started hanging out since they found out a lot of their friends were connected. 

They ended up becoming super close but their friendship was honestly toxic. They both thought they were trying to fuck each other boyfriends but then call each other out then resolve the issue but this happened basically dozens of times. This one time they went on a camping trip with a bunch of their friends and my sister was sitting next to the friend’s (now ex) boyfriend and the friend thought something was going on and freaked out while basically black out drunk and claimed she was trying to fuck him in front of all of their friends.

After this trip they decided they really shouldn’t be friends anymore and cut things off but I was still friends with the girl since we worked in the same department, but actually ended up both getting promoted to another department together. 

Me and this girl have been friends since I started working there (3 years) but the drama happened last year with her and my sister. 

It’s been hard because whenever I hang out with the girl outside of work my sister says I’m disrespecting her by being the girl’s friend. 

The current drama is I agreed to house sit for the girl and my sister found out (doesn’t live with me, lives about 20 mins away) and is pissed and blocked me in everything. Which she does every single time she finds out we hang out or I do any sort of interaction with her outside of work.

363,"I just found out that the man i’m going on a date with is 30 years old... I’m 18.

Some back story: We’re both in the same college class, and we were working on a group project together along with several other people in the group.

He ended up striking a conversation with me, and we talked for a bit before he admitted that he thought I was beautiful and wanted to take me out on a date. He has a pilot’s license and is in training to become a commercial pilot, so he wanted to take me up in the sky over the city at night.

I accepted, he seemed like a very sweet and romantic guy and this was easily the most romantic first date I have ever been asked on. But based on his appearance, I thought he was around 25. Still a bit of an age gap, but i’m a legal adult and i’m fine with dating men who are older!

Well, just a little bit older, as 25 is around the maximum age I would date. Or so I thought.

Flash forward to today, we have been talking nonstop and he is genuinely a sweet guy. He’s always asking about my day and well-being, and we’ve been talking a lot to each other about our life. He is great at making me feel happy and comfortable, so we made plans to go our first date tomorrow. But in our conversation, we finally talked about age and decided to ask each other how we old we were.

Once I told him my age, I think he was just as shocked as I was. I’m a skilled makeup artist, so a lot of times I look older than I actually am. I’ve been offered alcohol at a restaurant before without being asked for my ID, despite not even being the legal drinking age. So it’s no surprise that he thought I was in my early 20s.

Although I am an adult, the age gap is making me a bit uncomfortable, as i’m barely legal. I still want to go on a date with him, but it has to be lowkey and i’m terrified that i’m going to catch feelings for a man 12 years older than me.

We’ve agreed to keep this whole affair on the down low, but now it’s really fucking awkward because he’s still in my public speaking class, and we’re presenting our group project tomorrow.

How do I even handle this situation? Do I cut ties with him to prevent catching feelings, or should I still just go on the one very casual date with him like we planned? My parents still think he’s 25, and I live at home so i’m getting my ass beat if they find out his real age.",06Feb2020,1
365,"I started a lab  internship abroad in October. It’s a year-long optional internship. I was promised amazing learning opportunities etc etc. The problem
Is I have very little work to do. I am in the lab maybe once a week on average. Most days I’ll come into work and the first thing I’m told is that there isn’t any work for me at all. Literally nothing. So I end up sitting at my desk for 45 hours a week doing nothing. Whenever I bring the issue up I’m told that I should do more karyotyping (chromosome classification). I’ve done probably 100+ hours of that and it’s a pretty much useless skill that nobody else in the lab is expected to master (especially at that level). Any advice?",06Feb2020,1
366,"Hello everyone reading this, 

I'm a 22 year old male with a very difficult living situation. I'm currently attending college (my first year) as I didn't have to opportunity to go after high school and had to work right away. My mother and father are divorced with my mother being remarried.

Currently I'm living with my mother and her husband, along with my grandmother (due to her recent stroke) who can no longer live alone but she still works with my mother Monday-Friday.

I'm working part time only due to college but was previously working full time during break, I'm majoring in software engineering. Outside of work and school I don't like to go out much and stay home to game with my friends. Both my grandmother and mother say I need to go out and do ""normal"" people things, like playing sports or meeting up with friends.

I for one don't like sports, I don't go out unless my friends and I plan something and when I do go out then they complain with things like ""don't start drinking or smoking"" ""your friends might make you do drugs"". I can't win either way so what's the point.

Late last year in November (a week before finals) my grandmother out of nowhere verbally abused me, saying things like ""I'm good for nothing"" ""I'm using my mother"" that im ""using school as an excuse to avoid paying rent"". She compares me to my successful younger aunt (34) who went to school full time and worked full time. ""Why can't you be like her"" ""You're a man, and men need to work more"".

My mother doesn't care where I end up, she said it herself before, I don't like my mom's husband. Very immature, nosy (goes through my things, even things I throw out) and very OCD. They argue all the time and they plan to divorce sometime this year.

My father ( I still talk to frequently) is staying with his girlfriend and I have previously stayed with him before (due to this very same issue) for 2 months. Afterwards I came back to my mother's house after things cooled off, little did I know a few weeks later my grandmother says the same things all the time.

I don't want to move back with my father, I haven't asked but I don't want to be a nuisance. It's also nearly  impossible to live as a student alone in the majority of California (bay area). I have had many thoughts of running away and even suicide. But I'm managing to keep my head straight and pursue a career despite all this.

As of today, my mother's home is a 3 bedroom. I gave up my room to my grandmother when she moved in since I felt bad of letting her sleep in the living room ( which I have been now). The 3rd bedroom is being rented to an acquaintance of my mother. I can't really manage to pay your average cost of rent, I have a fair amount of money saved up and with my current paycheck, it goes to my phone bill, 2 credit lines, and your general cost of living (food,gas etc.)

I want to move out, I can't stand another day being here. My own ""family"" doesn't take my word and think I'm useless. I had the idea of moving to Korea, as I'm talking courses on the language, I love the people, food and culture. So it seems like a not so bad idea right? But the more I think of actually moving out of the country for the first time alone at my age seems crazy. 

The cost of living is obviously way different there than compared here in the US, I've layed out a plan on a place to stay, work and study if I move there. I won't even tell my parents where I go, none of them wouldn't care nonetheless.

Any advice would really help me out, I feel so stressed out all the time, thanks in advance!

I just turned 18 and she's now in my name and I'm going to give her up to the humane society but I want to get the wound healed up just enough so they don't charge me with animal cruelty (which is a felony in my state). Her wound was looking good I had been looking after it but while I wasn't home, my mom took off her cone and didn't watch her, I come home to find my dog had ripped up her leg again and it was bleeding.

379,"(First of all I apologies english isn't my first language)

I am 19 years old and i never though i will ever do that. 

I always had good mark at scholl without working a lot. I get accepted in a medecine college, but I failed the middle year contest. I decided to switch to an engineer school. I decided to pay by myself, with my own student money that I get from previous job, the admission contest ( 500 bucks). I did the contest, and get in the top 50 (I couldn't know my rank) over 2000 person. I then had to pass an oral test, and I get the first place over the last 50 person, wich mean i am accepted and i can start my year in March in a pretty prestigious school.

However, my parents now refuse to pay the studdies. When i failed my medecine school, they were  disappointed. They though I wasn't working at all. I talk to them about the fact that I wanted to get in en engineer school, but since they are skinflint (like hell. My mother once had a fight in a market cause the cashier didn't want to accept a reduction ticket of 1$ that was actually expired), I said the admission contest was free. They were supporting me, telling me they are pround that I try to find something else instead of just giving up, that they will support me and help me because they would be pround to have one of their childrend in a prestigious school.

The day I had that mail telling me I was accepted in this school, they only said ""oh that's great.."" without any smile or happiness in their voices. Later, my dad comes up and told me that I was just a lazy dumb priviliged child, that I only got accepted because my parents had the financial potential to pay my school, that my shool was only a money pump, and that if my parents had to use the financial help of my school, I never would have been accepted. They said then that they refuse to pay my studies, and that I had to find a little job in a market or in a sport club or anything else. They confessed me that in fact, they never believed I would have been accepted, and they don't believe I will success my studies. They don't want to ""waste money and time for something we know you will fail"". 

Instead of that, they keep bringing our sick cat to a vet every 3 f#ck#ng day, and when the vet says ""there is nothing else to do but wait that the treatment work"", they go to an other vet. They drived this morning during 3 hours to bring him to a new vet. And it's been 2 month he is sick. My cat is now scared of them, he is hidding under my bed al the day, shive of fear when he hear my parents are coming, he is not allowed to get out of the house, and is forced to sleep with them like if he was a teddy bear. He have a treatment, but my parents don't do it because ""it is only here to make him even more suffer so we can keep paying this vet for years"". My cat got a skin's desease wich makes him losing his skin and bleeding a lot on his back, neck, and  throat. Since they refused to do the treatment, I did it my self, paying it with my own money again and guess what ? He got nothing else anymore on his back and neck...

I can't tell them that I and only I help ""THEIR"" cat to get better, and that I paid my admission contest because they are really really pround, and it will be even worse. But I worked like hell to get in this school, and they lied to me and now refuse to pay my studies so they can keep briging their beloved cat to the vet for nothing ? Some of them know my parents and even refuse now to see them and I have to bring my cat instead. 

So I only see 3 possibilities now : I convince them to pay my studies (help me), I give up and work in something else, or I find 6000 bucks in less than a month....

PS: I even though once to kill my cat... I think it will be even worst

Thanks for the help, and I apologies for my bad english once again",06Feb2020,1
380,"So quick backstory. I'm 20 now, ive been in college for about 1 and a half year. 90% of the credits i have finished are basics, things required for all majors. When i started college i was super excited for my future, i was an education major, i wanted to be an english teacher abroad and get my TEFL certification. I researched every minute detail of this career for years.

Before last semester started my family was having money issues. I got a job while i was in college and didn't get financial aid. My dad told me i didn't get financial aid because of my major and told me i need to switch it to something practical, but im thinking that wasnt the reason. I thought teaching was pretty practical and not as competitive as higher up jobs. But i wanted to make him happy and i switched to nursing because a lot of people from our family are nurses and it seemed everyone else is doing it. I thought it would work out well for me.

Now my issue, my grades are alright. Mostly B's but everyday i go to school im dreading it and im really not looking forward to my future anymore and im losing motivation. I hear all my friends in the nursing program talk about how difficult it is, how competitive it is, how theres not as many jobs as people said there were for nurses here, how much they hate it but they do it because they either have a true passion for it or they are doing it to move up as an NP or CRNA.

I guess i want to ask strangers on the internet what they'd do, it sucks to be questioning your future. My options are either stay with nursing through the rest of school and take my chances on the job competition with my low scores. I can change back to education and disappoint my dad and everyone i lied to when i told them i was so excited for nursing. Or i can just switch back and not tell anyone for a while. Overall, i have money for school now so money isn't an issue for me it's mostly my appearance to family/friends and my future im worried about.",06Feb2020,1
383,There was this girl at school she was one of my best friends and we hung out all the time she became depressed a few short months after I met her and one time while we are hanging out she lifted up her pants on accident and her legs were covered up and down with scars across all of her legs after that she started becoming less and less social she was put into a mental hospital for a while but her dad is Rich so he pretty much just bought her out so me and my friends were trying to help her and she refused to accept our help anyway she only wanted help from her online role-play girlfriend pedals it made us all Angry we were friends with benefits the entire time but one day I was talking to my friend Greg and he says you know what you should do if you pull the girlfriend card and she says yes you can help her and then I decided you know what that's not a half-bad idea and about a week later a ton of planning and then I asked her then she says no and then I told her okay I hope you're happy (non sarcastically) then she gets worried about me and starts going on about how she thinks I'm going to kill myself or blah blah blah whatever and she eventually get so worried that she shows her parents and what they do is probably the best thing I've ever seen they decide to press charges for sexual harassment now I'm not allowed to talk to her because of a restraining order I can't go near her if I make eye contact with her I'm supposed to put my hands up and walk away now she wants to meet up and try and patch things up what do I do,06Feb2020,1
385,"Hi, first off, sorry everyone for putting this here. It looks like most of the other posts are about way more important stuff than this, but I'm hoping it won't bother anyone to put this here, as it seems like the correct spot technically nontheless.

I also apologize so much that it's long. There's a lot of backstory. I really do appreciate your time so much.

I (33/M) let my (now-ex) boyfriend move in with me (32/M) last year at the beginning of the summer because he was going to not have a place to live. I was upfront and honest that I felt uncomfortable moving that fast, but he was desperate so I agreed to let him move into my house, because I wouldn't have been able to live with the guilt at making someone homeless basically. 

The thing is, he's always been really sensitive about two things that frequently put me in a bind. One thing is he's really sensitive to people feeling sorry for him. The other thing is that he also feels (due to a lot of very crappy legit trauma in his childhood) that people discard him and he just ruins lives wherever he goes. Of course my first instinct is to think the best about people and try to reassure them of the reasons that's not true. And one way I do that is by giving them a safe space to exist - for free of course. I don't want anyone to feel discarded. And I don't ever expect anything from anyone. But that's turned out to kind of be my undoing.

Gradually, what became a safe space for him became pretty difficult for me. I have PTSD and a lot of anxiety and other issues to the point where I actually have trouble being around other people for a long time (case in point, prior to him, I hadn't lived with any roommates for almost ten years and invited a friend over maybe once or twice). (Also yes, I do see a therapist regularly for these issues) He's here 24/7 and it's really really difficult some days because he will want to talk (usually about depressing or traumatic things) even on days when I really can barely stand to be out of bed. Asking for space explicitly isn't really an option because he doesn't drive or have anywhere to go for a long amount of time, and the ask makes him panic a little and I think triggers him a little due to a lot of past rejection.

Well, after months and months of him not getting help for his mental illness, and several incidents that re-traumatized me due to this, I finally broke up with him. He did seek help at that point, although he has been less proactive it seems about getting further, permanent help (and yes, I have offered to pay for it and/or drive him). I didn't kick him out obviously though and after several months, he still lives with me.

But probably since before our break-up, I've been stressed as hell and walking an emotional tightrope. You see, I have to hide how I really feel about things in order to avoid triggering him and ESPECIALLY avoid the dreaded argument about me just letting him stay because I feel sorry for him. But even if it wasn't that way before, it kind of is now. Before I was like ""maybe this can work. Maybe we'll both grow. Maybe we'll both enjoy it."" But I was so wrong. If I really sit down and pull all the feelings up to the surface that I've been repressing about this situation, I realize I am just letting him stay here out of feeling sorry. But also...How am I supposed to feel anything else? A lot of things about what he talks to me about trigger me or up my anxiety. Him being here constantly ups my anxiety as well (not just him...any person really). And yet I have to stuff these feelings of anxiousness and a STRONG desire to move on and live alone again, because confronting him or straight-up asking him to move out soon will lead to arguments and frustration at best, or triggering him completely at worst. I really don't like confrontation. And I like triggering someone MUCH LESS than that.

I find that over time, I've really become sadly kind of resentful. I kind of hate myself for it actually. Every time he talks to me about something stressful or traumatic, I really want to approach it with compassion, but I'm just burned out. And I don't even know how to say it without making things even worse. It seems like every other day a new disaster happens. And to make things harder, he helps with things around the house sometimes and cooks sometimes, so I feel super ungrateful for even thinking about the resentment.

Ultimately, it's my fault I'm depressed and anxious I know - because I let him move in in the first place and I continue to let him stay here even though I knew like weeks into last summer that it was NOT the arrangement for me. But I don't know how to change that because like I said. Explicitly asking him to move out soon is too much of a landmine. He did say he'd probably need to be here no later than June 1st, but what scares me is that I don't see him making any effort to accomplish that move (he has a LOT of things we'll either need to store or sell or move, most likely. he also hasn't looked into renting a place anywhere as far as I know). At least not any time soon. It stresses me out because I don't think I can even make it to June without losing my mind, partly because it looks like he's not going to actually make an effort to stick to that. Meanwhile, I myself am actually trying to actually get my house on the market to move, and this is a delay that is solely for his benefit...I'm not sure he realizes that.

Anyway, whew. There's the backstory. So. Getting back to the resentment part. Yes. I've done more than I actually can handle and coped with more than I can (I won't go into details about his mental illness and what it specifically is, but I am triggered on a semi-regular basis by the way some of the symptoms manifest, even though I try to cope with this or ignore it...usually that doesn't 100% work). And today I got to a breaking point. What happened was he was arguing with me about something or other in the doorway - it was something that looking back, was really stupid. We were arguing who was right about a word for something...Anyway he ended up letting my cat out into the freezing weather at night by accident. Now this cat is a feral rescue who, last time he was outside, had fun almost getting hit by cars every few minutes, darting across the street like a fool. I have REALLY grown attached to this little guy and have tried really hard to take care of him. Well he just darts out the door like it's nothing because he used to live outside obviously. He takes off into the night and I break down pretty much and crumbled into tears. Because it felt like just...After all the triggering I had endured, and after everything I had stuffed trying to make my ex's life better and more stable, like the one precious thing I gained after this stressful, trigger-filled year was GONE just like that.

Because as much as I tried to rationalize it, any joy I had from the relationship was gone by the beginning of last summer. And I still don't know how much of the friendship is what I want vs. what I convince myself I want because I know he wouldn't want me to just feel sorry for him. 

But my little buddy was gone. And my ex just like could not grasp the impact of it. He honestly kind of acted like it was no big deal. He apologized, but honestly, every apology he makes seems like he just wants me to tell him it's ok so he can go back to doing the same things or just not caring about certain things.

But what can I do? It was an accident. I can't be mad about an accident right? But I messed up. I slipped up. That was just the breaking point for me. I finally said something close to what was on my mind. That I was tired and spent and despite everything, he's not better, and essentially because he cared more about being right about a thing than anything important to me, I almost lost something very precious, and one of the few things that gave me comfort while I was living with him. I wouldn't say I lost it, but I was firm about it. And I finally came clean about repressing a lot of frustration.

Well he got reaaaaalllly quiet and left. And then he posts on facebook about how he's a burden and ruins everyone's life and everything and I'm like goddamn it I feel terrible. I don't even know what to do. See I was trying to prevent this. He says everyone else discards him and says he's ""too much"" and now in one moment I've just gone and done the same thing and basically thrown away the year I spent trying to help out. To make matters worse, I managed to lure my cat back with great effort and a LOT of food, so I basically got upset for nothing.

I just feel so completely helpless. What should I do though? Obviously I can't just pretend I never said anything I said. It's out of the bag now that I feel sorry for him and that resentment has been building because I'm frustrated with my living situation (and the related mental illness stuff). I can't hide it now. But that's also going to make things really awkward. And to make matters worse, he's still going to live here until he moves out. So I basically have to spend an indefinite amount of time in a living situation made more awkward by my own hand. 

I really need advice. Has anyone been in a similar situation? What did you do to make things right and dispel tension? I'm not sure an apology from me would cut it at this point. Also, is there even a way to help someone move out or ask them to move out without turning everything into a tense disaster like I did? How can I do better? What should I have done? What should I do?",06Feb2020,1
386,"Preface:
So I met a guy or whatever and we mostly talk and hangout through PUBG which is super weird whatever lol. So I always play with my two friend let’s call them F and M (lol idk). We play a lot with all four of us and we chat and fool around. F, M, and myself always tease that me or M is going to date said crush and we both say we don’t like him (but I’m pretty sure we both have a crush lol). Anyways my crush does this thing where he is only online for like 20 mins and just disappears and doesn’t always play with just us (totally understandable whatever). But F was saying that my crush only plays when M is online and I am not normally this insecure but I really like him and we don’t know each other that well yet and are just friends right now. I’m even planning on transferring universities next year to the same one he is at (totally unrelated as I realize I kind of sound like a stalker). 

Anyways he is really sweet and awkward but he doesn’t really like talking about himself all that much so anyways I need advice on 2 things:
1. Do you guys think he likes my friend based of the little knowledge I have given (sorry just comment and I can clarify)
2. How do you low key flirt with someone who doesn’t like to talk about himself (more likes to talk to you and listen which is great but I don’t like one sided relationships)

TLDR: I like a guy and my friend might like him. Other friend teased he likes said friend. And I need help flirting with a guy who doesn’t like to talk about himself that much.

Thanks for any help and I’m pretty new to this whole flirting shebang and any help would be great :)",06Feb2020,1
388,"Questioning my sexuality; in desperate need of advice

Hi, so I’m ... not sure how to begin this, lol. I guess I’ll just get into it with a little bit of background. Bear with me, I have a lot to explain.

I’m eighteen and female. For most of my life (up until a few months ago, when I got out of a very toxic household situation) I have been severely isolated. I had no friends as a kid and nobody to talk to outside my mother for years. My mom basically both mentally abused and neglected me, and kept us indoors all the time. I never went to school, and we’d stay in the house for months and months at a time, partly because my mother is a seriously neurotic recluse, and also because I have really really bad executive dysfunction due to ADD, and that, coupled with the fact that I took care of her (sick and unable/unwilling to care for herself) and the whole house (she was a neat freak to an insane degree) which made it impossibly difficult to ever get out of the house and do anything. Seriously, it was like being imprisoned.

Okay, so the reason this is relevant and not just me ranting is this: as well as having ADD, I am also a maladaptive daydreamer. I have extremely vivid daydreams—“visions”, as I call them—where I can interact with fictional characters and have full-blown relationships with them. I’ve always been in love with multiple fictional characters, ever since I was little. They talk to me, spend time with me, and it’s like being in a polyamorous love relationship with multiple characters. Extremely passionate and deep and unbreakable bonds with people that aren’t tangible or accessible to you. 

Fiction and inner fantasy worlds were my escape from my awful situation. And that’s all great, but of course, there’s a big problem to it: I can never interact with them physically. I can’t have sex with them, cuddle them, move in together and start a life with them, or go on a date with them. And while the visions are vivid and beautiful, it’s just ... not enough.

For most of my life I’ve considered myself to be bisexual. And I’ve made my peace with this issue so far by telling myself that I can be in love with the characters I communicate with mentally, as well as having a relationship with someone real. Either someone who reminds me of them, or someone I love just as much. This past year I finally made friends with some people that I adore with my whole heart, and one of them is now my girlfriend. She’s the most sweet, caring, angelic person. She looks after my mental health and loves me in this very unconditional way that honestly makes me want to cry out of gratitude. But I’m pretty devastated, because I now realize that I’m incapable of viewing her as anything other than a very very close and beloved friend.

I thought I could be in a romantic relationship with her as well as the fictional characters I love, but it’s not working. As beautiful and lovable as she is, I feel no attraction to her. I’ve tried to force myself to have the same feelings for that I would have for a fictional character, but they just won’t start developing. We’ve had some sexual experiences together, and while it’s far from uncomfortable, I always end up faking my arousal and enjoyment of it. I get nothing from it. And it’s bizarre, because I actually have a pretty insatiable sex drive for fictional characters, but with my girlfriend, I feel like I’m asexual. Sex-positive, happy to please her and show her how much I love her, but getting barely anything from it whatsoever.

I don’t know what to think, at this point. Like I said, I’m a pretty horny person with a high sex drive. But only for fictional characters. I’ve had a couple relationships in the past—one with a boy and one with another girl—and in both cases I got nothing out of the sexual aspect. It’s really like I’m asexual for real people and intensely sexual for fictional characters.

Ideally, I would like to have a relationship with a person who wouldn’t mind playing different roles for me, either dressing up as a character and impersonating them, or doing some sort of text-based sexual role-play with me very frequently, interspersed with me fulfilling their half of the sexual needs of the relationship, by just letting them be themself while I make love to them. And I could talk to my current girlfriend about it, and “come out” to her as fictosexual, but I’m scared it would break her heart to know that most of my sexual and romantic experiences with her were me trying to please her, as opposed to me actively enjoying it and seeking it out. And I wouldn’t want her to feel that I’m “rejecting” her for fictional characters, either.

Even if all goes well, and I explain this to her and she’s okay with me being that way, there’s no way that I can know that she’ll be comfortable with role-playing for me. And if that’s the case, what do I do? Break up with her? Or stay in the relationship, with both of us knowing I don’t get anything out of it beyond close friendship?

Any option I can think of seems terrifying to me. Even admitting to myself that I don’t feel anything sexual for her was terrifying. But it’s making me feel like I should just resign to the fact that I’ll never fall in love with her that way, and stay in the relationship knowing I’ll never feel fulfilled, and all our sexual and romantic experiences will leave me empty and disappointed with myself. But I really, really don’t want to resign myself to that. And I don’t want to break up with her out of fear of ruining our friendship by hurting her. 

I don’t know what to do. For a while I’ve been feeling like I might be broken or fucked up in some way. And I feel like I’m tied to something I don’t want to lose that is, at the same time, preventing me from exploring other relationships that might be more mutually satisfying. She’s one of the only friends I’ve ever had. I don’t want to fuck it up. Ever.

TL;DR: I’m in a relationship but can’t feel attraction to anyone other than fictional characters, and I don’t want to break my girlfriend’s heart by leaving her because I love her very much in a platonic sense, but I get nothing out of the relationship when it comes to sex and romance. What should I do?",06Feb2020,1
389,"I work in an open-plan office, which  is a challenging situation at the best of times, but being seated  directly across from a certain manager makes it an absolute nightmare.  To be clear, he isn't my manager, but the manager of a closely-related  team.

Quite simply, this guy  spends as much time as humanly possible mocking people behind their back  in the most smug, sarcastic, condescending tone imaginable, often as  soon as they're out of earshot after he was nice to them to their faces.  The common theme to all of his mockery is how stupid he thinks everyone  else is. He genuinely seems to think that if someone is, in his  opinion, stupid, then they've earned his mockery and have nobody to  blame but themselves.

For example,  when coming back to their desks after a meeting with another team, one  of his team members, who at the time hadn't been on his team for long,  had the following exchange with him:

**TEAM MEMBER:** I thought that went well

**MANAGER:** It doesn't matter. They're all far too stupid to get customers to sign off on anything.

**TEAM MEMBER:** Well, maybe they'll surprise you.

**MANAGER:** Oooooh, I wouldn't bet on it.

This  was over a year ago. Said team member now sits right next to him and  gleefully joins in when he's talking shit about people.

&amp;#x200B;

He often won't even refer to people by their names, but by insults instead:

""Okay, we'll fill out the spreadsheet that Stupid sent us and send it back to Stupid""

""Where's Fuck-Up's email? What did Fuck-Up have to say?""

&amp;#x200B;

I've  lost count of the number of people I've heard him do the following  impersonation of in a childish tone of voice, holding his clenched hands  below his eyes like a caricature of someone crying:

""\*whining sounds\* Uh-uh-uh, I don't know what I'm doing, uh-uh-uh \*whining sounds\*""

&amp;#x200B;

One  of his now-former employees, when reading through some communication  from HR, asked him what the team's mission statement was, he looked  around to see who was within earshot, and said in a low voice that it  was to trash-talk people without them knowing about it.

He  mocks coworkers, customers, even total strangers. Any change to what a  customer asks from us isn't because of changing needs, according to him.  No, it's because they're too stupid to know what they need in the first  place.

I  recently overheard him  reading out a negative Glassdoor review from a former employee,  laughing about how funny it was and how he'd have to send it around to  people he knows. He also, that same day, mocked news stories about coronavirus victims, insisting that contracting the virus came down to the victims' own stupidity. 

Whenever  I've heard him being asked why someone did something, I don't think  I've ever heard him give a different answer than ""because they're a  fucking idiot"".

The worst thing is  that the people he uses as his audience absolutely love the stuff he  says, secure in their belief that if he's using them as his audience,  then they're in his inner circle and safe from being mocked themselves.

Just today, he mocked my work to my face when we were both there late after most people had left, despite the  fact that I did the work the way my boss, and my boss's boss (incidentally, the bully bully manager's boss) asked me to. I've overheard him mocking me  before when he didn't think I was there, and a former manager from work who is a friend of his once told me the stuff he's said about me. The former manager thought it was hilarious, because apparently mocking people behind their back is funny.

There's nothing I want more than to report him, but I don't believe for a second that he would face any kind of punishment, or that it would turn out well for me.  He's worked at the company for over 25 years, and is personal friends  with too many of the people who would have the power to punish or get  rid of him, include his boss and his boss's boss. I've read that over 70% of people who report bullies at work get retaliated against, including losing their jobs, being forced to transfer roles and generally being ill-treated by the bully's friends. For someone as popular and well-protected as him, being retaliated against is a virtual certainty.

396,"Sorry for throwaway but definitely necessary 

I live with my mom, sister, and dad. Im 18, sister 20.

Context - 

My dad is the smartest and hard working person I know. He is the rock that holds our whole family up. But i'm worried that he has had enough. My sister is special needs although we don't actually know to what extent. Mild autism would be the closest but there is definitely more going on. Anyways, she is almost living in her own bubble right now and takes our all anger on my dad. She hits him, swears, calls him nasty things like sex offender. It's really awful and he has completely stopped responding when she does things like that. He will literally stand there while he gets hit for doing NOTHING and doesn't say anything. He has been trying to stop it for years but he has really hit his breaking point with this. My mom doesn't truly understand how bad its gotten, and yells at my dad every time he tries to actually deal with the problem. My mom couldn't be fucked to do anything as she doesn't wanna deal with my sister screaming for hours for doing something small like taking her phone. Which leads me into the next problem. I'm worried my dad has also given up on my mom due to all of this. I mean this is SERIOUS abuse my dad is taking and my mom simply doesn't care. The only time they speak is at night in bed (at least they still share a bed at this point). I truly believe the only reason he is still around is because of his character. But everyone has a breaking point. I constantly think about how undervalued he is in this family and it seriously breaks my heart (getting a little teary eyed writing this lol) On top of that, my grandpa (dads dad) is on his last legs. I know how much my dad loves him and that makes everything so much worse. Not to mention I feel like a complete disappointment. I'm overweight and go to a community college. Meanwhile him and his whole family attended university, two of his sisters became lawyers. He wrote the LSAT too but just didn't want to commit to law school.

398,"I have sleeping problems - I so not suffer from insomnia, I've executive dysfunction so problems with task-shift aka I find it hard to stop what I'm doing to go to bed. It's neurological not lack of discipline. Sleeping is no problem, in fact I sleep too long and when paired with lack of routine I often find myself waking up in the evening. 

Currently it's 9am and I've not been to sleep yet, I'm considering staying up just so I can get things done but know I'll not get to sleep until anywhere from 4am-8am tomorrow, thus feel like shit. I want to sleep but I'm struggling to get myself to go to bed and if I do I'll likely oversleep so not be able to go grocery shopping etc (thus no food).

I've been this way as long as I can remember, due to either shift work or not working at all I've not had a sleep routine in twenty years (back when I was at school). I'm nocturnal and fear I'll never have a sleep routine, let alone one that works with the 9-5 of the rest of the world. 

I know lots of people struggle with disrupted sleep routines, they maybe have to change due to new jobs etc. but do they ever actually manage to get a new sleep pattern to stick long-term?

400,"Hi I’ll try and keep this short
So I was going out with this girl for a few days and then broke the relationship because I thought she didn’t like me but now I realise she actually did and we were meant to go out for valentines so she booked a day off work and now she’s going with another guy because she felt lonely after I left and promised him she would, but the thing is I started talking to her again and there’s a big chance I could get back with her, should I bother to chase her or not? I mean she’s going on a date with someone for valentines even if we get together because she promised them

It kinda breaks my heart that some other guy will be taking her out and makes me not wanna go for her again but she says it’s not that deep and stuff, but it’s vday and she’s going out with another guy, there’s no way it isn’t deep. I also believe she’s much closer with that guy and talks to him more despite her saying otherwise &amp; she started talking to me less, I feel like she talks to this guy more

It kinda breaks my heart every time I think about what they’re gonna do whenever I think of her, shall I try and get back with her or try and move on?

It’s hard because I’m pretty sure she’s calling this guy every day and me and her only called like an hour 2 times so I really think she likes him more even though she says it’s nothing

I said why would you wear pants you know you didnt buy- just apologise etc. She said you have no empathy, I thought they were clothes that belonged to one of my ex boyfriends string of women he had affairs with. What? Mum, furious at me agreed with her. To me this just looked like her shifting the blame so she didnt have to apologise and be wrong (shes never apologised for being wrong before).

405,"backstory: it’s me and k’s first relationship and we’ve been together for 4 months. we have conflicting political views, different sex drives, and k is “pc” while i’m more problematic.

ive struggled with marijuana abuse for almost 5 years. i genuinely believe it has taken a toll on my psyche and in general the kind of person i am. last week, i decided to begin therapy and try and stop my addiction, hoping that i would be able to turn myself into a better person before school started

k is honestly such an amazing person. she’s so beautiful, sweet, charming, funny, etc. i don’t know why i decided to break up with her. it was a mix of things i guess. it was these small things during our dates that just rubbed me the wrong way, it was the sex too i guess. don’t get me wrong — the sex was great. but she wanted to have sex ALL THE TIME and frankly i don’t have that kind of sex drive

another thing too, i felt like i was just a borderline awful person towards her. i would make these jokes about her face, her weight, etc and i would try and get her to understand they were “jokes,” but honestly i’ve been thinking about it a lot and i was just a horrible person. i can’t believe she put up with me.

when i finally decided to break up with her i sent her this huge paragraph apologizing for everything that i’ve done to her and that i really need a break from a relationship to sort myself out. basically, her response was “i think we should have a permanent break” with other words and stuff

—-OKAY NOW TO THE ACTUAL ADVICE PART


she texted me this morning asking if we could hang out in person and talk about things, basically saying we didn’t “leave things on the right note.” 

i oblige, we meet up, and she BASICALLY says she wants to get back together

i don’t know why but every time i think about that moment, and every moment i’ve had with her, it just makes me regret telling her we’re incompatible. some of the happiest moments i’ve had these past few months have been with her, and i genuinely don’t know what to do. i care about her so much but i don’t know if i’ll look shallow if i just come running back to her or whatever. i really just wanted time to myself so i can try and go sober, rationalize my problems, etc.

i just keep having these conflicting thoughts where i say “oh i think it’s best for the both of us if we remain friends,” but then i remember all of the happy moments we had together, and how much she made my day and how much of an amazing person she is and GOD do i just feel like a mess. i really do care about this person but i don’t know if i should go back to her.

what if i continue to treat her badly? what if we really are not compatible together? what if she’s already moved on? what if i just make myself look like a fool? what if i just need to stay single to focus on my own problems? I DONT KNOW

Today I was working and my manager noticed the hickeys on my neck and teased me saying shit like I'm too old for that shit and giving me shit since we work in a professional environment. Because her and I are close I told her about my involvement with this guy not really realizing it was a big deal. She got really serious and told me that she was never going to schedule us together again (we don't work the same shift so not a big deal) and that I absolutely cannot let my general manager know because it's a ""huge no-no"". 

I read our employee handbook from cover to end after the first time we hooked up to see if it said anything about relationships and it doesn't. It only specifies we shouldn't seek relationships with our clients. This guy and I work totally different shifts and if we ever saw each other it would only be for five minutes or so during a shift change so I don't really understand what the big deal is.

It’s very frustrating because I turned down so many people who I thought I may have made special memories and connections with even if it didn’t lead to marriage, so am I being ridiculous?

She always asks about him whenever we hang out alone which I find strange because she has a boyfriend of her own so why not just talk about him? Whenever he says something even mildly insulting to me, she snickers. And she can do no wrong in his eyes. 

He does the simplest things for her and she gets overly excited about them, like getting her food or lifting her bags. She basically squeals and grins the whole time. Yet whenever I do anything for her or anybody for that matter, she never reacts like that.

421,"Hi Reddit. I'm a little new to this whole website and to be honest, for a good long while I was in denial about this situation, too, so I hope you wont judge either of us too harshly. 

My friend is tied to his wheelchair after a motorcycle accident when he was younger, and now has some pretty severe pain in the parts of his body that weren't permanently paralyzed, as well as some PTSD associated with the event. That, I, nor anyone else, can of course blame him for. I'm suffering with mobility issues myself too (bad back and shortened tendons in my calves making it hard for me to walk or stand up) and know this is no excuse, but I feel it's still necessary to mention as it does add some context to the situation. 

My friend is an animal lover, despite his faults; I know he is, because he spends more time caring for his animals than he does himself, but I worry that neither of those things are enough. Let me explain. 

He has two large parrot cages full of rats, two freeroam rabbits (which, as far as I'm concerned is lovely, and there's no criticism I could lay on him for letting his bunnies roam free in his abode), three snakes, three leopard geckos, two guinea pigs, two bearded dragons, and, I'm sure, since it's been a while since I was last at his apartment, a few other additions to his already rather large animal family. He did mention wanting hedgehogs as well as more snakes. 

His rats are what I'm most concerned about. 

Here's my issue: 

* His place always reeks to high hell of unattended litterbins and cages. I have animals too, as well as a hardy bit of depression and my own issues with mobility, and I know this can be a struggle, so I don't necessarily blame him for it. I do, however, blame him for his borderline hoarding of the animals in his care. 
* The waterbottles he supplies his rats with are absolutely filthy with algae. I don't think they've been cleaned once in the ten+ years he's had them. 
* There are *holes* in his rats cages so the rats have easy and free roam of his apartment. Many of these are not handtame rats, and I've noticed his rabbits have a fair bit of scabbing around their ears and feet. 
* His guinea pigs do not have a top for their cage and they're elevated above the ground. He insists it is no issue, but I can't help but worry that one day one of the guinea pigs will take a leap and fall to either their deaths or their undeniable injury. 
* His snakes always have stuck shed. Always. I try my best to peel off the pieces of stuck shed as best I can whenever I visit, but it should not be an issue in the first place. 
* He live-feeds his snakes. This I know is a hot topic for debate, but I thought it necessary to mention. It personally makes my heart bleed to hear the rats scream. 
* Neither of his bearded dragons have their tails anymore. I have not asked why. 
* Most of his animals are NOT tame. The exceptions are his guinea pigs, one of his bearded dragons and maybe two of his rats, as well as his snakes and rabbits, but the rest are rather defensive and I, as well as he, have suffered some rather horrific bites as a result of this. 
* His animals are on the loose. A lot. Mainly rats, but his other animals have also gotten a chance to take a walk through his apartment and that's worrying to me. I understand that sometimes animals can escape, but it's a running joke that there's always at least one animal free in his home. 
* The apartment is in an almost constant state of disarray; I do not blame him, mine is too, I have my own mental health as well as mobility issues as I mentioned, but it is not to the result that his is, and his rabbits, as I might have mentioned, roam free. I'm worried one day they are going to ingest plastic and go into stasis. 

How do I mention any of this without coming across as an asshole?   
As I said, I struggle with my own health issues, but my animals will always be my number one priority. I will admit I have quite a few more than most people would be okay with (three cats, a dog and a cockatiel, and I hope to add more animals to my family in the future), but I like to believe my husbandry is in above average condition. 

I know his health is fragile and I worry even more about what's going to happen to all of his animals if one day he just doesn't survive the rough treatment he's been given, and also, gives himself. He claims he has help with his animals once a week but I, as well as everyone else with a set of eyes and a set of nostrils, can decipher that that's either a blatant lie or they just give it a once-over, maybe switch out the newspaper in the bottom of the rats cages, and then move on with their day.

so today’s the day when I thought about doing nothing for a day. and i don’t know if it’s the best solution.

so here’s the thing. college has started on 27th of January and i’m already tired. I’ve submitted my degree essay on the 20th of January and had a week off afterwards, but now we’re starting to work on our Final Major Projects and that’s a lot of work. 


So everyday now I do other college projects, which involve me drawing a lot, French, Japanese, I also have a young puppy who I walk five times a day for 15 minutes. Also, I’m helping a friend with her Final Major Project, writing short stories for kids each and every day. Since I don’t have much spare time, I only eat a 100g. of pasta each day and a little bit of chips sometimes. I also now help a guy buy and ship something for his collection from my country and dealing with PayPal is extremely stressful. So yeah, that’s what I do every day. I wake up at 8AM and go to bed at 2AM. I’ve been living like this for the past 2 weeks and I didn’t rest for a day. And I think that I may need some. But I love working, I just feel that the quality of my work is not that good now:(

I'm a young guy, my own parents are broke and everything I've ever had I earned myself, and I've been trying to save a long time.

Anyway he didn't specify an amount, but he told me to keep it between me and him, he didn't want my parents, or my Nan or anyone knowing about it.

Now I'm not really a shady guy, and this sort of thing puts a guilty pit in my stomach like, I'm usually pretty open about things. I spoke to my girlfriend for some reassurance, she thought yeah maybe he's ill and he wants to do something good (he did say to me ""wanted to do something before I go"" couldnt tell if it was a joke or.. he's not that old) and that if he wants to do it, I should atleast respect his wishes.

My question is, what do I do? I guess what I'm worried about is if he found out I said something he'd be let down about it, and maybe not find me trustworthy enough to use the money wisely, I mean it seems fair if someone's going to do something like that they might have their reasons why they want to keep it on the low.

On the other hand, I feel bad being.. dishonest? Or just not saying it to anyone, I feel like I'm being sneaky not telling anyone, and yeah it's just not a situation I'm ever in so I dont really know what to make of it.

433,"Knife to mouth solution

I have an extremely odd question / solution idea that i can not find the answers or opinions anywhere else (understandably so..) 
To most, this will sound like a very stupid question, i understand if that’s the response i receive
I have a god awful insecurity about my mouth, it’s rather small but not only that, it just about has no corners, it ruins my entire face, it looks like a dash “ - “ and i’m near tears daily feeling like if it was just a little different i would be much more content with my face..
I have always loved mouths that have longer and sharper corners and this brings me to the question, if i were to cut the corners of my mouth just a little so a scar can give the illusion of a slightly wider mouth and actual corners, would this even work? 
I know surgery is the option with more common sense but i’m light years away from affording even half of that and just desperately want a possible quick solution i can do from home.. 
This mindset is sort of bordering the “what if i just break my own nose so i can get a nose job from insurance” category, if there’s anyone out there who has also reached that point.
I’ve always been the type to find alternate options even if they’re extremely odd or idiotic sounding if it works
Any replies are welcome, just know i understand how this sounds, it’s just coming from someone who is constantly at war with themself and i’m struggling with a fixation of just one small thing.
I don’t necessarily need to be told that i probably look fine and its just in my head or that i should learn to accept the features i have, i know this but ultimately it’s just something i really want for myself...

434,"Hi all, 
(Apologies in advance, I am mobile so grammar might not be the best.) 

I’m a little unsure of how to handle this work situation so I could use some help. I started working for a bank around 9 months ago, and I only got my drivers license 4 months into work there. So I am not a very strong/confident driver yet, and my boss has me working at a location 40 minutes away from my home branch. During the 4 months that I did not have my license my boyfriend and his family would help get me to and from work. There were a couple occasions where we (myself and the other closing associate) would have to wait for him or whoever was getting me to arrive. We aren’t suppose to wait inside the branch because it’s a security issue, which is fine I get it, so I’ve always been more than willing to go somewhere else and wait.  I have been driving myself to/from work for the last 4 months, so we haven’t had this issue in a while.   
This week I have asked my boyfriend and his family to help out as I’m not comfortable driving the route. There was an accident that caused the person getting me to be 30 minutes late.  The person getting me left at a reasonable time that were it not for the accident they would have been on time. I wrote my manager an email and explained that I was very sorry for the tardiness of my ride, and that there was an accident that caused them to be late.   
She wrote me back and said that this is an on going issue, that it very negatively impacts the other associates and the branch as a whole as we all have lives after closing, and how I’ve said that my ride is only “5 minutes away” and it turns into 20 -40 minutes. She said that we should never have to wait for them to pick me up. 
I understand what she said, but it’s not an on going issue as it hasn’t happened in my months because I can drive myself to/from my home branch, and when it has happened in the past I have always been more than willing to go another place to wait for my ride so that we can get out and the other person can go home for the night. I just want to explain myself in a way that allows me to get out what I want to say without upsetting her.",06Feb2020,1

451,"I started four months ago and have found it a very demanding, challenging job requiring meticulous focus and attention to detail while balancing several urgent priorities at once. Basically, my position requires strengths in areas I have weaknesses in because of ADHD. I have enjoyed the challenge and opportunities for constant learning it has provided, but not matching up to the requirements of the role has unfortunately exacerbated the depression. And the depression is now affecting my work, as I've had a few embarrassing instances now of negative feedback causing me to cry in front of colleagues and also my boss. 

I've started seeing a psychologist in the last week, started running again with the guidance of a running coach, and am seeing my psychiatrist again next week to review medication, plus a nutritionist for the first time. I'm tackling the depression from nearly every angle I can think of, but I'm terrified Im going to be let go before the end of my probation because I've screwed up one too many times. Honestly, if I did get let go it might be a relief because I must have thought about resigning 200 times - but it would be a massive blow to my self-esteem and finances. Financial stress is enormous at the moment, so I can neither afford to lose nor resign from my job.

I'm having a meeting with my manager tomorrow, and am considering saying something along the lines of 'I have a condition which I have recently begun treatment for.' Except, that might raise issues of needing to document it with HR, and questions about what accommodations I might need. And from what I've read on Reddit, employees who need accommodations are seen as a problem and the employer starts looking for alternative employees.

I've never felt like I had to disclose my health conditions to any employer previously, so it has never come up. But my new job is unlike anything I've ever done, so I'm wondering that informing my manager that I'm getting help, so to speak, might assist me? That way they might see me as being proactive and not just a stressed out, emotional, anxious mess. 

My idea was to communicate that my performance is likely to improve over the coming months because of that assistance. If they ask about accommodations, I was going to say I didn't think there was anything I wasn't already implementing - for example, I keep a written running sheet of events that occur each day I'm at work with the date and time already, and take copious notes on anything I need to remember. If anything, just to emphasize that having everything in writing is super beneficial for me.

Has anyone had experience in this? Have you disclosed health or mental health or disability matters to your employer, without actually having to specify what it is?",06Feb2020,1
452,"Without going into too much detail, I graduated about a year and a half ago, and convinced my employer to create a new role for me which was a much closer fit to what I actually went to college for.

After about 8 incredibly stressful and anxiety-ridden months, I was 'let go' (it's much more complicated than that and a lot of what they did was actually illegal but this isn't the focus of what I'm asking).

This experience really fucked with my confidence, and now I've been unemployed for just over 6 months, with this being my only post-college work experience in a non-service industry job. It sucks so much. I get less done in a week now than I would get done in a day writing my thesis with a part-time job and extra-curriculars. I can't plan for anything more than a week in advance ^just ^in ^case. It's depression purgatory. I feel like a useless sack of shit pretty much all the time. 

Aside from the shittiness of it all, a huge source of anxiety for me is explaining this gap to potential employers.

455,"Is my EX in the wrong or am I?

I’ll try make this short.. I broke up with my ex girlfriend two months ago. We decided to stay friends but over the past few weeks we have engaged in flirtatious banter over messenger. I couldn’t help it so was starting to be consistent with flirty messages and she didn’t exactly turn it down. In fact some point she sent some back. She would send me some snapchats some days that would be slightly revealing and of course it got me going. 

I would call her a slut as a joke and I have always done this and she takes it as a joke almost always! I only ever say it when I’m flirtatious and putting myself in a dominant position which she loves. So I know she loves this. We use to share a reddit account where we would post revealing images of ourselves as a bit of fun. Well I noticed she posted to ones to the account of herself. Of course this got me going and I somehow felt like she knew I would see them. I pretended that I never seen them and I have held that up since this day so she doesn’t know I know.

So with all that said and done I obviously felt like I could flirt with her and felt like I had the green light. I send a message to her and the convo was a bit of a tease then I said she’s a slut (as a joke, nothing out the ordinary-4 Years together). 

She then ignored me all day and I knew she was pissed off for some reason as I got radio silence. This pissed me off so I messaged her saying what’s up? Then send a few more saying it was a joke. Then she laid into me and told me “I can’t call her that.” Then I said how was I meant to know to stop calling you that? She then said I have asked you 6 times the last month to stop it. (I couldn’t find these messages that she says exist). Then she goes on about how I wind her up via messenger but I only do so to be flirtatious. Again, this was out of the blue and she showed no signs of being angry at the time. I even found a bunch of messages I sent her recently saying she’s a slut as joke and her taking it well,  

She then proceeded to tell me to get my shit together and to grow up. She said it’s wrong of me to try turn our new friendship into a friends with benefits. I’ll add she directly sent me revealing nudes on 2 occasions... so I figured she was okay with such arrangements. She basically said I’m belittling her by calling her a slut. In my defence it’s always in the right context and how was I suppose to know this was a boundary when she eats it all up before? 

I don’t know how to feel about myself, I honestly feel like Iv been betrayed. I feel like this is related to something deeper but I can’t put my finger on it. Should I apologise? I really feel like she owes me the apology as she was not clear on her boundaries or expressing her feelings at all the past month. It was all just a sudden fuck you to me.",06Feb2020,1
456,"We haven't had the best relationship for a long time now, ever since my dad got removed from our house. Since then, the financial burden has gone solely to her and I know she's stressed. But I can't help but get frustrated every time I think about the situation cause she could have handled it better.

I'll start at the beginning. As long as I can remember, my parents have had a terrible marriage, my dad was controlling, violent, overly religious and misogynistic. He fully believes that women should hold no place over men and that wives should be silent and submissive to their husbands. I could understand why she was hesitant in leaving, she hadn't held a full time job since shortly after I was born and my dad was paying all the big bills. Though everything else my mother had to pay for, school clothes, food, petrol, heating, electricity, and as her only reliable source of income was the child benefit there were times we'd have to go without. Though my dad could afford to pay for it, he just wouldn't. However my mum tells me that he only became this way after he became a Christian. Either way I used to ask my mum to get a divorce, and she'd always say that she would and I'd fall for it, untill she would undoubtedly break her promise and stay with. On multiple occasions we went housing hunt and there was a time they actually put the house up for sale, but EVERY time, my father would ask for them to work it out and she'd agree. 

However the worst offender was when it came to the mortgage. My parents wanted to buy a second home, but with my mum's poor credit it was unlikely they'd get a second mortgage. So my mum took her name off the property so it was completely in my dad's name, despite the fact that she asked us what she should do and every one telling her that it was a bad decision. My dad took out the second mortgage, and never bought the second house, he just kept the money and I have never trusted my mum since. 

A while later, another fight broke out at home (unrelated) and my dad got removed from our home and he of course instantly stopped paying the bills and it's been my mum's burden. Since then, my relationship with her has deteriorated to near nothing, we just argue all the time, and I'm worried that we're never going to work this out. I don't want to wake up in ten years and I don't speak to her anymore. I want to forgive and let it go, but she never wants to sit down and talk, and if I try and force her to she starts yelling. Im concerned because despite the fact my dad has caused most of our issues, I don't hate him, I've forgiven him, I don't really care all that much about what he's done to us in the past and he visits us all the time, but with my mum, I can't get over it. Somehow she's hurt me more. Is that fair? It doesn't seem so. What do you guys think?

Every time something big happens and I go to wake my mom up or tell her of my concerns, I am always pushed aside with a ""everything will be fine"" or a ""nothing is going to happen"", despite the weather being as unpredictable as it is. 

Tonight, I did the same thing. I went and got my mom, told her of my concerns, and when I woke her up, all she told me was, ""Well if something happens then you should be asleep so you'd be dead and at peace"". Then when her mother calls her and tells her a bad tornado is coming our way, she panics last minute and stuffs us all in the closet of our mobile home. 

I have always been scared of storms for this very reason. I would always rather be safe than sorry, but my family where I stay currently feels otherwise. This was the most scared I've ever been and the storm isn't even over yet.

I had a heated, screaming argument with my mom because she was on the phone panicking of what to do. I had told her 30 minutes beforehand that we needed to leave, but as always, she ignores me. 

While we were screaming at each other, my mom got a call from her mother saying that a tornado was coming our way and that we didn't have time to do anything. The shelter up the hill was full. We live in a mobile home. All of us were panicking. So my mom's solution was to get in the closet in my room where I continued rambling and voicing how I felt about her never listening to me. 

I was having a panic attack and it's the most scared I've ever been. I've been through similar situations but not as bad as this. I'm getting sick of it and I'm considering leaving my mother's house to go and stay with my dad if that's possible. My mom has custody of me and we never go anywhere safe so I'm just stuck here fearing for my life when it comes to storms. She wonders why I'm so petrified of them. 

I love her, but I haven't told her that since I was in kindergarten that I remember. I don't have the best bond with her and I dont tell her anything. She does give me nice things and she does make me nice food, all of that stuff is nice and I feel like shit for considering leaving but I dont like this fear that I feel when I could be safe somewhere else. 

Would it be possible for me to leave and stay with my dad? I'll need time to think about it if so, and if I'm able then I might resort to it just to spare my life. I have a future that I want to live for, people I want to meet that I haven't crossed paths with, and I really feel like she is getting in the way of that with this. 

I really need advice. Should I leave if I can? Am I able to? Am I being a crybaby and too sensitive? I don't know what to think or do and i really need help. 

Thank you to anyone who leaves your kind words,

And then I was like “friend guy also got invited” and she was like really upset about that but was still ok with him going so from my point of view she was upset about him going and still was ok with him going and not as upset if she was upset at all with me going so I thought it was fine and accepted the invite. Also at this point in time friend guy (bi sexual) invited her to his formal and I wasn’t invited and I was more than ok with it also she invited him to hers where she said she would get me to go with one of her friends. Then in December friend guy sexually assaulted me and my girlfriend was like bye to him and he was already being rude to her and negligent so the sexual assault wasn’t the only reason but it was like the main one without it they maybe would still be friends. So anyways that’s a big drama like I didn’t want to say anything about it I just didn’t want to see him again and my girlfriend was like white knighting like I didn’t want her to because she lost a few friends and if not lost friends she became in an uncomfortable place with them because one of the people in our friend group defended him another one got mad at my girlfriend for confronting now known as ex-friend guy. And then other things happened and ex-friend guy was uninvited from friends formal and my girlfriends formal. And then in January my girlfriend told me she didn’t want me to go to friend formal because another girl was taking me to her formal and she didn’t like that even though our friend is lesbian and if I didn’t get sexually assaulted she would have had ex-friend guy take her to formal and ex-friend guy bi sexual. Then she told me “how about you got to the formal... single” and of course I’d chose our relationship over our friends formal but the fact that she made that threat it felt toxic and manipulative so I just said “ok.” And now she’s telling me I can go but then saying she will be super upset and that I should feel bad. I just want to know if I should go to the formal as it’s one of my close friends school formals and I’ve been excited to go for a while and we’ve been talking about it ever since and I don’t want to cancel on her the formal is in 2 months on April the 3rd and I don’t know I just want to know if I should go or not.",06Feb2020,1

There’s a few post I don’t think my dad should see. Like one with me half naked in his music video. Another thing is the women constantly commenting under his pics putting hearts.
Is him following my dad any indication that he is trying to win me over? Or is he just being a creep?
Also is it disrespectful for him to follow my dad knowing that my dad could now see all these things?
My dad DIDNT follow him back btw and idk if he is honestly.  And my dad never liked him for me. He also followed a highschool  friend of mine whom I barely speak to. So maybe these people came up in his suggestions?or he just follows people? I’m beginning to think he has mental problems because he is now just following random girls. Should I just ignore it?

476,"I would like to start off by saying that I am not asking for medical advice. I'm asking for advice on dealing with the stress caused by being terrified of health problems. I'd also like to say that I am 17, will be 18 in less than 2 weeks.

A little backstory:
I have had digestive problems and food/digestive related anxiety ever since puberty at least. I have had emetophobia ever since elementary school, which was the last time I ever puked. Until 2 months ago.

2 months ago I got food poisoning and it was very traumatic for me. My emetophobia and food anxiety got way worse. I'm on a super limited diet, I'm really stressed. I don't feel good physically. I decided enough was enough, I scheduled a doctors appointment and this was the first time I came clean about my digestive health issues. 

I had a CT scan done just to see if there is anything going on in my digestive system since I have diarrhea problems.

I got my results back and I'm really scared. I have a lot of anxiety about health problems. I don't know what the results mean. I'm really scared if I'll need surgery or something. I had to have lung surgery 2 1/2 years ago to remove blisters. I really hate surgery. I haven't googled about my results because I'm too scared I'll find something that will freak me out even more. Reading the results I got really hot, nauseous, just super super anxious, I had to lie down, then I was freezing instead of roasting. You get the picture.

The results said I have a blood vessel in my small intestine. That is the main thing since my doctor made a message saying basically ""we got the results, it looks like you have a blood vessel in your small intestine, this may or may not be causing your problems, either me or surgery will contact you to see if you need more imaging or to talk with surgery"" that's really scary.

I'm just so so so so so scared. I'm already super depressed and anxious ever since I got food poisoning two months ago. It's already been so hard to live each day. I'm not even living. I'm just surviving. It's so hard to eat. Even harder now. And now I have this. I can't handle it all. I wish I didn't exist.

I just need any advice. I have to wait a week for my doctor to call me. That waiting is going to be agony. Please don't tell me anything that will freak me out. I can't handle it.",06Feb2020,1

My very first prospect has always been law. But years ago I got lucky, landed a really cushy job in finance completely by chance and just grew in finance.

I had an AMAZING job. I LOVED it. It was a call center job and I had one of the best agent positions in the company. 

One of my coworkers, we’ll call her J, decided it would be a great idea to start fucking one of the higher ups, we’ll call him H. J asked me for advice about it because at the time we were sort of friends, and I told her it was a terrible idea and not to do it. 

J didn’t listen to me, so I stopped being her friend. Since fucking H, she got SEVERAL highly-sought after promotions in the span of two months. My other coworkers got suspicious. Meanwhile she’s humble-bragging to me over Facebook messenger pretty frequently, sending me screenshots of her steamy texts with H. 

Someone found out, because apparently I wasn’t the only one who was told, and they went to HR about it. J immediately blamed me, demanded to search my phone for proof that I hadn’t sent the screenshots to anyone, and made me delete all the evidence. I don’t know why I did, but I did. 

The investigation continued. H and J were scared. They still blamed me for it. So they got some other coworkers who didn’t like me to go to HR and corroborate on a story saying that I was making violent threats against J and several others. This wasn’t true. 

H had called me into the conference room. For situations like this, he was supposed to have his boss in the room with us too. But it was just him, and security (who supposedly worked with HR) on the phone. 
Security told me that four people had come up and said I was threatening them. H kept his gaze away from me but couldn’t wipe the smirk off his face. 
I told the man on the phone that none of it was true, and he said he didn’t believe me. He said corroboration wasn’t possible, when it was. It had happened before on a more minor scale. 

But either way, I knew what was coming. They were going to fire me and leave me with the professional reputation of being violent. So in tears, I quit on the spot. H was practically laughing as I stormed out. 

I have a friend who still works there, and when I told him this story he said it was very suspicious. He’s doing his own investigation into it but it doesn’t seem to matter much anymore because H quit and now works at another location, and J finally got fired for being a whore. 

I’m really, really mad. I know where H works now and I want to get him fired like what he tried to do to me. I want revenge on them both. 

If I can, what should I do to get him fired? If I can’t, how do I stop being angry?

Basically, I'm a college student and I've been pursuing a relationship with this classmate for well over a year now. We got pretty close, to the point where we go out every now and then to the movies and such. I should also mention that I was a mess until a few months ago, I weighed 100kg, I was depressed and self-conscious all around, I was lonely and I had just broken a 6 year old friendship, so I was not in a good place mentally. 

So, one time when we went out to see a movie I bluntly asked her if she's interested in me. She said yes, but she wasn't ready for a relationship (around a week after this happened she was back with her ex). I took the hint and decided to stop pursuing her because there's no point in pursuing someone that isn't interested in me. I also decided to change myself for the better. I made new friends that I hang out with on the daily, I started going to the gym and dieting and became a lot more confident. 

4 months later and I'm standing at 75kg and I am happier than ever before. I even get hints from a random girl I've been crushing on for the past few months that she might be into me, so I've been wanting to pursue her and I've been planning on introducing myself to her when I meet up with her after the break. 

Before I could do this though this girl that I've been going out with previously has started asking me if I ""like her as a gf"" and has started talking about how she broke up with her ex and how she really likes me now. This suspiciously happened right after I changed myself for the better and started pursuing other girls. Should I take this as a red flag?

500,"So my mother recently got a new job a cleaning company. They are a small buisness that has contracts with a lot of building near the universities in our city. The buildings are not owned by the university though, and are just mainly populated by students/young adults that live Uptown. She was assigned with a specific building with other co workers in other buildings in the court.   


(context: she was warned about this is her training apparently however, they made it seem like it wasn't a big deal.)  
There's a young homeless male that ""lives"" in the hallway of the top floor of the building my mother was assigned. He is often coming down off Fentanyl or something heavy \[The Fentanyl problem is getting bad :( \] and often is mildly violent when you wake him up.   
She's worked there for about 2 weeks now and he's been there every day and as per her training she calls the police to escort him off the private property and that's usually the end of it. EVERY DAY.  


So the real problem lies here: 730AM Today when he was taken away, he came back. And he was very angry and was screaming incoherently (at her, from her recount... repeating ""you fucking bitch"" between what he said, and that's all she could really make out) while punching the walls and kicking all the furniture and bins. He went into the buildings washroom (there's one on every floor by the laundry rooms) and that's where my mom was cleaning. She locked herself into the closet while he continued to rant and do lines of something (she could only hear from the laundry room's closet). Balling her eyes out, she calls the police and her boss. Then me (My appartment is a 15 minute walk away from her building, and I do not have a car- so I'm panicing and contiplating running over as the police clearly don't clear about him and may take an extended time) and as I try to calm her down for the next 5 minutes she tell's me she has to go because the police are on the floor.

He's young, so it's possible I know him or know people that know him, I haven't been able to look into it yet. I'm not sure if I could/how I would handle an encounter like that if he now has a grudge set on my mother and I come to straighten it out because they see each other next. She's been going through jobs lately and finally like this one but this has ruined it and I hope she realizes the danger here and not to feel prideful and force herself through it to pay her morgage.   


Any advice both legally or otherwise would be greatly appreciated!!  
I don't understand why the police let this happen but I assume ""there's not much they can do"" until a physical encouter happen, not just a ""close one"".

501,"My friend and I often take outings together in a lyft or uber and she refuses to wear her seatbelt unless the driver asks her to. It makes me really anxious because of the ramifications if we were in a car accident. I've asked her to buckle up before but she just won't, saying she doesn't like it and that we'd be fine if we got into an accident. If she wants to get hurt or worse, that's on her, but it could kill me too! I also just think it's rude, because if we got pulled over, the driver would be the one getting a ticket, not her. I don't know if she truly doesn't care or if it's because she's overweight, so I stopped bringing it up out of awkwardness.

510,"Hello reddit. I’m currently in a very healthy relationship with a wonderful girl. Everything with us is perfect, we were made for each other. But I have this big problem.

You see, she has been in relationships with a few other guys, and I’ve been in a few with other girls. The thing is that this is the FIRST time I’ve dated someone like that. I think that it’s perfectly fine.

But I’ve been faced with dealing with new problems, insecurities. I’ve never been insecure before, but now I’m very insecure.

There’s one big thing that led to my insecurity, and it was another dude my gf had sex with. I’ll call him Fred.

I learned about him when I asked my gf a question: “who’s had the biggest d**k out of the guys you’ve f***ed?”

Her response: “FRED! His penis was huge, like omg!”

Obviously hearing my gf talk about another dude like this made me upset. But there’s more.

Another time, I told her that when we had sex, I wanted to rip her clothes off. She mentioned that the first time her and Fred has sex, he did that. This is something that I really wanted to do, but I felt so discouraged and upset hearing about Fred.

The last time was when my gf mentioned that when he used to have sex with her, he would cover her in hickeys. I love to do that, but I can’t COVER her.

All together, thinking of another guy having sex with my gf and hearing about how much she enjoyed having sex with him has really made me insecure about myself. I don’t feel like I’m enough, I also have an irrational thought that maybe she wishes I were him when we have sex. 

How can I get over this insecurity? Are my feelings valid?",06Feb2020,1

513,"Hi! I’m a 21 year old working student and I really need your advice about my career.

So I’ll just give you a little back story. I was into arts before but my parents, including my relatives think it would be best for me to take up chemical engineering.

I took the program and since i’m not that smart, i failed some subjects. I took some subjects 3x too. I’m not proud of my grades but I’m trying my best. Right now, I’m currently working while I study so I could lessen the subjects that i need to take in the future but it’s quite expensive. I’ve also stopped for a total of 2 years so im way behind of my batchmates (in the Philippines, we usually graduate at the age of 21 because we didn’t have junior highschool before). 

Here’s my dilemma, I was really determined to finish this program due to the following:
1. Pride - i feel like if i don’t finish this program, i’m not smart to do so (which i honestly have mixed feelings abt)
2. I want to show everyone who thought I couldn’t make it that I can
3. It has good compensation when you work abroad
4. I want to be the first female engineer in our family
5. I want to make my parents proud

I’m having mixed feelings about the program due to the following:
1. My friends who are now engineers said that it’s really fulfilling to graduate from the program however, they think it’s more of the bragging rights that they get since they really aren’t happy right now. One wants to take up another degree in culinary.
2. I’m not sure if the time i’m putting up for this is worth it
3. I don’t know if ill be happy when im in the field

I’m really pressured right now since I want to decide what i’ll do because I don’t want to waste my time now. I’m way behind of the schedule that I planned for my life. At this time, I planned to be a licensed engineer already but now I’m working and crawling my way out of engineering school.

Do you guys think it’s still worth it or should I get different program? Are you truly fulfilled with what you’re doing with your life? 

I honestly need help since i’m really scared and pressured.",06Feb2020,1

For example, I've been wanted to change up my room for a while now, I've had the same layout for years. I want to change it up for the sake of changing things up, but my setup right now is ideal, so why should I change something that already works? It's so conflicting.

520," 

So, Me and my BF have been together for over two years now, and I feel like I'm being emotionally used to fulfil his emotional needs with not so much regard to my feelings.

He always refuses to do things for my sake saying these things would make him uncomfortable, it's not like I ask him to do extreme things, its usually more of things like accompanying me to an event or -now that we live in different countries- come over to visit me, We have not seen each other for months now, and his reason for not visiting is because it'll upset him to leave again. He doesn't seem to mind that this upsets me, and would just call me selfish if I got upset or asked him to ""sacrifice"" an hour or two doing something that I like together.

I feel like I might have spoilt him too much letting him have his way all the time (where we go, what to watch, what I wear sometimes), mainly because I didn't want to upset him, which have caused me to build up guilt and self consciousness that I'm no good for him, whenever I try to explain to him that this thing or that bothers me, he gets upset and says things like I make him out to be the bad guy and that he is horrible and so on.

We both have had depression before and try to cope our best, but we both are easily affected by this sort of fights, I feel like I'm the guilty one and that he is better off without me, but he says he wants me in his life. I'm too tired of having to just give in to his wishes and not having him agree to do one activity that I suggest or like and then being accused of making him feel guilty.

But all that I can bear if he would stop blaming me for bringing him into my crazy complicated life  (I do have a crazy life, family issues, no actual home country so recurring visa and permits issues and more) and to be fair to him  

he does support me in other ways but not emotionally, I think he is insecure about himself and that's why the tiniest critic/honest talk from me makes him say he is a monster who can't have anybody and doesn't care about anyone else.

but when it comes to other sorts of support like if I was in trouble with somebody, he doesn't mind standing up for me, or care for me when I'm sick. it's just the emotional part we can not seem to be doing very well at.

Before we started dating, she had just gotten out if a relationship that messed her up, to the point where she began to question everything about her life- how she related to other people, becoming more self-aware with regards to how people view her. She wanted to become accustomed to being on her own and taking care of herself while not relying on anybody, so it wasn’t a huge surprise when she asked if we could be just friends about a month ago. Before that, we were sleeping together fairly regularly, but she was also sleeping with a few other people, too. Not in a cheating kind of way, that’s just the way she is, and I was fully aware and accepting of that fact. But when it came to us, she just did not feel the same way about me as I did about her. I said that of course we can be friends because I truly value her friendship. 

Well, I violated the terms of our friendship. Colossally. She came over last night having been out drinking beforehand. She was out meeting some new guy, but told me that he was prying and asking questions about her sex life too early on. She was pretty emotional about it and, not for the first time, found herself crying on my shoulder lamenting the fact that, for the most part, guys view her as a sexual object, and her low sense of self-worth let’s them have their way with her. She even told me last night about a person that she had dated in the past, whom she had just wanted to be friends with, were away on a camping trip, and she made it clear to him that she didn’t want to sleep with him, but he made a move on her anyway. She said she let it happen, and that’s why she wasn’t sure if she could trust me to make sure that didn’t happen between us.  Wanting to prove to her that she could trust me, I told her she could spend the night. She was drunk, I was not, and we were cuddling, but nothing happened. 

Well, fast forward to this morning. We woke up, cuddled some more, and then.... I did the stupidest thing imaginable and started to make a move on her. Needless to say, she got up and left real quick without saying a word. She texted me when she got home, saying “thank you for proving my point, now kindly fuck off.”  I sent her a few messages back, begging for forgiveness, but not surprisingly haven’t heard back from her. 

Ugh, I feel sick to my stomach and am such a piece of shit. I was even telling myself to stop, and I didn’t! I knew that that’s not what she wanted and I went ahead and tried for it anyway. I can’t believe I did that and I’ll never forgive myself for it.

Move on day comes, 8pm passes by, and I call asking “Where we’re you guys?”

The lady on the phone says “I’m not sure why you were told that, we won’t be able to set up your internet for another week and a half.”

So I threaten to go with another internet provider, and the lady on the phone says “We’ll give you the installation for free!” 

The installation was about $130 dollars so I said “ok fine.”

For the next week and a half, my girlfriend and I took turns (we only have one laptop) going back and forth to a fast food place to use their WiFi. It really sucked because we were both also working a lot.

So the installation happens, internet service is pretty good, blah blah blah. Then the first bill comes in and I’m getting charged for the installation after being promised I wouldn’t have to.

I call, the lady on the phone says “Yeah, you shouldn’t have to pay that. Let me double check with my supervisor.... Yep, he says you don’t have to pay that. So don’t pay the whole $175 dollar bill, just pay the $40 while my supervisor and I fix this!”

Awesome, so I pay the $40 LIKE I WAS TOLD and next month I have a huge bill with a late fee on it and the overdraft from the $135 I was told not to pay last month.

So I call again, was told “They requested that you get the discount, but it was denied. So you have to pay all of that money plus the late fee because you did not pay the full amount.”

After arguing and sitting on the phone for HOURS, they finally say they will put in a “dispute” on the charge. But the dispute will take about 3 months to finalize, so I still need to pay anyway.

I call back after 3 months and was told the dispute was put in incorrectly, so it needs to be put in again.

So this month is 6 months since I was told this would be taken care of and they’re still not refunding the money they owe me.

I have been lied to by a company and forced to pay a large late fee after following their instructions word for word, now I.’most just getting pushed back and back and back whenever I demand an answer for this shit. I’m a broke college guy barely making it by each month. I don’t have the time or money for this, is there literally anything I can do or does big company just win here?",06Feb2020,1
539,"My Manager often parks in the visitors parking lot which is right outside the front door of our building and reserved for visitors. There are charity spots that can be purchased for $1,000/year in the same lot but she does not have one of those (despite being a woman in her 30s with no children making &gt;$150k/year..so likely it's not an affordability issue).


The staff lot is quite a distance away. I am 7 months pregnant, my coworker has asthma, everyone has their reasons for why they would love to park closer to the door but we all abide by the rules. Staff are constantly reminded not to park in visitors spots so she definitely knows she is not supposed to. She also made a comment to another colleague last week about it which confirms she is aware she is not supposed to park there, there is no secret medical reason why she is parking there or anything like that. 


I have reported her to our Facilities Manager but nothing came of it. Today was a goddamn snow storm and we all dragged our asses through the snow to the front door where we see Princesses car parked a few feet from entrance.

This is my first time on here, or even asking for help in general. I don’t have many friends, and some horrible people from my past made it hard to trust. So any feed back would be greatly appreciated. So I’ve been with my now fiancé for over 4 years. He’s what I thought to be the love of my life. Funny, caring, and an all around great guy. So him and I are very sexual, have done some group things and threesomes before to. My body quite is a little higher then his and also I thought it’d be fun if he found someone to hook up with (I’m also bi sexual and always tease how I can pick a girl up way easier then him). He works at this sex shop in town and knows this girl that would come in and purchase things for her “cam girl” career. Before I brought up him chasing a girl to bone (I know weird but please don’t judge) that’s all I knew about her. Well she had come in and told him she’d be down if he was single. We also discussed a lot about boundaries what’s okay to say and this one of them since some people find it odd. She would use Snapchat for most of her way of communicating and her “job” so he re installed the app. But he told me he wouldn’t use it because he didn’t want people from his past knowing he was using it. Then said he would text her. I woke up last night and for some reason wanted to see if she replied. I ended up finding out that he had been talking to her for at least the past 4 months!! The thread wouldn’t let me go back that far and the conversation happening where it started seemed to be in the middle of a conversation, but I couldn’t see anymore. He had contacted her on my birthday and our anniversary that we both celebrated together. He was telling her stuff he wanted to do to her, telling her his interests, and even let her know how his day was going. I had NO idea he was talking to this girl at all. I feel so foolish that I had no idea what was going on and until bringing up trying to find him a hook, I had no idea who she even was. She even sent nudes on my birthday that I had no idea happened. I’m so lost and already suffer from depression and anxiety and this just makes it all worse. I also feel that I may have brought this on myself and just want some help on what I should do.

He’ll lie about the smallest things and whine whenever he doesn’t get his way, oftentimes throwing a tantrum.

I’ve broached this subject with my wife ad nauseum.  She’ll either deny it or say I’m “picking on him”.  I did over hear her the other day bragging about me to her sister that her son listens now more than ever because of me.

When my friend and I take our dogs out to use the bathroom in the common area, we always clean up after them. But our newish neighbors just leave their dogs outside (we are in Denver) without watching them. Not only do they run in the street and harass dogs passing by (and by harass I mean try to play with them - they’re really sweet but don’t get enough attention), but they poop in the yard and because their person isn’t out with them they don’t clean up after them. 

I’ve let the HOA president at our complex know a few times and so has my friend, but she’s telling us that we have to let the tenants know instead of her. I told her that one of their dogs even followed me to the park where he was harassing other dogs. This was an issue because if something bad happened then I would feel responsible. Plus I didn’t want to clean up after him. 

In the HOA guidelines they say no unsupervised dogs in the common area. Last night one of the dogs was outside for a while and it was less than 20 degrees outside. We’ve told our HOA lady time and time again but she won’t do anything and says they’re planning on moving out soon. 

We thought about calling animal control but they really are sweet dogs so I’m afraid something worse could happen to them?

Years ago he hung out with this girl for awhile and was like in love with her but she didn’t feel the same way. I’m pretty sure she knew how he felt also. He would do things for her like give her rides all the time, take care of her pet birds while she’s at college, etc etc. In my opinion, he would just take care of a lot of stuff for her in the hopes that she would start to like him. 
Again, this was awhile ago now. Maybe like 7 years. However, my friend is doing it again but for another girl. He met this girl at work maybe 2 years ago and he had a massive crush from the get-go.

So for the past 2 years my friend is still in love with her and does things for her, hangs out with her and she knows how he feels about her. I’ve tried talking to him but it doesn’t usually work.

Im currently in the stage of life, where I get to choose my career related subjects. This is something I was always calm with and knew what I exactly wanted. I still do, but im not as sure anymore. A month or so ago if you would have asked what I would have wanted to be, I would have said a Computer Programmer, or a Video Game Developer, without any hesitation. My understanding is that both are similar in the way the work, however with the latter I may want to become a Creative Designer that designs the game, its creativeness etc.

However im not really sure anymore with terms like Computer Engineer, Scientist, Information Practices popping at the same time. 

This unsure feeling im getting is actually supported by a feeling of taking a career as a writer/journo, where I think my creativity can bloom, however I still would prefer to lean towards the Game Developer career.

So yeah, thats a highschooler, who is going to select his subjects in the coming weeks, who was sure before but not anymore.

556,"So I'm not sure where to start but I'm going to try to keep this short. 

I experienced as SA/rape in December, it was a result of a campaign of harrassment and being followed that started because someone close to me (family member) owed some money that they thought I would pay for them but the people they owed the money too didn't just want the money, they wanted more than that. Which I refused and it started a campaign of harrassment that resulted in the attack. 

I reported the attack to the police initially but now questions have come up about the situation that led to it. And my family don't want me to disclose the involvement of the family member - it wasn't their fault and they had no idea that would be the outcome. So I'm pretty much left with two options, either refuse to pursue the charges, or disclose the involvement of the person in the family at the risk of angering the people I live with and care about. And when I say anger I mean I grew up in an emotional abusive household and still live there so it's not as simple just waiting for them to calm down. 

I nearly told my course leader at uni everything today, he's been incredible and has fully supported me at every step after he found out about the attack but I'm worried he'd have to go down the safeguarding route - do they even do that for uni students that are mid 20's?

558,"Alright, there's a lot of baggage to unpack, but I'll try to keep this brief and simple.

For a brief background, All the characters in this story are in the same friend group composed of friends since Elementary/High School days. We're like childhood friends, so to speak. We're all in our second year of college. We go to different colleges now, but we're still close. We still meet up from time to time, be it a movie outing or a birthday.

A few years ago, one of said friends, who I'll be naming Guy A, started going out with Girl B. It didn't last long though, due to unconventional reasons (spans from them keeping their relationship a secret to everyone and me accidentally buzzkilling them. Take note of the word **accidentally**). To be honest, I only found out about it when I was jokingly teasing Girl B about this, and Guy A and Girl B decided to tell me about it in privacy. 

That was during High School. Fast forward to the present time. We're now in 2nd Year College. We all kinda separated ways, but we mostly went to the same colleges (Our group has like 11 members with 4 big universities around). I went to a university with Girl B and Guy C.

One day, Guy A decided to message me. He was planning to hook up a mutual friend from the group, Guy C, with Girl B. Quite some time passed between Guy A and Girl B's relationship, so I guess things have died down. I knew about Guy C's feelings for Girl B, since it was painfully obvious, but I was surprised at hearing that Girl B had feelings for him too.

Guy A encouraged Girl B to pursue the relationship even if I had some doubts about it (It was pretty unhealthy, tbh, Guy C suffers from some insecurity issues/too dense, plus he's so immature, and Girl B is kinda... idk, aloof? Blunt?). Long story short, Guy A was able to get Guy C to confess to Girl B. They got together.

Spoiler alert, it didn't even last the weekend. When I asked about it, Guy A told me Girl B's reason for breaking it off was that Guy C was too demanding and taxing to be with (i.e. messaging 24/7. Calling her ""mine"", ""cutiepie"", a lot of red flags, etc.). When I confronted Girl B, I was met with a vague response. 

 Herein lies the problem. Guy C is depressed af now. Girl B told everyone except Guy C why she broke up with him, particularly Guy A since they're still super close (We've always assumed they were just good friends). Now, Guy C got pissed at Guy A when he found out about it and started giving him the cold shoulder. Guy A wanted to help Guy C rebound, but because of the shoulder, Guy A got super pissed as well (Literally ranting on my PMs as I write this). He's like ""I'm trying to help him and he's just doing this, etc. etc."" I'm serving as the mediator between all parties now. Guy C refuses to talk to Guy A despite his attempts. Guy A is now pissed. Girl B is stuck in the middle of all this. It's a groupmates birthday on Sunday, and this is the first ever major fight we've ever had. Guy A and Guy C are thinking of not going. Worst part is, I kinda find myself distrusting Guy A and Girl B. While I know they're telling me the truth, the problem is that they were so close to begin with, and that they're the ones who are keeping secrets from the rest of us (Their relationshp, as an example).

I know I should just give it time, and that time heals all wounds and whatever, but it feels like everything is going to hell. I'm the mediator between all this, and I'm the only one that's close to Guy C   and he's willing to talk to. I'm actually meeting up with him tomorrow (It's around midnight here) I don't want to see this friend group die, please help.

**Tl;dr**  


* I have this friend group since childhood.
* Guy A and Girl B were in a secret relationship previously, but it didn't work out
* A few years passed, we all went to college. I went to the same university as Girl B and Guy C.
* Guy A called me one day. It was a plan to hook up Guy C and Girl B.
* Me - Not sure about that, but he was able to talk me into it.
* Guy C confessed to Girl B, they started going out.
* Didn't last even the weekend.
* Girl B told literally everyone in her friend group, except Guy C, why she broke up with him.
* She broke up with him due to a lot of red flags.
* Guy C is depressed now.
* Guy C found out that Girl B told Guy A why she broke with him (They were always so close)
* Guy C is now giving Guy A the cold shoulder
* Guy A got pissed at that, since he was only trying to help him
* Now they aren't talking, they're pissed at each other.
* I'm the only one Guy C is willing to talk to in our friend group, and I have to keep lying a lot to every party involved just to keep being the mediator.

562,"Hi there,

Here's my situation. I'm going to change some of the details for privacy.

One of my tenant's suddenly and unexpectedly died this week, not in his apartment. He was an older dude in his late sixties. He was renting from me for many years and we were pretty close. He lived alone and his family lives across the country.

I've been in contact with the family to help sort out his affairs. I offered to go into his apartment to take out the garbage and toss any perishables and they gave me written permission to enter his apartment.

Last night, I went into his place and started to clean up. After clearing out the fridge and main garbage, I checked the other rooms for garbage cans. In his office, I found a garbage can filled with tissues. These were obviously full of old cum. I debated in my mind for a second on what to do but ultimately decided to throw them out. The family doesn't need to see that.

Then, I checked the bedroom. As soon as I flicked the light on, I saw dozens of bras and panties across the bed and on the floor. They are obviously his as I've never seen him with a woman and they looked his size. I also saw boxes of maxi pads in Walmart bags. By the door was a pair of panties with a soiled maxi pad inside.

So, I'm guessing he was a bit of a cross-dresser. I'm surprised he was into that but I don't find it weird or anything. Everyone has their thing. 

However, I'm unsure of what to do. The family will be down within the next couple of weeks. Should I just leave his bedroom as it is or should I gather up all of the cross-dressing evidence and store it somewhere?

Part of me is thinking, ""That's his stuff. It's not up to me to move it."" 

But then part of me is thinking ""Maybe he would appreciate me getting rid of this stuff for him. Like telling one of your buddies to clear your browser history when you die. The family doesn't need to know this stuff, do they?"" 

But then another part of me is thinking ""What if he was pretty cool about the cross-dressing stuff and his family already knows about it. Then, when they are packing up his stuff the will be like ""Hey, wasn't dad into cross-dressing? Where's his stuff?"" And then they will ask me if I'd seen it and I'll say ""Yeah, I packed it away in case you didn't know."" And maybe they will be like ""Oh yeah? Likely story. What else of our dad's did you ""pack away""?""

I feel like the obvious solution is to just leave it where it is and let this all just play out. It's just something is nagging at me to do him a solid and help let the sleeping dogs lie.

Any advice?",06Feb2020,1
563,"Hi guys, 

I'm from Germany and ever since I finished high school I have trouble picking and finding a career I enjoy. Both my parents do not have high education. My mom works in customer service and my dad is a carpenter. Since I was at the time quite interested in computers, I picked a career in IT. I worked for an online bank for 3 years, got really good and broad IT education there and finished my degree. 

But I honestly just hated the work itself. There was so much bureaucracy, I felt incredibly restricted and hated sitting in an office. I felt trapped. I didn't get along with most of the people because they seemed to be ""living in their own world"" and were kinda weird tbh. People I got along with the best were all the ones not working in IT.  I passed through every IT team there was (databases, helpdesk, network, phones, management,...) and everything was just overcomplicated and super specialized and I quickly lost interest in IT to be honest. Both for work and as my hobby. 

Now I was very good at everything I did there (SQL, Webservers, Project Management, Phones) but I just hated the guts out of it. I was incredibly bored and kept staring out the window craving for freedom. 

So I decided to quit the job and go travelling on a working holiday visa to Australia. The purpose of it was to try different jobs and just enjoy life a little. I had 2 of the best years in my life, all the jobs I did there were very enjoyable and the people super nice. I worked on a cattle station, a grain farm, drove tractors, motorbikes, quads, worked for a fireworks company, as a tradesman building glass fencing, carpentry...  I very much enjoyed working with my hands, being active!!!, getting things done. 

Now I am back in Germany because my visa basically ended and I'm living with my parents. I have been thinking for the last 2 months on what to do and my mind keeps spinning in circles. I don't wanna be pushed into my ""old job"" and hate my life. But those jobs I enjoyed are not accessible here for me now. Say if I want to work in a trade I'd have to start from 0 and learn for 3 years making basically no money. On top of that, most trade/physical jobs here in Germany are paid incredibly shitty, you cannot make a good living from them (I can see it with my dad). Everything is so strict here and it's so hard to switch your career. I just hate it I feel like I'm going crazy thinking about my next move.

575,"Let me give you some back story, I’m a recently graduated nurse, wrote my boards less than a week ago so I am not registered yet, I went back to school to further my education so I am once again a full time student and I have a job that pays minimum wage, I work about 7-10 hours a week max 

Basically I dug a deep hole for my self financially, and I now owe $800 to just my fucking cell phone company of all places, I’m sure you are wondering how this happened, well let me explain, every two weeks I have a car payment that comes out that runs my almost totally dry (I used to work my before I was busy with school so it wasn’t a burden on me). Since I didn’t want to miss a car payment I just kept telling myself “I’ll just miss a phone payment and pay for my car, it’s already late and they haven’t cut me off so I should be ok”. Well part of me was right, they haven’t cut me off but they have just been stacking overcharges to the point that my bill is now $800 

I have no idea how I am going to ever pay this off , even if I just keep putting little amounts the overcharges will eventually be more than i can handle, Ive thought about asking my parents for money but that is far to much, does anyone know a way I can start making extra money on the side to pay this off? It’s literally ruining my life, the stress of this bill is making me lose sleep and just not act myself

Hello all!! I have started working in a company(let’s call it X) about two months ago. One of my friends from highschool and I started working on the same day and her name is Barbara. On our first day, we met a group of interns in the office and they seemed like they were really nice people. Later on, two of the interns, Brittany and Penelope got so close to us. Four of us were always hanging out. We were always having our breaks and lunchs together but we were spending time with other people in the office too. About three weeks ago, Brittany received a message from someone who works in another department via skype. The guy was asking for her number unnecessarily. After this incident we started having little jokes about this. We were talking about it during the breaks, and referencing to the conversation Brittany had with the guy. We were just having fun, we don’t know him. We know it is not prohibited to ask for somebody’s number and we were not making fun of him, it was just an inside joke that we had. Later on, our other close friends in the office learned about this. Two weeks ago we met Brittany’s boyfriend Bob and had lunch together. It wasn’t just the four of us and Bob, we were a larger group of people. About a week ago, Brittany received a message on twitter from an anonymous account, saying that she has secrets and he knows them. The messages were like “I know your secrets” “Your secrets go up above your height” “You are dating someone yet you are thinking about another man”. This account also messaged Bob and told similar things. He also said that “Your girlfriend is not the person you think she is, ahe has secrets. Skype is your clue”. The account also referenced to some of our inside jokes with the people in the office, so we are sure that he is from the office. He said that “I was going to message Penelope first, but she doesn’t have a boyfriend so it wouldn’t be as fun. You were the last person on my list but I don’t have a choice”. He always talks in the messages like “Haha I am having so much fun”. This makes me really angry, seeing Brittany sad all the time and knowing that she couldn’t get any sleep at night. It makes me sick to my stomach that there is a person in the office, who she sees everyday, who she smiles at and says good morning, without knowin that they are the anonymous account. Dear all, I am asking for a way that will make him come out. I want to know who this is. We all care about Brittany deeply and we don’t want to see her like this. We thought about baiting him, but we couldn’t come up with a decent idea. Can you help me?

TL;DR: My close friend from the office is receiving messages on twitter from an anonymous account, who we are sure is from the office. How can we catch this guy?",06Feb2020,1

582,"

I know how the title sounds, but please hear me out here.

Two years ago I was happily in a relationship, but out of nowhere I was hit with a medical issue concerning my private parts. I’m not really comfortable with sharing the exact nature of this issue as it’s quite obscure and not really that relevant here. It was not an STD, nor was it contagious, but it resulted in excruciating pain for several months and the most basic things (such as going to the toilet or getting an erection) hurt like hell.

This put a huge strain on my relationship at the time and my girlfriend ended up cheating on me. I’m not naive, I know sex is important in a relationship. I somewhat understand her reasoning in this (her reaction to it is something else ofc)

While any physical discomfort from the issue I had is long gone now I’ve noticed I’m having significant problems with opening myself up to other people, sexually that is. Mostly I’m just ashamed of what happened and the fact that I can’t share it with anyone. I’ve recently gotten back into dating (which was a big step for me), but I’ve noticed that when it comes to physical intimacy and making moves I’ve lost all confidence. This has nothing to do with my dates themselves, they’re great funny people but I’m really mentally blocked from taking it to the next level and things just end up fading out everytime. 

It’s not really sexy to admit that I’m just not confident and comfortable at all anymore, so I just avoid that conversation alltoghether. This is developping into a huge problem and I’m really scared that it will just kill any shot I have at a relationship once I admit it. I know this sounds like the most pathetic thing ever and I know it’s just all in my head, but I also know that when you’re dating sexual compatibility and confidence are important and due to me never initiating anything out out embarrassement I feel like it’s just killing all the chances I might have.

I obviously have nobody to talk to about this so a bunch of internet strangers might be the next best thing.",06Feb2020,1
583,"First, this is a throwaway; I'm not hoping to get kicked out or misuse this thread. I don't know where to ask (I have been removed from other threads), besides my fellow employees, which I'm concerned will cause more problems than solve.

Back story: I work in healthcare, have for some years. I take patient privacy very seriously, even being described as a ""HIPAA nazi"". 

After work, I decided to go to a bar and relax the mind; being quite a distance from home, I was in my work uniform. (I admit this may be unprofessional, but I simply thought I'd have a beer before heading home.) At the bar, I see a patient (B), who arrived after I. Initially, I recognize B but, of course, act like I don't know them, as we sat several stools from each other. As time ticks, B starts yelling at me to 'join the crowd' (minimal bar patrons) and not sit by myself. Possibly a mistake, I move down; in time, B starts mentioning how I look familiar, to which B sees my uniform and starts asking questions (""where do you work"", ""oh, I've seen you before"", ""did you go to school"", etc.) which I responded with short answers: yes/no, ""oh?"", ""really?"", etc. Time passes and, while I tried to keep arms distance, conversation went smoothly and we kinda hit it off. I could best describe it as talking with an old friend that you haven't seen in a while, we simply had a vibe and clicked intellectually. At closing, B asks me to breakfast which, maybe against better judgement, I agree to. Conversation continued to go well as we talked a bit about our lives, how we are where we're at today, etc. I was very careful to not say anything relating to their patient privacy, even after B tried initializing that conversation, to which I still simply replied flatly and blankly. Even when B stated things like ""I have 'this and that' health issues"", I played dumb and responded simply, such as ""oh?"" 

I thoroughly enjoyed my time with B, they made me smile and vice versa. It didn't get physical, except brief hand touching (not holding) from across the table. At one point, B give me their number, stating they enjoyed their time, they are hopeful we can get to know each other more, invited me to dinner, and also briefly mentioned they will look for me when at my work. 

I agree everything was great, but would getting to know each other cross a line? Of course, if the line were to be flirted with, everything could fizzle quickly, or something may develop, I really don't know. I acknowledge that I wouldn't be able to partake in their healthcare needs, if things were to take liftoff. Would I have to tell my superiors? When?B's number is burning a hole in my pocket (they don't have my number); I highly want to give them a call, thanking them for their company and see where conversation leads. I've also considered calling them and discussing my concerns, for their input.

What are thoughts on my next steps?

TL;DR: I work in healthcare but ran into a patient off the clock. We shared excellent conversation, with potential for something to develop. I am wondering if it would be inappropriate to try to get to know them further?",06Feb2020,1

585,I made friends with a gal at a coffee shop several years ago she initiated conversation with me over a  comic book I was reading. We then made friends over finding out that we're both artists by exchanged artwork .we talked several other times about books and art .one day she was working and I was playing a video game she came over and to play it with me kicked my ass and explained the reason why she was so good was her fiance taught her to be better at that game.I realized at that point that I had already had feelings for her but I thought she was a really cool person and didn't want to screw up the chance at a friendship with this person so we spent the next two years slowly getting to know each other as casual acquaintances.eventually I told her about how I have dinner parties at my house with my friends from time to time.she said she miss doing things like that with her fiance they don't get to get out much anymore to which I said well it would be nice to actually meet him finally you two should come over sometime I'll cook just bring a bottle of wine. She agreed we set up a date for getting together. A few days before the day we were supposed to get together she explained to me that her fiance has really bad social anxiety and that he has a problem with eating in front of strangers she thought it was going to be more than just the three of us getting together but he's really anxious about having a one-on-one essentially with a new person so he wants to cancel the plans.I explained that I was really sad to hear that but maybe we could do something else another time. She said she still wanted to come over though so she did.when she came over we spent the rest of the night drinking wine and eating and getting to know each other on a more personal level. It turns out her fiance has such bad social anxiety that he rarely leaves the house aside from going to work and he has outright stopped going to social gatherings with any of their friends and any of their family the only time that he actually leaves the house is when it's absolutely obligatory like when her daughter from a prior marriage asks him to come to a school play.the guy's been in therapy for years for having manic depression as well he's told her that he hasn't been happy in years they get in argument continuously they've even had discussions about whether or not if her daughter didn't exist if the two of them would still be together . then we somehow got into a conversation to effect of both of them being bisexual so they decided to have an open relationship because there's some things that each can't provide to the other I end up asking her if that meant if she wanted to go out and sleep with another man he would be okay with that she said yes so one thing led to another that night and her and I ended up hooking up. We both agreed in the morning that we enjoyed ourselves but that we couldn't look at it as anything other than just that hooking up . We started to contact one another on a daily basis and call each other everyday. The more and more we talked the closer and closer we got eventually we had dinner again at my place just the two of us and the same thing happened we talked all night long. Even closer we got to understand each other even better opening up about things that neither of us would open up to anyone about in years and at the end of the night we slept together again.the next day she told me that she felt really bad because she knew that I had feelings for her but all that she was able to offer with a friendship I explained that it sounds like she was having a hard time in her relationship and that from the sounds of it the reason that her and him were staying together where financial reasons and her daughter that it didn't sound like she was very happy in life to which she explained she has been a lot happier as of recent since her and I started talking and started hanging out she loves hanging out with me and she wishes that I lived closer in town so we can spend more time together. We keep getting closer and closer and sharing more about each other to each other but as of recent she seems to be pulling away from me I know she keeps saying all she wants is a friend but she also keeps saying how comfortable she is around me and how she has to keep putting up these guards for herself to make sure she does not feel feelings for me I'm not sure what I should do as it sounds to me as though this guy is basically a houseplant she keeps putting in all the effort and all he's doing is looking nice I don't know what to do I want to tell her that in this situation no one wins. He doesn't win as he's become complacent in his anxiety and depression and won't change unless forced to.it's not fair to her or her daughter as raising her daughter in this situation will only show her that this is what a healthy relationship is supposed to look like and she will be stuck in a stalemate with him as they've been engaged for 4 years with no date set and haven't gone on a date in over 3 years. And it's not fair to me because I keep getting these mixed signals where she keeps saying she wants to be my friend but keeps telling me how close she feels to me and keeps telling me that she misses me when we don't get to talk,06Feb2020,1

Its for a small company thats adjacently related to my field, and the owner is currently writing a research paper so I would also get my name published in the credits if it pulls through. On one hand, this would be great for my resume, as all my previous experience was in Compsci (my old major) and random secretary work.

588," Hi all, 

Ok, so I work at a very small firm (around 8 people) and its owned by 3 partners. Last year they hired an intern, S (22 F). She was placed next to our receptionist. I did notice some heavy BO sometimes, but as we were not sharing our work space together, I didn’t really mind. I just grabbed whatever I needed and went back to my room that I shared with my coworker B. 

Well, B got another job and S got a promotion after her graduation. S is now my trainee and took B’s place a few months ago. We are sharing a room and I cannot deal with the smell. 

I would describe the smell as souer, old sweat. I know she showers in the mornings, so I think the smell comes from her clothes, not per se her body (if that makes sense). It’s usually worse when she wears synthetic shirts. It has gotten to the point where I recognize a few shirts as being “the smelly ones”. Even an open window, in the middle of the winter, is not helping. I can literally TASTE the smell. It's that bad.

I have no clue if anyone noticed the smell as well, although I don’t think it’s possible I’m the only one smelling this. 

Also I’m scared people think it’s me smelling like this when they enter our room. 

I really like S, so I feel super crappy, guilty and awkward about this all. We have a good working relationship and she is a good person, so I have NO idea what to do. 

We have no HR department, as we’re so small. And I would feel like a backstabber going to my bosses. 

It feels like the only way for her to fix this, is to throw out a lot of her clothes. So it’s not a quick fix either. And she doesn't have a a lot of money either. This makes it even more sticky. 

Does anyone have any advice for me?  Thank you.",06Feb2020,1

590,"This is a throwaway for obvious reasons.

Some background. Politically, I've been a Democrat my entire life and an Obama supporter for as long as I can remember. I volunteered for John Kerry's presidential campaign back in 2004 which is where first registered on my map. I watched his speech at the DNC was was instantly enamoured.

When he announced his candidacy for president in 2007, immediately threw my weight behind him. I knocked on doors, educated people about his policies and did the best I could to get people to vote for him. When he was elected, I was ecstatic. In the past, when I had supported candidates, it was out of cold reason; because I thought their policies and acumen would result in the best net result for this country. But this was a person I could get excited about, someone I could *believe* in.

When it came time for his campaign for a second term it was largely the same. I had slightly soured on him. Granted, he was not the president I had hoped he would be but that was not his fault. I had built him up to be so huge in my head it was impossible for him to live up to expectations. Republican gridlock in Congress also prevented him from getting through the policies he wanted. Nevertheless, I still supported him, still volunteered and was still happy when he won his second term.

The problem started about three weeks ago. I had a dream involving Barack, which is not uncommon for me, I was working with him and Michelle on their upcoming Netflix show. We were looking over demographics and how they related to various geographical locations. Without even realising it, I said ""Yeah, N\*\*\*er, we should do pretty well in (area near me)"" He just looked at me and stormed out with Michelle behind him. I woke up and went into the bathroom to splash cold water in my face. I dismissed it. I don't have a racist bone in my body. This was just one of those dreams, right?

A week and a half ago, I had a similar experience. This time I dreamt we were going wine-tasting together. I don't remember the lead-up but I ended up saying something to the effect of ""The sommelier said we should be detecting earthy tones in this wine, but it's just not registering with me, N\*\*\*er"" This time, instead of storming out he replied, very sternly ""Why did you feel that was an appropriate thing to say?"" I began to stutter and explain it was an accident but I had once again woken up.

The most recent incident was last night. I dreamt I was at a family barbecue with the Obamas, just his family and mine. He was manning the grill and i was speaking to Michelle while the children played with each other (I know Sasha and Malia are adults now but I still think of them as children) I said to Michelle very politely ""excuse me for one moment"" and marched right up to Barack and tapped him on the shoulder. He turned around to look and me and I just said the word and nothing else. I can write off this happening once or twice in my dreams but three separate events is too much.

I don't know what to do. I don't want to do this. Every time it happens my work suffers the next day. I've started lying to my wife saying I've been having nightmares but I'm not sure she fully believes it. Lately, I've been worrying I might start saying it in my sleep and she could hear. I'm at my wits end and I want it to stop.",06Feb2020,1
591,"I have a bit of a sleeping problem. Ever since I started to attend University I have to travel quite a long commute. It is about 3hours there and then back, two rides one is an hour the second slightly over two hours. So, in short, I spend more than 6 hours a day on the bus, this alone would not be a problem, because I have free time there to read or study. 

The problem is that once the bus gets off I always fall asleep, I just can not help it, once I sit down and the thing starts moving I have 5-10 min till I fall asleep.

This leads to the unfortunate fact that once I get home I am so sleepy after my bus ride that I can not do almost anything.

Due to this schedule, I sleep (in bed) something around 6hours, which makes me quite refreshed, but once I wake up in the bus after my morning ride I feel completely exhausted, this feeling is there for the whole day, up until I get to the bus home. 

So basically, I need to find out how to not sleep on the bus. Do you think coffee in the morning would help? I have not tried it yet, because I am afraid of, ehm, bowel movement in the bus.

I read some advice on the internet, but most of these are not an option here. (Like standing up) 

So I really need to not sleep on the bus, because it makes me exhausted to the point that I have a hard time not to fall asleep in the school either.

593,"I just turned 20 and my girlfriend is 19. My girlfriend and I have been dating for 3 months now. That's not too long, but this is the best I've ever felt about someone so it's decently serious to me. From what I can tell she's serious too. Not too many bumps in the road, honestly. We spend a lot of time together and talk things out when we're frustrated at each other.

When we started dating, I knew she'd smoked cigarettes in the past, but it'd been a long time since I'd seen her with them. At the time, she'd opted for a Juul to curb her desire to smoke, which worked out well for her. 

After about a month of dating, out of nowhere she came to me, unprompted, and said something along the lines of ""I don't wanna smoke cigs anymore, and I wanna stop using this Juul too. I want you to help me stop."" Obviously, I agreed, and said that I'd help remind her not to do mess with them. I also told her, however, that the only person who could truly make her quit was herself. She agreed. 

Fast forward to about 2 and a half months of dating, after I've been helping remind her that cigarettes aren't good for her and neither is the Juul (using the Juul as a crutch to stay away from the cigs as a first step, which she still hasn't touched at this point) and sits me down like I've done something to her and says that I ""need to let her be herself and if she says if she wants to smoke then I need to let her. She said she doesn't really want to stop and I need to stop trying to make her. I told her that I was trying to help her and that she came to me first. I told her that she needs to tell me the truth about if she wants to stop or not. She agreed and said that she wasn't ready to leave the Juul alone yet, but that she wasn't going to get any more cigarettes. 

Fast forward again, to yesterday, and I found a brand new, unopened pack of cigarettes in her car when she came to my house. I didn't say anything, and I don't know if she saw me look at it, but she bought them again. I think she tried to drop it in her bag (which she keeps on the passenger side of the car) but it fell on the ground; where she couldn't see it, instead. I don't want to date someone who smokes. It's harmful to them and the people around them. Not to mention the smell.

Hi guys,

I'm from Germany and ever since I finished high school I have trouble picking and finding a career I enjoy. Both my parents do not have high education. My mom works in customer service and my dad is a carpenter. Since I was at the time quite interested in computers, I picked a career in IT. I worked for an online bank for 3 years, got really good and broad IT education there and finished my degree.

But I honestly just hated the work itself. There was so much bureaucracy, I felt incredibly restricted and hated sitting in an office. I felt trapped. I didn't get along with most of the people because they seemed to be ""living in their own world"" and were kinda weird tbh. People I got along with the best were all the ones not working in IT. I passed through every IT team there was (databases, helpdesk, network, phones, management,...) and everything was just overcomplicated and super specialized and I quickly lost interest in IT to be honest. Both for work and as my hobby.

Now I was very good at everything I did there (SQL, Webservers, Project Management, Phones) but I just hated the guts out of it. I was incredibly bored and kept staring out the window craving for freedom.

So I decided to quit the job and go travelling on a working holiday visa to Australia. The purpose of it was to try different jobs and just enjoy life a little. I had 2 of the best years in my life, all the jobs I did there were very enjoyable and the people super nice. I worked on a cattle station, a grain farm, drove tractors, motorbikes, quads, worked for a fireworks company, as a tradesman building glass fencing, carpentry... I very much enjoyed working with my hands, being active!!!, getting things done.

Now I am back in Germany because my visa basically ended and I'm living with my parents. I have been thinking for the last 2 months on what to do and my mind keeps spinning in circles. I don't wanna be pushed into my ""old job"" and hate my life. But those jobs I enjoyed are not accessible here for me now. Say if I want to work in a trade I'd have to start from 0 and learn for 3 years making basically no money. On top of that, most trade/physical jobs here in Germany are paid incredibly shitty, you cannot make a good living from them (I can see it with my dad). Everything is so strict here and it's so hard to switch your career. I just hate it I feel like I'm going crazy thinking about my next move. All I want is a job that is at least a little enjoyable and makes enough money to live.

TL:DR: picked a career in IT, hated it. Did work&amp;travel for 2 years and loved it. Now I’m back home and don’t know what to do...",06Feb2020,1

I don't know what to do, because I don't wanna look as an ungrateful guy, because they just hired my at my actual job and if I quit just a few days after starting I'm afraid that it will affect my resume in a bad way.

598,"Just some background: my parents have been divorced for a long time at this point and I split my time between them evenly, living one week at my mom's house and then the next week at my dad's. I also just recently left high school to obtain my GED.

For a while I've felt like I wanted to only stay at my mom's house for many different reasons. However, the main reason is that me and my dad don't really have much in common. I also don't like having to deal with my younger step brothers, as well as the fact that his house is a good 20 minutes from town, making it hard to hangout with friends, get home from work or other engagements, etc.. I also just generally have more fun at my mom's house and am much happier. The days drag on during the time I'm at my dad's house, yet every day goes extremely fast when I'm at my mom's. It's honestly gotten to a point where my dad's house doesn't really even feel like my home, but more just a place that I have to go stay at for a little while until finally I am able to come back to my real home (my mom's house). All of this coupled with the facts that my mom most likely gets very lonely when I'm not around, as she lives alone and that I can now help her provide as I am working and not going to school makes me feel as though for both  her and I, I should stay with my mom on at least a somewhat permanent basis.

However, I am stuck between a rock and a hard place, as my dad is very nice and honestly loves me and I love him too. I just don't know how to break it to him, or even if I should tell him the idea. It feels like I have to choose between my mental wellbeing and my father's feelings. What do you think I should do Reddit? Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated.",06Feb2020,1

600,"After breaking up with my ex I needed a roommate to afford my apartment. I decided to rent out one of the three bedrooms I had for $400 and $50 to go toward gas and electric. So basically $450 everything included. The room is small so I thought I would have a hard time finding someone but I didn’t. My roommate is a lady about 10 years older than me and mostly keeps to herself. Fast forward a couple of months to today and my new boyfriend officially moves in. He’s a student and only works part time so I told him to pay the utilities and not to worry about rent. My roommate is always late (typically tens days after the first)with giving me her part of the rent and had only given me the extra $50 once in the 8 ish months of her living here. I texted her today (the 6th) if she had the rent and she told me she gets paid tomorrow and now that my boyfriends living here if we’re splitting rent 3 ways? In my head, she agreed to $450, only pays me $400 and is always ten or so days late with giving me rent and she has the audacity to ask if her part is getting lower? No, she agreed to pay that for the room, I still pay everything else and now since I’m splitting my space further will be paying less in bills not her who has nothing changing for her.

601,"Hello Reddit sorry for the long post. My ex and my 3 year olds father has been asking non stop about my plan for my tax return almost to the point of harrassment. I'm getting about $6,000 back. He said I can go ahead and claim our son since I've only had 2 jobs and only 2 w2s vs his 5 or more jobs throughout last year. He expects me to split the return in half but I'm very conflicted. Also I should mention I never agreed to give him half or any portion. Some backstory: we broke up July 2019 we were living together and both providing support for our son up until that point. My ex moved out and he only saw our son for a few hours twice a week while I had class and when classes ended he didnt see him. He recently just moved back in with his dad and now sees him on weekends ONLY because his dad offers to take our son every weekend so I can have a break and did so even when my ex didn't live there. Im conflicted because while we were together and even now he could never hold down a job. He doesn't provide any child support. He doesnt buy groceries or clothes or necessities, his dad and step mom do. He helped pay half of our sons daycare for a short time but now his grandpa is paying me for daycare because I threatened court because he always had an excuse why he couldn't pay. That's the only thing I asked of my ex since daycare runs me about $180 per week. I should mention I do live with my mom and she does help me out a bit with things for my son. But I pay for my car which my ex and I financed together, but he left me to pay for. I pay all my own bills like car insurance, phone, internet, and groceries for me and my son. I struggle financially, I'm a full time student and just recently laid off from my job so I need this money more than ever. My family and current boyfriend think my ex shouldn't get any of the money, but their opinions are obviously bias. I don't really think he should get any money either because I know he will only spend it on himself. So my question is should he get any of the money or not?

609,"Hey guys. I (female) was engaged to my Bestie as she said she wanted us to be a family. I wasn’t in love with her and she wasn’t in love with me either. Close friends, but her family is overseas and mine is deceased and We both loved the idea of having someone to grow old with, especially such a close friend. We were even discussing adoption and buying a house together. 
So we tell absolutely everyone and start to plan. I put lots of things in my life on hold to concentrate on the engagement. Then out of the blue, she tells me she’s met someone, they are in love and they are getting married in 6 months. 
We’d always said if she or I; met a guy or girl, we loved romantically, wed talk about it and we’d look at a change to our plans, but that we’d communicate and always be friends. But she didn’t. 
When she told me, she tried to blame me by saying I “hadn’t been taking our engagement seriously”- I was perplexed-as that was not my reality of the situation. I was there for her through thick and thin. She never once alluded to any issues in the year 2.5 years we were engaged. It seemed to me like she was making excuses and blaming me for something that she did. 
I was so angry at her for doing this. I felt totally worthless, that I’d been planning and taking things seriously to marry her, when apparently I was an option, till she met someone else she preferred. I felt like she had used me. 
TBH I’m not upset she’s getting married, she was a good friend and I wished her well and if she’d told me, (that this guy asked her and asked could we end our engagement); I would have been so happy for her-we’d probably still be friends. I would have said, go for it and be happy.  She deserves a love marriage, as do we all. 
But it was the awful way she went about things. I feel like I can’t trust her anymore.  Nobody likes to feel devalued and used. I would never want to get in between a “Hallmark moment” engagement with her and this guy and ruin it for her; but the reality is that she WAS engaged elsewhere and she told this guy; he KNEW it. I don’t expect him to respect and honour our arrangement; but I at least expected her to. She said he was jealous of out friendship  go figure. She treated me like I was nothing. She made decisions for me, without consulting me. And that’s hard to forgive. I don’t blame her for wanting a perfect love, who would? But I was raised not to crap all over others; to get what you want. 
Now, after I have taken her off all my social media-friends tell me she’s suicidally depressed and suffering severe anxiety and has been housebound the last few months since it happened. I’m not correlating this illness with what happened- I think the timing is coincidental. But she sounds very unwell. 
I want to reach out; but I don’t. 
How can I ever trust her again? 
When push comes to shove-she prioritises herself first and I don’t want to be used again. I miss and worry about her: but I need to be able to trust my friends.

623,"tl;dr - Night Owl needs advice on sleep cycle.

I (22/m) pretty much get my work done during the nights. I am in my final year of college, going to graduate in 5-6 months. All these years, the best work which I have produced has happened 'overnight'. In the sense that I find myself most productive when the world around me sleeps. In fact, many days I find myself up till 5, noting down my thoughts, researching or simply designing concept sketches, etc. I am a design student - in theory, I study close to nothing. Almost all of my work is hands-on. In my case, its always digital so I spend a good amount of my time indoors.

Other than work, I play video-games and make music. Most of my hobbies have nothing to do with people - ironic, because the stuff I design is mostly about them  (I am a User Experience designer). However, I just cannot get stuff done when I am around people or aware of the fact that there's noise around me. No, headphones/earphones don't really do the trick. It's the 'feel of the night'. 

In the past, this kind of lifestyle has messed up my routine a lot. I can't get up on time for classes, have to take naps in the afternoon to catch up on sleep and have tried 'fixing it' by re-wiring my sleep cycle. The max I can go is 4-5 days - *sleeping at night and getting up in the morning* without an alarm. After that, I crash back into my default cycle. 

I don't really know what to do. I am yet to begin a career and it scares me how society functions. If I apply for a job, I know I'm in for the '9-5' lifestyle. If not, I may try freelancing but there's not joy of working without being around important people/mentors who can guide me. What should I do?

630,"Ok so not entirely sure where to go, I still need to weigh that out so I don't end up going somewhere worse. Reason I want to leave is 3 big things. I can't stand American culture, its superficial as all hell and encourages people to be terrible to each other, to ruthlessly take advantage of and put down others. Also, our government is very clearly corrupt and we no longer have a say on who works in government with elections now being decided long before we go to the polls. This is going to lead to even bigger problems than we currently face with the government. Which leads me to my third reason, our take on capitalism is a cancer I can no longer support. The earth is dying, kids are dying, families living in poverty, living standards falling fast, and our society is trained to hate to hate the poor. Its so bad, poor people hate other poor people for being poor, not understanding they themselves are also poor. But the government pays off media and influencers to propagate that, to keep poor people mad at each other so we never fix the real problem, capitalism. America allowed and even encouraged men like Jeff Bezos and Donald Trump to gain more power than they ever deserved, and when someone tries to call out their wrongdoings, the government even assists with sweeping all accusations under the rug.

Ultimately I didn't care until I had a son. Now I need to know he can grow into a smart, respectable man, and its clear to me now that I have very low chances of being successful in doing so here in America.

635,"I'm a 2nd year and I'm still not liking my university. (pretty big state school with ~25k students, around 35 min from my home) Ever since last year I've felt really lonely and that I don't belong here and made the wrong choice.

First, I can't stand the town that it's in. Rent and prices here are insane, and it's a super congested area and feels like a bubble. The people here are pretty much the polar opposite of my political beliefs, some are really cool and some are assholes (which you'll find anywhere). I've given it a fair try and even explored a lot of stores and food places here, but at the end of the day I just feel like I don't fit in. And I'm not trying to bash this town, I can definitely see why people enjoy it, but the culture here just isn't for me.

Second, I have zero friends here. I tried making friends last year, going to events in my dorm, going to orientation events, going to a Fifa tournament, and even joining an intramural soccer team. But in the end, I just ended up making slight acquaintances and no real friends to chill with . It's weird because my whole life I've never had a problem making friends, I was never popular and always introverted, but I made friends easily in school and on every sports team.

I've gone to a counselor, gone to the gym, and taken care of myself the last year, but I'm still unhappy here. Not to mention, last summer I had a 3 month summer break and I felt a huge weight off my shoulders not being here. I hung out with friends at home and enjoyed working a cool grocery store job and I feel like I'm just happier away from here.

It just hurts because this is a great school, everyone in my close family went here/is associated with here, my scholarships are solid, and it's close to home...I feel like I should be happy here. It also sucks cause deep down inside I don't feel proud to go to this school, and I have no desire to root for the sports teams after watching all the football and basketball games in high school.

Should I stick it out for two more years or go somewhere else? The education here is really good and I don't know where else I would go. If I stuck it out, I'd consider taking a gap semester. While I haven't brought this up to my parents, I know they'll support my decision and will try to encourage me to stay but also support me leaving for another school.

637,"So I've lived in this house with 3 other working guys. For 3 months and I've never seen this kid shower, not once. 

He's taken over the basement living room. He's taken all the pots and dishes and they lay moldy in a pile in his room. He has garbage bags filled and piled in his room. His bed consists of a foamy which is surrounded by garbage. 

It smells in the hallway. We are all very upset, we've told him to clean. He's one of two that signed the lease, we took pictures to show the landlord and get him taken off. We're starting to be very rude to him. The other day I stood in his doorway and stared him in the eyes as I emptied a bottle of febreeze into his room.",06Feb2020,1
638,"Hello, I (15 y/o bisexual male) am really attracted to one of my best friends and always have been attracted since we met almost a year ago. At first I thought I had no chance as I thought he wasn't attracted to men, but when I add everything up I'm not so sure anymore. I've always thought he acted a bit strange in talking and preforming certain actions. For example, he doesn't mind sitting really close to me or even directly next to me in some cases when there's enough space for him to move. Also he always grabs me by my upper or lower arm when he wants tell me something, and when I talk to him he always looks me directly into my eyes. The things I just listed are a few noticeable things that no one really does to me nor does he to other people. But that hasn't turned my mind on as I really didn't notice that until a couple of days when I really started thinking. We were in a tram on the way back home, and I noticed that this was the first time we really were alone together. There are 3 seats next to each other with very little space between them, on 2 sides. I sit on the first one expecting him to sit on the third one so there is some space between us, but he sits next to me leaving almost no space between us with his elbow almost grinding on my private part. He also started acting very awkward and silent the whole ride which is the opposite of him. He also told goodbye around 10 seconds before he actually left which made things more awkward. After that I only noticed how he was acting around me and to me only. So next weekend he is going to stay at my place overnight and I want to make the right move as he probably is not going to do anything because of his shyness. It might be useful for you to know that he doesn't know I'm bisexual nor does anyone really.",06Feb2020,1
639,"Disclaimer, I’m just describing my situation. It’s layered and difficult to describe; I find myself cringing at some of the things I write because they make me feel uncomfortable to share. elements could come off as offensive to some. I apologize if that happens, I mean nothing against anyone. (Also Im on mobile, sorry for grammar and spelling.) 

My mom is a sexual assault survivor, as was her mom, and her grandmother, and so forth. Generational trauma runs deep, and it has led to my brother being afforded a greater degree of freedom than me. I was always kept at home, not allowed to go to sleep-overs, not allowed to close the door if I had friends in my room. My mother propagated this to protect me from entering into situations where I could be vulnerable to assault. And I suppose, in her mind, it was perfectly reasonable of her to do so. I don’t know if it was bad of her to do that or not.

She spent a very long time educating me about predators and danger in the world and my environment. I remember constantly being surrounded by warnings of r*pe and murder and kidnapping. Torture of young women by dangerous men was discussed with me multiple times. I don’t remember when it started, I feel like it’s always been this way. 

The thing that really bothers me and affects me in my daily life is the way she described every sexual act in detail, the way she would drill me about what to do if someone kidnapped me or locked me in the trunk of their car. This eventually escalated into showing me adult content about serial killers and rapists on the t.v. and internet. I saw crime scene photos really young, I don’t remember how young. I knew who Ted Bundy and Gary Ridgeway were and what they had done (two famous figures who happened to live close by to where I grew up.) She also allowed me to explore violent historical data about wars and mass killings (WWII, Vietnam, Jonestown, Columbine, slavery in the U.S, etc.) which I DID explore of my own accord and discussed with her at length. I saw crime scene photos, photos of holocaust victims, mass graves, autopsy photos, and a lot of other content that exposed me to really dark stuff. In grade school, teachers would write home about inappropriate things I would say in class, and how they were concerned for me. But my mom is a really educated person who speaks well, and she was always able to soothe any discomforts they had. Idk how.

As an adult, I’m constantly thinking about these things. It’s almost compulsive, and I have this weird drive to collect massive amounts of medical, psychological, and historical facts on these subjects. I often re-read and re-read wiki pages about murders, watch violent movies, read books and look at threads about true-crime, etc. Etc. I can’t help but be overly aware of my surroundings, and plan how I can get away if someone I’m talking to attacked me or tried to drag me into the woods. Likewise, It takes up so much of my mental energy and time, it makes me come off as odd to others, and I feel so stupid talking about it because it sounds like I’m a wanna’-be emo teenager. (I’m dreading the comments to this, haha)

But I’m a psychology major now, and entering a career in government work surrounding the correctional system. I also have been through therapy and am significantly more relaxed. I have tools to cope with my feelings, and developed interests that are outside of everything listed above. I’m perusing a career I feel is important, I discovered I love public service, and I’m all around much healthier than I was in my teen years. Hopefully, this pattern continues. Trying to better myself is really difficult, but I try my damndest.

Has anyone else experienced this? Have any other young women been taught to avoid danger by a parent like this? I love my mom, but I don’t know how to feel about this part of our relationship.",06Feb2020,1

One of our leads basically works 1 day a week and has been meaning to step down from her spot for forever , the other has his notice in for a new opportunity. Everyone is aware I start a new job at the first of the month and will be leaving but now with personal situations consuming the time of my boss and our on staff leads AND with the leaving lead putting forth minimal effort my job has become hell on earth and it looks as if I’ll be working multiple 12 hour shifts until I leave for my new opportunity.

I told my boss that I was happy to stay around to fill the gaps until the replacement for myself and our leaving lead are hired. But the incoming workload is far more than i suspected or I’ve ever had to deal with while here my last few years and I feel like I’m getting used since everyone is tunneling in their business outside of work. It’s dragging my  morale down heavily, and I’ve got my own life things to deal with too ya know?

All to ask:
Would it be wrong for me to put my notice in now/earlier because I don’t feel it’s right for everyone to dump their work load on me in my final days?

648,"I'm 31. I've worked for my Brother's company for 5 years now. Never thought I'd be here. 

At first, it was very nice of him to hire me for $15 an hour, and I was only working two days a week. Now, I run the entire office. My job consists of everything from Organizing and Intake of shipments, to billing, payroll, janitor, system designer, receptionist... I basically do everything. We're a home automation company, and I answer phones, create the estimates, send out the bills, pay the employees, deposit checks and record the transactions, order, returns... I deal with everything, which allows them to do their work and make tons more money! 

 They bill like $250 an hour. So any hour they're not doing the small stuff, they're making more money. My brother is super abusive as a boss, but that's like whatever... the problem is, they pay me $17 an hour in Los Angeles, 4 days a week. I work fast, so I don't need to be here fridays as I get everything done. But I've been on this pay for a while now, and doing much more, and wanting to start a family, and it's impossible! I know they have the money, and I feel they should have offered me a raise. I mean, I never wanted to be a burden on the company, or even ask for a raise. I wanted to them to realize they're doing way better with me here and then treat me like a human. 

I want to get married, I want to be able to pay for a car or vacation... 2k a month is not doing it in LA. I'm sharp, fast, talented, tough to deal with sometimes... but so are my two bosses. I mean... I want to be seen as part of this makeshift company, but in reality they just see me as some shitty person here to do the work they don't want to do. 

I have no idea what to do here. By comparison, I get paid $75 an hour for piano lessons, $60 an hour for singing, and $150 an hour for Photography... but those aren't steady. I've never tried to make them steady, but they're not. I want a job I can count on. 

The worst part is, they won't even be clear with me about a raise. Two weeks ago the boss said he'll talk to my brother (the other boss) because I don't wanna deal with this with my brother. Then last week he said again. Then this week he said we'll meet... All the while, he's on vacation and not even answering or considering that I'm a human being. I said just tell me NO if you have to, and I'll go work somewhere else and  you'll quickly realize my value. 

Yesterday I snapped back at him via email... I listed all the jobs I do for the company, and showed my complete salary last year 20,877. He responded, ""if you respond like that again you won't have a job."" Again, just notifying me that I'm a piece of shit who isn't even worthy of requesting a raise, or asking if a raise is even a possibility.

Im currently in the stage of life, where I get to choose my career related subjects. This is something I was always calm with and knew what I exactly wanted. I still do, but im not as sure anymore. A month or so ago if you would have asked what I would have wanted to be, I would have said a Computer Programmer, or a Video Game Developer, without any hesitation. My understanding is that both are similar in the way the work, however with the latter I may want to become a Creative Designer that designs the game, its creativeness etc.

However im not really sure anymore with terms like Computer Engineer, Scientist, Information Practices popping at the same time.

This unsure feeling im getting is actually supported by a feeling of taking a career as a writer/journo, where I think my creativity can bloom, however I still would prefer to lean towards the Game Developer career.

So yeah, thats a highschooler, who is going to select his subjects in the coming weeks, who was sure before but not anymore.

655,"I don't normally post about my personal life but I'm kinda looking for some outside opinions and advice.

My boyfriend and I have been together for Nearly 4 and a half years. We started dating in Highschool and have gone through many ups and downs over the years.

We didn't really have any problems until he joined the army. The first year of him being in the army was hell for me. We fought a lot, mostly over distance. We nearly broke up once over it.

However we got over it and our relationship seemed to get closer after that incident. Fast Forward a couple of years and everything is fine. I usually only get to see him twice a year but I grew used to it. 

Towards the end of last year was when problems started to arise again. I feel like the distance was getting to him. He seemed distant when we talked over the phone and it felt like he was disinterested a lot of the time. 

One day he finally told me how he was feeling. I remember it clearly and I'm still a little hurt by it thinking of it now. I had asked him if he still loved me. There was a long uncomfortable silence and he told me that he still cared for me but he wasn't sure if he loved me any more. 

He explained to me that he thought we were growing apart, that it was hard to balance our relationship and his social life. He felt like this for days and my emotional state was just getting worse. I didn't know what to do. A few days pass and I'd finally had enough. I told him let's see how our relationship is after Christmas, maybe it was just all the stress and distance getting to him. 

Christmas rolls around. To sum it up, it was like we were Two lovesick teenagers. It was like we had no problems at all and we were completely in love. 

Then as the holidays ended its like reality came crashing back. He did say he loved me at least but he didn't know if our relationship would continue. 

It's been a few weeks since he went back to the army. We haven't really talked much since then. 

I'm really uncertain about our future. 

I keep thinking maybe I should just let him go. I'm miserable, I still love him and want to be with him but maybe we just need to go our separate ways. 

I just don't know if I can keep going through this emotional roller-coaster with him. 

Any advice would be appreciated. ❤️🙏",06Feb2020,1
656,"Heya. 

You can skip this next paragraph and go to the second one for the problem. And I apologise in advance as I suspect this will be VERY long.

I don't usually ask the internet for life advices because what I'm going to type is all you are going to get and it might miss the context of what actually is happening to me. I know that just means I should talk to those near me instead; just know that I'm doing that too. I just want to hear as much opinion on this as I can before making a decision.

So it all started last year when I got the russian scholarship after a succesful interview. This was not the only scholarship I applied to at the time but it was the first to respond to me. After months of being unemployed I took the first opportunity that I get.

At first I was of course ecstatic. I'm going to a place where only a few people have gone to study! But then months after while waiting for my flight, gradually things got more and more worrisome. I found out that the scholarship only covered tution fees and the allowance per month is about 30 USD.

I discussed a lot with my family before I departed and ultimately decided to go. I know that it was foolish to not look into the scholarship fully. I don't like looking back at it. I was so desperate to study abroad, just anywhere that I just blindly applied. More on this later.

When I arrived to Russia, a lot and I mean A LOT of unlucky things happened to me. Room flooded and having shitty roomates being two of them. Top that with barely able to communicate with people, I broke down. I can remember the number of times I broke down and just cried sitting down in my life. In my time in Russia it happened 3 times.

It is worth mentioning this is my first experience of studying abroad. Yes yes I know, everyone probably thinking its a classic case of homesick. I really respect all those teenagers being sent to study abroad now while I'm here in my 20s whining.

After months of classes, the situation there started to get better. I got along with my classmates. I enjoy the language studies and even passed the exam for the first semester. 

Then I started thinking about my future.
There are 3 major reasons I went to Russia:
1. One of my main motivator to finish my degree is so that I can take my Masters'.
2. I want to make my parents proud of me for one last time with my results, since my degree result was mediocre.
3. I want to be able to tell my grandchildren I studied in Russia.

I just finished my first semester and am currently on a semester break. I did a lot of thinking:
1. At the rate I'm going, I don't think I would be a able to write a thesis using russian language. Let alone a 2000 words assignment. 

2. I feel like I'm wasting my time here as even if I get my Masters' the only job opportunity that will open up for me is teaching. Which I don't feel too strongly about. (For context I'm taking Technical Physics, which in my country don't have much application other than to teach Physics)

3. The full length of this course is 3 years with 1 year dedicated to language and high school science studies for a kind of 'entrance test' to get to the main uni. 

The thing is, even if I do pass this test and officially get started on my Masters' there's no guarantee that I would be able to do it. If I fail, I would probably have to repeat a semester or two, making the total to 4 years or more. I don't want to wastefully use my youth like that. Especially on a future job that I'm not too fond of...

So should I just quit now and cut my loses? 
I'll add more if I remember some points that's needed.",06Feb2020,1

659,"I live with a roommate, he also happens to be my best friend, and we have lived in apartments and houses with no issues, until now. We’re both millennials, and as per the norm my roomie deals with very common mental ailments, and I have been very considerate of them, but I feel as though I am a camel and one too many pieces of straw have been placed on my back.

I am very clean, annoyingly clean, and I try and control myself as best as possible, but sometimes it really is just too much. My roommate is not the cleanest person I have ever met but he’s always done a fantastic job of keeping it in his room, and I have never had issues with that (I don’t have to do anything in his room, so to me all is fair). However, that does lead me to cleaning the common areas of the apartment by myself, and that’s been the case in multiple leases, but this one in particular (started in Aug. 2019).

I like to think of myself as a decent human being, but I know I have my flaws. Nevertheless, when it came time to move last summer, and my roommate had 200 dollars to his name, I fronted the rest of the costs (I’d say about 1500?). These are where the problems start, as it is now February and he owes me 1500 bucks. To make matters worse our PSE&amp;G (gas and electric) bill has been higher than people I know who own homes, we have a two bedroom duplex and it’s small. I have also been paying this bill in full, along with out internet, groceries, and anything other necessary bills until just a few days ago. I just finally broke down and forced his hand into a payment plan (105 bucks every paycheck until our lease is up, and he can’t borrow another cent from me). However, it’s not enough and I don’t know what to do or what to say.

Another reason, and please don’t advert to me being jealous, is that he just recently started seeing someone, and he’s a new person (naturally not to me) but this new person has him doing things I have never seen, and has him waking up in the morning to start their days of adventure (something myself and another good friend have never been able to do, so much so, that we have been hours and I mean hours late to far to many events and trips I’d like to think about). Now my issues here are that there was no discussion of her living here (she essentially does) and she’s as dirty as him. Now, I know you’re thinking oh they probably keep it in his bedroom, well they don’t. They act like they live here and I’m a live in maid because I don’t know how else you can explain letting one person clean the only bathroom, kitchen, and living area.

I have gone to him directly and said that she is a guest in our home and needs act accordingly, and I stressed this point heavily that she is not to be here alone, period. To him that means she can get here a few hours before he is done work to start her laundry, that inevitably i will end up paying for. We are not well off at all, and I don’t know where any of this came from but it’s stressing me out immensely.

We had these talks and ideas of working together and all that good stuff and I get that plans change I really do, but I also feel like I have some valid points and a stressful situation. I’m okay with money and have always been good at saving some, but this way of life I have found myself in doesn’t sit right with me. He barely used the kitchen, now they’re in their constantly, and don’t feel a need to clean? Is there something wrong with me? Am I overreacting? Am I, for a lack of a better phrase, too much? I need some help guys because it doesn’t matter what I say or do. This was proven to me when he said (during our money payment convo) he doesn’t think anything has changed since August to make this place dirtier and more expensive. ANOTHER HUMAN is living here, and I have to pay and clean for it, how do you mean.... any and all advice, criticisms, or just your two cents is appreciated.

TLDR: I was nice and patient with my roommate about contributing to our living arrangements because I thought he was truly down in the dumps. Turns out I was a placeholder until he found someone else. I am at my wits ends and just wanna hear the ideas and opinions of others.",06Feb2020,1

I had been in school for so long that I was just so exhausted. I also couldn’t afford it. Something inside me longed to be different from everyone else. Even though I went to a nice, cushy school and what not, eventually it wasn’t enough. I felt like everyone was just apart of this system after a while. Everyone was just so caught up in school and grades and stress because they had to be. They had to get a degree because that’s what society says we need to live a comfortable life. But I didn’t want to be like that. I thought maybe I could do something different. Show people that you don’t need to follow the rules to be successful. Kind of like a big fuck you.

663,"Hello,

I am stuck between a rock and a hard place right now. I am a third year university student who currently lives in a rental house with 3 other roommates. Today marks the official 6 month period since we signed our lease on the house! Inevitably, one of our roommates is going to move out. My best friend and I were the ones who found the rental and went through all the  legwork to obtain the house over this past summer. One of our roommates is awesome and he may potentially move out to be under the same roof as his younger brother who is a freshman currently living on campus at our university. The other roommate is an irresponsible, lackadaisical, and frustrating roommate to live with, who is honestly just pure rubbish that me and my best friend (3rd roommate) really do not want to live with next year, or at least don't want to have to live with him intentionally for another year. 

The roommate that we want to kick out is terrible at cleaning as I have literally never seen him clean a single common area in the house and has NEVER swept or mopped our hardwood floors. He refuses to use the dishwasher and is irritatingly slow at doing his dishes. The 3 of us all will make food and almost immediately, rinse the dishes off, and then place them in the dishwasher. This kid has a continuous habit of leaving lights on that do not need to be on raising the electric bill for all of us. He has his annoying ass girlfriend over all the time, who is generally not courteous of our house in general. She leaves lights on, uses our utilities, and has no self recognition that we all have to pay for her presence. Those two will do laundry and leave clothes in the washer and/or dryer for days on end and don't have any urgency to free up the washer and dryer for someone else. We had a keg the night before our state rivalry football match the weekend before Thanksgiving and the roommate in question threatened to call the cops on our own house at 11 PM because as soon as his girlfriend and him stopped were ready to call it quits for the night the entire party had to be shut down. We all mutally agreed to have a keg for this event within days of moving into the house. He even called his dad and bragged to him about how were going to have a fat party... yeah, this kid is a pussy. Not to mention I am the account holder for a $70 internet bill in our house hold in which I ask each roommate to pay $10 (I literally front more than half of the bill) and he did not pay me for the month of December when I asked and was 3 weeks late on the simple payment and got pissed that I IP banned his devices in the house until he payed me. I guess its a good thing I'm purchasing a router with DumaOS so I can limit his bandwidth and if I hear a complaint about internet speed he can start purchasing more bandwidth :). He has not taken any significant actions to improve his behavior and we are all becoming fed up with it.

So, ultimately one of my good roommates may potentially move out but my friend and I would love to have his younger brother move into our house and we just kick out the shitty roommate. Even if our good roommate moves out we still want to kick him out. I am not afraid of confrontation because I will always shoot people straight and tell them what they need to hear rather than what they want to hear. The last time I called this kid out for an issue in the house he became so hostile and told my friend that he can't talk to me about issues in the house because were going to get into a fight. I might be an asshole (which I'm really not) but I'm also not going to let someone live in delusion about their actions. 

How should we go about attempting to kick this guy out? How should I inform him that he will not be on the lease next year? What should be the basis of the conversation considering he is super soft and cannot handle the slightest criticism of his actions and is not good at dealing with confrontation? I want to be courteous enough to inform him that he will not be on the lease so he has several months to make arrangements to find alternative living and get a new place before next school year. If our roommate does like the idea of his brother replacing the shitter roommate, how do we bring that up to him and tell him he has to move out? Any advice you can provide on dealing with how to tell someone they need to move out it would be greatly appreciated!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR I live with a roommate who sucks and need advice on how to approach kicking him out/telling him he needs to find another place to live/he won't be on the lease for the next year.",06Feb2020,1
665,"I am a VERY forgiving person and I give my friends the benefit of the doubt always! However, to sum it up me and 2 other friends were going to live together HOWEVER one friend never signed the lease. Now her reasoning was because her mother and herself both felt like she wasn’t responsible enough to get a whole apartment yet which VERY understandable BUT, I found out after 2 weeks she’s living with another friend this August in an apartment? Even after she told me she wasn’t responsible enough for one?? So is this disrespectful? I play devil’s advocate a lot so it is hard for me not to see another person’s side. She could be living in a cheaper apartment OR even a university owned apartment (which financial aid helps with). I just don’t know when someone is being passively disrespectful vs. directly (like bullying or insulting me) so how can I tell?",06Feb2020,1
666,"Hi I don’t post much so please bear with me. 

I’m an 18 year old female who lives at home and has graduated highschool with average grades. I’m not going to college but I have a full time job. 

Here’s my situation- I’ve been in a relationship with someone I believe I really really love for over a year now and things are amazing. I don’t have the best mental health but he’s been so supportive and there for me through everything even at the beginning. We moved really fast, it didn’t take long to say I love you. 
My mom, is a pessimist. Her and my dad don’t have the most picture perfect relationship. Every time she talks to me about my relationship it makes me more and more scared of what’s to come. She makes me feel like this love is temporary and that eventually I will be as miserable as her. That the way we feel about each other will disappear over time. I’m absolutely terrified of that. This is my first real relationship on top of it. I’m his first girlfriend. It sounds stupid but I can see a life with him. He’s such an old soul, hes in the military and he’s so career focused and I’m so focused on our future. I’m so scared to lose this... but her words make me feel like this is all an illusion that I’ll lose. Everyone seems so pessimistic about relationships. They never work and it’s so scary for me to think about I don’t know what to expect 

Career wise. I’m just a mess. I have a really good full time office job but I don’t want to be stuck here for the rest of my life. Ive always wanted to work with animals but I never took the right courses in highschool to get into a decent college. I feel like my time is up to get the right education even though it’s really not... I just don’t know the right steps to make. Do I wait to advance my career? What do I even look into for it? I don’t want to be in loads of debt but I don’t want to be miserable. I feel like I’m a disappointment if I don’t get a career, like the people who doubted me were right. 


I’m hoping this is the best place to post this. I just need advice from anyone. People who know what it’s like becoming an adulthood. This is scary and new for me and I just need any advice I can get",06Feb2020,1
667,"I suppose the best way to even begin to ask for advice is to tell my story from the beginning.

Around September of 2019 I met a guy off of a hookup app. Great start huh. Anyways, this guy was the straight and curious type. That’s fine, whatever. We’re just two guys trying to get off lol. I wasn’t there for a story or anything life altering. 

Flash forward a few months and slowly but surely we’re seeing each other more and more. Although at this point it’s still just a hookup thing. The holidays begin arriving and we’ve begun opening up to each other. Telling one another our goals and ambitions, likes and dislikes, our lives. Over the course of the holidays I feel we really began to get to know each other fairly well. 

By December I’ve come to realize I’ve caught feelings for this guy. Although I refuse to do anything at the time because of the nature of how we met, and the fact that I’m the first guy he’s ever been with. Plus I highly doubted he even felt the same towards me. 

We continue meeting up once the holidays ended, and still we learn more about each other. I come to learn he’s not only physically beautiful but beautiful inside and out. I mean this guy is truly a beautiful human being. So deep, thoughtful, insightful, kind, ambitious. I’ve realized that at this point I’m deeply in love.

Midway through January I tell him how I feel. Without saying the L word of course. He’s shocked and really doesn’t know how to deal with what I’ve told him. So I give him the time to think on it. About a week or so later he tells me he feels the same, but is conflicted because of how he sees his future with a wife and kids, and moving from city to city working and experiencing new things in life before that. Not to mention what changes being with a guy would bring to his life. The potential judging and scrutiny from family and friends.

Knowing all of this we continue to see each other. Making time to actually hang out and do things other than mess around. We discuss our feelings here and there and I ask him point blank if I’d ever have a chance to be more with him. After some thought he pretty much tells me that it’s just too complicated and that he can’t deal with what being with a guy would bring. Of course I’m hurt, but decide that we may as well enjoy the rest of our time together until the end of January, when he begins a course for his job and will become much busier than he is currently.

Our last weekends together are wonderful, but simultaneously bittersweet and so, so painful. I try to tell him that no matter how long or how hard I have to work to get him to be more comfortable, I will do anything, fight as hard as I have to for him. Even telling him that I love him, but to no avail. He’s just not brave enough to love me openly like I deserve. Hell, how everyone on this earth deserves.

So, to the reason I need advice, and maybe it’s stupid of me to ask for any. Given how this story has played out, but I need perspective from someone other than a family or friend.

Should I just give up on him? Should I let him go and live out this plan he’s got for his future? Not that I wanted to ruin it, if anything, I’d hop from city to city with him, but the thought of him marrying a woman and settling down because he feels like that’s what he’s got to do shatters me to my core. It makes me so sad he can’t live his truth. Besides the fact that I can’t love him like I want to. 

Maybe I’m an absolutely hopeless romantic, but I haven’t felt this way about anyone in so long. I feel like I’d be a fool to let him go.

Any advice/perspective on this is greatly appreciated!",06Feb2020,1
668,"I (F20) currently live with my parents and my younger brother (M16). Recently I've become unemployed and my mental health has gotten worse, so I spend most of my time at home. On a day to day basis I'll do all the dishes, take the dog out, help with/make dinner and just tidy up random things here and there. I'm also responsible for cleaning the bathrooms weekly and changing the cat litter. This isnt a long to-do list however having to deal with depression makes accomplishing things more difficult. Some days I just want to stay in bed all day but I know things need to get done so I force myself to get up.

My family has always been generally lazy but lately things are getting really under my skin. For example, people will make food for themselves and leave all the dishes for me to deal with. My mom will expect the house to be kept tidy and if she notices anything dirty I'm the first to be told to clean it. I will clean the bathrooms and the next day there will be stains on the mirror and counter tops. It just angers me that my family is not considerate of their mess or that I have to clean it up after them. 

To make matters worse, my parents are very lenient when it comes to my brother's responsibilities. He never helps out with anything and just leaves after dinner is done. I have spoken to my mother about getting him to help out more, but she twists the conversation into about how I need to focus on my own chores and  that I never helped out alot at his age. Everytime I bring up my issues about household responsibilities I get shut down. The thing is, my family expects me to go above and beyond for them but then don't reciprocate or even appreciate what I do. 

At this point I've just stopped cleaning up after people, but I risk that leading to an argument which it almost always does. I guess what I'm trying to figure out here is if I'm justified in feeling this frustration towards my family or if their expectations are reasonable. I don't pay rent so I know I need to work hard to earn my keep, but dealing with my depression plus my families laziness and my brothers lack of responsibility is driving me insane. The fact that people don't listen to my complaints adds to this anger and it's gotten to the point where I don't know if I'm in the right any more.

669,"A bit of a weird one, but stay with me.

I'm a teenager with a job as a waiter. It's a zero hour contract and since I can only work weekends, I rarely get shifts. My last shift was about two or three weeks ago and I started during the summer holidays when I was available every day and got at least two shifts a week.

Obviously, not having a job isn't a huge problem for me but it's nice to earn some money and get experience. The real issue is how I was fired. All the part-time staff are in this group chat where a weekly timetable is posted and employees can swap shifts or get covered etc. And I was removed from this. It was completely unexpected and I didn't see it coming; I am punctual whenever I have a shift and my performance is decent. 

But what's really bugging me is that my manager hasn't even contacted me otherwise, which seems a bit tacky. I don't believe it was an accident and I'm not sure how I should approach my manager about it, since I've still got wages to collect (I always get my wages from a shift during my next shift) and my shirt and apron to return.

I’m invited to go out with them and stay the night at one of their houses and was excited about it until I learnt that an out of school friend of 3 people in the group was coming too. I’ve never met them before and know next to nothing about them. It takes me about 3 months to get fully confident around people, and in a situation with new people I’m so uncomfortable and out of my depth I sort of just shut off.

674,"So basically this is a very long story. Here goes.

I had a group of 4 girl friends (including me, 3 of us are 19 and the other is 22, lets call them K, N, and E)  last semester and things were great. I really felt like we'd be friends forever etc etc. And I had another friend group with a couple of exchange students (both 19M). So automatically both my friend groups joined and one of my girl friends, E (22F) , is the super super sociable one and she's really extroverted. She got really close to one of the exchange guys, lets call him A. A and E end up falling for each other which was sad because since he's on exchange he's gonna have to go back. Fast forward to this semester, E starts acting off with me. I'm the type of person who'll speak up if I feel like someone is acting off with me. So I asked her whats up and she got even more pissed off (??). She then didn't talk to me for the next couple of days. Mind you during this time period, everything was fine between me and the other 2 girls from my group. Then I decide to talk to E to sort things out and she tells me I messed up by, and I quote:

1. I told one of my friends about A and E getting close in the context of liking each other (because they were trying to keep it a secret but I didn't even know they were a thing until I asked E till later on) 
2. When she did tell me about her and A, which was after I asked her, I reacted by saying ""I'm kinda sad I got to know last"" (cause everyone in my friend group knew except me, so I felt left out)
3. She has exams going on in Jan, and I told her about one of my issues but not completely which pissed her off because she felt really 'disrespected' and 'stepped on' that I undermined her exams
4. Me bringing up her being off with me and she thought I was trying to ruin her mood. 

Anyway, I apologize for each and everything and E tells me to reflect on what I've done. Since she's older to me I really really respect her and stuff so I stay away for a few days and think about all of this. After a week or so, I talk to her again and apologize once again about everything I've done and she tells me that she doesn't see this friendship going anywhere and I respected that. Yes, I was sad because I lost a friend but this does not stop there. 

The other two girls in my friend group also start acting very off with me. I ask them why and this is where shit hits the fan. One of them lets call her N, says she's mad with me because I lied to her. I ask her what I lied to her about and she brings up this one instance of when I got sexually assaulted and she claims I'm lying to her because the guy said otherwise (this guy is in our class) and another instance I apparently lied about was when I told her about my date with this other guy. AND WHATS FUNNY IS THAT ***E*** HAS RECENTLY BECOME FRIENDS WITH THE TWO GUYS I'VE MENTIONED. Coincidence? 

And these 3 girls basically are talking to each and every friend that I have outside of them and they're bringing up little little things I've said and done and making me out to be a very bad person that I know I'm not.  Basically everyone hates me now and I've got no friends left. :) I've never felt this lonely and isolated my whole life. Especially by people who I once held extremely close. I've been seeing a therapist because I genuinely think I might be depressed. This is the worst I've felt about myself and my surroundings in my 19 years of existence. Everyday, I don't want to go to campus because I can't bring myself to see them because it hurts. It hurts a lot. I don't know what to do I'm so lost. I'm only just 19 and I have my whole life ahead of me but I feel like things are never going to get better.",06Feb2020,1

678,"I (27f) don’t know what to do for/ about my brother (24m)
 
He is severely depressed, I don’t think he knows what being just “ok” feels like. He has been this way since childhood. Our mom died and we had a monster of a step mom, both of which contributed to his low self worth and complete lack of motivation. 
 
I’ve been called an enabler by my parents, neither of whom are very nurturing. My step mom is borderline mentally abusing and my dad is passive and brainwashed to agree with her so as to avoid blow ups. 
 
Through the years I have done what I thought were helpful things, paying his phone bill, buying him clothes, hand holding during processes like paying taxes or getting his oil changed. Things he wouldn’t always do on his own. 
 
About three months ago he left a good job for a shady under the table job, all for the sake of a few more dollars an hour.  No one was surprised when a month later the shady job ghosted him. Things like this are a pattern in his life. He does not think ahead and will leave a year round job for a seasonal job that pays a tiny bit more, with no plans for when that job ends. 

As a result, he found himself displaced, losing his apartment when he couldn’t pay rent. 
 
I wasn’t going to let him be homeless. I let him move into my new apartment. He was supposed to be here two weeks, until he could get a job and move in with his friend. 
 
It has been over a month, he drinks a 6 pack a night, using a gift card from Christmas (intended for gas) to pay for it and plays video games all day. His friend has flaked on him, I assume to avoid the situation I am in currently.
 
I am a full time college student. Being able to pay rent and feed myself was stressful enough, without the added financial burden. I have told him how stressful paying for him has been and do think he feels bad. 
 
When it got well past the point of taking advantage, I decided to set some rules. I gave him two weeks to get a job or pack his things. I also laid out a plan for my expectations on at what point I expect him to start helping with rent. In the meantime he is doing all the dishes and walking my dog when I’m gone. 
 
In a typical move for him, he continued to be generally unmotivated.  Only  applying to only a handful of jobs online, waiting until two days before the deadline to job hunt outside the apartment. And, again, surprising no one, he got hired on the spot. He has always been just lucky enough to avoid most real life consequences.
 
I believe that at a certain point you can no longer blame your behavior on the past; once you acknowledge the problem there is no excuse for not trying to better yourself. Which is why I struggle when it comes to my brother. I am torn between wanting to care for him and wanting him to better himself and be happy.

The ball is currently in my court since he is living with me for free until he squares his debts.
I would like to enforce rules that deal with his underlying issues. I was contemplating a “dry apartment” rule and giving him a deadline to start seeing a therapist, something he has been open to in the past. The no alcohol rule is going to be tough, and he will be mad about it. I’m not sure it can be all or nothing. 
 
I am not sure what a reasonable level of rules would be, and I know I can’t make empty threats about him moving out.
 
I don’t know what to do or how to help him. All feedback is welcome.
 
Tldr: I’m potentially enabling my brother who is living with me for free. While he did just get a job, I would like to enforce rules that address his underling issues of depression and potential alcoholism.",06Feb2020,1
679,"Some context before I start going on ranting, I'm Pans 19YO, Male, most likely in the spectrum since I haven't seen the document stating so Sharon claims to have somewhere. I've been living a really eventful life, if you ask me. This is also my first post so, sorry in advance if this seems rushed or confusing, please ask if you can't understand anything. (Some things I will write to stay anon, I'm terrified someone's gonna find this) 

I change names to stay anon.

These last few years have been just awful. I miss going to school in [ANON] because I had friends and right now I feel invisible to most of them now, I guess it might be me not planning anything or that they're just really busy but I'm scared I'm bothering or that i seem like I'm cheating on my amazing boyfriend, Giles because most of my friends are fairly attractive girls. I might have OCD due to a lot of symptoms connecting, as well as anxiety since my GP notices I get anxiety attacks and I'm on edge, I have times where I feel like I can't get a ""full breath"". Giles is literally the best thing in my world right now, he's always had my back since last year and I try to be the best I can for him and I plan on [ANON] to his place before I go to uni. 

My parents are not great especially Sharon, But my dad Chris does have my back and I trust Chris more but I feel like whenever I get emotional he doesn't listen and just tells me to ""go outside"" whenever I mention that I hate it here due to a feeling of dictatorship from Sharon and how messy and depressing this ""home"" is, although that's one con of Chris, don't see him as a bad person because he's a victim to Sharon. My brother, Marley is amazing, couldn't ask for a better one, he always looks to cheer me up whether it would be with really and jokes or just talking in general, he's even an admin on a big [ANON] server and he has really nice internet friends on it, I always look out for him as much as I can as his older brother. Giles is amazing, he loves gaming and Pocket monsters god, he's a bit of a weeby nerd too as well as me with my shots of JJBA and Star Wars, I have no idea how he puts up with me, I'm so lucky to have him as he puts through my silly thoughts, I end up getting thoughts I don't want then I get scared that I did wanted them and some of the thoughts I get, I get scared they were real, and apparently it's OCD working that, I love him so much, and I want to hopefully get engaged with him. The friends I talk to are alright, we game often on siege or BF2, we have a group chat and stuff, one in particular, Graham, is close, sometimes we fight and I get annoyed at him sometimes but eh, I kinda wish he wasn't as stubborn and presumptious and that he could try to understand the situation at home. But as of now no issues I think.

This house is just a state, I feel like the family isn't even a family but we are living under a massive burden, it's something I can't explain, I'm quite scared now that somehow Sharon will see this and kick me out or scream that she will do something to herself like hurt or kill herself cus the last few times we tried standing up to her, she held a knife in her hand near Chris. Sharon always gets me and Marley things because she still sees us as her to children, that ""side"" of Sharon is really nice, but when it comes to disagreeing with her on a major scale she will go mad on anything, whether it's us not doing what she tells us to do or whether we slightly annoy or inconvenience her, she always sees Chris as a drunken, cheating and dishonourable person, yet dad is known by most people here as a really nice guy, in fairness he is, despite his flaw of not trying to help me emotionally he does look out for me and my brother and takes most the emotional and psychological blows from Sharon. She doesn't really emotionally or psychologically hurt us directly but almost indirectly. An example would be that we would have to do as she says such as like maybe, get her a cigarette from next door, and we feel like we HAVE to otherwise she would go mad or passive aggressive. Sharon does make broken promises here and there and thinks we forget half the stuff she does. She has a history of lying and claims to have stopped, but hasn't. There has been times Sharon has called the police on Chris for just going to the pub with his mates til late and claims that Chris was in her face when he was so far from her and claims that he pushed her. Chris goes into custody and tells the police his side of the story and to my surprise, they do believe him. Because the police see him late at night often getting logs and such so the neighbour, Brandon, can buy them to burn it. I keep telling Chris to get Sharon sectioned but he never listens, I'm terrified that mum will hurt us eventually if we stand to her, she threw a ceramic plate at dads head one time, but dad doesn't want to section Sharon, he wants to wait until me and Marley move out, yet that's a while.. Personally I would rather get Sharon sectioned and get the help she needs, I don't want her to die living a lie, Sharon's been indoors for a very long time. Chris thinks she's literally far from helping and thinks she's missing a frontal lobe, every time I said that's not how it works he persists to be right. Narcissism is mental and so is sociopathy, but dad thinks it can't be helped and we gotta ""wait until we leave"" which I don't want my brother living another few years of shit whilst I'm in further education.

Did I mention Sharon is disabled? Very rarely people think Chris the abuser because of stereotypes often showing disabled people being victims of abuse. I remember when he got called a parasite by a paramedic because Sharo  told them he abuses her. The whole thing has been similar to this all our life, as kids we thought Chris was abusing Sharon being ""Sharon's cubs"" until I went into sport with Chris and told me his side of the story, I think Marley knew sooner than me, he's a smart kid honestly. It's still like this now, living in a messy house with a feeling of dictatorship until I visit my perfect man, Giles, for a while, those days fly by for me because he makes me feel so much better and happier.

[[[Onto another topic]]]

My real name, Hans, has sort of been hidden away from me since I was born, and I only found out when I was about [ANON]. And my LEGAL name wasn't even on official documents like in education and with my local doctors, and even nhs (which is now backfiring onto me with identity proof, I don't even have my own bank account yet because I still need evidence and I need to get a provisional which I have to pay for myself in order to prove it). They claim to have done it to make the decision mine once I've known, but I would've rather had the legal name so I didn't need as much evidence to prove my identity, I got most documents but I still need proof which has taken so long to do and I still don't have a job or a card cus of it. I want to get away from this place as soon as possible because I'm so much healthier with Giles, and i feel like I am a better person. A more happier and friendlier person who's not afraid anymore, whereas here if I get called for once or twice I end up getting angry over something so minute. I snap at Marley and Chris sometimes and say some passive things? I do apologise as soon as I realised I overreacted or if I snapped, I try not to. And lately I'm scared I'm going to snap at Sharon and get kicked out or that she will harm me because she's heavily unpredictable. 

That's the gist of it, I would write so much more but it would go on and on and on.

Is there any advice anybody can give me? Is there anyway I can move asap? Is there anyway I can help my brother for the next two years whilst I'm gone?? Thank you so much if you read all of this I really. Really appreciate it so much.",06Feb2020,1

My roommate was really good friends with this guy (let’s call him Brad) and he would often invite him to our dorm. Brad has a lot of problems and shows signs relating to a psychopath. He is very manipulative, impulsive, lies almost constantly, and will do anything to get his way. Brad had a very bad and prominent reputation in his former high school and it carried over to college. Knowing some of the things Brad has done, he is very deserving of his bad reputation. But because I never had a personal problem with him, I decided to be friends with him anyway. At one point, I even considered him to be one of my best friends because I thought he changed. Unfortunately as the semester went on, Brad became much worse. I can’t say exactly what happened, but Brad ended up getting in huge legal trouble with the school. Because of this, my roommate and I decided to cut him off for good. After we cut him off, school was a lot less stressful. We went our separate ways and everything was so much better for us
     Unfortunately, this period was very short-lived. I own a MacBook for college and it is synced to my phone. This makes it to where I can text people off of my computer. I’ve recently learned through other students that while Brad was in my room, he went through my computer without me knowing and took pictures of “sexts” I had between me and my girlfriend. These pictures include my girlfriend posing sexually in a dress (not nude but still obvious sexual intent) and me responding in a sexual way. Not only did he completely invade my privacy, he also sent it out to multiple people. I still can’t figure out how and when he was able to get in my computer. Surprisingly enough, this isn’t the first time he’s done something like this. I know this because while we were friends he showed us some horrible stuff he has on other people as well. What would stop him from doing the same to me? I can’t sleep at night knowing he has reputation-harming photos on both me and my girlfriend. I’ve known Brad for a while now, and he is the type of person to use that against me in the future. I know if I confront him about it that he will just lie and it won’t go anywhere. I’m also afraid to provoke him as well. This situation has caused me a great deal of stress and I don’t know what to do about it. Any of you guys’ advice would be greatly appreciated.

tl;dr: A bad person has reputation harming photos of me and my gf and sent it out to multiple people.",06Feb2020,1
684,"I work in the music industry, it’s a very small world and everyone knows everyone. My boss has been involved in the executive level of the industry for 20-30 years. He is a big schmoozer,  and consistently over promises and under delivers with his current company i work for. i have seen blatant lies from him in emails with clients, and there is a lack of transparency with certain aspects of the business that i find unsettling. 

Some circles think my boss is a cool guy, while others think he’s an asshole, and I have seen discussions on industry groups on facebook where some people are advising against working with his company. I am starting to wonder if many more people really know the truth about this guy. 

if the person i’m interviewing with has a negative opinion, and I lie and say “he’s great!” I feel they might think i’m foolish or at worst, supportive of the sketchy practices. but if they have a positive or neutral opinion, and I say “he sucks” they might think I just have an attitude problem.

686,"I am using a throwaway account. I would really appreciate serious advice on this.

It happened again today. I drive my kids to school and we were having the daily “are you ready yet?” conversation. One of my kids, a teenager, was not having a good morning and said something like “what are you, stupid?”

I got upset and said “you can’t say that to me“ and the teenager said “you’re stupid“ just to make a point.

At that point, I got angry, grab the kid by the shoulders and started saying “Stop it. You can’t talk to me like that. Stop it.“, Etc.

The kid started yelling at me and I pushed the kid down onto their bed which they were standing next to. At that point, we had a full back-and-forth yelling match for a minute, and of course nothing of any good was discussed or settled.

This was followed by accusations of “you look like you’re going to kill me“ and “I’m calling the police“. Fortunately neither of those things was true.

Within 10 minutes, we had a calm conversation where I apologized for getting angry and the kid apologized for saying nasty things to me. My wife rightly asked me “what’s wrong with you?”

I now feel like complete crap and like I’m a terrible father. When I look back at the discussion it seems clear to me that I could’ve calmly responded to the insults, but at that time I guess I had lost my temper too much.

This kind of thing has happened every two or three months for the last couple of years. I don’t want it to happen and I tell myself it won’t happen again, but at some point I guess I lose my perspective and it happens again.

Question for all of you is: what steps can I take to really make this behavior stop? Do I sound like I need to go get therapy, anger management, or something like that? or do I just need to stop being a jerk?

I love my kids and I love my wife and I want to be a good father, good husband, and a good person. Feeling like I do now, I believe I’m currently failing all of that. I would appreciate any serious advice that you have.",06Feb2020,1
687,"Hello, this is a throwaway account as you can see. 

I am just looking for a rational advice regarding a conundrum I am in. 

Background: I am a contractor at company A. Working for 5 months now. They are sponsoring my visa, but the project will last upto 12 months. 
 I liked it in the start but now it's just meh. The boss was also great in the beginning but now after one thing I didn't do according to what he expected, he has started second guessing me at every turn. Even to a point of calling me out in the meetings. Also, at some point I get a feeling that the work I do, is considered by him as not that useful or what he actually asked for. I feel him but he doesn't realizes that he is kinda vague in his requests too. 
The work is also kinda boring (only BA stuff, nothing tech yet) and requires a lot of meetings. Not that I am opposed to that. But it doesn't fully satisfy my skillset. 

My background: 
I have a hybrid set of skills, Business Analysis and Technical skills. ( I have worked as a app prog in the past but never was super awesome in that. But don't want to leave it but also don't want myself to be fully engrossed in it) 

Yesterday I got an offer for company B, slightly better pay and they are ready to file for my visa which will secure me this position for next 24months. The manager also said that there will be hybrid work involved which sounds exciting but not sure how much of that will be until I take their offer. 

Now, I am super confused, should I continue with my current work? I will still get my sponsorship but I am guessing only for 12 months. 

Or should I go for the new offer, about which I don't know a lot about what kind of work it will be but from the sound of it, its going to be hectic and demanding. 
But I also get slightly better pay and 24months + extension. 


I hope someone can help me. I don't know how I come off in this post, so please feel free to point that out as well. And if you want to ask more questions to clarify, please do so as well. Sorry if the english is bad. And sorry for long post.",06Feb2020,1
688,"I’m a senior this year in HS and I’ve “adopted” some freshmen and sophomore students. Of these, there are an adorable pair of twins, they’re the sweetest girls the lord ever made. They’ve had a rough life, being born to addicts and then going through the foster program after CPS took them from their parents. Fortunately they’ve been adopted by a wonderful family. However, the smaller of the two, I’ll call her Leanna, gets bullied, a lot. The twin are short, neither of them are above 5’1”. However Leanna is the only one who gets bullied. She has a fashion sense of a 2000’s tween, you know, tie dye, colorful leggings, light up shoes, and the likes. It’s adorable because she loves what she wears. But it makes her an easy target. Most recently she wore these cute unicorn earrings, but the entire class for a two hour period laughed at her clothes and threw trash and gum at her. When I saw her after her class she finally broke into sons of tears. I have personally been on both sides of bullying and I know that people often get away with this kind of behavior.

I (f19) have a guy friend (m18) who also works in the same office as me. Over the last few months, we grew closer and developed a friendship. Eventually we ended up sleeping together. We started flirting, texting more and seeing each other frequently. But then, he got a girlfriend.

He‘s still incredibly flirty towards me, and I think I have fallen in love with him. The last time I felt like this was 2 years ago in my last serious relationship (lasted 1.5 years).

Last weekend I got drunk and unfriended him on every social media app I have, which of course he noticed. He questioned me about it, telling me whatever it was, we could work through it.

I wish I could tell him, but I don’t want to risk our friendship. Also, I don‘t want to be that girl. The girl that breaks up a relationship, even if they‘ve only been going out for like 2 months. At the moment, talking to him and seeing him hurts me, but I don‘t want to cut him out of my life.

696,"My wife and I got new neighbors a couple months ago and have woken up twice to hysterical sobbing, with someone repeatedly saying ""get the fuck away from me."" The first time this happened, I woke up disoriented and confused because I did not think anyone even lived in the apartment next to us, so I went and knocked on the door. The woman who answered casually played it off, saying her girlfriend was drunk and upset about losing her job. This didn't seem right to me, but I exchanged numbers with her and decided to keep an ear out in the future. 

Last night, I again overheard loud crying. I took notes on what I heard, and it went something like ""Stop. What are you doing? Get off of me! What's the point of this? Stop touching me. Why are you touching me! ow!” I heard a growl from their dog, followed by ""I don't know why it has to hurt... why are you like this... I don't know why you had to wake me up... you just had to grab my hair and I wasn't even doing anything wrong... I made you late? for what? There's no point to this. I don't understand. I was sleeping fine. You just woke me up and had to be a fucking asshole. Stop touching me."" I did hear thuds that could be objects being thrown, but it was faint and unclear.

I am very confident there is abuse going on, but there has never been violence that is clearly audible to the point that I am confident that calling the police is the right move yet. I'm also conflicted because I've heard that involving law enforcement can make things worse for the victim if their abuser takes it out on them. I know the victim just moved from out of state, has no friends here and no job, and considering they are a very young lesbian couple, there's also a possibility that they do not have family to turn to either. I do not think she has a clear way out and I would not want to make her living situation worse for her.

I have reached out to building management to let them know that I am concerned about my neighbors and also asked if it would be possible to get their contact info. I never see the victim in the hall without her partner and have no way of speaking to her one on one, but if I get her number I would like to let her know that we are a safe place that she can come if she ever needs to.

Am I doing the right thing by holding off on calling the cops for now? Any other advice?",06Feb2020,1

I explained to her that I was following her some time before me and my girlfriend met and I haven’t unfollowed a lot of people since we met and I completely forgot to.
I also said I don’t really use social media to browse my feed or homepage I only use it for texting friends who don’t have data or anything like that
We resolved that by her saying she’d forget about it and I replied that I don’t want her to forget I just wanted her to understand my point of view.
And then later that day I was with a few friends hanging out and still a little upset about what happened and then a friend of mine kept bothering me about the situation and I didn’t do anything I got up and left
Then fast forward to this morning we were talking and the guy who was bothering me about the situation kept bringing it back up and she asked a question and I had in my AirPods and I guess I replied in a rude manner and a few minutes later I apologized because I wasn’t sure then we separated to go different places.

I also don’t have a desire to have sex with her (despite my huge sex drive). Everything I do with her feels like a chore, or almost forced. It’s weird because I used to be so happy with her.

I smoke weed a lot, she is against weed. She does not like most of my music taste. We disagree on a lot of things politically. We have a lot of different views on things.

Also, I’m scared of dealing with people after.. “why did you break up?”.. things like that. We have a lot of the same friends so the girls will probably be mad at me

So I came across this sub reddit because I need some advice for a career path because of my college situation as it is pertinent to my career question. I was originally a Digital Design/Digital Media at my school. Long story short: This semester I was supposed continue on with my major, as taking my studio classes is the only way to go forward in my degree. Because of a financial situation, I wasn't able to pay my tuition in full from last semester. Despite having seniority, I wasn't able to get in to my studio class because of lack of room. ***I wasn't made aware of this problem until the day of by my Academic Advisor. This is typically the responsibility of the Academic Advisor or Major Administrator to reach out to students of seniority in case they are in that type of situation at my school.*** **My department offered a General Studies degree in place of the Digital Media degree. It's not a technical degree or even specific, I would graduate in Fall 2020. I would still be able to take classes pertinent for my original major, but then I would be taking General Education requirements that really aren't (they are required anyway to get a degree in Digital Media, but I think it's a waste of time).**

My main issue is whether or not I should go with the General studies degree, as I won't focusing on studying programs for my industry which I planned working in. **My main question is this: what should I do in relation to my career focus if I am not actively working with my programs for the majority of the time? Should I just drop out ?** I still have the option of taking technical classes (which I am doing now), but I am also taking other classes that aren't related to Digital Media.",06Feb2020,1

however, last year, someone had reported it to the police anonymously and I had to sit down with the police and my principals. I went into a really depressive state and the police were trying to force me to go to court, but I didn’t want to ruin his life or his dad’s. eventually, I asked my parents to call everything off and they did.

before the guy did it to me, though, he did the same thing to another girl. I’m still facing the aftermath and emotions of what happened, but now I deeply regret ever letting him get away it, mostly because I now recognize that he was manipulating me into apologizing for it and not reporting him.

I was having insanely bad day, like, I just just shattered that day because of other reasons, and during math class, I could not focus and I asking too many questions to the teacher which is unusual from me because I'm "" the nerd "" if that matters.


And she straight up bullied me, like I could not understand something and she would burst into laughter and say that I should ask me 3rd grader sister to help me ( I'm 9th grader ). 

I didn't really take it as bullying from her in that moment until it hit me later in the day, I had this rush of anger and I started being rough around her and yeah we fought that day.
It looked like a fight that would last a day or two until I cleared out ""buddy"" I had nicknamed her on messaging app. She sent ""?"" And I never replied.

Next day I was really cold to her, she tried to joke around and I made a disappointed face and turned around. Same with the next day.

And then I just started missing her, like I see her everyday and the fact that I can't talk to her kills me....

However, since the past few weeks she's been talking t my grandma (her mom) about how she does not know what is she going to do after I've gone as she's been a housewife for a very long time and cant get a job to sustain herself. It has been bugging me so much lately as I feel like a bad daughter wanting to leave her mother alone. But if I stay, i know, i JUST KNOW that my dad will create some sort of drama and make our lives a living hell.

726,"Title.

I’m not really having a good time. My stomach doesn’t work correctly, I’m an anxious paranoid mess and my brain is malformed. 

When it comes to my life, I’m in college when I’d rather be a shut in and working a shitty full time job that I hate. 

Honestly if it wasn’t for my girlfriend, I’d drop out of school and move all my stuff into my parents basement and just never leave. 

I generally can keep myself from seeming outwardly disengaged from my life but some days I think it’s pretty clear that I’m sick of it all. 

I’m doing everything I really can for my health but it honestly makes me even worse, I get no satisfaction out of exercise, maybe I will some day.",06Feb2020,1
727,"So my parents relationship isn't really that great. They fight all the time and i swear to god it's making ME go crazy. Im sick of it. So my dad started all this thing that mom is cheating on him and he isn't really sure about it. I dont own my own computer, i use my moms and so  it just happened i have an assignment to write and i accidentally opened moms FB account. Normally i would just log out and get on with my bussines, but this time i checked into her messages just a bit. What a coincidence they just had a fight before i started working on my assignment. She messaged her friend how she fucked up on hooking up with her client and how sorry she is for it. Honestly i dont blame her. I assume they didnt have sex in quite a while. From all the reddit posts i read it's pretty safe to say that having sexsual relationship isn't easy if you have three kids. I'd like to say that this isn't just my moms fault.

So this leads me to the question. Should i tell my dad his wife cheated on him? Money in our house was always a bit tight and if they divorce i assume it's just gonna get even worse. I dont want  both of my parents to go broke because of it. I dont wanna move out... i dont like changes. Honestly i'd like to say them to stop fighting, smoke a fat ass joint and go get fucking laid because they both need to get some. On the other hand, i dont see any good reason for them to stay together.   

&amp;#x200B;

What should I do?...I shouldn't go seeking trough my moms messages in the first place. Should i just forget what i saw and see what happens? Should i give them that J and a pack of condoms? I don't fucking know anymore...I'm just so confused at this point...

728,"I'm going to try and be as vague as I can here so as not to reveal too many specifics about my situation.

Basically, I purchased a ""widget"" from an online secondhand business (Business A) that had good reviews, large seller. A few hours after my purchase, I went back to review my purchase and noticed the widget was missing a key piece that led me to believe it had possibly been stolen. There was other identifying information on the widget from a screenshot I took, and so I googled that information. The widget was actually still listed for sale at another company (Business B).

Unsure of what to do, I phoned the Business B and told them I had just purchased the widget from Business A. They were previously unaware that the widget was even gone (stolen) from their inventory, as the thief had removed it from it's original packaging so nothing would look amiss in a stockroom.  Business B was very thankful and filed a theft report. This was a valuable widget worth several thousands of dollars and I am a person with a huge conscience, so I decided to send the item back for a refund and let Business A know why I was returning the item. Please be nice to me, there was no way I would have kept an item \*knowing\* that it had been stolen.  I wouldn't have felt right about it. That was never the issue.

When I let Business B know what I was doing, they were extremely thankful. They planned to work with Business A and the local police to recover their item. Business B mentioned that they would ""do something really nice"" for me in gratitude, and even offered to pay return shipping for me if Business A didn't offer free returns.

I sent Business B photos of the item when I received it (by the time I noticed anything amiss, Business A had already sent the item to the shipper so I had to wait to receive it and send it back). That way, I figured there was proof that I had indeed received their item. I repackaged it, filed the return, and shipped it back to Business A. I emailed the contact I had been working with at Business B to let them know when I had shipped it, sent FedEx tracking numbers, photos of the item and also ate the cost of the shipping which was almost $30.

Since the initial phone call with the contact at Business B, I have received zero communication from Business B. They do have my contact information. There were no replies to my emails regarding FedEx, no offers of paying return shipping, nothing. When I called them I was informed my contact was ""out"" of the office. The contact has made zero attempts to connect with me since the day I purchased the widget.

I'm salty about this because technically I paid for the item and wasn't under any obligation to return it to its rightful owner. It would be nice to be thanked. Or to have my return shipping covered. I imagine they don't have to do this, but it just seems like good customer service.

Would you try to contact Business B again, or a higher up manager to let them know this is what happened? 

TLDR: Did a good deed, recovered a stolen item worth thousands, out shipping costs of $30.

I was being treated for ptsd and depression, but I blew off all of my treatment and stopped taking my medication. Now i medicate with weed and am definitely addicted. In the past year i gained ~40lbs; I’m overweight and have a terrible relationship with food. I oversleep and the only reason i wake up is for my dog. I’m pretty antisocial and i don’t feel like I deserve friends, so I feel really alone even when people try to be there for me.

She admitted to me a while back that she was a bully in high school. I was bullied in high school. So my level of trust and respect for her has always been a tenuous thing at best; I kind of feel that anything that I tell her she would use against me in the long run. And she’s quite full of herself. She own/runs a recruiting company in a big city and thinks quite highly of herself (even though she tries really hard to be “grounded and humble”).

She also randomly started to come up with lame ass excuses and not exchange holiday gifts like we have for years. So basically we see each other once a year and she decides to a get rid of a long-term tradition and be cute and harass me jokingly about my DOB

I look younger than my age, so I can understand why people assume stuff. But it’s not like I’m 50 and pretending to be 30. I just feel like she’s being an asshole and trying to be cute.

735,"A little backstory: my parents bought a computer for the younger siblings in the playroom. Recently it broke, something to do with the hard drive. I heard that usually if it has to do something with the hard drive, it is usually a lot easier to buy a new one unless you have really important stuff. However my parents havent had the chance to buy a new one as my mother and I have an event to go to on Sunday.
 
I have an upcoming exam(paid 80 euro for it) for a level 5 and I have over 250 pgs of notes to memorize  for the 2hrs exam. Since the kids had nothing to watch and they had some of their favourite programs going on at the time, I recently attached my laptop to the monitor using an HDMI cable and let them watch. 30 min ago, I took my laptop away from the kids( I let them use it all day, it is 7pm where I live) and went upstairs to study. My mother texts me a while later telling me to go downstairs and attach my laptop to the monitor for the kids. She said that I could study later. I said that I  couldn't as I was studying and the exam was 2hrs long. The kids will survive till their bedtime 9:30. My mother replied with' it's great that I do stuff for you but you dont do anything I return.' (Context, she bought me a dress for the event)
I have read the message from the notifications but I havent opened it. I dont feel guilty about the whole situation but Im kind of hurt by the fact that she didnt even acknowledge that I let the kids use my laptop because it was s a kind thing to do.

But me and this chick don't do drugs together we were actual friends for no reason other then we just enjoyed each other's personalities and company.

Theres never been any type of sexual tension shes just a really good friend.

743,"Professional Advice - Project Engineer (31M)

TLDR; currently looking for ways to turn my experience and workplace knowledge into a more fulfilling career. Possible transition ideas welcomed. 

The story:
Currently a PE for a major construction firm in AZ. I consistently work on ~$10M new construction contracts. I have no formal college education, I began working doing commercial TI’s during the recession, I used some connections to start in a project assistant for a subcontractor in 2015, then became an estimator/PM assistant for said subcontractor within months after higher date. In 2017 I parlayed the combination of field experience and estimator/PM asst. into my current PE position. 

I’m currently not fulfilled at my workplace. Possibly due to the aging culture that’s in the office(average office age is ~50) or the fact that building these projects aren’t necessarily fun or interesting. 

Given all of this, I’m looking for possible career change ideas so I don’t necessarily start from scratch. I’ve considered looking into remodeling existing buildings (preferably historic) since part of what I like doing is problem solving combined with the fact that I’m not the biggest fan of destroying new landscape for these “boring” buildings. I currently don’t know of any contractors in the Area, and our buildings aren’t necessarily “romantic” to grab my attention. (I know this could seem very millennial of me). I’ve also considering leaving it all, grabbing a pilots license and just try something new.

I don't know what's wrong with me(26f).. Or my husband(36m).

We both admitted today, in 2 separate ways and different times that we are like.... Living in a dream. We both feel like we are mentally not all there most of the time. Like we are in a bad fog. But that it's so constant and has been so long that we're not sure if we're just over exaggerating... 

But, how i explained it to him was... ""it's like I have a short moment of clarity where I'm like 'this is more normal, I'm seeing life for what it is, I'm experiencing my children for real. Hearing them and not just going through the motions."" 

I obviously always hear them... I respond. I smile, I laugh, I question. 
But sometimes, when I'm having a rare moment of clarity, I hear them like how I heard my first born constantly, in wonder. 

I know I'm sleep deprived, I know depression through and through, and I even know that this season of winter blues has been extremely difficult for me and my husband.. 

But I still feel like it's something else. 

All in all we are doing okay... But honestly, I'm posting this because it's starting to frighten me. 

My husband told me today... ""I'm having a hard time driving lately... Like. I'll make a wrong turn or miss the exit."" (my husband isn't very sleep deprived for the most part) he told me this while trying to explain that he doesn't feel normal.

I was/am still o' medication but i'm currently cutting off. I also have met a wonderfull friendgroup Who really are all really suportive. For the first time in my life i have friends and i'm becoming better and more confident.
Now back to the situation with the girl. I felt line she needed me because she always contacted me and asked for my advice on things. She told me i have a really positive vibe and she likes being aeound me. She's going to some shit and i'm always there for her. Needless to say i began to fall in love with her and so did she (at least i thought so...) we studied together, laughed together, are always in each others comoany.

She kinda friendzoned me, I say kinda because she Said i shouldnt feel permanently rejected and that' it's possible that she's just blocking het feelings. She also Said nothing would change and we still would call and talk all the time because I meant alot to her. This worked for a week untill she started to distance herself from me... Fast forward to this week. At school everything was fine but after school she just ignored me. Until today. I told her i wanted to take some time for myself till my feelings would go away because I have the feeling i put too much pressure on myseld. , she responded that she wants permanent minimal contact with me, and the world doesn't revolve around me (don't know where that came from) ...  It suddenky feels like a one sided friendship... She told me she only wants to talk to me when she feels like it. And that she'll probably not talk to me for weeks (litterally her words). And that the time we called and talked everyday was just her being politie...  She also told me that i have to work harder on this friendship but that it doesn't mean that she has to do the same... We also havent talked about the Date anymore. Keep in mind i'm also the only person she talks to at school. She's always zitting with me, laughing at my jokes, constantly touching my arm and shoulders. People think we were a couple.

So, a bit of back-story: I've been hurt quite a bit in my life. My first relationship involved a fair amount of gaslighting (although I don't think he did it on purpose), ending after five years in complete desaster and leaving me devestated.
Since then everytime I put myself out there and dated, it always ended with me getting hurt, always ending badly.
I don't know if I just have bad luck in picking partners, or if there is another problem.
Recently I met a guy, and I didn't have feeling for him, but I trusted him - and we decided to go our separate ways after a short but intense acquaintance.

762,"Hello everyone! 
I‘m new here, so please bare with me! 
Some background-When I was 13 I met this guy on omegle (I know- hi loneliness and no self worth) and we „dated“ long distance (me Europe- him North America) for the following 4 years. It was honestly a dumpsterfire of a relationshit, he was emotionally and verbally abusive, unemployed, cheated, drank almost daily and did every drug under the sun, I certainly didn’t know what a healthy relationship was and may have reacted/said things to worsen already bad situations. After 4 years on and off I set an ultimatum for him to visit to see if we had a future together or not, because I have had enough of wasting my time (My thought process was that I had already invested so much time, I had to see if being together IRL would make everything better). So he came to stay with me for a month and as you can imagine, the relationshit didn’t magically turn into a picture perfect lovely partnership. Some while after he returned to his home country we got into yet another argument in which he called me every name in the book and I’ve had enough, I broke up with him once and for all and didn’t take him back. 
That’s when it all started. He freaked out, threatened me and when I finally stopped trying to talk him out of doing something bad and blocked him, he would just make a new facebook or email address. He sent derogatory messages and nudes to what must’ve been hundreds of people, posted my full name and hometown on 4chan alongside the nudes, posted on my employers facebook and review website ect. 
I filed police report after police report, involved a lawyer, all in hope to finally just make him stop. I haven’t heard from him for about two years, eventhough I would  periodically google my name terrified of finding if he had posted again. 
A couple of weeks ago he messaged me on a craigslist add I had posted (only had my nickname and hometown), he found my current job which also only showed my first name (granted it‘s a very uncommon one), now he‘s been calling and emailing my boss. 
I‘m so done with this, it‘s been almost 6 years since I broke things off, no contact for 6 years, I‘m turning 24 this year and just want to live my life not having to worry about some psychotic deadbeat. I don’t know if he thinks no one has ever seen a naked girl before? Literally no one cares, does he not have anything better to do than badmouth some girl from another continent?
I just want to be left alone. 
Do you guys have any advice on what I could do? I‘m filing another police report tomorrow and I think my boss is going to do so as well. 
Should I move? Sue him some more? Change my name? 
I‘m not in a good place right now, would really appreciate any and all advice.

She has never sold a property before and desperately needs help going through our junk, repairing, and going through my Grandmothers things, who passed away a few months ago.

Obviously I am more than willing to help my mom, but I’m not sure its wise to quit my job now. It is my first job and I’ve heard the longer you have it, the better you look for your next employer. I am not dependent on the cash, I mainly just got this job to pay for a trip and accumulate some savings. I plan on getting another job this summer when we move, so wouldn’t it be better to quit my job in the later months like April or May? Or am I overthinking this and its okay to quit now?",06Feb2020,1
764,"I have a huge crush on my coworker, but she’s already in a relationship with a guy. She knows I’m into her (we’ve had conversations on the subject), and we’re still friends, but she makes it clear that she doesn’t want to cheat on her bf, which I’m cool with. 

I’m not shy about reminding her that I’m into her, but I’m wondering if a Valentines day gift would be too much. Any advice?",06Feb2020,1
765,"I’m 13, and I am tempted  to try weed. Now, I know how it’s unsafe to smoke it when under 25, and that of course, it’s illegal(In my state) I’m not doing it for clout or any of that shit, I’m just curious to try it.",06Feb2020,1
766,"So there’s this girl, we’re both in tenth grade and she’s a really cool person, we’re very similar in a lot of ways but the problem is that I don’t get to talk to her all that much, we only have math together and over the past couple of years I’ve only had like two classes with her. I don’t have a crush on her or anything like that, I just want to be better friends with her but I don’t want to walk up to her randomly and say “Hey let’s be better friends!” That seems kinda weird to me. So I’m just asking, is there anything that I could do to be closer with her?",06Feb2020,1
767,"We were all sitting at the same table at a company function and I told my friend's office mate that he had taken a sick day off before but then he was on social media on vacation. My friend tried to play if off and I kept on going like ""okay"". And then I told him that we had all done something similar at our old job and it was okay. Like how incredibly stupid of me. Anyway, he later tells me his boss was sitting at the same table!!

I feel so incredibly stupid. I don't know WHY I mentioned that. Like how would that help anyone???

Everyone at the table was talking to each other and I just pray she wasn't listening. I've definitely learned from this but unfortunately I can't go back and change it. How can I make it up to my friend? I really honestly don't want this to impact his job because I was so incredibly STUPID to the entire situation.

I shouldn't have mentioned it at all because even if his boss wasn't sitting there, we're at a COMPANY FUNCTION. 

My friend is honestly so dedicated to his job and work and I know he just doesn't take sick days off for work. Especially because this job now is way more important than the last one (we were both at the same company before as well).

I promise I am not that socially inept but idk what happened today. I feel so horrible and I don't want this to impact his job review. How can I make this up?",06Feb2020,1
768,"Sorry if this is long rambling and frustrating I kind of need to get my thoughts out and would appreciate an outside perspective. 

I'm 25 and primarily live with my mom in a small town and also occasionally stay for extended periods of time with my boyfriend (29) who also lives with his parents in a city an hour away from my house. I was in college for 5 years (due to being a transfer student) studying graphic design and my dad died suddenly. After that my grades tanked and I was failing classes over and over and I couldn't secure an required internship to graduate because I couldn't drive and didn't have transportation. Eventually it got to the point where schoolwork piled up and I couldn't leave the house, and I withdrew from college. I thought maybe it would be a good opportunity to learn to drive and see a therapist again but it never really happened. My mom got laid off and her new job has shoddy insurance so I can't see any local doctors or specialists without going through my primary care physician who is located an hour and a half away and I have so much social anxiety and executive dysfunction I can't bring myself to set up an appointment or call to see what my options are. On top of that my mom is dating a new guy who I like but takes up all her time and money going to events and restaurants every night, and she's had to take up a second job to support her lifestyle so she has even less time to help me or teach me to drive. We don't have the kind of relationship where I could ask her and she gets upset when I need to see a doctor and tells me I can set up my own appointments even though I need to be able to schedule them when she's free to take me so I haven't seen anybody for my issues since I withdrew 3 years ago.

After withdrawing I didn't do anything for a few months until I managed to find a job stocking and unloading the truck at a local store and I liked it a lot and was considered the best stocker but I only got 4-8 hours a week. I picked up another job that paid less but scheduled me way more often, but it was a clusterfuck of poor management and I actually had to deal with customers which made my mental health tank even more. They pressured me to quit my first job I liked so I could work there every day and I tried doing that, but had a huge panic attack at work and quit on the spot because I couldn't take it anymore. I've been living off my savings since then which are dwindling but I'm too scared to try to apply to any other jobs. Just reading a basic retail description sounds so overwhelming now and my mental health is so much worse. I can't think of one thing I'd be up to taking on. I even suck at the thing I studied for years because of the horrible liberal arts college I had to attend for the scholarships where I wasn't taught any of the relevant skills as part of my degree program and I feel like my skillset is stuck in 2005. I probably can't afford a therapist but I remember reading on a personal finance subreddit that if you're in such a bad way you can't generate income, you can't afford NOT to see a therapist.

When I'm at home I stay in bed all day and sometimes if I'm lucky manage to walk to a convenience store minutes away for a snack. I hardly eat or get good sleep but just spend upwards of 10 hours a day on my phone or my laptop. I try to put it away to pick up a hobby or try to clean up but I physically can't pull myself away until I finally cry myself to sleep. 

Living with my boyfriend isn't really better. They're really wealthy and while they're nice people, I'm almost afraid of interacting with them and I mostly spend all day hiding in his room. I'm afraid to even leave to get myself some water or a snack. I've been losing a lot of weight as a result. I feel like the dude secretly living in the basement in Parasite. We planned to move out together sometime this year to a city with public transportation but with no income or references I doubt any place will accept us. He's currently studying for a certification so he's gone most of the day.

I'm planning to commit suicide this year because between being too depressed to improve my life, not having transportation to see a therapist, I don't know what can be done. I'm trapped and wasting the best years of my life away. Even if I were to get better, I don't see anything about this horrible world worth living in. People are cruel, power hungry, and evil. They don't care if people starve or die or the whole world is destroyed by disaster or war so long as they continue generating wealth and fuck off to mars. And I would rather the people close to me look back on me fondly as a tragic figure rather than as a 30+ year old deadbeat who is just a drain on their finances and never contributing anything of worth to the world. Being the way I am is humiliating. I know it would destroy my boyfriend but every moment I'm alive is so painful I can't bear it anymore. Everything is stuck and I can't identify the one piece I need to move in order to fix the ten car pile up that is my life.",06Feb2020,1
770,"Hi, I am 19f, and I have been having a mental battle of whether or not to pursue college. 
I got my GED right out of 9th grade due to a shitty home situation and I needed to emancipate myself, so I have been put of school for way too long to have any academic incline in this situation. 

I have been working mindless jobs honestly just to survive, and am in a position where it is easy to fail. I do not have support from family, I do not have much money, I do not have credit, I barely have a place to stay.  The odds are stacked against me.

I am fortunate enough to have a therapist who sees me for free, and she is the only person I have in my life who is pushing for me to do more. (She sees me for free since she has known me since about 15. It was legally required back then, but now she understands my situation and wants me to succeed and offers two free sessions a month.)

I have lived in the same town my entire life, and feel kind of trapped. I know I am never going to be happy or satisfied if I keep going like this.

I am afraid of college because of how long I've been out of school. I missed so much of simple math, history, etc. and I am scared of failing out of college. 

If I went to college, I would probably want to pursue a master's in psychology. It fascinates me and I would love to make a difference in somebody else's life. 

What are your opinions about college? Do you think college is the only way to truly get out of this? 

Thank you for reading!",06Feb2020,1
771,"Warning! Long story! Tldr and question at the bottom.

About a year ago, I joined a video game community on an app so that I could better my knowledge of a fictional language. Through an rp (roleplay) chat I joined, I met someone that I really clicked with. I'll call her Ajil for anonymity sake. 

Ajil is an amazing writer and we bonded immediately over a similar love of putting our characters through a lot of torment in the rp. Over time, we became really good friends. And then things started getting weird. 

We both have big problems with depression and anxiety, though I usually don't like admitting that. But over time she started beginning each day by being as negative as she possibly can, and ending each day the same way. I tried to stay the happy one, the one she could rely on, but it seemed like no matter what I did, I could never keep her happy. She would say super negative things that had me really worried about her. I stopped being able to talk to her about anything and started having to cater to her moods and try to keep her happy to absolutely no avail. 

At this point, I was wearing myself a bit thin. I was trying to keep up the only thing that made her happy at all times, the rp. But if I left for even a few hours for work, she would complain and I would feel really guilty. And one day, I put my foot down. I was staying up until 2 or 3 in the morning just to rp with her, and it was actually leaving me exhausted. So I told her that I couldn't do it anymore and that I needed to get sleep and that from then on, I would be going to bed at 10 instead. And she was not happy. 

She started immediately ranting about how I'm the only thing that makes her happy, how the rp keeps her going and she has insomnia so she needs something to do at night, and how it isn't fair that she won't have me after 8 o'clock her time (She's in a different time zone than I am.)

I tried to reason with her but eventually lost my temper and ranted at her about how I couldn't talk to her for real anymore cuz I'm always trying to be the happy one, the smiling one. Bit she fired right back and said that she didn't want me to be, that she just wanted to be miserable with someone. She said she didn't need comfort,she just needed someone with her. And boy, I felt really sheepish. I apologized and we talked for a while more. At this point it was like almost 4 a.m. and we were both tired, so it was slightly inevitable that one of us said something wierd. Which she did. She said she had a crush on me. 

Now, I'm Ace. I don't really feel sexual or romantic attraction towards anyone. I mean, I've tried. I used to think I was broken or something. But I just don't. So that took me aback quite a bit. I told her we needed to talk about that when we both were more lucid, but we never did. I'm terrible at confrontation and when she begged me to leave it be and forget it, I obliged.

For a while, everything was good. We were talking and everything was fine. But then she got mad at me for trying to cheer her up. And the, she got mad at me for not cheering her up. And she kept getting mad at me every time I had to go do things. It got so bad that I started lying about my hours at work so she'd think I was at work for longer than I actually was just so that I could get some time to myself without constantly having to be glued to my phone just to respond to her messages in the rp. And anytime I wouldn't message within a few minutes of her messaging back, she would get mad and guilt trip me. It culminated recently to a point that I'm super frustrated. 

I was absent for 2 weeks due to unavoidable irl issues. When I got back, I begged for some time to readjust and got it. But only 3 days after that, she asked me if I was ever going to come back to the rp.

Also, I'm usually online for 2 to 3 hours every day. During that time, I have a lot to do. I'm in two communities, and I'm fairly well known and oddly liked in one, and I'm starting to make a name for myself in the other. So I have to split my attention between all of the chats, posts, projects, and my personal writing during that time. And she knows that! But just yesterday, while I was helping someone with a thing in another chat, she got mad again. I apologized and said that I was just trying to help a friend of ours with something, and she sent this back:

Ajil: It's whatever.
Ajil: I'm just going to go cry.
Ajil: Just like I have been for the past 15 minutes because I feel like I'm not good enough to be paid attention to.
Ajil: I spend most of my day counting down how long until I get to talk to you and then sh** like this happens and you send maybe a half an hour in total talking with me at all and it just makes me miserable.

And yes, that is copy pasted, so it's word for word. Except where I censored a curse word. 

I'm just so tired. I'm exhausted of trying to tiptoe around and constantly keep up with the rp while I have a lot more things I'm doing. I want to focus on my languages and my writing but I can't anymore, and I'm afraid to tell her that because she'll either get mad again or rant about how I never spend time with her anymore and this will decrease our time together even more. I'm just so exhausted and exasperated. And I'm not good at confrontation at all. 

Tldr: i really care about my best friend but I also really care about the languages I want to learn. She'll get mad if I spend less time on her but I'm just so tired of trying to keep up with the rp all the time.

I guess my question is threefold.
1) Am I a jerk for feeling frustrated with her when she's having a really bad time irl and she says that our rp is the only thing making her happy?
2) What should I do or say to resolve this? Should I just keep quiet and keep going as usual?
3) One of my other friends called this an abusive relationship but I'm not sure it is. Would y'all classify it as such? I feel like such a jerk cuz she needs me.",06Feb2020,1
772,"Throwaway account. So my father in law seems to struggle with basic concepts. He needs help with literally everything. And by that I don't mean he doesn't know how to use a computer. He never knows how much money is in his bank. He struggles to read very simple words. My wife and I recently had to help him find an apartment because he was living in a house without a lease and paying the landlord in cash, and the basic things he doesn't know how to do are astounding. Literally if I was on his mental level I would have died and starved years ago. My wife says that he isn't all there, but refuses to do anything. I know how this works because my cousin is mentally challenged and has a social worker to help him with basic tasks such as money and bills. I'm very worried because recently he started selling plasma to pay for the rent at his new apartment. (his previous rent was 400 a month now it's 600) I don't know how this is happening because he has a very good union welding job that easily makes 75k plus.

775,"I'm probably going to get downvoted to hell for this, but fuck it.

I hate men. 

I'm a woman, I've suffered with social anxiety my whole life due to an abusive father. I also tend to browse anti-men subs like gendercritical because they're the only social interaction I get and the women-centeredness(?) Of it all makes me feel safe. 

I don't want to hate them, but I've had a lot of run ins with incel types and MGTOW people who tend to brigade those types of subs. Reddit as a whole seems to be very anti-women to me (there's usually at least one anti-woman or anti-feminist post in popular somewhere) so I tend to stick to the subs I know. Men on videogame subreddit also tend to be really sexist which are the only other subs I browse. 

I'm fucking tired of it, I don't want to be like this and I don't want to hate men but I just can't help it. There seems to be no other subs to remedy this, either? All subs are just X vs Y whether that's the goal or not. 

There are subs like nice guys are neckbeard things that shit on men, then there are subs like nice girls and leg beard things that shit on women, but there aren't any subs to boost these kinds of people, or improve your view on them.

776,"I just posted on r/relationshipadvice but I could use all the advice I can get. 

I'll apologise first of all if this becomes a bit of a vent, I'm sorry if it's long. I just feel I need to type everything out so I can stop bottling it up. 

I'm not sure what's going wrong really, there just seems to be a lot of tension in the household. There is my Mum (53), my fiancee (23) and me (22).

I know at 22 most people don't live with their parents, but that isn't the situation with us. When I was 6 my Dad died, and we inherited his debts, which meant my Mum had to spend his life insurance to clear us of debt. We also had to sell our house, so since then we have been renting which isn't cheap. My Mum doesn't earn much as a carer and she can't afford the rent/bills/food herself which is where I come in. Since I was 18 she took my paychecks and kept them (I honestly didn't mind because if I needed something then she would pay for it). It worked for awhile but the past few years we have really been struggling financially, and it is stressing us all out. We don't have a life, we aren't living, we are merely surviving. I've mentioned about me moving out before but I can't - she can't afford to live alone and I can't just leave her stranded by herself. For the most part I don't mind living with her, but I feel like sometimes I get the brunt of it. When she is at work or meets occasionally a friend or such, she is always so cheerful and happy, yet when we are home she is mostly grumpy, rude and demanding. It's exhausting. 

For the past year I've been ill, I had to quit my job and stay at home because I'm physically weak and exhausted. Not that it matters anyway, I don't have any friends or such, so nobody has noticed or missed me. I can't help but feel I should have more of a life at 22 than what I'm actually stuck with. I hope when I get better I can get back out there and get a job but right now it isn't an option so I'm just stuck at home.

I've been with my partner over 2 years, he pretty much lives with us now. Our relationship is great most of the time, we rarely ever argue (except recently). He helps out towards bills because he eats a lot and obviously lives with us and uses utilities. However we still don't seem to be bringing in enough money to cover all the bills and rent. He also is really bad at remembering things, if I ask him to help me do a chore or to do one then he forgets and it takes four days to get it done. He always forgets he has the oven on so sometimes it's on full heat for an hour before we notice, or he leaves the windows/doors unlocked at night. I always have to walk around at the back of him to make sure he switches things off and such because I'm worried one day the house will burn down.

The jobs in the house are mounting up. I'll be the first to admit that although I try, I probably could do more. I try and do the dishes, bins, recycling, tidying, cleaning up. I get the dog out for his walk and I look after the other little pets. I keep the house from burning down, get the mail, put the shopping away. I feel like I really do try but my Mum keeps telling me I don't do enough and I'm lazy. In her mind, as she works that means she shouldn't have to do dishes or housework. I just feel I could use some help, I feel like I'm drowning. My partner works part time (2 days a week) but he really is awful at remembering to do things, but if I keep reminding him he eventually will do it. Although I'm the bad guy because I'm then hounding him and I'm on his back all the time. 

I've been back in therapy recently. I hate talking about it but I've been struggling recently because a few years ago I was sexually assaulted. I've also suffered from depression and anxiety since I was a child. It really is all getting on top of me and I'm struggling to cope. I feel like I'm getting worse and worse with each day. I see my therapist every two weeks because I can't afford to see her more, I struggle to even pay for the two sessions a month I have already. 

Tonight it kicked off because the dishes haven't been done. I haven't been able to do them because I got a wrist tattoo (a free one from a tattooist friend) and I'm not allowed to do dishes for two weeks incase of infection. Or that's what I was told anyway, I think I might just do them tomorrow anyway. My partner doesn't want to do them because he is busy working on his computer on something (not job related). My Mum doesn't feel she should do them because she was working yesterday and tomorrow. I think they both want me to do it because I was called out for being lazy again. 

I'm just at the end of my rope, I don't know what to do. If anyone has any advice please feel free to give it. I'm sorry this was so long.",06Feb2020,1
777,"Hi everybody,

I (20f) completed my first two years of college at a community college and then transferred to a university. Coming in as a transfer student was incredibly difficult, and I still commute and am making tons of sacrifices in order to have financial stability and for my family too since they need help from me. 

I made two really good friends. We’re all indian. This is important because of our culture and it explains why they are the way they are. I was the only one born and raised here, they’re both international students. I find myself being the butt of their jokes and all, and them just being overall inappropriate w/ me at times. It’s definitely just a cultural thing because they love me a lot, but i don’t know how to explain to them that they are in the states and there are different cultural norms. They both know my boyfriend and get along with him so it’s not that they like me or anything. 

I want to draw boundaries. I’m getting really stressed and fed up at this point in life and they’re just immature. I feel like I’m their mom sometimes and they don’t know what it means to be genuinely supportive. In fact, most of what they say in attempt to be nice is extremely backhanded.

782,"I suppose this needs a little explaining. First of all, when I was a child I didn't get much from my parents. They weren't abusive to me really, just never really felt like either of them were there and I didn't have both of them at a time (id live with one for a couple years or so then switch).

Now, my relationship history isn't very good at all:

I've had two serious girlfriends.

To me, it's felt like they didn't love me the same, or that they wouldn't do what I'd do for them. I think my problems here, and the problem I've had with lying  I've never physically harmed anyone in my entire life, never gotten in a fight. I've lied about it when I was younger because I didn't want people to think I was weak, but I've never abused anyone I've been with. What I think I have been is emotionally abusive and I don't mean to be. I'm obsessive to the point where my old girlfriend, when I was 16, wound up getting a restraining order. When I saw the case she described what seemed to be sexual assault as one of her reasons. I was completely shocked. I would never rape anybody, but I think she either felt like she practically had to do it because I was so crazy, or something to do with her parents finding out. Either way, I just decided to let her have the restraining order because I didn't want to be around her snyways. Now I'm older and I know i left a scar in her memory.

Sometimes I feel confused because I don't say horrible things in anger, and I do show love and there are good things. But I think it's just the fact that when they want to leave, I just get crazy obsessive.

 Now. I'm afraid everything is gonna crumble. My recent ex, I obsessed over her too when she left, said she doesn't want to see me ever again. She got accepted into the university I wanted to transfer into and told me if I go there she's gonna go for a restraining order too. I really want to go there, but I know I made it so she just couldn't stand to be around me. With her, in the relationship, I lied. She cheated on me first, but then I became a scumbag. I cheated a couple times, lied a lot. She told me the truth about hers and I lied.

I'm at the point where i know this isn't gonna work out. I probably won't be able to go to the school I wanted to go to. I mean, I don't bother her anymore, I don't know if she could win a restraining order since I don't think I impose an immediate threat, but I don't wanna make her have to be at the same school as me if she doesn't feel she can.

I don't know what to do. My life's gonna go downhill because of what I've been. My recent ex has only been saying these things recently. I don't know if there's a way I can change her mind so we can just be friends, or if I've really really fucked things up. 

What do I do?",06Feb2020,1
783,"Myself and my husband (HB) have been having issues with his mother. I don't like to use the word crazy but I have no other way to really describe it. Let's start at the beginning. 

My HB's parents divorced when he was young. His dad worked a lot to pay the bills while his mom was supposed to take care of him and the house. Well she left him practically floating in his own bodily excrements and didn't do any sort of household work. 

After they divorced she was in and out of HB's life. Calling at random times and making promises to see him but never did. After years of this, she went silent. Around the time HB graduated high school, he reached out to reconnect with her and make an attempt at a relationship with his mother. 

He moved out across the country to be with her while going to college for a year. During this year he suffered verbal abuse while sleeping on a couch in a hoarded livingroom, that she expected him to clean. He did at first, but she kept immediately making a mess of it. He helped with bills whenever she was short of cash as well.

HB ended up getting an Emotional Support Animal because of all this at the recommendation of his therapist, as a result of her treatment. He adopted a special needs cat with a seasonal seizure disorder as well as mental disability, knowing this loving cat needed him as much as HB needed the cat. Kitty had prescription pills, little white ones, to keep the seizures at bay. During winter with a lot of snow in the area, HB mother threatened to throw the pills into the snow with the cat. This was not the first threat to the cat but did end up being the last, as HB promptly moved to the college dorms with the cat to finish the year.

HB kept trying to maintain a relationship with his mother in hopes that the issue was just living with her. He also maintains contact with his younger half brother that still lives with her. 

I met my husband the summer he came back after that year in college and we were married the summer after that. Fast forward an additional two and a half years and we are at our wits end. Our two kids have (thankfully) never met HB mother as a result of living in very different parts of the country.

 My HB finally cut ties with his mother late last fall because she threw a fit about us not sending her money. (We barely make ends meet as I am unable to work.) Her fit as usual consisted of her making my HB feel like he was worthless for putting his family first. She verbally abused him and he finally said he was dine with it all, and told her he is an adult with his own life and responsibilities, and that they could talk when she stopped treating him this way.

As a result she got all upset and even started acting as if she did nothing wrong, despite this simply having been the final straw on the camel's back. She went around telling most of her side of his family how horribly he was treating her and that she ""Just wanted a relationship with her son and grandkids.""

She has been harassing him with calls. He blocked her on all media and blocked her number but she keeps calling on various different private numbers. She continues to act as if she didnt verbally abuse him while HB had been on the phone with her in front of me and our kids. She continues to leave voicemails consisting of versions of ""why are you doing this to me? Let me talk to my grandkids please. I love you."" To put it short. (These are minute long messages typically) 

She has not apologized, let alone ACKNOWLEDGED how she's treated my husband. He cut ties because its not good for our kids to be around that, especially our oldest who's biological father was abusive to me and then became an absent parent. He wants stability for our kids and our life and everytime something is going well for us, his mother acts like she's going to come visit or send us presents and then flakes saying she doesn't have the money and needs us to send some. (This may be partially our fault as the first time she asked for help, she needed to pay a heat bill and we scrounged up cash so his brother wouldn't be freezing.)

As of HB's mother's most recent messages, she is going to come down and visit on the 19th of this month. HB has clearly stated she is NOT to do so. She claims to be getting a ride with his grandmother so he then called her, explained the abuse and how he is not welcoming her until she straightens herself out, and requested his grandmother does NOT oblige HB's mom. Well his grandmother then yelled at him basically that she would do whatever she wants and that she ""will in fact be coming"" and threatened to force their way in if necessary. 

Now we are scared and are getting a restraining order on both of them, but being as its just a piece of paper and police in our area aren't exactly fast acting. We don't know what to do. She's less stable by the minute and we don't want our kids around that, and seeing or hearing her trying to break into our apartment would be horribly traumatizing. I thought maybe if I messaged her, as I've been staying out of it per HB's request, she would realize we are united in this decision and back off. But HB thinks that if I do, the situation will be made worse and that I'll then be open to the threats and verbal attacks, and he is worried my ptsd will be triggered. 

So now I come to you reddit hoping someone, anyone has an idea for what we can do? As I said we are getting restraining orders, but this situation is just two weeks away.",06Feb2020,1
784,"I need to have a talk tonight with my SO about something that has been really bothering me lately and bringing me down, but I am NOT good with confrontation. I'm going home in about an hour and a half and I want to bring it up to him. My heart is pounding right now at the thought and I really hate that. Communication is so important in a relationship and I'm shit at it. 

I need some advice on how to not chicken out and how to calm myself down so that I can have a rationale discussion with him. I'm currently sitting in my office basically rehearsing what I want to say. I also cry when I get frustrated which sucks because it makes it so much harder to articulate my thoughts. I really hope I don't cry. He's not going to be surprised when I bring it up because we've talked briefly about it before but I just really need to hash things out with him.

787,"My mother-in-law abandoned my husband when he was 4. His brother was 9. They had lived as transients, very poor- living in motels, vans, hostels, homeless. She would clean motel rooms in exchange for lodging. One day she gave up. Sent them to live with their dad they never knew. She sent letters and small gifts for a year or two, then stopped all contact. Letters returned undelivered.

Dad was a monster.

It’s been over 40 years and they still wonder what ever happened. Did she have a different life after this? Did she go to jail? Is she dead?

I hired an investigator and found out she’s living about 7 hours away from us, in a dirty motel. Looking at her history, it looks like she’s done nothing but float like a transient for the past 40 years. No criminal record, no other children. No cell phone.

I tried calling the motel. It’s listed as her employer and home address. I asked for her, and her room number, and the manager hung up on me. I tried calling back and he had turned on the fax machine. Clearly she doesn’t want to be found, and has told the guy to not let anyone through. 

I think what we really wanted to know was her side of the story. Where she has been. Why she initially left. But I don’t think we’ll ever get that. I don’t know what advice to even ask, so I’ll just ask, how do I help my husband have some closure?",06Feb2020,1

I don't feel rewarded after completing tests or difficult assignments because it was a requirement that everyone else did as well. I don't feel like I'm doing anything for myself. On the flip side, I feel extremely rewarded by extracurriculars because I chose to be there and I'm being proactive about myself there. I have something in my identity that not everyone else has. And whenever I'm confused in class I don't raise my hand because I cringe at the fact that I don't understand something I'm required to be a part of.

So to sum it up, I don't like learning because I'm being forced to. If everyone else in my school does the exact same thing as I do, then what's the point? What's so special about being able to do language, math, history, science etc when everyone else can?

796,"Preface: I dont want this to be a debate abt my identity, please if you're just gonna be mean or make jokes plz move along

For context, I am transgender and I run a NSFW instagram account where people have to request to follow me. In my posts it is obvious I am transgender as the way I refer to myself (i identify as male plz i dont want to make it about my identity I promise its relevent) yet I have not yet medically transitioned and it's obvious due to the nature of the photos posted. Now, last week I got a follow request from someone i went to college with, I wasnt sure what to do as this person wasnt exactly nice. He was never nasty directly to me but him and his friends would make jokes about how km transgender and about the way i would dress (i dress pretty whacky i grew up an arty kid) and something inside me (probably my anxiety disorder) told me that he didnt want to actually see me in that way, he only wanted to follow me because he was going to send them to all his friends. Which to me makes sense considering he didnt exactly like me in college. 
But a different part of me thinks that surely, if he was going to illegally spread around my nudes (not even naked just dressed up in sex gear really) then surely he would make some kind of attempt to conceal his identity by making a side account especially considering we know each other in real life. Every single time I upload to my normal instagram (where selfies go) he likes it within minutes of me posting no matter what i look like which makes me think he has post notifications on for my account but I could just be wrong, and this has gone on for around a year. He also seems to be inconsolably horny on other peoples posts too. Commenting flame or squirt emojis on celebrity photos where they dont have as many clothes on as they usually would so maybe hes just unashamed and doesnt mind people knowing? 

Either way I initially declined his request thinking that if theres a doubt there the answer is no, especially with such intimate photos. But tonight I posted a selfie on my regular account, he liked it withings SECONDS and requested to follow my NSFW account once again. Surely if he just wanted to make fun of it he would have let it go and would have tried to conceal his identity the second time over right?

I guess what I'm asking is, given the context of him as a person, shouldbi be accepting him as a follower. I dont have very many followers so I really need all the followers and likes on photos I can get so instagram can start pushing my account so if he wants to see the photos for his own purposes rather than to make fun of them or show them to other people then I really dont mind I just dont want someone to spread them around.

799,"Hi. I’m an 18 year old high school senior and I’m really struggling to even finish off my senior year due to my own mental health issues. Last year I was in a mental hospital for a bit and had to finish up the year doing online school. Now I’ve missed a lot of days of my senior year and have started to care less about my grades. So it is safe to say I have my own struggles that stress me out. However, my mother who is in her early 50’s also struggles very badly with mental health issues. My mother is my rock and the only constant I have had throughout my life. I know for a fact I can not survive without her. However, she is very suicidal and depressed and I don’t know how to help her. I can’t help but be worried about her and that puts a damper on my own personal life as well, making things such as school even harder. She doesn’t yell at me for missing days because she’s also too depressed to get out of bed sometimes. Don’t get me wrong, she’s an amazing mom - just not perfect, as nobody can expect her to be. She is so down on herself and gets angry with herself for everything. As if that stress wasn’t enough, she has to move to a different state soon for personal reasons. I’ll be graduating this year and don’t want to leave the only town I’ve ever known, at least not at this point in my life, so I won’t be able to go with her. I know this also causes us both a great deal of stress and at this point we’re both kind of on the verge of giving up and I don’t really know what to do about it. Sorry if this isn’t in the right subreddit, I just looked up advice because it’s the first thing that came to my mind and I am rather desperate. Thank you for taking the time to read, and I am open to any and all suggestions. (We are both on medication for mental issues and she goes to therapy when she can.

On one hand, hes my bestfriend. I've known him for 7 years and will continue to be his best friend until death. On the other hand, me and this girl really enjoy each others company and shes just a cool person to talk to.

She has always had an over-the-top excitement about things I'm involved in. Video camera in my face, not listening when I ask her to stop. I actually stopped doing a certain creative pursuit when I was younger because she was so enthusiastic and excited about it, always there, always grinning, always shrieking, always filming, that it sucked the joy out of it for me.

I know, many people would say I shouldn't complain about being loved by a proud parent. I get that. But there is another extreme, and it's damaging in its own way. She even treats my friends this way, and my wife, to their annoyance.

I recently had a good thing happen to me, and since it happened, she's been going full-on with all the annoying behavior, all at once, twice as much as she ever had in my childhood.

810,"Hey! I’m a freshman in college this year going to a school far away from home.

College has been a pretty miserable time. I’m extremely sad all the time. I’m not homesick- it’s much deeper than that. I can’t eat anything, I get nervous talking to anyone,  I’m getting terrible grades, I’m not doing simple things like showering or brushing my teeth. All I want to do is lay in bed. I got a 1.8 GPA last semester and am on academic probation. I’ve made a couple friends but our relationships feel very surface level.

This is not who I am at all. In highschool, I had a 4.4 GPA, got a 36 on the ACT, and ended up at this school on a full ride. I was captain of the cross country team and had tons of friends. I suppose I felt sad sometimes but I had such strong support system it never effected me.

During winter break, my Dad, who works overseas, had a schizophrenic break. This was not the first time, but this was the first time I was very involved in the situation. It was very traumatic for me to see him when he came back. While my mom and I were trying to track him down overseas, we had to go through his computer, bank records, and medical history and it came out that he probably has woman that he sees overseas and a family that he supports financially (he is very smart and has a high paying job over there). He is a long time alcoholic very good at denial, and refuses to admit anything went wrong or apologize for the month mom and I spent pausing our lives to try and find him. Against our wishes, he returned working overseas this week. I stopped talking to him around 3 weeks ago.

This whole situation has made me even more miserable than last semester. In addition, I’m concerned for the possibility that I could inherit these mental issues from my father. I know I need to see a doctor. I am extremely sick of feeling like this. And I know that winter break was traumatic and I just need someone to talk to. I just have no idea where to start. This is where I need advice. I am not close to my mom or have any other adult figures in my life, so I would really appreciate the help.

How do I find a doctor? And what type do I need to see? A psychiatrist? Therapist? I don’t have any idea where to start. I go to school in Chicago, so every time I try and look thousands pop up. It’s very overwhelming.

How expensive is it? I have my own insurance, but honestly don’t really know how it works. I’ve never had health problems in my life. Does insurance pay for the whole thing? Will there be out of pocket costs? Do I know that beforehand? I am financially independent from my parents, are there like cheap doctors? I do not have a job. If they recommend medication do I have to find a pharmacy? Is medication covered by insurance?

As a result, one of my best friends from college wants to come up and visit me! I absolutely adore her and I cannot wait to see her, since I will be gone the entire semester and she is graduating soon while I still have a couple of more months.

I thought it was just going to be her coming up. However, she texts me and says she is inviting our mutual acquaintance along. Here's the issue. I don't get along with that acquaintance. I know I have my faults and pride is one of them, but I just can't get along with her. She is always talking about her family and how great they are and spouting basic history facts (she graduated last year with a degree in history) that anyone would know from third grade. She talks all the time and won't let you get in a word. I'm a naturally quiet person, so people like this usually don't bother me, but the fact that she treats elementary knowledge like some great thing she learned in grad school and won't shut up about her family history really gets under my skin.

I hung out with her in college because she was best friends with two of my best friends. Other than that we never hung out and when she graduated we just stopped talking except the occasional check-in. 

Now my best friend is coming up and last minute is bringing her? I'm not annoyed enough to absolutely skip the whole thing, but I don't want to spend time with this acquaintance. Lucky for me my other best friend also lives in this city, in another neighborhood, and has a spare bedroom so they will be staying with her, and since I have a conference at work I won't be able to spend much time with them. 

How do I enjoy this time with two of my best friends while also not being bothered by this girl's presence? I don't know what to do. Every time we went out as a group when we were all in college she put me in a horrible mood, though I am always in high spirits with my best friends. I know I can't be an a--hole and tell her not to come, but it just kind of blindsided me that my friend invited her and booked tickets while I was just expecting her.

How do I have a good time when they come up? Please help me, I really do want to enjoy the time with my best friends since it will be the last time I see one of them for probably years.

Me and SO are expecting our first child in a few months. When we broke the news to my mom her husband was also in the room (not my dad, they have been married for 2 years). Everyone was of course very excited, and my stepdad right away expressed his joy about being called ""grandpa-*blank*"". I never really thought about that before he said it, I didnt really consider him in my mind to be one of the grandparents. 
We do have a good relationship but I have only known him for about 3-4 years. They married quickly but there is no doubt they are perfect for eachother - he will probably always be around.

The thing is, I'm worried it will seem disrespectful againts my actual dad to give my stepdad an equal position to him. My mom left my dad sort of out of the blue, and even if its been years my dad is still a bit broken over the fact that he lost the love of his life. Long story short my dad is not a fan of this man who ""took over"" the husband-role.

I know I don't have a very clear question, but I would love some insight on how I should wrap my mind around this. Is it weird to have three grandpas anyway? 

SO doesnt seem to really care/mind about the whole situation.",06Feb2020,1

My brother’s girlfriend is best friends with the manager of a local fine dining seafood restaurant, so based off her word I got the job. She no longer waits tables or has desire to work at this restaurant, but I am worried about her friend being upset if I quit because I was hired solely on her recommendation. I thought I would enjoy fine dining and make more money than I was at bars. It turns out to be the opposite, I don’t enjoy the restaurant at all. The work is complicated and I am not used to nor do I desire to give the level of service that is expected when I make LESS money. They have to run their own food, their own tables, provide water and wine service, complete side work, and bake. Simply put I don’t see the amount of work worth the pay and I have decided I’m going to cut my training short.

821,"Things just....became so different between myself and her. We were once a match made in heaven. We absolutely fell madly in love with each other from the start. We both came from a rough background and have mental issues. But we looked passed all that and saw the beauty within. She would always be there to help me through troubling times. And she was the only person to get me to truly smile after not smiling for years. For once i felt comfortable in my own skin because how she made me feel. And vice versa. 
This went along for awhile. We would always text and call each other. Lovey dovey stuff. Constantly. And if we ever had a issue or if one of us needed to talk about something the other half would be there always. But all that began to change....

The change started to happen once she starting going to college. I starting hearing from her less and less. To the point i probably won't get a text unless i send one. Of course though she's a very busy woman now as she's studying to become a nurse. I just don't know if she sees what i see and all the change that's happened to our relationship. From once getting complements and constant hugs/kisses without me asking to i have to ask for all that just makes me feel like something is wrong. I know somethings she won't tell me. I used to always have to dig sensitive info out of her even we first started dating. This woman has made me feel...alive. and has given me the best time of my life in just a course of 5 months. Neither of us have the interest in breaking up. But the one thing i don't understand is, how can going to college change someone that much? 

I want to fix everything, even if that means i have to fight tooth and nail. I would do anything for her. I just want everything to be okay. 

P.s- i will be going on a two hour drive tomorrow with her and that will give me plenty of opportunity to talk with her about my concerns and feelings.",06Feb2020,1

823,"Me and a girl have been texting fairly often for about a month, but we weren't really close friends, more like college friends. Recently I told her that I like her and would like to get to know her better. She said ""we can become friends and get to know each other's personalities better"". 

Yesterday I wanted some clarification because it seemed like her answer was vague, we had a long convo and I assured her that if she sees me as an acquaintance, brother or a friend then it's not gonna work out and I can't continue talking with her because I want more. I asked her how she sees me, she replied ""I see us as friends who are getting to know each other's personalities better and if all goes well, we can take a step together"" I thought maybe she is just leading me on but then she said ""If I was rejecting you, we wouldn't even be talking right now in the first place, so please take that thought out of your head"". I told her again that my intention is not being friends with her, as she has tons of those already, she said ""I understand but how can we get to know each other if we're not friends, maybe you won't like the way I think and maybe I won't like the way you think, how can we find out if we're compatible or not if we aren't friends""...she then said ""we'll get to meet each other in person in college and courses a lot for sure""


I was being honest with her when I told her that I would stop talking to her if she sees me as a just friend or acquaintance, but some friends say that I was an asshole and made it awkward. I think maybe the wording could have been better, but she still initiates conversation fairly often after that so maybe it wasn't that awkward after all, i'm guessing?

Is there any chance she could be interested in me?",06Feb2020,1
824,"Okay. Lets start by saying I am a very lenient and laid back person. I don’t care what my roommate does as long as it doesn’t effect me. I pay for an apartment and rent out a room. Before I rented out this room, I met with a few different potential roommates so that I could find someone similar to me. When I talked to my current roommate, i told her im very laid back and am looking for the same in my roommate. She agreed and acted totally laid back but she has been anything but that. Let me get into it...

My boyfriend lived in another state, and recently moved to the same state as me. When he lived in the other state, he would come visit and obviously stay with me (which i previously told her would happen before she moved in). She had a problem with his length of stay when he would visit and basically told me he could only stay 2 days at a time (the weekend). The thing is... when my boyfriend is here we are almost NEVER home. And if we are home, we’re in my room (we NEVER go in the living room, max 20 mins a day). We literally don’t see her, she doesnt see us. She only knows he is there because I tell her to be respectful and let her know. 

Well fast forward to now, he got a job here and now lives about 5 mins from me. Again, I never see her. He never sees her. We’re either out and about or in my room, but he stays sometimes until around 12:00 am, but we make sure not to be loud and are very respectful. She only again knows he is here because she can hear when he leaves from her room. When I say she doesn’t know he’s there, trust me I mean it. I can’t remember the last time my boyfriend has been in the same room that she has. ANYWAYS, she just texted me and said this,

“Since ___ moved here and that kinda changes the agreement we had before from the lease, do you think he could head home by 9pm during the week?”

This pissed me off bc she doesn’t even know that he’s there. My apartment is much more comfortable (his apartment is barely livable currently as he lives with 3 other males and it’s not in the best part of town so I hate to go there) I think 9pm is unreasonable because she’s up later than that and again it makes no difference that he’s there. Am i being unreasonable? I wouldn’t have rented out the room to her if I knew this would be an issue. How do I handle this?",06Feb2020,1
825,"Yes this is a stupid crush. And yes I know its toxic staying in love with this person but I need help badly because it's starting to affect my mental and social health. So this crush dates back to my 10th grade highschool year and I'm a graduating senior now but I have no clue how I'm still head over heels for this person. I'm not the best looking but I've been told I keep good and positive vibes and I'm very sociable(only when I'm nervous) When I first saw her it was in math class and at first she always had her hoodie on and never talked but would always laugh at my jokes. If I'm being honest I didn't find out she was female untill one day I got out of my and her comfort zone and I asked her the age old question PC or Console(I'm a PC player). She took of her hoodie and answered ""ps4"" and thats when it hit me she was female and that she was very VERY cute. Shes quite small in size and very very shy. We talked often because I noticed I had her for my last period also. I introduced her to my friends and she told me she recently moved to where I was living at the time. She got more and more comfortable with talking to me and my friends and we ended up being best friends. I trusted her with everything and she trusted me. That's when the crush developed. After the crush developed everything went downhill. I then find out shes a senior and older than I even tho she looked so young because how short she was. But she continues to hang out with me and do things I liked. I was a stupid 16 year old with little to no experience on girls or boys(bisexual) or even relationships in general. I had no clue if I was being dense sometimes because I had friends point things out I hadn't like that she would only talk to me when hanging out in a crowd or how she trusted me the most with secrets. I knew these things but I didn't know it was extremely important to her. Talking about it now I feel immensely stupid but at the time I was legit stupid.

828,"I’m in college, and I live in an apartment complex. There is this really cute girl that I’ve never met, but I’m assuming we both know of each other because I knew who she was. 

Anyways, I was pulling out of my apartment parking lot early one morning and she began to back her car out as I was passing her (I did not know who it was at the time; I had to ask a friend who parks near her who drove that car later that night). Even though she wouldn’t have hit me, she quickly hit the breaks as if she didn’t see me driving behind her. 

She pulls out behind me, and we’re both driving down the road in the same direction. She gets in the passing lane and zooms past me and then gets in front of me so she can turn right. 

Coincidentally, I had planned on turning into that same drive through as well. So, we both pull into this drive through. We order, were waiting in line, she pulls up to the window and gets her food and drives off. I get up to the window and the man says “Good morning sir. That young lady in front of you paid for your meal, so you’re good to go.” And I said “that one right there?” And he said “yes sir”. I was looking at her car as she pulled out and I had no idea who drove it so I was completely confused. 

I asked my friend if he knew who drove that car and he told me. I found out it’s a really cute girl who lives near me. 

I have no idea why she paid for my breakfast. We’ve never spoken to each other, I’m pretty sure we don’t follow each other on social, and she didn’t do anything that I feel like would make her feel like she “owes me”. And I mean we’re broke college kids. Who does that just because? 

What should I do? I thought about paying her back and saying she didn’t have to do that but it was really nice or thanks for breakfast or something like that. 

She paid for my food for no real reason, and whether it’s flirtatious or just a nice gesture, I don’t really know how to respond. Any opinions?",06Feb2020,1

831,"I received a noise complaint from the apartment that one day my downstairs neighbor could hear my dogs playing during the day. They don't bark, they said it wasn't barking, just a thumping they could hear. Both dogs are between 15 and 20 lb.

I have the dogs at the park at least 3 times a day, and if they play in my apartment it's usually for about 2 minutes or less if they get zoomies, which happens once a day. To make the noise less, I have taken them to the park even more now, only let them play in the room with the carpet, and don't let them zoomies. 

My question here is what are the next steps for me if another noise complaint is submitted? What could happen and what else should I do to prevent any issues? 

It's a pet friendly apartment, tons of people have dogs and I regularly hear neighbors dogs barking, people being loud in the halls, etc. I was pretty surprised to hear we received a complaint, especially in the middle of the day.

It has become one of my obsessions. Now, he knows how I get and I apologize constantly for being so full of worry but I don’t want him to think I don’t trust him, because I do.

834,"One of my best friends from childhood, Allan, is immunocompromised and has cystic fibrosis, meaning his lungs fill with mucous at a slow rate, limiting his lung function to about 30%. Allan has mentioned in the past that he gets flu shots every year because it will hit him much harder due to this. My other friend, Jake, who I usually hang out with separately but more frequently, works as a receptionist at a health clinic. The clinic sees a lot of international students from a nearby university.

Reports are essentially saying this virus is SARS-like, affecting the respiratory system, and hits like a hard flu. Some friends working in healthcare told me over the phone that personal protective equipment would be worn if visiting someone suspected of contracting coronavirus. Almost all of them have also said something along the lines of, ""Oh, I overheard they have someone that matches symptoms up at so-and-so hospital!"" To this day we have no confirmed cases in my state so it's all just rumors. 

A couple days ago I was getting coffee with both Jake and Allan, and Jake brings up there was potential coronavirus match at his clinic. I immediately thought of Allan, who got visibly uncomfortable and left.

It got me thinking: Jake is pretty much the first person someone interacts with in the healthcare system before they have any idea of what's going on. Being at a clinic that sees many international students, he is the most likely of anyone I know to contract it.

With a 10-14 day asymptomatic, contagious incubation period, I am nervous to hang out with Jake. He insists everything will be fine, there's nothing to worry about, but he's clearly talking confidently as if he were a healthcare professional, not office support staff. I'm not sure he has a full grasp of the outbreak situation or the correct measures to prevent its spread.

Allan clearly is wanting to limit his own time around Jake, so I feel like I'm in a position where I can only see one or the other for the time being. Part of me is saying it's more on Allan to make arrangements for his own health issues, so if he doesn't want to contract it, he knows he shouldn't see me. This will also ensure I can't possibly give it to him.

Then again, maybe not seeing Jake is the better option. I don't want to contract the virus myself, and I don't think it's as likely I would get it from my other friends.

The last part of me is saying, ""Whatever happens happens."" If I stop hanging with Jake for a while, I might still contract the virus and spread it to Allan within the incubation window anyway. Allan could also potentially contract it from his own friends, people at work, etc. He called me a few hours after he left the coffee shop saying we should see a movie on Saturday. I asked him about the coronavirus issue, he said it would be fine. But it seemed to me he was saying that because he was guilty at the idea of cutting me off, even if it was for his own health, because he's one of the only close friends I have left in the state and I can't rely on family much.

So I don't know what you all think, but I'd love to hear your thoughts. 

Tl;dr: Two friends: Jake and Allan. Jake is unfortunately the perfect candidate for contracting coronavirus, and Allan is the exact kind of immunocompromised person it kills. What should I do or change in how I see them, if change anything at all?",06Feb2020,1

837,"I am fairly new to reddit, therefore I have no idea if this is the right place, or I am allowed to ask for advice, since I don't have much Karma, but I digress.

I am in a tricky situation. I want to help my partner get out of their abusive household, but it seems like this is something bigger than me, and I'm desperately looking for some advice or even some words of encouragement.  
They live in South America with their adoptive father. With the knowledge of what he has done to them in the past, both my partner and I believe with certainty that he must be a psychopath. I won't dwell too much on detail, but it's enough to say that the post-traumatic stress disorder and the scars would be enough to terrify an army man.

They have no other family. Being adopted by an abuser, they've been completely isolated, and they have no way of knowing who their original family was– it was a closed adoption (which means all information is closed and private, and the adoptee has no way to access them without the adoptive parents' consent, which my partner clearly does not have).   
They have no access to money. Their adoptive father cut off the money he gave to them for university after an accident, and I had to convince my partner to let me send them money in order to afford basic necessities, like food and meds. Besides, they dropped out without telling their father because of their mental health and the abuse they were enduring in the school system as well.

They don't have much time before their father discovers about them dropping out. I'm not sure they would survive the violence that would follow that. I need to get them out of there as soon as possible.

I am getting informed regarding marriage and citizenship legislation in the European country I live in, and putting money on the side in order to pay for plane tickets to go where they live and help them get the hell out.   
I am psyching myself up in order to tell my family that a complete stranger will move in with me in the house I share with them (we have an empty apartment which was my grandparents', even if I am terrified of telling them I still think this is an easy solution), especially knowing my parents are neglectful abusers as well, but living with my aunt and uncle gives me enough support to know I should be able to pull this off. I just need to tell them.

I don't know what to keep in mind, what I should check for, I don't even know how to deal with the pressure and the trauma that comes with this. I apologize if this is not the right place for this, and I apologize for weird syntax, English is not my first language.  
I can barely take care of myself because of mental health, but I don't want my partner to die when I could've done something. They stayed alive until now even having gone through hell and back because they've never been to a museum, and I feel like I owe them at least that.

She’s always put men before her children, I remember going into hospital numerous times and her leaving me there because her boyfriend needed her.

847,"I’m gonna try to explain it as best as I can so I’m sorry if it’s gonna be hard to read.

I’m 17M in relationship with 15F for about 3 months and we’ve been very close for last half of the year.

For our 5 last meetings let’s say we’ve been doing those things and I believe we’ve tried everything except of real sex and anal (yes I know we are probably too young but it just happened).

Here starts our problems,first she started to bleeding out of nowhere,2 times when I’m was pleasing her with my fingers and as she says there have been other times (3 of them) so it’s not only when I’m doing my finger job and at the same time she says that her period is late (5 days for now) but still she says that those bleedings aren’t those period one.

I know it’s sounds dumb and very immature but here it starts to complicate 

So she should obviously go to a gynaecologist with that as it may be something very important that shouldn’t be ignored,maybe even she is pregnant (I’ve never put my dick into her and I believe that there wasn’t a chance to even my seed have a contact with her vagina but still...) but she has never been to one because as she says there wasn’t need to and also she is a bit scared.Her mother has never took her to one.

And here it complicates even more

Her mother (conservative one which keeps her at home and doesn’t let her go anywhere for her free time outside of a home because she got exams this year(you can imagine how hard is it to be with a girl that doesn’t have time for you so as she found some last time I’m was very happy and you know how it ended))was deducting that she may be with me as I’m was at her place for a new year so she knows me.Today she messaged me that her mother knows that we are together and she hates me (how she found out?She doesn’t know but probably that neighbour told her that once saw me leaving her place) so asking her to go for visit would immediately mean that we’ve been having sex and she is scared about her reaction (me too) but I can’t blame her for that but still it may be something important.

But

Tomorrow starts our winter break and she is going for an school exchange to other country  for those 2 weeks (and I’m also going to be out of a country) so we can’t see each other and It’s gonna be hard for me to support her for that time (I don’t know what else I can do in that situation) and she is probably going to be stressed which will only slow potential period.

So what am I suppose to do?

Wait and see what’s gonna happen?

Maybe her period will come and it’s gonna be fine as it may be because of a stress but still those sudden bleedings  maybe some kind of  infection and she should go talk about this with her mother to pay a visit to a gynaecologist (screw what she will think about me) but still she doesn’t want to and this winter break will take off that chance for a 2 weeks and it may affect her health condition in negative way.

Yes I know,dumb young me,I’m fully aware of that

848,"So I'm taking driving lessons now and I was really excited about it. But lately I feel really uncomfortable and stressed because of the driving teacher. If I make a mistake and he calls me out it feels really bad. and because I'm an overthinker, I can't stop thinking about the incident and brings me in a really shitty mood. I don't know if I'm exaggerating because I have never experienced such a thing in my life. (one to one lesson beside intrumental lesson)
Another problem is that I havs already paid him for the hours in advance. (20 lessons and I've had 7 until now) I would have to search for another teacher and pay 100 buck for administration which is another negative point. But it would make my life easier to change the teacher.

854,"I'll skip the local context, just if you know Mayor Lovely Warren and Brockport's recent seperation of their diversity officer, then that might help, but really I feel you don't need to know all about that to get my situation. 

Due to the issues with the mayor and the seperation, we- students of SUNY Brockport- are having diversity meetings. Today's covered everything from how we need to actively seek out people different than us and make friends with them- which to me seems offensive, actually. My LGBT friends hate that feeling of ""oh lol well I HAD to have a gay best friend"", to microaggressions, etc. With semi-forced participation- if someone didn't answer or respond, the whole class would be kept longer. Not straight up calling people, but lots of classmates looking at each other like 👀👀👀 until someone raised a hand. 

I responded twice. The first was ""if someone wearing hiking boots stood on you as you wear flip flops but denied it, what would you say?"" I responded ""oh, sorry my foot was underneath your boot, my bad."" And got laughter from the class and the officer, so I feel that statement was safe. 

The second, I responded to something like ""so if it seems stupid that anyone would deny stepping on someone's foot, why would they deny taking responsibility for someone being hurt by a microaggression, such as calling my name pretty, when I'm lesbian, implying that they actually think I should have a butch name?"" 

This felt like a trap, seconds turned to minutes, minutes turned to hours, she wanted I think at least three distinct answers. So I raised my hand and said ""well, maybe they feel they didn't insult the person, or were unaware you perceived it as an insult?"" ""That's good! Exactly. People are ignorant about their hurtfulness. What more can you say?"" ""Well, boots are boots, but communication and people are messier. Some people wouldn't see a statement as an insult while others are more sensitive, and in the end, a mature adult should take responsibility for their own emotional state, not expect others to take care of it."" 

This was wrong. And I realized that it's harsh, and now I'm worried I'll be ostracized. I'm a third generation Polish heritage, with visual impairments, I'm not alt right at all. I'm in a new college, in a new major, it's already hard making friends, and one classmate told me after in a diff class I explained my impairment meaning I'm facially blind, that he thought I was just a stuck-up asshole for not saying hi to him outside of class. I can't recognize people well, I struggle with finding my family in a crowd, I feel even a person with good vision would have difficulty recognizing someone from the first week of class. 

One girl ran across me walking to my car and asked if I really believed that people are responsible for their emotions. I said I'm sorry it came off harsh, I mean more you shouldn't be held responsible if someone blames you for their depression, which comes from my past emotional abuse by friends n family. But she said hmmm I guess so it just didn't sound like that.

857,"So earlier today, I (16f) was in class for Spanish. The teacher has this thing where she shows us memes on Thursdays. Now I had a previous issue with her regarding my anxiety and PTSD as she forced me to be in complete silence even though a trigger for my PTSD is silence and i have a doctor's note. I broke down, went to the guidance counselor who said he'll make sure all my teachers know of it. Guess what he didn't do. 

So back to my main issue, the meme the teacher showed was a corny joke about a battery being bipolar while talking to a psychiatrist. 

Firstly, she knew that my older sister (17) ended up having severe manic bipolar, and that our school was pro mental health. (But still let students bully her over her medical conditions sure...)

Secondly, isn't this just encouraging students that it's ok to make fun of mental illnesses? I don't know... 

Thirdly, this was right after she gave us a school shooter briefing before class. 

Finally, it's how she described what bipolar disorder is. It was wrong in so many ways... saying they feel angry and happy at the same time... not only that but, then ASKING THE CLASS if they KNEW ANYONE WHO WAS BIPOLAR.

So basically about a month ago I started dating a dude. This is my first ever relationship (I’m 15). I’ve noticed lots of problems in our relationship already. My third day of flirting with him he asked me to be his girlfriend. Looking back that is really soon but I wanted to be in a relationship. The next day he told me he loved me. I told him I loved him too but I never meant it. I later found out he broke up with his ex a day before he started flirting with me. Which means I’m a rebound. He talks about his ex a lot and I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if he still has a thing for her. He has been pressuring me to have sex with him (I’m a virgin) and I don’t think I’m ready. He tells me I’m the best thing that has ever happened to him and he couldn’t live without me even though he always makes himself seem better than me. I don’t love him and I am not sure if he loves me either. I just don’t know what to do. I don’t want to break it off only because I like the thought of being in a relationship. Should I talk to him about how I feel? What should I do? Please help",06Feb2020,1

We got Rosa one year ago this month. We got a second guinea pig named Daisy in September to help Rosa be less lonely. Both are female. We have read that they need to be in separate cages until they are the same size, and Daisy seems just big enough now. They were both babies when we got them. We had their separate cages right next to each other and they would each chew on the bars toward each other. 

Recently we moved into an apartment and let them run around a bedroom together a few different times, and they loved it. They were popcorning and squeaking and running around together so we decided to finally buy one big cage to put them both in. 

Once we put them in the big cage (nothing but bedding was in it) they immediately started fighting. Like deep teeth chattering, biting hard fighting so we separated them and put them back in their own cages. We’ve done this a couple times now and I’ve read that you’re supposed to keep them together and they’ll figure out the fight on their own unless it got serious. 

But it started serious. Every video I’ve watched shows exactly what they were doing being the “serious fighting” and I was really scared. We’re 95% sure Rosa is the instigator. We really don’t want them living in separate cages for much longer, and we don’t know how to go forward from here. They even started to fight when we put them in the open room and not just the cage. What should we do?

TL;DR our Guinea pigs won’t stop fighting when we introduce them.",06Feb2020,1

Is this weird?

Hi there, I just wanted to come here because I feel so conflicted about the situation and I want to know if other people fun it weird. I’m F 21. 

Okay so about a week ago a lad I don’t know (27) followed me on Instagram but had a lot of my friends following him so I thought nothing of it. Then yesterday he added me on Facebook and I accepted it as I just thought he was a mutual friend that maybe I had met in passing. 

He started by messaging me telling me I was beautiful and I said thank you and he went on to ask me if I was interested in talking to him and trying for a relationship which I declined as I do not know this man. I let him down gently and told him that I’m quite content on my own but I wouldn’t mind getting to know him as a friend. 

He declined my offer of being a friend and he “didn’t want another friend he has enough” and “he found me very attractive and wanted to see what happened” but he doesn’t know me! All he’s seen are the photos that I have posted on my Instagram and Facebook, he knows nothing about what I like or my personality and I find it a little bit weird that he spoke to me purely to peruse a relationship and declined a friendship.

Im 13, moving out isnt an option

Her friends are next door neighbours

My Mom is an ok parent otherwise

This is not on the weekend, its usually in the middle of the week.


Basically, every couple of nights my Mom will invite our next door neighbors over and get wasted whilst blasting music and talking and laughing loudly.

I’ll call her and ask her to turn it down, only for her to refuse as I have “sensitive hearing”. From my P.O.V, the music is so loud I can *feel* it, even with the doors closed, making it impossible to sleep.

The neighbours will usually leave at about 2-3am, it takes me another 2 hours to actually get to sleep, and I have to get up at 7:30 at the latest.

I usually end up going to school exhausted, and trying to catch some sleep in the bathroom at lunch. Coffee/sugar doesnt help at all.

Im so tired constantly, and all I want to do is cry because Im so tired constantly.

She always insits on having them around our place, too.

Anyways I get a bit jealous and suspicious when we get back together because she always had a notification from this guy and she told me he keeps
Hitting her up and they don’t really talk, so things were rough for us and were kind of on and off but mostly off due to me being a insecure. I go to her house to surprise kind of and we make up and she tells that they talked while we were broken up but it’s was probably when we were together too because shit was so messy, she confesses to me that he asked for nudes and switch went off in my head and I knew there was more ( she didn’t send any btw). 

I message this guy and he tells me everything and says when we were broken up she responded to his Snapchat story saying the meaning of life is too suck dick your dick( to a question that said what’s the meaning of life wrong answers only),  but he has a device that lets him know who says it. I do think this was an honest mistake because obviously it was anonymous she didn’t know who it was too and that they’d be able to find out it was her. 

Anyways he tells me that she initiated every conversation and they didn’t really talk but she seemed really interested that he played guitar and she told him to listen to music and shit, but he did say there was no flirted or anything or making plans and he thinks she did To make me mad. Essentially just talking but not really just short convos. I was mad because she talked to him after he knew what she said about him 

She tells me that she maybe started two conversations and that she tried to make it awkward and shit because she was embarrassed because she didn’t mean to say she wanted to suck his dick or anything, she tried to leave him on read but he’d hit her up and they really had short awkward conversations, they both told me and had since both blocked eachother on everything.

Little back story... I was violently assaulted by my child's father in the summer time. Since then he has been out on bond after spending a few days in jail. His mother paid for the huge bail and is paying for one of the most popular ( I assume expensive) lawyers in town. There is a NO contact order by the judge on him so he has zero contact with me and our child.

So in comes this relationship with the other family and its odd. In the first few months after the attack I was in more contact with his mom and we even had dinner to I guess vent /talk. Btw I always got along with her well and most of the family too.There was more effort to spend time with her granddaughter during this period too by picking her up ,stopping by and taking her out to eat etc. My ex has two other older kids from a prior relationship and he was their only care taker well now his mom is helpng him with that so I assume things can get pretty stressful for her.

Its February and Ive noticed a sharp decline of interest in my daughter from her other family &amp; grandma. Meanwhile , my daughter's older half siblings have been invited to holiday gatherings and what not. We know this cause she keeps in contact with them through messaging and IG.

One of them told her she has xmas gifts there at the grandma's house ...but its Feb now and no one has offered to come by to drop them off or make any other arrangements.

I get this is a hard time for everyone but I feel in my opinion my daughter has it the hardest out of EVERYONE. Her older siblings and grandma/ everyone else can still see and contact her father. She can not. Yet nobody on that side of the fam has shown any real concern with how she is doing.Like when we ran into her father's cousin hanging out with her older siblings while she was not invited...that was awkward.

Here is where I need advice, Should I put in more effort for there to be a relationship with the other family? Or deal with half ass attempts ?? Im tired of her telling my daughter/me she wants to spend time then has zero contact for a long time or do I just not give a fuck and let whatever happens , happens idk.

They have a very broken household (parents are separated) and their communications skills are bad. They avoid talking and avoid negative conversations hoping for situations to resolve on their own. However he has been able to gain some freedom slowly but surely over the last 6 years we have been dating, but recently we have hit a wall I am not sure how to get over. 

She has had access and control over his bank accounts his entire life. 6 months ago she let him have personal access and let him deposit his money and whatnot. My boyfriend has exclusively done almost everything in cash to get around this, but now has a substantial amount of money saved and is looking to purchase a house to move out of the toxic environment his household has become. 

He has done his due diligence with my help to work his way through the process to buy a house, but his mom refuses to release his tax returns and old W2s to him so that he can get pre-approval from a bank. She doesn’t want him to leave and wants to continue her control over him as long as she can. She continually is giving the excuse that she wants to do his 2019 taxes, but won’t do them while he’s around nor will even entertain the prospect of giving them to him in any way (which I know is illegal). 

Is there any way he can reach out to where she filed his taxes and be able to access the old returns and/or W2s without her involvement? We don’t know where as of right now, but I think we can find out.

888,"Alright let me start off with some basic info about myself. I am 18 years old and in the last year of highschool and I come from a middle/higher class family. Parents are both already retired and somewhat older. Though the title of this thread is a little harsh, I want you to know I do love my parents, but these issues are affecting both me and them.

Since as long as I can remember, my parents have always bought or gotten used stuff. They have all kinds of old cutlery to full furniture items that were once from other family members or they got them for free. Their explanation for having so much used stuff is that it is better for the planet, a reason that I do agree with, but I just think they chose some of the uggliest, impractical used stuff ever. 

They also keep all kinds of useless stuff at our house, for example: they collect the caps of bottles and cartons. They also have like 2 lawn mowers of which they never use a specific one. They also have two vacuum cleaners tho one costs exceptionally more to maintain (kirby) but they both have the same HEPA filter.

Next to that, they also never seem to mind minor problems which become frustrating to me after some point. Stuff like replaced windows which came without sills so there is now a line of concrete sill which looks bad and is so impractical.

Mouses are given a free hand because they can crawl behind the shitty wall because the concrete sills arent properly closed off to the insulation space behind the wall. 

I am fucking done with living with my parents because it looks like they dont care anymore about any fucking thing though they have the time and money to fix everything.",06Feb2020,1
889,"""asking for a friend"" here - what can be done to stop VERY offending foot odor? My friend is in her work shoes all day, she says she can smell her own foot stink in meetings and is mortified about it, but doesn't know how to stop it. She has to wear a special type of lace up safety shoes in her job. 

Is there a particular kind of sock that she should wear to stop the foot stink? A foot spray? An odor absorber that goes in the shoes when she's not in them? It's so bad she can't even drive with the windows up anymore. She says she's showering every day and wearing clean socks every day, but her feet just sweat and throughout the day it builds up stink.",06Feb2020,1

891,"Hi there, I'm looking for some advice on how to handle relationships/friendships, I had an unusual upbringing and came away with no real idea how to navigate social situations. Because of this I don't have many friends, so I really want to do this right so I don't lose another friend.

I don't have a lot of money, I live pretty humbly and mostly paycheck to paycheck. For Christmas, my grandmother sent me a good amount of money, about equal to the amount that I make in a month. This is very unusual for her, it's not like I regularly get money from my family, I consider myself self-sufficient. So this was a nice surprise.

My birthday is in February, and so is my friend's. I decided to use the money to plan a trip to Disneyland, which I've always loved but haven't been able to go for many years because it's so dang expensive. So I'm paying completely for myself, my husband, and our friend to go on this trip. This is a VERY expensive endeavor for me and I was super excited because my friend has never gotten to go to a Disney park despite loving theme parks. We'd talked before about her wanting to go, so I knew she really wanted to.

After making sure I could afford the trip and planning things out, I brought it up with her. She was obviously EXTREMELY excited. We only planned about a month in advance, so it was a bit last minute, but that's not really a problem for any of us and she has not said a single negative thing, nothing but excitement.

The problem is that she has also not at all said thank you, even once. I feel really weird and uncomfortable about this. It's not like I want her to feel like she has to fawn all over me and be super thankful... but she hasn't even said ""thanks"" one time. I kind of thought maybe she would when we got there, but now I'm not sure.

We got our tickets in the mail, and I took a picture of the three of them together and sent them to her, just because I was excited and thought she'd like to see, and she just replied saying ""I call (the clearly best ticket)"" (each one has a different picture on it, she wants the best looking one)

I don't really care, I guess, which paper ticket she gets. It's just a piece of paper. But it really REALLY rubs me the wrong way that she hasn't said thank you at all and she's acting entitled about which ticket she gets. I don't get it. I have spent so much money on this trip and I don't begrudge her that but I could have spent that money on a computer (mine is over 10 years old) or ... I don't know, I can think of any number of things, like I said I usually live very humbly. 

I've tried to ignore stuff like this because I just want to have a good time, but as the trip gets closer, it happens more and more with little entitled comments and me not getting any sense that my friend cares that I completely paid for this trip myself and how much it has cost me. I don't know how to express to her that this has been expensive, stressful, and I just want to have a good time together. Please help.",06Feb2020,1

893,"So let me set the scene. I have a dog who is not friendly. I am renting out a house, so there is no risk to anyone nearby. It's the reason I didn't rent an apartment. She is pretty large, about 75lbs. The property manager knows this, and she is in my lease. The owners of the place I'm renting recently sold it to new owners. They are contracted to fix certain parts of the house, like the roof, plumbing issues, some things inside, etc.. I have told the property manager time and time again that my dog is NOT friendly and I have to be present for them to work inside the home, and lock her away so their workers are not at risk. I cannot lock her up 14 hours a day multiple days in a row so they can do repairs, because she will get anxious and start chewing her feet until she bleeds, and overall cause her great distress seeing people walking around. There is also a pretty decent risk she can break out of her crate if she's distressed enough.  They have routinely told me that legally only 24 hours notice is required, and they will enter when I am not there. I cannot afford to board my dog in a kennel for the multiple days they are there, and they refuse to work with my schedule. I have even offered to take 3 days off of work if they just give me 2 weeks advance notice so I can request time off at my job. They completely refuse..
If they enter while I am not home, my dog will likely bite them. I'm freaking out a little bit, because they will not listen.. My question is, can they sue me or pursue legal action and have my dog taken away and such because she bit them, even though it's my own home? I'm confused in the laws because I am a renter..

903,"before i start, sorry for no capitalization, my shift key is broken.

so this has been going on for about 5-6 months, this girl at my school just wont back off and really just acts like some childish 8 year old and i'm kinda conflicted on what to do since i've never seen anyone this annoying and childish.

so basically about a year ago a bunch of new people started in my school, among these was this girl which was pretty annoying from the start, she'd always interupt everyone, hit everyone if they say something against her and act offended to everything for example if you jokingly call your friend gay or something she'd come up and act like you just called her the n-word or something even though not a single person even looked at her. yes i am aware this is offensive and i don't mean to say it, sometimes it just comes out once in a while since it wasn't very long ago that it was pretty normal to call someone gay just like you'd call your friends some other word like dumb or something incase they do something silly.

she paints out men to be human trash and women to not have done anything wrong ever. yes shes one of those people that dye their hair crazy colors and bring up stupid things like manspreading in normal conversations just to start drama or something, i dont really get her reasoning for bringing up stupid shit. 

i obviously didn't like her and she just wouldn't stop coming up to me and talking to me and shit, her way of communicating is really confusing, she almost always ends up insulting you or calling you stuff like gay that she gets mad at for no reason if someone else even mentions it.

fast forward about 2 months and she asks me if i want to be her guy, doesn't even ask me out just asks me if i want to be her guy as if we're 9 or something also who tf asks someone if they wanna be together after 2 months of barely talking? i obviously think she's annoying af but she didn't seem to catch the hints, so i just say i didn't like her like that and only like a friend when really i just want to change school because this girl is a huge hypocrite and one of those people that think insulting someone is funny.

what does she do after i say no? she goes and tells all her friends about how i friendzoned her, i dont know how this is normal but im guessing it's fairly normal to tell your friends if you got rejected but thats not my problem, my problem is that she probably said something weird to her friends since i got stares the whole next week and eventually someone came up to me and asked why i friendzoned her which is kinda strange, i didn't expect it to be such a big deal.

ever since i rejected her she has been acting like some 5 year old always staring at me and if i stare back she looks at me as if i called her the n word, it pisses me off so much.

she always goes out of her way to be close to me but never communicates and if i say anything to her she acts like some bitch and insults me vulgarly and this doesn't just happen to me, she insults almost my entire friend group just for being friends with me. 

i was getting very mixed emotions so i tried being annoying to her and guess what changed? nothing, she still stares and everything, her feminist stuff have gone even more extreme, even though i believe in equality i dont believe in feminism since in my opinion it has turned into something way worse than equality and my classmate is an example of that, she recently interviewed me about my thoughts for manspreading which i think is the dumbest thing ever made, yes there are people who take up more than one seat but i bet most of them are drunk people, homeless people trying to sleep or people taking up more space with their bags (more often women than men since women usually have bags and purses with them) her argument for that manspreading exists is that ""how can it not exist if it's become so big it has a word?"" and honestly yes men do take up more space but most men will probably agree with me that sitting with your legs closed squishes your junk and it's very uncomfortable and sitting on 2 seats at once hurts unless you're flexible. if you cut off my dick and balls i will gladly sit with my legs closed! actually don't, i like my broom. this really went off topic sorry for my rambling i just really despise people who act as if women have all the problems and that men live the perfect life with 0 problems.

anyways back on track, my goal with the part above me and the following is to hopefully paint out her shitty personality.

anyways she usually gets extremely triggered and mad if someone mentions the word ""gay"" or if sometimes we joke about my chinese friend which he always is in on and we would never call someone we weren't close friends with ""yellow"" or something or if we even joke about me, i'm middle eastern so sometimes my friends call me indian or something since middle easterners and indians look alike and stuff maybe sometimes they call me terrorist or something which i 100% get is offensive but we all say things with our friends that we don't really mean, sometimes we all get carried away and i'm fine with it honestly since i've known my friends for most of my life and again we would never call people that kind of stuff unless they're inside our very close friend group. to put to perspective, we'd be the kind of guys that'd be able to shit infront of eachother in the same room without it being awkward or weird and yes i get that in some cultures this is completely normal anyways but where i live it really takes some balls oh wait nevermind i cut them off to stop manspreading. (sorry i had to throw one manspreading joke in there)

anyways even though she gets offended, it's as if she thinks it's perfectly fine to call other people stuff herself but no one can say anything to anyone else.

i myself have diabetes type 1 and some people are ashamed of it, i don't really care about it and if you care about it, i don't really care about you since you really have to have some problems to dislike someone since they have diabetes which you can't even control and yes type 1 isn't the one you get from eating unhealthy, it's the one where your body doesn't produce insulin which i think comes randomly but anyways she just randomly calls me ""diabeteskid"" or ""diabetic"" mid conversation for some reason and doesn't feel shame at all, it's as if she thinks nothing applies to her but as soon as you do something wrong it's as if you just killed her family or something it just makes me so pissed off to see hypocrites like this and if you speak out about it she just says ""oh, are you offended?"" talking to you as if you're a baby or something in a really humiliating voice, like bitch what the fuck is wrong with you? a second ago you just acted as if i snapped half the population away and now you act as if it's perfectly fine?

i honestly just want to stop thinking about it but i just can't stop thinking about how she's such a piece of shit and i just want to hit her so hard so that she understands what a fucking dumbass she is like fuck you and your manspreading hypocritical insulting ass holy shit i want to beat her in an argument but i never can because she acts so dumb all the time and just hits you with her humiliating baby voice and i just get left speechless because i've never talked to anyone that childish.

she also basically won over all the teachers on her side somehow so if you ever get in an argument with her you might aswell expect the teachers to jump in and tell you that you're wrong and stand on her side.

fuck her and fuck the teachers, there are 2 really good ones that seem to like her but like professionals they dont choose a side and try to break the fight up.

what the fuck do i do and don't even suggest talking to her, i've already told you what happens everytime anyone speaks out and her hoard of friends just also follow after her like flies since she's literal shit.

she acts as if she's 30 and 8 at the same time. if anyone is immature she acts mature and just spits insults yet if someone acts mature she acts immature and spits out insults too. like go ahead and cry more bitch.

sorry for all the shitty swearing and stuff at the end, i understand i dont look like the good person after this but trust me i'm not like this normally i just really lose control when talking about people like this.

as asked above, what do i do and dont suggest talking to her since i've told you what happens

905,"I had adopted a puppy around December 29th, 2019. Unfortunately, due to our older dog not getting along with a young active puppy we ended up having to re home. Now, I had put puppy up on Kijiji (Canadian craigslist) and made sure to interview every body to see who had the most suitable home for his needs. Now, the man who we decided to re home to told us many lies straight from the beginning which we only figured after that nothing added up due to the way he was acting. I had puppy up for $500. He called and tried to negotiate down to $300, no problem. (I was only advised not to give for free because it would show people who would be serious - which was not the case) anyways, we get there and he only has $250. I’m not going to argue about money all I care is him having a good home. I spend over an hour thoroughly explaining everything he needed to do and how to change puppy’s food properly so he doesn’t get sick. He says he is going to feed puppy chicken &amp; eggs. I said that’s great, just make sure to half n half the food until the old food is done so he gets used to the chicken &amp; eggs slowly. I had also discussed with him that at any point in time he needed to re home the pup, he is welcome to come back here, I will take care of him until I find a more suitable home. Now, 2 weeks after we had met up - he texts me and tells me that his parents are coming from back home and he needs to re home the pup. I said my bf’s dad is on the way now to pick him up. He started acting shady from the start saying “pups not at the shop he’s at a friends house” and then my bf’s dad arrives to the shop, puppy has no food, water bowls or toys with him from supposedly being at the friends house. He willingly handed the dog over my bf’s dad &amp; now he texts me almost a week later asking me for a $200 refund. He says either give him the $200 or the dog back? There was no contract to begin with stating I would give him a refund and on top of that, upon bringing puppy home that night, he threw up all the food this man was giving him (CURRY chicken, peas... etc) so we ended up paying $106.00 to get puppy’s old food back, bowls, toys.. etc AND we brought him to the vet to make sure everything was okay which was more money on top of that. I don’t care about the money spent on puppy. Is he entitled to a refund and what should I do in this situation? Personally, I don’t think he deserves a refund because he put minimal effort into taking care of pupper, didn’t bring him to the vet and fed him things that are not good for a puppy. Thoughts? 

Ps. I already know that I made a big mistake in the beginning from adopting pupper &amp; giving him to a new home but I have tried my best to find a new home for him and unfortunately, people are liars on the internet no matter how much interviewing. Now, I have found a very good home for him on a farm with family friends. I regret exposing puppy to this in the first place. He is safe and happy now.",06Feb2020,1
906,"Allright so this might be a long story. I just entered high school this year and I made a lot of friends. I'm not popular but I am a bit known. I am very attached to a handful of them and would do a lot for them because I really, really value our relationship. I just want the best for them because I never though I'd meet such people.
Now, about my friend. I'm in the best high school in town, and he has the worst grades of us. Not that he's dumb, he's actually very smart, but he's got a ton of shit on his mind.
He is the popular kid from American movies. He doesn't really try in school, is coming from a rich family, has got questionable older friends from middle school. 
The thing is me and my group have already seen through his facade. I'm worried about him. I don't think he's depressed but he has got a ton of self-doubt in him that his trying to hide from the world by being arrogant and quite an ass. 
He's not really good at that either. A lot of people see through his bullshit, but they just think he is cringe.
Dont get me wrong, he can be so fricking annoying sometimes, when he is obviously lying and putting on a face. Ffs, he is cringe, but just because he limits himself. I think he finds comfort in that stereotypical character he's created for himself and doesn't even realise. He can be so arrogant sometimes, he can be very rude and uncaring, but he can be good too. One time we got out of town with the class and we talked a lot and he was so fucking sad it was hurtful for us. 
His family is rich but his parents clearly dont care too much about him. I want to help him and I cant find a better way but to tell him f2f that we can all see through his mask and he can be a much better person if he would be sincere firstly with himself, than with us too. 
He always wants to be in the centre of attention and wants to seem very smart and he doesn't understand that he needs to work for that. It's the way he grew up that fucked him up and I really get pissed when I see that he's been spoiled by bad parenting. 
Should I speak to him about that? Should I just hope he will grow up and his ego will shrink? He s not a bad kid, he just wants attention and affection and doesn't know how to get it. 
I'm worried if I'll tell him what's on my mind I'll get carried and be too harsh. I talked to another friend about that and we want to play a good cop bad cop scenario. Is that good? 
I am scared he ll just get it all wrong and think we hate him. I sincerely dont know. I'm confused.

918,"So here is some background. I am the 3rd year (out of 4) student studying in an university(computer science) and an art college simultaneously. I'm going to make a computer science career after graduation, that's my main business. But I genuinely like painting/drawing and I'm studying it for years already (not going to use it for work though, I just love it).

Recently one of our university teachers said he could recommend me (and other students as well) to a company and we could start working (part-time) and getting experience already. That sounds super cool to me since I would really like to get some real life experience at computer science as well as earn some money.

The problem is that if I start working, I almost certainly will have to quit the art college just due to lack of time. And I am pretty sure I won't be able to gain such painting skills anywhere else later. I doubt that I'll have time and will to study painting after graduation at all. So it's one-way road.

I can either get a job at computer science = get valuable experience, money and be ready for work right after graduation and quit art college. Or I can pass it up and continue studying both at university and art college. What should I do?",06Feb2020,1

And he said all night every night he’s on his phone talking to girls. And I- I was shook. So yeah. He told me not to tel him and I said his secret is safe with me. Then he said he’s sexting you too. And I said yeah. He is. Soooo yeah that’s what happned. And then he told me that he’s constantly showing him what the girls are saying and it annoys him. I can just imagine that.

And so I stay at my parents home, I don't know how to meet new people and try to make friends,

 And I had a love story that I kept in myself didn't say anything until I drunk too much a year later and I fell sorrow becouse of that and I still think of her, that I could do better, we could be together, I can't stop pity myself.

I can't stand parties, have never been to any other than  with high school class but even then I couldn't force myself to dance with others or just communicate with them.

How can I forget about unrealized love that I kept in myself, and how to move on and find friends?

933,"Tl;dr: need help with questions to ask/ how to handle a situation with dating a guy with a kid and the baby momma in the picture.

So I’m 20(f) dating this guy 24(m) who has a 3 year old son. We are kinda long distance around 45 mins to an hour away from eachother? We have been seeing each other over the weekends for around a month and a half. We met a music festival and started dating soon after just for a little background. I have met his best friend and other close friends as he payed for me to go to another festival on his birthday and they follow me on Instagram. But here’s the kicker!! He doesn’t have an Instagram, like 100% doesn’t have one so I can’t get any information on him at all 🤯

I just wanted to ask Reddit- would you guys date someone who has a baby momma and broke up with her around 3ish months ago lol? As in, do you think they’re still messing around/in romantic contact. I’ve already asked him and he now since things are exclusive with us (he asked me to be his girlfriend) I’m starting to realize some reddish flags maybe
 The flags: 
- I’ve seen his phone but he keeps it glued with him for the most part 
- keeps it short when I ask about it (just saying we either meet up or pick him up, or that they don’t text or anything like that) 
-haven’t been to his place 
-just broke up with her 3 months ago 


I don’t trust myself cause I do tend to be an over thinker and overly anxious in relationships so I’m asking y’all. 

I’ve  asked him trying my best not be accusatory but just how they’re relationship was and how the relationship is now/if he’s basically still seeing her and he responded saying they don’t get along and they just either meet up at a spot to drop off the kid or pick/drop the child off at the house. So I either can ask In a different way or just trust his answer. But idk how to ask in a different way or if I should just leave cause I don’t know how to trust this. I’ve never dated a guy with a kid and don’t know what to do.

Should I date a guy with a kid? Have any of you ever? How did you guys go about it because I am lost. If I were to end it I don’t even know how to end it cause I’ve never broken up with someone. I’m lowkey just a mess. 

Also, How do I tell him that both of us need to be tested without seeming accusatory?  (I know I’m clean but what if he’s still messing around with her and she isn’t ahhh idk)  so basically in a relationship how do you guys usually propose the let’s get tested convo? 

Sorry for the whole long thing, I guess I just barely started thinking about all this
Stuff now and I’m barely able to know how about to go about any of this or ASK stuff to him, I don’t know how to ask without seeming annoying and I don’t know where my place is. What are some questions you would really want to know if you were dating someone with this situation?

He told me to follow him into an empty hall . He said do not harass girls again . And started talking about how he has reports against me from other girls which makes no fucking sense because no girl I spoked to before was ever uncomfortable to where I would think she would write a report and how could they never walked away after I spoke to them or they did know my names the ones that I didn’t get there snap or phone number from. and even with this girl with the food . It was him who noticed and him who followed me. He said he’s going to write a report on me and if I do something like this again I’m expelled.

I’m in 11th grade now. There was a honor society meeting after school today and this girl (17f) who I (16m) knew in eight grade sat in front of me and my friends.  I know that in 8th grade she had a crush on me and looking back on it I was attracted to her too but didn’t know what the feeling (crushing) was then.

I thought she looked pretty cute when I recognized her and realized it had been years since we last talked. So by the end of the meeting I decided that I was going to go over and talk to her. Unfortunately she ran out right as the meeting ended and I didn’t get the chance to.

I’m not someone who accepts defeat so easily so I texted the number I had her saved under about 10 min later asking if it was still her number. She said yes so I asked her if she was in track, doing well in classes. I told her that I’d like to catch up with her because it’s been so long.

I've been going out with a guy for almost 2 1/2 years. We balance each other out pretty well - he is good at looking out for me when sometimes I don't do it myself; we have similar interests and humour, etc. We both have had mental health blips at various points in the relationship - I've had particularly bad depression and anxiety for the past 2 months or so, and have tried to be open about it as difficult as that is. He is a very guarded person and doesn't find it as easy to talk or open up as I do. During the week I felt like there was something he was not opening up to, and I asked if everything/we were okay. There was a pretty long pause before he suggested he didn't know.

This took me off guard and when I asked what that meant, he couldn't explain. Of course this is when the anxiety kicks in and the chronic worrier in me thinks the worst, and I did a lot of ugly crying as he struggled to say anything. We went to sleep without talking and the next day when he got back in, he did talk but suggested he just didn't know what was wrong with him. That he doesn't know if it's just a general depressed episode or not. He doesn't want to break up, and wants me to give him time. Which I understand as I know depression makes you question a lot of things in general, but my head is pretty all over the place trying to figure out what this all means.

I love him a lot and I want to do what is best for him even though I might not like the solution. Although I feel like it may be a particular bad depressive episode and space may not help either. (I did ask if he wanted space, but he said he didn't.)

The money is gone and he will won’t send me tracking even though he texted me that it was shipped.  I have his name and phone but I think it is all fake.  I am such an idiot.  Should I contact police?  his number goes to a recording that says he has not set up a voice mail.  He claimed to be a student.  I went outside of Offer up so they are out of the loop.",06Feb2020,1
959,"The story:

I was called by someone from a job I applied to (part time low wage) who showed a definite interest in my application, and at the end of the call the person said they would get the store manager to call back as soon as they returned to the store. This was two Tuesdays ago, and I am starting to get worried, as this was the only job of the over a dozen minimum wage part time jobs that even responded in the past month. I have really bad weekday availability due to a pseudo-college course in downtown Pittsburgh, and the drive is 45 mins WITHOUT traffic, and they seemed prepared to accommodate that here. I would like to know if there is any way of checking up on this situation that would be acceptable? Should I go in person to see, should I give them a call, should I wait a bit longer before doing anything, should I just move on, or are there any other things I could do?",06Feb2020,1
960,"I don’t really know what to do. We broke up recently like last month and it was completely my fault. She’s the only one I could really be myself around and now I feel that side of me slipping away, and that was the only side of me that I liked. I don’t really have any friends. I try to distract myself by going to the gym or making music but it’s only temporary distractions. I had my first therapy appointment today and it didn’t really help. Not really sure how to make this easier.",06Feb2020,1
961,"Preemptive apology for the long read

As the title suggests, I'm an American born and raised outside of the US by fully American parents (my parents are teachers and left the country when they were in their late 20s). I've lived in a number of different countries and continents. Never have I seen the US as my home nor have I ever planned on living here, but I decided to go to university in my parents' home state–a small southern state–because of cheap in-state tuition. I figured it was more important to graduate debt free instead of going to a fancy expensive university. I knew it would be a change, but I thought I'd get used to it, plus, it was worth it. Right? Now I've been going here for almost two years and nothing has been any easier. I'm living life day by day because thinking about the future gives me anxiety. Everything in my life is so unstable that I cannot even conceive of what I'll be doing even in the near future. I've always been an extrovert until I came here. Meeting people is exhausting because I can't relate to anybody and nobody wants to take the time to understand my situation. I've even gotten dirty looks because of my denunciation the US as my home. I can't find a job to distract me, I've become indifferent about my hobbies, and sometimes I feel as though the only thing that drives me to get out of bed is the guilt of being a lazy slob. I've never had to deal with serious anxiety and depression until now and I don't know how to get rid of it. I see my friends from high school going to universities around the world and excelling, hosting TED talks, becoming student body presidents, and studying to be doctors and lawyers. I know I want to succeed. I know I have the ability *to* succeed. I know I need to get off my ass and do something, but I don't even know where to start. Kierkegaards definition of angst perfectly describes my current state of being: understanding how many choices I have but how little I know of how to exercise these choices wisely. I'm at a crossroads of life and the amount of roads and signs are dreadful, but I know I must go down one of them. So, Reddit, where do I start?",06Feb2020,1
962,"I’m in Year 13 at the moment and I’ve applied to take a gap year. I chose that because I don’t feel ready to go to uni yet - my mental health has been declining pretty rapidly lately and I’m not really looking forward to anything about my future lol. But now I’m worried that I’m going to be completely alone on my gap year and that things will get even worse. I guess I was just hoping somebody might have some advice/tips on what to do in this situation?

Thanks",06Feb2020,1
963,My dad and I have always been very close but in the past month or so I have had intrusive sexual thoughts about him or thought about me as his wife. Sometimes I think about him during the day. Every time I hug him or watch tv with him I think these thoughts and I can’t stop them from happening. They disgust me so much I cry afterwards and I’m terrified of this ruining my relationship with my father who I love more than almost anyone. I couldn’t bear to lose this relationship or him. I love him like a father but lately I can’t be around him without thinking these thoughts. I would rather be dead than be in a romantic or sexual relationship with my father. I am currently in highschool so I don’t know if this is normal but I just want help to make these things stop and what I should do in order to just be normal again. Sorry for the poor grammar but I am desperate.,06Feb2020,0
