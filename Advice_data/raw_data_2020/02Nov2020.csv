0,"Going to keep this vague, just in case, but I have a sister who has had a lot of major medical issues continuously for the past 20 years, which began when she was 15. Because of this, she has always been babied and coddled and had people do things for her so she’s not very responsible. She’s also very mentally fragile. You can’t yell at her or draw her attention to anything she’s done or she gets upset. This can present as crying and having a panic attack or melt down, or she can get extremely mean and attack. Because of this, it’s nearly impossible to call her out on anything because it’s not worth the outcome. Stuff like we are cooking together, and when SHE is done, she just leaves everything out and doesn’t put stuff away. She wears muddy boots into the house and puts her feet up on the furniture - if I point it out and ask her not to, she rolls her eyes, says they aren’t dirty, and accuses me of being too anal and freaking out over nothing. She’ll misplace important paperwork or lose things that belong to someone else, and if you try to stress their importance or express that you’re upset that she lost something, she goes into meltdown mode and completely loses it. I am several years younger, but was forced from a young age to grow up and deal with things because of all her issues. People assume I am older because I’m constantly taking care of her. 

How do you deal with someone like this?  I’m not an expert by any means, but it feels like I’m constantly being gaslit by her if I try to bring up anything where she has been irresponsible or rude. I usually just bite my tongue and pick up after her or whatever the case may be, but I know that doesn’t solve anything. It just makes my life easier than dealing with the fight/meltdown.

Does anyone have any advice on how to cope with someone like this?",02Nov2020,1

My girlfriend stole my whooky sack. I am at my wits end and I don’t know what to do

My girlfriend has stealing problems. It started out with small things like a phone charger or sunglasses or something. I have found the missing objects at her house with proof that they are mine. I confronted her about this but she just deflected and changed the conversation. This was a problem but it wasn’t serious until now. I noticed my whooky sack was missing and I was furious. She knows how much I don’t want my whooky sack to be stolen so I never suspected her even after the previous issue. I called the police immediately but they found no proof of a break in. I interrogated everyone who as access to my room (my mom, my dad, brothers, goldfish), but none of them did it. Yesterday, I found my whooky sack in a drawer at my girlfriend’s house. I would normally just punch the shit out of anyone who touches my whooky sack, but I don’t want to hit my girlfriend. What should I do?",02Nov2020,1

So about 4 months ago I (18 m) met this girl (18f) , and I fell in love so to say. I got the spark and butterflies etc etc. and we hit it off pretty good, but then I told her my feelings one night while I was drunk, and it was too prematurely. And that was too fast for her, so she quit talking to me. She then started talking to me again 2 weeks later after I reached back out to her in a flattering way, which she considered really romantic and we started talking again. Ever since then it’s been ups and downs. We barley hung out, when I would ask she always had an excuse. And when we did it was for an hour or two at a time and she’d always rush to leave. But my stubborn ass still stayed around. It even got to the point where she’d get me to buy her alcohol (since I have a fake Id)  and then not hangout with me after. So I finally got fed up with her not giving me a straight awnser, so I told her to tell me what she really felt. She told me she never had feelings for me, except at the beginning but I moved to fast and screwed it up. She said that one side of her wants too try but the other doesn’t want to lead me on. So I told her we can go on a date as friends and see what happens, she agreed and said it sounded like a good idea. So the week leading up to that date, was weird she was suddenly more involved in our conversations and giving me pretty big hints. She insisted I meet her mom, (but she blamed it on her mom wanting to meet me) she acted so nervous, but me and her mom hit it off great. So the night of the date came, and it was amazing. We played mini golf and were flirting the whole time through, and afterwards we went and parked my truck by the river. We had sone good conversations, when I asked for a kiss. That in term lead to a make out session. Then she asked me “would it be inappropriate for me to give you a blow job on the first date?” And then boom, oral sex. after we finished, we sat there and cuddled. And usually when we hang she watched the clock, but this time she kept delaying it more and more. (Saying stuff like “5 more minutes”) and then asked when she is meeting my mother. When I asked for a second date she said “duhhh”. Am I weird for thinking this is strange? It’s like her feelings up and changed? Don’t get me wrong I love it, i just don’t know what’s going on.",02Nov2020,1
3,"First off, I will call him Ray (that’s not his first name) but Ray is my biological father. I HATE him with a seething passion. Ray and my mom are still married and have been my whole life. He’s not abusive to anyone or anything like that, he’s just a horrible person. He is never wrong in his eyes and he’s has the foulest attitude of anyone I’ve ever met. He is extremely bipolar and the most self centered, hypocritical person you will ever come across.

I haven’t ever been particularly close with Ray, although he has tried to talk to me (nothing in common, only talks about his drone and rc racing and the military and all shit idgaf about)

He is a mechanic and I’ll admit, he is extremely good at what he does. The final straw for me was two months ago the engine in my suv died on me. I asked Ray if I bought a new one if he would do the engine swap. He said yes. I bought a new engine and my suv is STILL not complete. The engine is and hooked up, but for a month now he’s been “working on” something to do with the oil gauge or oil filter or something. Yet he doesn’t do it. When I ask he gets an attitude and gives me some shit he’s not gonna have the car drivable until he knows it’s good (which I get and appreciate) but it snowed today and winter is coming and the only other car I have is a sports car that I can’t drive in the winter.

For this reason (him taking so long and not caring or communicating) I hate him. It truly is the last straw. We have a family portrait in two weeks and I told my mom that I will NOT be there or to thanksgiving or Christmas if Ray is there. Everyone thinks I’m in the wrong but how can I be?",02Nov2020,1
4,"I'll try to keep this short - I went through 5 years of hell to get a degree while raising my kids on my own. It's a very difficult degree program to get in to and the job itself is very hard starting out. I got my degree, got an awesome job, and got a house. I've been on my own with my kids for 5 months now and I feel depressed and hopeless. I wonder if it's because I got so used to having to fight every single day in hopes of achieving this goal? I had to live with abusive family members to get this degree after an ugly divorce. I have what I've always wanted and I'm more miserable than ever. I get this very empty feeling like... ok what now? What's next? Is this my life now? Go to work, come home, make dinner, go to bed? What do I do to make sure my kids have a good life now? I'm at a loss. I thought I'd be thrilled to be out of the horrible situation I was in.",02Nov2020,1
5,"I think I'm just super discouraged because of the state of the world and how it's affected my education. I'm doing my college classes remotely this year and it's way harder to learn a new computer program when the scope of the professor's abilities and what material they have to teach has changed drastically. I also can't just stay after class for 5 minutes and ask them to show me how to fix what should be an easy problem. The zoom meeting ends and I have to learn how to use a program my computer isn't built to run all by myself, maybe with the help of an Indian guy on YouTube using an 8 year old version of the program. 

I just get so defeated and angry and can't push myself to keep going. Every time it crashes or I run into a new problem that I have no clue how to approach, I just want to rage quit.

7,"I don’t like to vent often to others. I used to, then I realised it didn’t mean anything to them anymore because I did it so often. 

Now I wonder what to do.
I don’t cry as often as I used to. Kind words from friends mean null..
Yet stranger’s words can instantly make me cry.
The thought of someone, somewhere in the world caring about me means so much more than a person I know.
It’s almost raw. A stranger can care, and you can probably take their word for it.
Yet for someone I know, it’s so much harder to believe.

Despite this, I still can’t help feeling so exhausted and lost. Keeping up a brave front isn’t helping me as much as I used to.
It distracted me, yes. It made me think I was okay.
Then I realised it didn’t stop me from thinking about dying.
It wasn’t as often as it used to be, before I started lying to myself. But that was because I really didn’t think anymore.
I can’t focus on things, I can’t think deeply. Imagining things is so difficult when before, I could reenact an entire movie in my head.

I don’t understand how it came to this, I don’t know if I should get out or not. If I stop, I’ll end up going back to the depressed state I was in last year.

And sometimes I really wonder where I'm going in life.
I don't have any goals, passions or hobbies I can fully invest in.
I've been living my days feeling some mediocre happiness. But it feels shallow because I know I don't feel that way. But if I dont feel happy, what do I feel? I'm not sure.

I've been pushing down my worries and negative emotions for a while. Whenever it pops up I try get rid of it in some way ASAP.
The disappointment of failiure is always there. Like dancing, I'm not improving. I cover it up with a ""I'll get better"" but I'm not sure I will.

I no longer have friends I'm close to. I use to. I'd drop everything to hang out with them, I never felt uncomfortable and time passed fast. Now it's gone. I don't have anyone I can talk to about things I like without being made fun of.
Going out with them feels like a chore, I always feel like it'll be pretty boring, which it usually is.

I feel so lost, like I'm drifting.
No good grades, No close friends.
No goals to aim for, no passions or hobbies that make me happy.
I don’t even have decent looks to rebound off of.

I know I'll have to wait to see what will happen to me. But I'm getting impatient. I want to know if my life is worth living.

9,"
My friend put my new jacket in her friends bag while we were shopping and I forgot to get it from her when she left. A hour later she said “I think one of you left your jacket in my bag”. We texted her saying it was mine and tried too coordinate getting it that same night but she said she was already out with friends. She told my friend she would be available today to give the jacket back but at nighttime cause she had plans. Well both me and my friend work at night tonight. 
I got the friends number and said: I can pick my jacket up Wednesday or Thursday from your place or if you are near my place (I like ten min from her) then you can drop it off and I gave her my address. She said “Hey! 
I’ll drop it off later today! So sorry bout that!” 

I told her I needed it before the weekend and if she was going to drop it off today that my bf would be home. 

She hasn’t responded to my last text for hours. Is my jacket a lost cause and should I ask her again when she is coming? She borrows my friends clothes often but my friend says she returns them.

To clarify I did not put my jacket in her bag. Our mutual friend did without me knowing",02Nov2020,1
10,"Around 4 years ago, I left school. My time there was a mess, I was with the wrong friendship group and ended up getting tormented, ridiculed and made to feel like the most insignificant person ever. 

I won’t go into too much detail but it left me feeling like I have to go above and beyond, and that there must have been something fundamentally wrong with me when in reality I was a victim.

I decided to cut them out around two years ago (but still bump into them every now and then) and I can’t help but feel that resentment towards them. I understand we were younger and dumber but what did I do to deserve the treatment I got? 

It makes me angry because while I wasn’t perfect myself, I’ve done a 180 and decided to get my shit together, got in shape, stopped taking drugs and started dating. This coincidentally happened when I cut them out, and they still partake in all of the above to this day. 

But it’s like every time I see them I turn into this school kid that couldn’t stand up for himself, even though our most recent interactions have been okayish, in that they haven’t said anything and actually seemed okay to be around, but I cannot shake the feeling off. 

The funny thing is, I would absolutely love that validation from them. I actually daydream (maladaptive daydreaming) about situations in which I look hard/cool/whatever in front of them, and when reflecting on it in later points I feel silly. Like my whole identity and self-esteem really is tied that much to what someone who I haven’t spoken to in about two years thinks of me. It’s crazy! 

I was getting therapy, and will be, but I’d like to hear any insight anyone can bring to this. How can I get to a point where it doesn’t bother me as much?",02Nov2020,1

I'm an extrovert too so it makes things so hard for me to be alone in general, I used to use vrchat as a way to hang out with people during the day but they updated it recently and my computer's no longer is able to run it.

28,"I am a 19F sophomore in college. I have had pretty good grades up until now. Last semester when the pandemic hit was a bit difficult for me. Since I have a pretty intense home life focusing on school got especially hard. I was able to pass all of my rather easy classes with A’s, but ended up failing a math class which I personally found especially difficult. I felt pretty bad about myself, but decided to put it behind me. Since then things are home got even worse. I got kicked out by my abusive mom about a week before this semester started. I had to figure out my housing situation rather quickly, and ended up using all of my savings to get an apartment with roommates. Since then I’ve been juggling school and working full time hours and haven’t had much time to even breathe. I already suffered from depression, and this situation has made things so much worse. I ended up retaking the math class I failed last semester, and it looks like I’m going to fail it again. I’m doing rather good in all of my other classes. Failing this class again is going to make me feel like the biggest failure and I just can’t shake feeling this way. I put school on a high pedestal because it feels like the only way out of this terrible phase in my life. I just feel like my regular life is already collapsing on top of me and if I fail this class and have to retake it, I’ll just feel like I literally can’t do anything right.

34,"Sorry if this title is a little confusing, but over the last couple of months I've been noticing more and more that I may have some kind of mental disorder, but these issues are so completely different that I have no idea what it all stems from. Here are some of the things I'm talking about:  
\-I have overthink, overanalyze, and overworry everything

\-If a teacher says check a paper, I'll check it 100 times. Same thing with quizzes, tests, etc- I check tests and quizzes 1000 times even though I prepared more than enough for said exam

\-I don't trust myself with anything. For example, I've been lifting for like 2 years now, and I still have to check that my hands/feet are in the right place even though I've been doing it for a while

\-I literally do not stop washing my hands when dealing with raw meat for fear that I may accidentally touch something and thus inadvertently poison myself or someone else

\-I wash my hands after throwing a tidepod in the washer because I associate a tidepod with bleach and bleach with death

\-In video games I get so so SO SO stressed out with choices and character creation. Like in trailers when RPGs are talking about their extensive character creation I'll be like Wow, cool but then when I get into the game, all the different options, presets, spells, whatever seem like they're all the best to me and I can never pick one. So, I'll play with one character for a little bit, while constantly stressing how I'm missing out on playing other characters; ie I cannot stick to one archetype and be content with that

\-I struggle to read for pleasure. I feel like if I don't absorb/ if I miss a single word I'll miss what the author is trying to say and ruin the book by missing the big point or whatever. I think this might stem from the fact that I dont think I can do anything solely for ""myself"". What I mean by this is that as soon as I open a book or go to read it, I'll immediately picture myself trying to talk about the book with someone after I've read it, I guess to give myself a purpose? I don't know what I even really mean here it's hard to pin down

\-I get really stressed in libraries. I'll see one section of books, for example fantasy and think Wow, I'll never be able to read all of these and be a ""master"" or whatever of all of them and then I get upset because then I feel I cannot identify as a ""fantasy"" reader or whatever because I'm missing out on a series. I cannot be happy with what I have, I need to understand/ be a master of ALL the subjects in that genre, or in the entire library

\-Everything takes top priority in my head, I cannot do things in moderation, only extremes. For example, when I'm taking notes in class, everything seems important; I am all ready formulating test/quiz questions in my head as I take notes 

\-I imagine myself through the lens of other people. For example, if I am doing something I feel slightly unconfident about (which is everything) I'll imagine someone laughing about it and making fun of me

\-If I start to trust myself (which is rare) and make one little mistake, I take 1000 steps back and keep checking and checking because I'll convince myself that I would have caught that mistake that brought me from a 100 to a 98 if I had checked harder. For example, if by some miracle I'm taking a math test and dont overcheck one problem, and then I get the problem back and the teacher goes ""that was a careless error"" or whatever then I will literally double my effors to check everything

\-I have no confidence in things that I've done over and over again and doubt myself constantly

\-I'll check and recheck that I've turned in HW (online)

\-If I'm exposed to anything, I want to instantly be a master at it and stress out that I'm not

\-I was at this blacksmithing the other day as a noob, and all these kids my age were so involved and interested in it and content with being interseted in it, ie they were content in their purpose while I just felt so purposeless. They knew what they wanted to do and were happy doing it, while I could never do that

&amp;#x200B;

I'm all ready getting anxious that I forgot to put something I'm anxious about in this post lol. I've talked to my school counselor about this (I just told him I feel anxious), but I have no idea how to put this all into words to somebody. I feel like my brain is just so wiredly fucked up that I won't be able to fix the millions upon billions of things that stress me out. Anyways, thanks for reading and responding

We are now both back in the same state, and have been hanging out like nothing ever happened, I just don't know how to open up to her that I still love her.

She was my first and last girlfriend and honestly I haven't met any other girl that has made me feel the way she made me feel.

38,"A few of my friends keep saying I should. I've never been officially diagnosed with depression but I've taken several tests and surveys and they always have said I have depression. And I'm pretty sure that i do. I've never really considered it a big issue tho, I've always said if i have depression it's not severe or anything so therefore it's not worth doing anything about. But sometimes the stress, self hatred, and just all the negativity I feel on a daily basis starts to feel overwhelming and i have some kind of an emotional breakdown. There have been times I've thought about killing myself, but I've hardly ever seriously thought I would do it. Oftentimes I would just think about it like ""what if I did commit suicide today tho?"" There was one time tho where I did feel like I was going to tho, I was extremely upset and on the verge of having some kind of a breakdown and in that moment I thought ""as soon as I can, I'm gonna try to hang myself"" but as soon as the opportunity came, it was hours later and the feeling had left(altho there was still a small part of me that felt...disappointed that I no longer felt so strongly about it). If I had been able to kill myself in that moment, would I have? I really dont know. I'm not sure if I wouldve or not. But that was one time. One time that I thought I might actually commit suicide. That was the only time I seriously thought I would. Other than that, I feel more just a lot of self loathing, insecurity, deep feelings of sadness and just a general dislike and hatred of my life. Like I said, I dont think I have to see a counselor or anything, it doesnt seem like that big of a problem to me, but what do u all think?

Edit: some more info I forgot: my biggest reason against therapist or counselors is that I dont like talking to people I dont trust

41,"7 years ago my grandma died. My aunt lived with her and my mum and siblings and I moved in to keep my aunt company. This house was my mum and her sisters childhood home. They went through so much in the house including a lot of violence due to both soldiers and their dad. 

I’m asking this because all my life my mum has dreamt of living in a country house away from the city and the only thing that stopped her was her kids and the fact the country was so far away from the city and her sisters. Today though her youngest child (me) turned 18 and we went on a short trip to a cabin for the weekend. The cabin was 40 minutes away from our city and it was next to both a village and a small town with a supermarket. The cabin itself was in the country though. My mum fell in love with the place and immediately said she wants to live her. 

Going back, before we moved into my grandmas home we lived in another house that we still own and my dad pays the bills for her (though it’s under my mums name, he jsut lives there.) My mum was working on plans to get the house renovated to fit in apartments (the area and type of house so very popular for renting out and there are a lot of landlords with the house that make a shit ton of money.) 

But now, she asked me and my sister for advice. She said she feels like renovating and renting the house out is her way of procrastinating buying a country house. She wants the house asap and asked us if we’d be ok if she sold our home or the old house. She says she’s conflicted on selling our current home because my grandma loved the house to pieces and she’d to go against her after death. She also knows that the dead should hold her back and that her grandma would have loved a country home. She’s deciding between selling our current home or selling the old house. 

I gave her my thoughts on that as best I could but I’m wondering that if she does go through with it what is some way I can help her deal with it? To deal with the thought you betrayed your mother. I don’t want her to go through that when she goes through so much already. She’s badly depressed and sad all the time these days and this is the first thing that I’ve seen her excited about and I want her to be happy more than anything but I also don’t want her to have regrets.

So about 4 months ago I (18 m) met this girl (18f) , and I fell in love so to say. I got the spark and butterflies etc etc. and we hit it off pretty good, but then I told her my feelings one night while I was drunk, and it was too prematurely. And that was too fast for her, so she quit talking to me. She then started talking to me again 2 weeks later after I reached back out to her in a flattering way, which she considered really romantic and we started talking again. Ever since then it’s been ups and downs. We barley hung out, when I would ask she always had an excuse. And when we did it was for an hour or two at a time and she’d always rush to leave. But my stubborn ass still stayed around. It even got to the point where she’d get me to buy her alcohol (since I have a fake Id)  and then not hangout with me after. So I finally got fed up with her not giving me a straight awnser, so I told her to tell me what she really felt. She told me she never had feelings for me, except at the beginning but I moved to fast and screwed it up. She said that one side of her wants too try but the other doesn’t want to lead me on. So I told her we can go on a date as friends and see what happens, she agreed and said it sounded like a good idea. So the week leading up to that date, was weird she was suddenly more involved in our conversations and giving me pretty big hints. She insisted I meet her mom, (but she blamed it on her mom wanting to meet me) she acted so nervous, but me and her mom hit it off great. So the night of the date came, and it was amazing. We played mini golf and were flirting the whole time through, and afterwards we went and parked my truck by the river. We had sone good conversations, when I asked for a kiss. That in term lead to a make out session. Then she asked me “would it be inappropriate for me to give you a blow job on the first date?” And then boom, oral sex. after we finished, we sat there and cuddled. And usually when we hang she watched the clock, but this time she kept delaying it more and more. (Saying stuff like “5 more minutes”) and then asked when she is meeting my mother. When I asked for a second date she said “duhhh”. Am I weird for thinking this is strange? It’s like her feelings up and changed?

49,"TL; DR— My room mate is breaking the lease and moving out with less than a months notice, leaving me with 6-7 months left on the lease, and I have no way to pay her half of the rent. 

I have a 7yo child, 2 large dogs, and an eviction from 5 years ago that happened while I was going through an awful divorce from my abusive, drug addict ex- husband. My room mate and I both have bad credit. This is relevant info so that you understand that it’s extremely hard for me to find and afford a safe place for me and my child to live with 2 large dogs, bad credit, and an eviction on my record.

After months of planning and searching, we finally found a private landlord willing to rent to us.
We moved in July and it’s been great. My room mate has the master suite (she has has own bathroom connected to her room). My daughter and I each have our own bedroom, and we share a bathroom in the hallway. I pay $900/ mo. and she pays $700/ mo. 
About a week ago my room mate totally blindsided me and told me she is moving out and back home to Upstate NY because she is really struggling with her mental health and she has some family issues going on at home. She first said that she will be leaving the week of thanksgiving, and that she will pay November and December rent. Then, a couple days ago she said she’s actually going to leave sometime in the next 2 weeks. I’m assuming this means she is not going to want to pay December rent like she said previously. 
If she pays November and December rent she’d still be leaving me on the hook for over $5000 in rent and utilities that she was supposed to be responsible for during the remainder of the lease. 
I have no other friends who could feasibly move in with me to take over her part of the rent. I can’t just go on Craigslist and find a random room mate because I have a child and it’s a small house...it’s not a situation where we could comfortably live with someone we don’t know. 
My mom just sold her condo and has a little bit of money from it and offered to pay my room mates half of the bills until the end of the lease. She’s a saint. I’m 30 years old and my mom has already helped me *WAY* more than she should have ever had to. 

Other info: 
—room mates dad is not super wealthy but definitely more than comfortable (*way* more so than my mom, who lives paycheck to paycheck and only has the ability to help me because she just sold her condo). I say this because I think if I threatened to sue her, he might cough up some money
—our lease has a “jointly and severally liable” clause, meaning that the full rent has to be paid even if one room mate skips out
—I have documentation (text messages) between room mate and I where we agree that she will pay $700/ mo and I will pay $900/ mo. So if I needed to show documentation in court, I could. 

Should I: 
- Let my mom pay my room mates half of the rent and bills 
- Tell my room mate that she can either come up with $5000 to pay that she’s responsible for on the lease, or that I will take her to court for the money— hope that her dad will cough up some money to cover her

I (18NB) have been in a relationship with my partner (17M), and honestly I've been starting to regret it. I rushed into the relationship only 4 months after being brutally broken up with by my ex, and if I'm being honest I don't think we're right for each other - our life goals are just too different, and this has been the source of many a discussion... he wants to stay in the general area we're from, and I want to move far away (I'm moving away for college); he wants to start a family, I most certainly don't. He's also very emotionally distant, which for as somebody as desperate for romantic contact as me, is many different kinds of painful.

Now, I can already hear the choir screaming ""*end the damn relationship*"", and of course I've very heavily considered that, but he honestly intimidates me to no end. He's known by his friends to be spiteful and sneaky (I didn't know this until I even met his friends a month into the relationship; red flag?), and knowing that he has my nudes as well as all of my friends' contacts, I don't know how that might play out.

My friend is wonderful, we’ve really been good friends for a while. I have had romantic feeling  for her that come and go, but the friendship is really much more important to me. She has a partner and I only wish them the best. She has kept me sane through this entire pandemic because she’s the only person I’ve spent time together with during the pandemic. Before the pandemic I was making an effort to date, but was bummed because a relationship ended and then the pandemic hit. 

This past week (I see her too much 2-3 times a week) we spent some time together and things weren’t flowing as easily as usual, maybe I was just tired, maybe she was tired, maybe we’ve hit a wall in our friendship. That’s my fear that we have no more steam to keep the friendship going. That’s what worries me, is that we’re both losing interest in spending time together. 

She still wants to do stuff together, and has suggested several things. I’ll admit that she puts in as much effort as I do. All in all it’s a confusing friendship because she was/is polyamorous. I was always confused because whenever she got together with all her partners, I was included. She had many other platonic friends but they were never there. I’m sure I screwed up things the times when she invited me in for coffee at 2 AM several times. I was stupid and thought because she’s so confident that she would’ve said something to me. 

I’m always confused but she means a lot to me as a person. I may just be feeling lost right now because it feels like the world is going to crap and I had a touch of seasonal affective disorder.

     My Dad(53), my younger sister 'K'(15), and I(19) are trying to lose weight together during this pandemic. My family has history of diabetes and well, my dad, my sister, and I are morbidly obese. My Mom on the other hand has a history of bulimia that she still has yet to overcome and is still in denial about. Her bulimia had an affect on us kids when were small children mainly K. K used to used to try to imitate my Mom while she was in kindergarten and would stick her fingers in her throat during snack time.
    
     We were on a low carb diet together for the past couple of weeks. However I overheard my dad telling K he wanted to try intermittent fasting with her and then try fasting to lose weight. Now my family as whole doesn't have a healthy relationship with food and I have concerns about teaching my 15 yr old sister how to fast when she is young and was so vulnerable to the habits of my mother in her early life. I worry this may have adverse effects on her when she finally loses the weight. Like what if she eventually becomes anorexic or develops bulimia like my Mom? What if after losing weight like that so fast she can't maintain and gains it all back? 

     I have only done some light research on weight loss fasting and I'm not really convinced that this is something K should be doing. My father has dabbled in fasting in the past and has tried to get me in on it but I refused. I believe that there is no healthy in mind or body way to short cut in losing weight. If we're consistent in what we're doing now and exercising we will lose weight. I have yet bring up my concerns to my dad.

Later when I’ve gone to their apartment and my significant other has ignored his roommate out of not liking him for mentioned reasoning my friend has instead of thinking this was justified said my significant other was being childish and needed to stop.

Now presently my friend’s friend posted something on social media saying “people who say people shouldn’t go out to bars right now are just mad they didn’t get an invite”. I privately messaged her saying that was a b*tchy thing to say and some people, like my significant other have suppressed immune systems and don’t want to risk getting COVID. This person then blocked me and I texted them asking why and they cussed me out saying I was judgmental and told me “I’m not talking to you about this I am at work, sorry my daddy doesn’t pay for all my things and I have to work for my money”. (Context my father is paying for half of my tuition). I reached out to my friend asking them to have my back and maybe say something to their friend defending me. My friend then told me it was two sided because I texted their friend first and that they would not be in this.

Hope that made sense. Really looking to see if I am over reacting by considering cutting them off. I just feel hurt that they never have my back.",02Nov2020,1
61,"So for context, I’ve been talking to this guy for about 4 or 5 months now, and he is actually basically my best friends’ little brother which is how I know him. We actually have feelings for each other, but he’s 15 (turning 16 next month), and I’m 18, so I don’t know if that’s inappropriate. Also, there’s the fact that my family is way too overprotective of me, so my dad is against anything happening. His mom and my best friends also don’t think it’s a good idea in case anything happens (though I get along very well with his whole family). I also feel like real-life interaction with him very awkward because we’re so used to just calling and texting. I know we could probably push past this if we saw each other enough, but I can’t see him too much without my dad freaking out, and I really don’t like having to hear all about his drama for days. It just feels like everything is going against the relationship, but I really like him, and I don’t want him out of my life.",02Nov2020,1
62,"For context, I’m a 20 year old guy and i feel like this year (especially the last few months) I have felt more and more stressed, usually coming in very spontaneous bursts that I don’t deal with very well. I tend to worry about a lot of things too regardless of impact, and regardless of how seemingly big or small the problems is. This week alone I accidentally dragged my coat into some paint at my friends house and the situation made me feel so stressed that I ended up crying to my friend in the bathroom and going off over everything bothering me recently.

Yesterday I went out with a bunch of my really close friends to a bar. I’m not a very heavy drinker and I usually just stick to beer or cider but my friends wanted me to try something new and enjoy myself (which I am thankful for) but then I ended up having too much, ended up drunk, threw up several times, and had a complete outburst at the pub with everyone there and having to walk out of the pub to calm myself down. 

Even small situations like spending £5 on something will stress me out as my income is very low at the moment, which isn’t helped because I can’t find a new job cause of covid which is also stressing me out. My friends will do one small thing that annoys me and I find it very hard not to lash out or get annoyed by it, and I don’t deal with stress well at all. It’s just been a very stressful year for me with relatively small reason as to why. 

To finish this story off, how should I deal with stress? Is there any chance I have some sort of mental health condition as I’ve been feeling like this for a while now. I just seem to worry and stress about so many things big or small that it’s actually starting to bother me.",02Nov2020,1

64,"I'm pretty desperate. If the right people saw this idea, I have no doubt it would take off.

Here's the app description and a link to the petition:

Helping Hands is a charity app that would allow users to donate 5, 10, or 20 dollars a month to a common fund. Users would then debate and vote each month to decide which three charity organizations get the funds for the month. Basically, the philosophy of this app is that it is better to take a bunch of small donations and concentrate them into a few charities than to scatter them among all charities.

This app will create an involved community focused on helping people. It is direct democracy in action where everyone has an equal voice in deciding the winners.

69,"Within the last couple of months, my best friend \[M 18\] and I \[M 19\] have constantly floated around the idea of doing a dorm-style in his room.

Since Covid-19 lockdowns began, I can barely see my friends, especially with college/work preoccupying everyone's time and taking precautions. Fair enough to my parents though, they are worried about catching the virus, especially considering how unpredictable and dangerous it is. We take precautions like cleaning off our groceries with bleach water (anything that can be left out, we leave out for a day or so) and limiting how much we bring people into our home (even for repairs). As a result of the lockdowns/pandemic, I missed out on a lot I was looking forward to and have really missed seeing other people besides my parents. Like everyone else, it has caused me to be pretty sad (I wouldn't call it depression, but it's been the worst it's been ever), much harder to get up out of bed, lonely nights, etc. Not to mention, my parents constantly and I run into issues often. It's almost every month we have had a rather heated argument over something.

Recently though, my friend said that his parents have been more and more open to it. With the growing possibility that I could move in with them for a while, I have actually been considering doing it.

The problem is the reaction my parents may have (considering they pay for my college tuition, which is $1,000 a semester). While I am 19, legally, I can do anything I want. I have about 2,000 grand I can contribute to my friend's family so I am not freeloading off them. I have also known this friend and his family since 6th grade. Either of us almost never crosses a line (once or twice in the past few years). Additionally, I have a job I can go back to at any point I want if I need it.

The last concern I have though is leaving my small dog. I'm worried he may pass away, considering he is ten years old with a seizure disorder (he has seizures every few days).

If I were to go through with this, it would be around January that I would move in. That way, I don't leave my folks alone for the holidays. From what I know about my parents, they won't want me in the house, so there is no possibility of them getting sick. But they would be open to masks and distancing outside so long as they feel as I am taking precautions too. Considering how long this pandemic is estimated to be, I don't want to be away from my parents and dog for over a year (since the estimated end of social distancing is till the beginning of 2022). At the same time, I would be happier than I am now if I lived with him. He cares a lot about my well-being, and I feel like we could have a lot of fun together. Obviously, we would make a bunch of rules and make sure both of us could have some alone time. Both of us are extraverts, so we have the same tolerance for being with other people. I would also talk to his parents about what they would need out of me for me to stay there.

If you have any questions, I'll make sure to look out for them in the comments.

I would love to hear other people's opinions on this! Thanks guys!",02Nov2020,1
71,"I used to be a normal weight 2 years ago but I forcibly stopped eating breakfast and lunch and ate dinner because obviously my parents made it. I would get really hungry yet try not to eat anything. But then I slowly stopped after awhile and right now I am 101 lbs and 5' 10 (male).

My friends make jokes about me being stick and my mum says I'm the skinniest person she knows and is worried about me but I don't feel  skinny or boney I feel like I'm at a healthy. About a month ago my mum says to me after a trip to doctors (for vitamin d deficiency) that the doctor also said he was worried about my weight and said I had to put some on. So she made me eat a bit more (not strict).

But i think I have gained a tiny because I put on one of my shirts and it felt a bit tighter. And the first thing i felt was that I was fat and started pinching self and went to the bathroom to look at my body and started feeling nervous / sick even though I am underweight I felt I should lose weight.

I called a nurse helpline and felt so anxious telling her what I was experiencing because I didn’t know if my symptoms were valid or I’m just wasting her time.

I’m going to an urgent care tomorrow to see a physician. And potentially get tested if that’s what the doctor deems necessary.

Any advice for how I can describe what I am physically feeling to the doctor? I’m worried my ptsd from emotional abuse will keep me from seeking/receiving help.

My ideas so far are to write down each symptom as I feel it so I don’t forget and doubt myself that it ever happened.

77,"So I (22F) live with my grandparents who rent out an extra room to this girl (23) who I’ve become friends with. She began saying she would want to move out with me whenever the time comes, and I’ve been genuinely trying to save up to move out. I didn’t have credit so I started building that, got a better paying full time job, and have a goal of moving out within 6 months when I have enough money. However, she has very bad credit, I believe in the 500 range, and she doesn’t seem to be trying to fix that at all. She works at a dispensary and makes twice as much money as me but spends it so quickly and has only saved $1500 within 2 years of working there. She makes about $4000 a month so obviously she doesn’t have great budgeting habits. She also doesn’t get pay stubs because the clinic she works at is an illegal shop, and when I ask her to ask her coworkers how they go around that, she never did. It’s just really frustrating feeling like I’m the only one actively trying while she just spends excessively and doesn’t care about getting things in order. She also has a pretty bad attitude sometimes over the smallest things. She can be very lazy and irresponsible. For example, she got a fish about 4 months ago and has cleaned it once, but only because I had to help her. She also has a dog that she hardly cares for that she basically handed off to my grandparents. And she doesn’t ever cook, it’s constant eating out and then throwing away half her meal of leftovers. I’m not sure if we would be good roommates but I don’t know how to get that across to her without completely upsetting her. I feel like I would end up doing all the hard work to get the apartment together while she just sits back and pays for her part instead of actively helping me.

79,"
so yeah, this is something i need to get off my chest. i don’t want to discuss this with my girlfriend, because she is truly an incredible person who would probably be insulted that i feel this way - she doesn’t deserve it.

we are both 20. i’ve known her since i was 14, and while we had a crush on each other all through high school - she ended up leaving the school and becoming anonymous for 2 years.

recently, something absolutely tragic happened to her. something i won’t discuss here, but something that caused her to do everything she could to come back into contact with me - as she felt i am the only person she has ever truly fallen for and can trust.

i can be a pretty pessimistic person. this has affected my love life to some extent - in the sense of i find it hard to believe true love - or even genuine people - is an absolute rarity today. i have been through a couple things in life that lead me to that mindset. 
this woman, she is literally that. incredible, wholesome and genuine. 
appearance wise, she is objectively a 10. which is perhaps the beginning of my issue, she can do so much better than me with regards to appearance - it just feels too good to be true.

i can’t shake this feeling that one day, she will get bored of me, or someone else will come along and slip his number (which has happened probably 100 times) and she will fall for him or something dumb like that.

i somewhat feel i don’t deserve, or it’s not real for good things to last forever. i have never cared for someone so deeply, nor have i ever found someone that truly gives me hope in people - but i also cannot shake the feeling that it will end because that’s just what good things do.

81,"Parties upon parties, this has been my life since I was 17 years old. I live what many teens/young adults would love, a life in which there is no worry. You don't even have to think about money. Bills are non existent. I'm privileged I acknowledge that. There comes a point when you get sick and tired of hosting parties, it becomes sickening, drinking everyday becomes disgusting, the noise is unbearable and it's not at all fun anymore.

It's a weird topic I know. I tried talking to some of my buddies and they told me I'm delusional and to stop joking but I'm dead serious. I was thinking what life could be. I feel empty. I know today if I stopped with the free parties and all the free goodies then all my fake B and A lister celeb friends would just dissappear. I've been thinking and I don't think I have any actual friends. I don't have any genuine friends, I just have people that hang around for materialistic purposes. 

If I stopped with the parties then how would I get funding? How would I accomplish my job as a socialite? I want to get close to God. I want to be a scholar. I want to feel fulfilled and I want to not fear death. I want to live knowing that I'm not a sinner. I want to change but where do I start? How?

So the simple answer is go to the police. They won't go to the police however as the thing they are being harassed about is their relationship.

102,"My boyfriend and I moved into my stepmom’s rental in July because I got a pay cut and my boyfriend was unemployed. From our understanding, stepmom was doing us a favor during tough times, and we thought we’d only be here for a few months to get back on our feet. 

Thing is, once we got here, we realized that she wasn’t flexible on the rent and she asked us to sign a lease (which she didn’t tell us about before our move, and so we were forced to sign it because we had nowhere else to go and just spent $3000 on our move). We also are roommates with her son (20M) whom I don’t really get along with. Essentially, she’s contractually stuck all her kids under one roof and charged us $2400 altogether. 

I’ve been sticking it out for four months fairly miserably. My stepbrother is not an easy person to know. He’s openly racist and relies on fake news sites as real news. He’s always in the living room watching trash tv, so I never leave my room. I’m burning through my savings because I can’t afford rent, utilities, car payments, and bills. I have cried seemingly every day since weeks after we got here. 

There’s always some kind of ridiculous drama here because it’s my stepmom and her son. I know we’re “related,” but I don’t know them SUPER well. Like, the other day, the landlord (my stepmom) dropped off a feral kitten for her son to take care of. Nobody asked me and my BF if this was okay, especially because we already have two cats here. I complained about the cat and stepmom shrugged me off and said “well GEE, nice to see you too!” This new cat is feral, hasn’t been to the vet, isn’t socialized, and may have fleas. Now my cats are holed up in my room too. 

Then suddenly the bad news seemed to go away. My BF got a job after 15 months of unemployment. I couldn’t believe it. We were ecstatic. Immediately he and I began talking about moving to our OWN place in a cheaper area. Suddenly it felt like good was happening.

Issue is we signed a lease. I’ve talked to my dad privately about our decision. He said the stepmom will not take this well and will be upset if we break the lease since being a property manager is her main source of income and I’ll seem ungrateful because she’s “giving us such a great deal”. The lease says we can find new tenants in our place (subletting), but I fear this will be the hardest part of our journey. I live outside of NYC but I can’t imagine finding people who would pay $1600 for a shared 2-bedroom house. And like I said, my stepbrother is very difficult to get along with, and he has a feral cat that’s currently taking up the spare room. 

If I can’t find new tenants, I don’t know what I’ll do. We can’t leave then. Staying here has taken a serious toll on my mental health that I can hardly focus on work anymore. I never see the sun anymore. I lay in bed all day. Im running out of money bc the rent is WAY more than I can afford. I can’t even afford to break the lease. I just...can’t wait until next July. I’m scared of what this depression will do to me. 

I need to figure out how to talk to stepmom about this situation...without offending her son’s character. Bringing him up as an issue in any way will only make things worse, especially since she’ll tell him everything we say, and we’re the ones who have to live with him. I need to try to focus on how I understand we have a lease, but is there anything she can do...? She’ll say no, but I’m bleeding money, and it’s not viable anymore. She’s a pretty strict woman with many an ounce of compassion, so I know emotions won’t work on her. She’s going to treat this as a business deal that I’m breaking. I’m going to owe $$$ for leaving, even though it’s clearly not a business deal, because she shows up whenever she wants and gave us a goddamn feral cat to keep without her tenants’ permission. Leaving without new tenants will put a strain in our relationship and I’ll have to kiss goodbye spending holidays with my family. 

But I can’t do this anymore. I just need out.",02Nov2020,1
103,"Basically Ive been talking online to someone for a bit more than a year, just to have someone to talk to and vent I guess. It always annoys me so much not being able to interact face to face. Im already quite awful at interacting with people and not being able to tell how someone is feeling by looking at their behaviour makes me feel very confused at times, which is what happened now.

Usually we message and reply in a couple days, but sometimes she will not reply for weeks, and Ill be asking if everything is ok and in some weeks she'll just say like ""hey sorry, yeah Im fine wby"" , which is what happened this time. And I dont know what to make out of it, like is she so busy she cant take a couple minutes to write, just tired or maybe bored of me? I don't know, the fact that she just answered so briefly after weeks where I was wondering what is happening puts me off a little bit...

So in these cases I don't know what I should do. Other times she sent longer replies and was just like apologetic and said she had been busy etc. Which is completely fine and maybe I should overthink it, usually I just say that its alright and move on, but I always have that doubt that maybe there is something Im not getting or that I should do, and more this time when she answers so briefly. I feel like if I ask or talk about how I feel about it it will make things awkward and I don't wanna be pushy, because I think Im already a bit pushy at times with her.

I don't know, maybe the relationship is losing strenght after all this time or maybe she doesnt feel like talking, which is fine, but how am I supposed to know without being there in person (besides straight up asking which Id rather not do, because Ive done it sometimes and was way off so it was very weird)
I dont have much experience with online relationships and I dont know what I should expect or how to handle it or make it more interesting for both or if its worth it at all. Any help will be highly appreciated",02Nov2020,1

110,"Topic in the title.

Currently I am starting my 5th Semester at University in a Bachelors degree for physics. Since the start of my academical endeavours I always had a strong urge to compare myself to fellow students in terms of performance in the field and how far they've come already as in which modules they already finished and got the credits for etc.

During 2nd Semester I failed an important module 2 times and I had to retry the exam for a third (and last possible) attempt, only caveat I would have to wait one year for the final attempt until the module is offered again because you can only take an exam 2 times in one yearly rotation. A couple months ago I gave it my third and last attempt and passed with flying colors, which I was very happy about. However during the year leading up to that final ""day of decision"" if you want to call it that, I didn't get into many other big modules for my bachelors since I wanted to properly retake the yearly module I was going to be tested for for the 3rd time (frankly I failed it the first time because I was focused on too many things at once and it got left by the wayside).

Since that problem is out of the way, I am now currently in the position that I am at 82,5/180 points I need for the bachelors degree in total. It took me 4 semesters to get this far, while the regular time for this degree is 6 semesters (an expansion until up to 10 semesters is permitted though while taking 8 semesters is quite likely for many, so I am not yet at a dead-end halfway point).

I see many of my fellow students who are a lot harder on themselves in terms of what they want to accomplish each semester, they enroll in more modules at once and try to run through the bachelors degree ASAP not spending any unnecessary time. Some of them are aiming to do two very difficult modules in one semester which are meant to be done in a one-per-semester fashion. I just feel peer pressured into doing the same even if I know there is a good chance it will be too much for me to do at once. The thought of the people I got to know and always study with being done earlier than me while I still have stuff to do they already got done simply doesn't sit right with me.

&amp;#x200B;

So here is my pledge for advice: How do I get myself out of this negative headspace? In a objective way of thinking it appears unreasonable to try and speedrun the thing like my fellow students do. I am only 20, my brother is doing his masters at the age of 25 in another natural sciences field; if I applied the same speed as my friends I would be already done at 23 with my master. My brother tells me there is nothing to worry about, however I still perceive my actions as making a mistake by giving myself the amount of time I feel like I need. Any advice ?",02Nov2020,1

112,"I am a heterosexual female and I was at a Halloween party last night. There was a flamboyant gay man there that I knew previously. He’s a very funny man and is the life of every party! 

Anyway, yesterday he told a group of us that he made several gay porn videos years ago and I asked him for his stage name and told him that I would like to look him up online when I was home later. Everyone started laughing and saying I was nuts and weird for wanting to look that up. We all laughed but I tried to explain that I was not really interested in watching the video for sexual reasons but I just thought it might be interesting to see how he looked in the video. ..kind of like a morbid curiosity to see someone i know on video like that I guess...lol. To me it’s similar to knowing a minor celebrity I guess. Anyway. I really thought this was a natural reaction to what he was telling us but everyone’s reaction suggested otherwise.

Do you think my interest in seeing how he looked in the videos was weird? Or do you think it’s a normal reaction? Thanks",02Nov2020,1
113,"In 2 weeks i turn 20, and 2020 is about to get much worse for me.

So to give you some perspective of my current situation, I lost my main source of income in July, and i have since been looking for a new job.  The previous job was an apprenticeship where I earned just under £5 per hour whilst working 40 hour weeks.  I still have my second source of income delivering dominos which I earn anywhere from £300-400 per month working 6 evenings a week.  My hours fluctuate due to demand so this is not a reliable source of income.  This barely covers my bills, so as a result, I signed up for universal credit where I currently qualify for £50-100 per month extra depending on how much I earn.

Now onto my current issue.  The relationship between me and my parents is flakey at best.  Since lockdown began there have been regular arguments weekly if not daily, tonight was the last straw.  I tried to have a discussion with my parents regarding the times they were allowing me to be awake, as I was screamed at for trying to expand my programming skills at 12am (apparently its not acceptable if im not getting up early morning and going to sleep before midnight)

Both my parents had been drinking for a few hours and I tried to have a calm conversation about being forced to follow a strict sleeping schedule, however i was quickly met with screaming, shouting and verbal abuse, all whilst trying to talk quietly and being reasonable.  This went on for 30 minutes to the point my mum went into my room and started ripping out cables from my pc, and then later burst into the bathroom when I was naked trying to have a shower.  So now the situation is at breaking point and I want out.  I have no savings as a result of being out of work and I am now entering my arranged overdraft so i have no idea how I'm going to escape this.

Regarding financial support from my parent's, there is none.  I was paying them rent whilst also being treated like a child up until the point I lost my apprenticeship and I am unable to afford university to get a degree as my parent's earn over the maximum threshold for student loans, meaning the loan will not cover the cost of accommodation.

At this point, I dont really know what to do as I have agreed to move out by the end of this month, but I can't afford to rent a place as I have such a limited income and I have not got past the interview stage of any of my 100+ job applications over the last few months.  Selling my car is not an option as without it, I am unable to work at dominos.  And quite frankly, i have lost all motivation and hope for my life.",02Nov2020,1

115,"I’ve had this on my mind for a while but I don’t have friends to speak to or an outlet to have conversations with others/go out (due to covid, etc). And I’ve wanted to get someone’s opinion without them thinking I’m a full psychopath. When I say I feel as if I’m emotionally numb I think I mean to my own life completely. Situations that happen to others I can sympathize and empathize with, so I know I’m not heartless or crazy. Just that when something happens to me, I don’t exactly care? I may stress over it or cry, but those situations happened before COVID when I was worried with school/work/money. Which I no longer stress about because of the virus (no school, no work, money situation is okay). Which was around 8 months ago. Now, I don’t do anything because I don’t have friends to do things with or situations that would make me go outside. I know some may say (get a hobby! Go for a walk! Make some friends!), but it’s not easy to do so especially during these times. I feel like every day completely blends together, time is going very fast where as they use to drag on. I’m rambling, but I’m just concerned because I don’t really have emotions I’m just there in a sense. I don’t really have thought or stresses about things because there aren’t significant others or ‘best friends’ that may cause that. Im worried that when this virus clears up if I’ll ever go back to normal? If that makes sense. It’s not depression (not severe depression maybe?) because I don’t want to die and I don’t get necessarily sad or cry.

116,"Hi,

I’m a first timer here and need somewhere healthy to vent. I am 21 dating my partner (we are both women she/her) who is 27. We live together and have for almost a year. She is a joy and I think/hope she feels the same with me. Long story short, things are well, steady, and healthy. I’m thankful and grateful especially with the times we live in now and never take that and our health for granted. Anyway, we have a friend who was originally hers but now I am a good friend with him too. He is 22, lives at home with his parents, and he comes around A LOT. We have all hung since back in summer and we all got pretty close. He’d stay the night sometimes twice in a row some weeks. Leaving in the morning and coming back later. That was nice because things were better in summer financially, free time wise, and we all smoked a lot of weed together. That is kinda the main thing we do actually. 
In the past month my partner and I (scheduled and not compulsively) got another puppy. We got one in March as well and we just were ready for another in July. We are those people, dog people, yes. But things financially have got worse with the government and expenses are more tight so we are really watching spending on all our food/ratio/save. Another dog = another baby = another mouth to feed (happily, always) but you get it. On top of that we aren’t spending the money on weed and I have completely cut it out to go back into the health field because we need the money and I miss working (even though I’m scared shitless about COVID). We have to make ends mean and I hope even better than that, we can get back on our feet. 
So this is where we get to it:

Our friend (M 22 from above) recently crashed his car along with a lot of other shitty things that seem to be following kind of a shitty spiral/time for him (product of his own actions) he has been using a family members car and because of this, he can’t smoke in the vehicle. So he has in response been coming over and sitting on our front porch on the swing to smoke. It didn’t bother us and first, we even said “sure! Of course” thinking it wouldn’t be bothersome or even a lot. We were wrong. It happens everyday. Morning and night, at the times we are getting up to make breakfast and take the dogs out till the time we are making dinner, taking the dogs out, and should be headed to bed. It’s throwing our alone time together off, it’s upsetting the dogs when he just sits outside and they are crate training alone, it’s causing our schedules to be thrown off, we are smoking weed more than we want because it’s around, and it’s not like when he shows up and we’re home we aren’t going to invite him it (it’s cold outside where we live currently and only getting colder) and that comes with the meals we make too. If he’s inside and we are cooking we aren’t going to deny him a meal or not offer. I just wasn’t raised that way and it feels uncomfortable.

It was cool in summer. Even nice and I liked those days but those aren’t these days and things are on the line to make bills. He can’t come over and eat. It’s not that I wouldn’t love to feed him it’s just we need those leftovers BAD. We are struggling to make sure we have stuff because we need to make sure the dogs eat too. He knows we are struggling and cutting back, it’s our main topic but he is at a very self involved place in life and his parents put a roof over his head, pay for the car/repairs, phone, groceries, etc. I know he receives some unemployment but he lives with his parents. 

I am asking now because the same situation as above just happened. It’s 6pm and we come home from the grocery and he is sitting on the porch. We offer him to come in and we begin to let the dogs out, cook and get the evening process going. He ate, we smoked, watched a show together (another thing is we feel we have to entertain him as well or he kinda just panders/stand around in the living room while we are doing our schedule), and we told him we had to leave at 8 to go pick up our nephew and take him home from work (we do this every Sunday for my sister in law and to see our sweet nephew, he’s a joy). 8pm rolls around he’s had more helpings of the food than either of us and he is in no rush to leave but we are. We pretty much are trying to get out the door when he says “I’m just going to smoke some more” indicating he’s was going to sit on the porch. The dogs are now in the crates, they are puppies, not happy with their mommies who are going to leave them, they are whining and barking. So we pause and I’m thinking in my head “the dogs are going to go nuts throughout that all and not settle before we get back for bed. Not only that he will be in the PM cold and it’s COLD. “ So now clearly both me and my partner feel obligated to let him stay inside and with that I know we can’t leave the dogs out because he is lazy and they need to be facilitated because our littlest is small small and our oldest is big and doesn’t know his size. They love each other, but we can’t let them love each other TOO hard yet lol.

So now he is at our house inside and our dogs are in their crates. It’s horrible. We hate it. We feel that we have no privacy and that now we are kinda being ran over. Idk maybe I’m an asshole but it’s a lot and I’m not comfortable with this situation at all. Neither is my partner. 

What do I do? What do we do? I feel so poor we can’t even have friends. I feel sad but also I can’t even have time with my person before bedtime or in the mornings.

123,"You’re struggling. You’re angry, depressed, anxious… you’re angry about being depressed and anxious, ha ha. Negative emotions suck donkey doo doo. You’re not emotionally where you want to be, and that’s okay.

When you’re trying to be a happier and more understanding person, it can be easy to create an unrealistic expectation that you’re never allowed to feel any negative emotion. This impossible expectation causes you to feel self-invalidated, which then ironically prolongs and intensifies your anger and powerlessness.

You’re going to feel sad and depressed sometimes. You’re going to be happy one minute, and then break down crying in the shower the next. And then go to work with a smile on your face.

You’re going to feel angry sometimes. You’re walking around stores, feeling good, and then someone is rude, and now you’re pissed. You watch how disrespectful people can be and it causes you to want to punch them in the face so hard that they go flying back ten feet, leaving a crater blast in a concrete wall from your One-Punch-Man level of strength. And also wonder if you’re wrong for wanting to say something to let them know that their behavior is rude so they can improve (because they either genuinely don’t know and no one told them, or they just don’t care).

You’re going to feel anxious sometimes, and worry about if and when things will work out for you.

You’re going to feel guilt, shame and regret sometimes, about how you reacted to people and situations. Berating yourself; wishing you had done better.

You’re going to feel unworthy sometimes. Remembering how bullies treated you ten to twenty years ago in school, or how your parents text you nagging or abusive things just to make you feel like shit.

You’re going to feel bad sometimes... And that’s ok. There are no rules; there are no standards to being human. You’re doing the best that you can. Feeling fear, or unworthy, or angry, does not diminish you in any way. It just gives you the opportunity to be a little bit more self-aware and reflective of the kind of person you want to be moving forward.

It’s okay. You’re far too hard on yourself. And even if you are hard on yourself, that’s okay, too. You are great. And you’re stumbling around, trying to figure out life like the rest of us. We are all in this together — We’re all idiots, ha ha. But we’re learning, and even if you just take one baby step forward, that’s fantastic!

If all you did today was put on pants, when you haven’t been able to get out of bed for two days straight because of depression — Congratulations.

If all you did was think ten mean things, and you only said eight of them to someone — Congratulations.

If you feel like unlovable trash, but put your hand on your heart and say, “I’m going to do a little bit better to be nicer to myself,” — Congratulations.

Everything you do is progress to who you want to become. Congratulate ALL progress; not just the big leaps forward.

Don’t diminish your journey or the rate of your growth; there is no standard of speed to you becoming the person you or others think you should be. You are who you are now; and who you are now is more than enough.

I then notice it wants me to back up my seed phrase which i try to do only to recieved a fatal error message that my seed phrase cant be read.  So now my crypto is stuck in a wallet that i cant authorize to do anything because i was never given the phrase to authorize it.  Yeah be careful with the wallet app.  Customer service is no help.

She says I overreact a lot and that I’m always dramatic. These things are really starting to get to me because I cannot control how I react to things.

131,"I’m a 19 year old male living in the UK with my parents. Since I am autistic and suffer from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, as well as several mental illnesses, I am on disability benefits. However, my parents go to my Universal Credits appointments on my behalf as I am
very socially anxious and find it difficult to communicate with strangers; this makes my parents feel as though the money I claim is rightfully theirs. I am not allowed to spend any of it without their permission. When I spend “too much” money, they take my card from me so I am unable to buy anything else. 

I hate that I am currently unable to work and contribute towards society, but sadly it just isn’t a possibility at the moment, even without COVID-19 causing job losses. My parents say that if I want to buy whatever I like, I should be earning the money myself through hard work... which as I have just said, I am currently unable to do.

This situation suffocates me. My mental illness already causes me so much depression, it is already difficult for me to ever be happy. I know that I would never be irresponsible with my money if I could spend it however I wished, and one of the very few things which brings me joy is the excitement of purchasing something which will make my life even just the tiniest bit better. Not being able to do so is making me feel so much worse.

I love my parents very much; they have done so much for me. But I don’t think I can live like this any longer. I want to move out, but I don’t have enough money to do so, nor anyone to live with who would be able to help me out on my worst days.

Please, is there anything I can do without ruining my relationship with my parents?",02Nov2020,1
132,"I do care about stuff. I care for people close to me to be in a good mindset, I care about animals and it’s devastating seeing cruelty, I care to achieve something in my life. These are just some examples.

But at the same time there are things I don’t care about. One example would be depression. I don’t care to discuss or think about it. I feel as though the majority of people go through it at some point. So have I. But by now I’m so over it I don’t care to think about such stuff. On a grand scheme I don’t care about depression as a whole but if someone I know was depressed I would feel for them and care.

I don’t know how to properly write this out. 

I do care, but at the same time I don’t. I don’t know how to make it make sense. 

I’m not depressed or anything, I’m just tired of some things.

133,I hate being and feeling brought down by pretty much everything to the point where I can never let it go and let it effect me everyday. Just today I passed down a trump parade going on in my city and there was an elderly Hispanic women who was trying to sell flowers to the cars passing by and I instantly became filled with sadness for her. I just never thought I’d ever personally come across a trump parade here where I live so it definitely was shocking and overwhelming for me. I just know for a fact I’ll be replaying the loud chants and yellings from that parade and the hispanic elderly lady across the street trying to avoid what’s going on there and trying to sell her flowers. This was personally more intense for me than usual so I know for a fact I’ll be replaying this for the rest of my life,02Nov2020,1

BUT I miss my friends. Talking to them on the phone isn't the same and so isn't video chatting. It seems that the moment the phone call is over I feel alone and empty. 

I have attempted to download MeetUp app to look for similar groups I could join. My job doesn't have anyone my age. And just being home depresses me, to the point that I can't sit still to watch a movie.

I cut him out of my life because he was a toxic friend and I was tired of dealing with his bullshit. Without getting into all the shit hes done, I decided that I was better off just cutting him out of my life, and it was super awkward (since I worked with him and saw him at the field I play). After a few years i haven't seen him, and I was planning on getting back into the sport, but im not sure id he still does it and if I'll come across him.

137,"2020 has f**ked me over and over in so many ways but this week really did me in. Two weeks ago I lost my aunt suddenly from a heart attack, she was only 43 years old and it rocked my shit. My boyfriend and I drove home to Long Island for her funeral and spent less than 24 hours there before driving 5 hours back home to northern Maryland. Yesterday I woke up to news that my cousin had died from a heart attack on Friday night. She was also 43 years old and died only 10 days after my aunt. My issue is that I am so desperately craving support from a friend but I literally cannot seem to share this news with anyone around me. I suffer from social anxiety and really dislike being the center of attention and due to moving recently I feel like all of my friendships are too fragile to handle the level of grief that I am currently feeling. If it wasn’t two dead family members within two weeks I would probably feel differently but I honestly feel like it’s just too much to put on someone. Holding it in is swallowing me up but I physically cannot say “hey, my cousin died TOO” it’s like my brain goes on mute and I can’t get it out. How do I reconcile these things? Any advice would be so incredibly helpful. Thank you",02Nov2020,1

139,"I know you’re probably laughing at me by the title, but please hear me out.

Neither of my parents were very available. My mother spends all her energy on my special needs brother, and my father just has the emotional availability of a dead fish. He’s a very macho, no emotions type man. 

I turn 16 in December. And when you are sixteen, you can choose where you live. This means that I can move out and live with Anna (22f - not her real name) her sister Emily (15f - not her real name) and my twin emma(15f - Not her real name.) 

I know I must seem pretty ditzy. I doubt like on of those kids that are like “aw yeah I’m gonna leave home and play video games all day and eat and just live!” But that’s not it. I recently got my national insurance number, so I’m starting to apply for a few jobs. We’ve been looking through houses to rent, and we’ve been putting together a list of what we will need. It’s all coming together. And I’m pretty excited for it. It’s gonna be a new start. 

Here’s where the advice part comes in. 
I have had a social worker for twelve years now. And I don’t know how that could tie into our decision to leave. My mum already had an inkling of this decision, and has made it clear that she has no intention of allowing us to leave. And I get that, but how do I tell her and my father that the only way they can stop us is to take Anna to court, and knowing they won’t win? I’ve asked the counsel of my grandmother, who said that I’ve been through some really bad things (that I won’t mention here) and it made me grow up. So now I’m ready to leave home when most my age aren’t. 

So this is what I’m asking. Can the social workers stop me from leaving, and if they can’t, how do I leave without hurting my parents? And am I really crazy for wanting to move out at 16?",02Nov2020,1

146,"My friend is wonderful, we’ve really been good friends for a while. I have had romantic feeling  for her that come and go, but the friendship is really much more important to me. She has a partner and I only wish them the best. She has kept me sane through this entire pandemic because she’s the only person I’ve spent time together with during the pandemic. Before the pandemic I was making an effort to date, but was bummed because a relationship ended and then the pandemic hit. 

This past week (I see her too much 2-3 times a week) we spent some time together and things weren’t flowing as easily as usual, maybe I was just tired, maybe she was tired, maybe we’ve hit a wall in our friendship. That’s my fear that we have no more steam to keep the friendship going. That’s what worries me, is that we’re both losing interest in spending time together. 

She still wants to do stuff together, and has suggested several things. I’ll admit that she puts in as much effort as I do. All in all it’s a confusing friendship because she was/is polyamorous. I was always confused because whenever she got together with all her partners, I was included. She had many other platonic friends but they were never there. I’m sure I screwed up things the times when she invited me in for coffee at 2 AM several times. I was stupid and thought because she’s so confident that she would’ve said something to me. 

I’m always confused but she means a lot to me as a person. I may just be feeling lost right now because it feels like the world is going to crap and I had a touch of seasonal affective disorder.

TL;DR: worried that my very good friendship is slowly falling away. The last few days we spent together felt stilted. Usually everything flows so easily between us. Am I just overthinking things and we had an off week?",02Nov2020,1
147,"Hi all,

I published my debut novel, Breakout, a little while back ([here's a link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B08LR2VSJG/ref=tmm_pap_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1603917933&amp;sr=8-3) in case you wanna check it out), and I am now faced with the infamous struggles of publicizing/advertising the book and building a social media presence. 

Thus far, my main form of advertising has been through several subreddits, big and small, and I have achieved marginal success with it. I have also advertised it to my peers and paid for a small-scale ad on Instagram (my main form of social media), which has also been somewhat successful, but nothing truly effective. Since this book was the culmination of quite a bit of time, work, and money, I would like to see it prosper and not go to waste. Does anyone have any tips on getting the word out to a wider audience?

As mentioned above, I would also be seeking to grow my main social media channel (nick.a.porter on Instagram), as I understand that this is another crucial part of developing a following. For those of you who have experience in this matter, how were you able to gain followers?

I'm pretty close to two people in the group (there's 7) and I talk to them very often. The catch is that those two I'll call them Emily and Jen are VERY close with another girl Harper. Those three have been super close for two years maybe?? And they're always together. They've added me to a group chat and it's just the four of us and we talk sometimes, a lot everyday irl, but i know they have a separate gc without me in it. They always say we're close and I sometimes hint that I want to hang out but they still always hang out without me. Today, they're sleeping over and I didn't find out until I saw an Instagram post. I don't know what to do, do I try and get closer?? I've only just joined the group a month or two ago, or do I just give up and enjoy their company?

I understand that the police are just doing their job and investigating a report but I wanted to speak with some at the PD to let them know that if they do respond to a call at my house in the future that there are residents, and that it isn't abandoned. That assumption is the only reason I can think of that they wouldn't accept a government issued photo ID as proof of address. I have the equivalent of my PD's non-emergency number but who should I speak with? What's the chain of command at a PD? Also I apologize if this the right sub isn't for a question like this, please redirect me to the right sub(s). Thanks!",02Nov2020,1
166,"I’ve been really close with my friend (we’ll call her Marry) for about 4 years now. She recently had a break up with a long term relationship. Marry has struggled with depression every since I’ve known her. Her home life isn’t that good, and it’s starting to affect her school work. I myself have gone through depression, and self harming/ suicidal (thoughts) so I do understand her on a personal level. I’ve made it clear to her that I’m always here, I’ve been listening to what she has to say and I do my best to offer good advice. One thing about Marry is when things get bad she doesn’t want to actively get better. I try to motivate her to maybe do some small things like shower or clean her room, but she doesn’t take any advice which is why we run in circles with the same problems. I find she ends up in the same situations because she doesn’t learn from her past mistakes. I don’t mean that to sound mean at all, because I truly love her and care for her. But I’m at a loss because I feel like I’m not actually helping, or maybe it’s just I don’t know how to help. Is there any tips or advice you guys got?

167,"Broad question, I know, but I have a severe dilemma. 

So, I'm 17 and I'm applying to college and I have never been as down about my future and about the bleakness of life and the world as I am now. I feel like I'm never going to be able to properly function in the adult world (I barely function right now). I hear over and over again how life is just about doing what makes the most money and everything else -- happiness, mental health, your dreams -- are either secondary or should be completely thrown out the window. 

I'm supposed to go to college and major in something ""marketable"", regardless of if I like it at all, and then get a super high paying  job, regardless of whether I enjoy it at all. I don't live a fantasy world where I expect to have a ""dream career/job"" or something, but I want something that I simply like. However, if I choose the degree I like and try to pursue a field I like I'm labeled as stupid bc I chose happiness over easy money.

Is that all life is about? It doesn't matter if you like your job or your life, it's just about money? I come from a kind of broke (not poor, but on the broker side of life) family, so I'm not in a position to be blinded by priviledge or anything. I just want to be happy for once. I've dealt with (and am still dealing with) depression, anxiety, and occasional thoughts of taking my own life and the idea that life is as bleak and cold as this only worsens those things. There are kids my age who plan on going into computer science or PRE-MED solely for the money and I feel like I'm the dumb one. 

Do I just suck it up and accept how terrible reality is? How do I even do that? Is that all life is? Money and materialism? I don't know if I can, or want to, live in a world like that...",02Nov2020,1
168,My best friend moved back to her hometown a month ago. The city we live in is getting to be too expensive and after a family member died from covid and she regretted not spending more time with them she chose to move back home where her parents live. She is now out in the country and living with her mom. She was able to keep her job and is working from home. She kind of went into shock after moving because it isn’t what she thought it would be and has been crying every night. She is fine during the day while she’s busy with work. I think a large part of her moving was grief from her family member dying and it was a very rushed decision. She’s realizing now that she has very different political views and lifestyle from the majority of the people in her small town (in the south) and has seen a guy she had a bad experience with when she was younger on a dating app. She’s wanting to move back here now. I’m trying to stop her from making another rash decision and told her that she needs to give herself some time to settle in. Tonight we agreed that she will give herself x amount of time and if she still isn’t happy we will start to come up with a plan for her to move again. I need some adultier adults to tell us how much time is reasonable to give herself to adjust to her new life before she decides to move back here. Thank you for any advice.,02Nov2020,1
169,"Apologies for length of post 

Last week on my commute to work a car cut the car in front of me off causing him to slam on his brakes. I in turn slammed on my own brakes and stopped about a foot from the car in front of me. I was lucky I didn’t hit him, but thankfully there was a decent amount of space between us (paranoid about damaging my fairly new car). Very soon after, the car in front of me pulled off to the left shoulder and I passed him. As soon as I passed him he pulled behind me and seemed to be following me. To test this, I pulled into the center lane and he pulled in behind me. I put on my left blinker to make it look like I was going to change lanes, he did the same. I started to move into the left lane but came fully back into my lane, the guy mimicked every thing I did. I asked myself, does this guy think I hit his car? About 30 seconds later I saw an opening in the right lane between 2 cars and moved quickly into the lane. The guy who was probably following me could not get in behind me and I breathed a sigh of relief. Five minutes later I am about to exit the highway to get on a bridge and I hear someone honking. I turn my head and it’s the same guy! He pulls up next to me with his window rolled down and his cell phone waving around yelling something at me I can’t make out. I look ahead and pretend I am not going to exit the highway. At the last possible moment (after checking no one is coming) I switch lanes very quickly and take the exit, making sure there is no way he can get in after me. The last thing I need is this crazy person following me all the way into Manhattan and then getting out of his car with a tire iron the second I am stopped at a red light. Okay, weird situation but it’s over.

Ten days later I get an email from my auto insurance telling me to update my claim. I say, huh? I didn’t file a claim. I call the company and they say a claim was made against me because I allegedly rammed into the back of a car on the highway and then fled the scene. I gave my side of the story, I was scared of the unstable person that was chasing me all over the highway for at least 10 minutes after I DIDNT hit his car. So now I have to go an auto repair shop in a few days for the insurance adjuster to assess my vehicle. There is no damage to my car because I didn’t hit his car. 

What can I expect in this situation? This guy just flat out lied about me hitting his car and now I have to take off work to go to this appointment. Are my rates going to go up? I’m a little freaked out, but I hope justice, or whatever that looks like in this situation, prevails",02Nov2020,1

172,"
So my boyfriend is drunk passed out right now. We just had a conversation about how he thinks I am cheating. Last month we got in a fight, and because of my mood swings he requested for me to try medication or that we would not be together. I whole heartedly complied because at that point, I just wanted to fucking kill myself anyways so why not? Since taking the medicine my libido has tanked, as well as my affection levels. I’m easily annoyed and quick to bite back. Otherwise I feel perfectly fine minus normal side effects. I sell weed and weed related products on the side to make more money and he doesn’t understand the waiting around and time it takes to do so. He swears I must be cheating, but it’s not that at all. The man knows nothing of foreplay. There are no sweet kisses for more than a minute, no different positions, no head from him, etc. head is so rare that I’ve had to imagine what he felt like down there. I’m not cheating, I just simply am not enjoying myself and haven’t gotten off in a few months. There’s no easy way to explain that to your partner. He said that he wanted to make love to me, and he simply never did. I feel as if I’m here for a quick fuck and to be someone who’s doing the wrong thing all the time so that he can feel good. No matter what I try, I feel like a fucking failure at least half of the time because I just can’t do anything right according to his standards. He doesn’t understand personal boundaries. I’m so fucking angry. I just want him to fucking appreciate me and my body and actually try new things with me and he doesn’t understand, his only thought is I must be cheating. Like he did in April twice. And then I broke it off with him and had sex with a woman the same evening. I just pulled out a loan for an attorney for his son. And even that has somehow made the claims in his head more believable. Am I wrong for being frustrated? Overwhelmed? Tired? Fucking over it?",02Nov2020,1

176,"Okay this is a long one that I really need to get off my chest,

I started dating this guy 8 months ago. He is the most empathetic, kind, and understanding person I have ever met. I really see myself being with him and he just ""gets me"" like no one else has before. I think I love him.

The only thing is, I get extremely depressed whenever he brings up his ex girlfriend who passed away a few years ago. I don't think I would be as affected by this, however, they started dating when she was in her late sixties and he was underage (15 at the time). His ex had addiction issues and eventually died of disease. Their relationship lasted until he was about 19. The whole situation makes me feel very uncomfortable, it seems like...grooming, but who am I to judge the relationship. He was vulnerable at 15 and this whole situation makes me feel sick. I cannot even imagine it. Whenever he brings her up, although it's been years, he enters the cycle of grief all over again. I know grief is a long process but it makes me feel like I am not good enough and it also makes me feel sad on his behalf. He still loves her, in a way at least. I don't think he views the situation as child abuse. Further, I always feel like I am in her shadow, which makes me feel like shit (and objectively I feel like, I am young, should I be taking on this? Are my feelings even justified?). It is like there is a cloud constantly over our relationship. I have tried to be understanding, and I have tried telling him a little about how it makes me feel but I know this is something I cannot change. Every time he starts talking about her I feel my stomach twisting in knots.

Last night, he started talking to me about how he wants to take me to see where she is buried, and how he sometimes has dreams about her that he ""doesn't want to end"". While I respect his grief as valid, I have been talking to a therapist on my end who recommended that I suggest he seeks therapy. I told him that for our relationship to work, I need him to talk to someone professionally. He has never told anyone but me about his past relationship. I told him that I think his grief is valid however I also think he was groomed and abused. He told me he doesn't think he will ever be able to view her as someone who groomed him, but agreed to go to therapy and make an appointment to talk to a professional. He gets upset and defensive whenever I bring the situation up (he started sobbing when I told him I thought he was groomed), and to me sometimes I feel like he thinks I am attacking someone he loves/loved. That being said, he also told me that if she somehow came back from the dead tomorrow, he would choose me. I think the ongoing grief has something to do with a long lasting effect of being groomed.

This whole situation makes me depressed, sad on his behalf, and anxious. I am a current graduate student on a scholarship a top twenty university, I know I can be independent, I know my worth, I know I can leave this situation if it ever gets too much. But, I do want to try and make things work. Am I doing the right thing in this situation? I just think he will never be able to move on with me if he stays locked on to his past.

Does anyone have any further advice?",02Nov2020,1

I am currently in my third year at community college and I feel like I am really struggling in online school especially with my lab class that I am required to take. I have never been a school person to begin with and I truly have no idea what I want to do in life.

For years I wanted to get a job working in an MLB front office as baseball is my passion, but I have come to realize that is no longer a realistic dream. The problem is that I was so focused on trying to do that that I never really looked at any other careers so I have absolutely no idea what I am good at or what I could try and do.

One thing that I am good as is writing, and I own a blog about the Chicago Cubs, but the problem is that I get absolutely no interaction with my writing which makes me feel like I am basically talking to a wall and it causes me to lose motivation on keeping up with the blog.

I have a stable part time job that pays fairly well doing retail and I recently got a promotion plus a raise there. But I don't see myself working there as a career. I really enjoy the job, but I don't want to settle for working there as a career.

My parents got divorced a couple months ago. My dad (50M) got a job offer in a different state. He told my mom (48M) that he would only agree to an amiable divorce if my mom moved to the same place. She agreed to it. I felt a little betrayed, because she didn’t even talk to me or my brother before accepting his deal, and we’re very close. My brother (14M) is starting high school and i feel terrible for him that he will have to leave his friends (he has been friends with them for like 7 years) and go to a school where he doesn’t know anyone.

I have a life here. I have my friends, all the places I like going, and I like living here. It’s where I live. I don’t want to move. I’m 18 and I can choose to stay or not, especially since I got accepted into a college here. But I don’t know what to do. If I stayed, I’d be living with a roommate, which would be a totally different experience. My mom and I are very close, and I think I would miss her (but it’s part of life).

So my mom told me I have until the end of this week to make up my mind. She caught me off guard because I still need time to think. Part of me wants to stay and see what happens, but the other part of me thinks going is “safer”. I’m afraid of staying and making a huge mistake.

I have talked to my therapist about it and in his opinion, she should stay. He told me that he has a feeling we will stay. I think she’s using the whole “deal” with my dad as a pretext for going. She says that she has better chances of finding a job there, but she barely looks for jobs here. I know it’s not easy, but she thinks her whole life will change once she moves. What should I do?

So fast forward to Tuesday last week, I have a dream that my current girlfriend, did the same exact thing that happened 2 years ago, in my dream I had caught her texting some other guy and flirting with him over text. So now back to reality,  I had been trusting my current girlfriend up until this damned dream I had, but now whenever I see her texting other people, or snapchatting people, I get super paranoid that my dream was warning me about something and I get worried that its all gonna be true and she is cheating on me and everything that I did 2 years ago to rebuild my confidence and my trust will be for nothing and I will never be happy again.

I just worry that I'm being selfish in the sense that I should break up with him to spare his feelings if I end up wanting to in the future because he clearly wants something long term and I dont know if i do. But I really really love him and talking to him on the phone is the best part of my day. I have also been having a terrible past few months (quarantine, family emergencies, mental health issues, etc.) and am incredibly lonely. I genuinely think that I cannot handle breaking up with him atm, but I feel like I am being selfish if I dont. 

I go back and forth bc we are so young and who knows what's gonna happen. But I just dont know what I should do.",02Nov2020,1

203,"Hello, before I start I would like to set some rules.
No ‘u poor thing it’s not your fault’ because it 100% is my fault.
Please don’t bash my family
Counseling is not an option
Meds are not an option
Anything expensive is not an option

So I am almost 18 (f). Till about a year and a half ago I was completely emotionally withdrawn. I didn’t like sharing feeling or even acknowledge them. After being diagnosed with gad and depression I was put on meds and I looked for advice. I started feeling things again. I made the decision to open to my parents and share my feelings. It was hard and I hated emotion for the first few months. But i believed the internet’s stupid advice. Whenever I got sad I would go tell my mom or dad that I was sad. They didn’t need to do anything. Just saying it out loud helped me. 

Now i get into arguments with my brother (14) often. He’s charismatic, a really good liar and manipulator. I’m blunt, honest and reserved. So let’s skip ahead to recently. A fun activity I found out recently was melting down candles. My brother has never cared for candles ever but suddenly wanted to do it. I offered to show him in the condition that he doesn’t start up his own candle thing. Because I knew this would start a fight. This started A big fight and many other issues were brought into it. Eventually I went down to my parents to seek comfort and justice. They kinda solved the problem. 

Then sat me down and screamed at me. How I was such a child to get to emotional over smt do small. I tried to explain that it wasn’t about the candles but they were having none of it. They told me to ignore him and stop being too sensitive. How I would never last long in the real world. How I should not try guilt tripping them and how I need to grow up. I stormed off to my room in tears. 

The part that hurt me the most was when they said that “ your always sad so this is nothing new” I asked what they meant and they said that I was ‘always ‘ telling them that I am sad. This hurt me as i said that in a moment of weakness . They then said how I was not considering how me being sad is affecting them. I got mad, said I wouldn’t tell them about my issues and feelings anymore and that’s when I stormed off. My mother came to me and I thought that she was gunna comfort me as I was a sobbing mess. She told me to stop overreacting and to get a job.  

I want things to go back to how they were when I couldn’t feel anything. It was stupid of me to open up. How can I stop feeling emotion again? I’ve stopped my meds also as insurance runs out soon anyway. And I have tried so hard to get a job I just can’t find one. I would kill for a job or a chance to move out. My grades suck so my hopes of going to uni are ded, i have a 93,67, and a 80. How can I disconnect myself. Please help I wish I could just get out and start anew. With no emotions or strings. 
I don’t know how to face tomorrow and no one will help me. My parents tried but I’m unhelpable. They were the only people who were there for me and now they have made themselves clear. Where can i get a job? No emotions? And a way to make my parents proud? Also Im probably biased towards myself so imagine me and 100 times worse than i described. I even screamed at my mom when she told me to grow up and I feel really bad. This isn’t the first or fifth time. But I swear it’s gunna be the last time that I tell my parents about my self and my emotions. Especially after you guys tell me how to get rid of them!",02Nov2020,1

207,"I'm married, 9 years this November. I love my husband, but I don't know what happened to me/us. I'm diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, ADD, and depression. This has been a strain on our relationship due to me sort of being an ""introverted"" and socially awkward about ""normal"" activities as well as having a lot of fatigue some days or simply being highly nervous about what most people consider normal every day adult tasks. However, he has told me that while being normal would greatly benefit us, these things aren't necessarily a deal breaker and he still loves me. Sometimes I became (probably) irrationally insecure about myself and our relationship stability due to always feeling like I wasn't enough. A lot of arguments have came from my insecurity, typically ending with him blasting me that he does care and the ""voices in my head"" are wrong. I was medicated, and did therapy for a long time, but he has gone back to school and we have no health insurance and I haven't been to any doctors or had any medications for quite some time. I feel good on most days, but some days I crash and want to be quiet and off to myself because of high fatigue and feeling overwhelmed but also honestly embarrassed of feeling this way, but I haven't honestly felt the need to seek out a new therapist for a while until something major happened in our relationship. 


2 years ago my husband had what most people would call an emotional affair with one of his classmates. Only it was unrequited on her side, but he had confessed many times that he had feelings for her, to both her and even her friend. Even though he asked her if they both were single what would come of them, he said he didn't want anything to come from it, only not to lose her friendship. Her husband wasn't okay with that and after many arguments between my husband and her, her husband requested she end it with him and she did. This itself lasted over a year. During this year we had around 5 counseling sessions, but where I felt I was getting through to him, he seemed only to be thinking of what he could do to repair his problems with her. We stopped, got individual counseling until Covid happened. Nothing really resolved. I was told by him to see her as his friend and drop it. I didn't want to lose our life and years together so I swallowed it.


Now that she has been gone for several months, I thought I would have relief on all the shitty feelings I felt since he is no longer texting her on a daily basis, eating lunches and dinners with her, or seeing her much or at all really. But I can't say that any relief has came. On a daily basis I wake up thinking about how he could have just left me, how he seemed like if she had said okay or requitted the feelings back he would have truly cheated on me or left me for her. I feel insecure, I feel ugly, I feel boring and scummy. I feel worthless and unimportant. I feel like all the significant important things we built together are valueless to him. 


He sees it as if he didn't touch her sexually or talk sexually to her, rather that he had a ""crush"" on her that went wrong and I'm blowing it out of proportions. I see it as nothing happened because she didn't want it to. I see it as me not being good enough to love fully but rather only until something better comes along. I see it as he built something with her while I was asking him to build things with me. I see it as him knowing he felt things for her that should have only been felt for me, and he continued to do so, continued to see her and try to get closer to her until someone else had to put a wall up. I wanted HIM to put the wall up to save US. 


Its been several months and I always have to sort of fluff myself up and shove those thoughts down. He says I'm unhappy all the time, but I try very hard sometimes to be like my old self. I clearly fail most days because he mentions almost weekly now that I ""look devastated and miserable"". I often feel like I'm on the verge of crying. And unfortunately now every time he does something wrong, no matter how small, it feels like just another nail in the coffin. 


Yesterday we fought because he had enough of me being miserable and not telling him why. I don't ever tell him because I know he will not respond well to it. The entire reason for it is such a sore spot to him (I'm talking sore as in divorce has been thrown around several times in fits of absolute rage and destruction) and doesn't want to speak about it. So I have to say that its nothing, or that I'm fine, because the topic *has* to be avoided if I don't want to upset him. I love him, and communication is very important, I agree and believe that. But this is just a nagging thing for me. He thinks he had a small accident fling, and I think he emotionally cheated or at very least wanted to cheat on me. There is **NO** seeing it either way for either of us unfortunately. 


He told me I was mentally abusive because I would never tell him what was wrong and lying that it was nothing. So I told him a more softly padded version of what I have said I feel here. He didn't respond to any of it in the way I expected considering I wrote it out in an email that was fairly long and detailed. He rather sent me back a short snappy reply that I needed to stop, and that it was the last time he wanted to see me that way and that I was mentally abusing him and that I was making him hate himself and want to harm himself. 


Am I an abuser? That statement threw me so off guard and really made me look back and see myself differently. Is this abusive behavior? I have been distant for months but doing so to protect myself, to swallow issues I know will never be resolved because we cannot see eye to eye. I'm also doing it to avoid more conflict in our already conflict filled relationship. Is it abusive to take a long time to heal? Please just be honest with me. I want to get better, truly.",02Nov2020,1

213,"Im aware that this question is asked quite often and that there are a multitude of resources to reference, but this is for my personal circumstances. 

I'm someone who blends in with the furniture. To illustrate this point about 2 years ago during a group photo of about 12 people, I stood behind a guy a couple inches shorter than me with no hair. Everyone thought it was a great picture and no one thought twice of me not being there and the bald guy now having hair. We took other pictures and they would immediately notice who wasn't in them. Except for me. Never really got over that. 

Fast forward to the event that made me write this post to begin with. I'm shy around new people. Still need to work on that and small talk. Being able to approach people whenever and however.

I did a run-through infrastructure of my team who I work with on a daily basis. It went very well. Then in front of the whole company I was a studdering mess.

215,"I was dating a girl for almost 9 months and it was incredible. We were each other's best friends we've ever had and I genuinely wanted the relationship to last forever. I'm 22M and she's 20F. This was also her very first relationship lasting longer than a week or such. She was also a virgin before ""Us""

However, GF was always intimidated about a female friend of mine back in my home state. We were good pals from highschool and kept in touch. 

From the start of the relationship, whenever GF asked about any past fling, I was confused to why she wanted to know but let her in on what happened. 

When she asked about female friend(Jane), I told her we were close but we had not done anything physical. This was not the whole truth, as it was a one night stand, but one I was not really really proud of and didn't think GF needed to know all the details, especially because it was in the past and before her time. 

About every other month, GF would ask again about Jane and what happened and kept pressing into it. 

I kept up the side that we had not done anything physical, but there was a lust at one point. Jane and I never dated, but we did have a one night stand 2 years ago while I visited home. There was a mudslide that prevented me from driving home, so Jane invited me to spend the night.

 Jane had a BF at the time but assured me they were on a break or broken up as I was hesitant to have a relation with her. It ended up happening and I was able to drive home the next morning. 

Fast forward to now, GF kept asking and asking and I finally told her that it was a one night stand that happened before her time. 

GF is crushed because her anxiety was correct, and kept distant for about 3 weeks and wanted space. We texted each day but I felt her receding and her texts were off. 

We were only able to meet once a week over dinner, where as we normally would meet once a week and hang out on weekends as well. 

We needed to talk through things in order to get through this, and this was the very first problem we have encountered in the entirety of the relationship. 

One night a week to talk about things was not enough, and she took all the rest of the 3 weeks by herself and trying to work everything out on her own. She talked to her therapist and parents during this time. I was afraid of her dealing with this on her own because I did not want her to come to a conclusion of breaking up without giving us a chance to talk about everything and get through it. Even though I really pressed into the fact that we needed to get together and talk more, she was busy with practice, school, and swim for her school. And also wanting to deal with this by herself. Even on weekends, she decided to hang with roommates or go back to her parents house. 

She decides to take a break from the relationship and break things off. I was really hurt because she did not have valid excuses to why we could not work it out. I was most hurt at the fact that we just needed to talk things through and she was not wanting to work things out. 

I was disappointed because we had such an incredible relationship, and this was the first problem we encountered and she did not want to talk through it/was not ready to talk through it. Her mind was made up on her own. It felt like I was in middle school getting dumped for a non reason all over again. 

To me, it was immature and really unfortunate. It seems she let her anxiety get the best of her, and protect her from trusting me again as she was scared to get hurt. Sadly, she has self image issues but she is the most gorgeous girl I have ever seen. 

She wanted a break and for me to give her space. I don't plan on reaching out to her for 2 weeks or so, but when I do, I just want to get coffee as pals and not talk about the breakup. I want to get her to laugh and feel comfortable and reconnect with that love for me. We both saw each other as lifetime partners and maybe even start a family together, even though we both did not want to consider a baby as we were young, obviously this would be something pushed out 10 years from now. 

Honestly, she might need another relationship and experience to know what we had was truly amazing and not common at all. I really did not want for her to have to do this and get hurt, as I could have just treated her like she deserves. Overall, I just want her to be happy more than anything. Even though I know I can provide an incredible relationship and this was the only thing I lied about, I had not deceived her or did her wrong in any other way entirely. 

But as I am sitting here, I really really need advice. I really do see myself with her forever, but I am afraid we might not be able to work through any future problems. And that is only speaking for the possibility that she does want to be with me again. 

I know we could have something amazing, and she's the most incredible person I have ever met and loved. She's hilarious and incredibly sweet and I miss her so much. It's not like I am depressed and sitting in a room all day, I have been keeping myself busy and trying to work on myself. 

I need more input, as whenever I tell the story to friends and family, they are all so surprised that we broken up over such a small thing that happened in the past. I know that that is not the real issue, the real issue is that I broke her trust and lied about a past fling. But honestly I thought it's none of her business and it was before her time. I do not have feelings for Jane and I stopped talking to her as much and even at all after starting a relationship with GF. I have not reached out to her at all during this and I do not plan on it. GF's anxiety told her that she was getting in the way of things between Jane and I, but there is no Jane and I and never was. Jane may have feelings for me and shows it in indirect ways even though she is with her BF still. This is why I cut her off as soon as I started seeing GF and if Jane ever reached out, I kept it short and professional. 

Any and all help is so so so so beyond appreciated. I know this is not the end of the world, but I loved her more than I've loved anything or anyone and I really don't know if I should just get over it or hold onto hope. If any other questions, please let me know!",02Nov2020,1
216,My whole life I have lived in the same place and school district. Some kids I have gone to school with since kindergarten (now a sophomore/year 10). Right now there is about 900-1k people in just my grade. I’m pretty used to being in bigger schools that’s what I’ve grown up with and am comfortable with. I don’t really have many friends at my current school which in such a big place feels so isolating. To see he’ll hundreds of other friend groups and you aren’t in a single one. This new school would be a private all girls school with about 80-100 girls in my grade. It is 40 minute drive or so away from my house (current is about 5) and is way stricter at grading. It is 100-93 is an A 92-84 is a B (current school is 100-90 is an A 89-80 is a B and so on and so on by intervals of ten) and right now I have a 4.0 at my current school but under their standards I have closer to a 3.3. I don’t know if I could keep up with the extra work on top of harder grading. I just really don’t know what to do. I think it would be really nice to start fresh for once in my life and move on from the kids I’ve been with my whole life but should I just wait until college to do that and spend the next 2 years eating lunch alone? Or should I at least try this new school out. Is starting fresh worth it even with the risk that I might not even make any friends at my new school? Is it worth it? I think it is important to mention I’m a decently shy person. It takes awhile for me to feel comfortable and to make friends. Also never really experience private school or know legitimately anybody who goes there. I can’t stop weighing the positives and negatives of both and it’s really stressing me out because I have to pick soon. Please if you were in my shoes what would you do,02Nov2020,1

I recently decided to put grad school on hold (was planning on getting a MLIS- master of library and information science) because I’ve heard from so many others that getting their masters hasn’t actually helped them achieve anything specifically. 
As much as I enjoy teaching, I think working in technology that would benefit schools and students would be so much more rewarding.

(even though in the message I state I understand if I don't receive contact I'll understand as I don't want to disturb anyone's family life) I never thought of looking into the friend list to find if there was anyone else related I could possibly contact, so this evening I tried that and come across what I think is his daughter.... Now heres the problem.... It appears the man I've been messaging to contact regarding finding my father passed away in 2017.... Now obviously I would like closure and to find out but Im not sure I have the right to just walk into someone's life and possibly cause an issue.... I just would like to hear a few opinions so I can make up my mind what to do as I'm feeling little bit lost on the subject

Thanks in advance",02Nov2020,1

So I decided it would be best to try working from home and quit my regular job. I am a pretty good artist so I could do some commissioned work but I don't believe I would make enough for a living. My other idea was video editing which I have some knowledge and experience with. 

There are of course jobs like customer support etc. but my communications skills are absolutely terrible so that's a no no. And that's all I could think of or I have found that isn't a scam. Do you have any idea or advice what to do?",02Nov2020,1

226," 

I dont know if this is the right sub to post this, but I think it fits in the theme a bit. I am an 18 year old freshman in college, my mom was super super controlling, narcisistic, and abusive, because of this I had very poor social skills and was super isolated in school/didn't really have friends, I was also homeschooled for a time.

The consequence of this was that most of my understanding and exposure to pop culture basically only comes from my grandmother/father (who are normal people that I love very much) since I was either banned from hanging out with other kids my age or just not invited.

Since I barely interacted with other kids and was a single child, my exposure to pop culture/media was basically only stuff that they recommended. This meant that most of the music, books, and movies I was exposed to from early childhood to my teenage years (where I was super super depressed and didn't break out of my comfort zone) was from the late 60's to the mid 70's.

This isn't important because I want to feel quirky/special or moan about how bad things are now.

Its important because I basically cannot connect with my peers in college over pop culture, since we have very little shared interests in these things and completely different tastes. It feels like I am speaking a different language.

I can't talk about any of this stuff conversationally since I just like don't know who any of the celebrities/Tik Tok things are. I didn't have any ""real"" social media until 2 weeks ago besides reddit. To provide examples of how this messes with me socially: 1\] My dorm building had a Harry Potter themed Halloween party. I have never seen the movies or read the books. Around that age I read the Wizard of Earthsea instead 2\] I went to my first party a few weeks ago, and had no idea who 99% of the music artists were (besides the super super famous ones everyone with a pulse knows like Beyonce, Drake, ECT). The music also felt very unfamiliar to the point that I don't feel like I could really appreciate it. Most of the music I listened to in high school was from hand me down vinyl records.

I really am not saying this to be edgy since I realize that the wrong generation thing is a bit of a meme; I just feel like due to my Nmom sheltering the hell out of me, I am at a point where now that I am free I can't connect with people over shared interests, and feel out of touch with a ton of people my age. If anyone else had a similar experience I would love some advice on.",02Nov2020,1
227,"So I (17F) wanted to get a parents perspective. Earlier this morning I was told that I'm grounded from my room for a week thus I get to sleep in the living room. The reasoning being my room was messy. I'm not a complete slob, but I did happened to have laundry scattered about and things on my dresser. My sister's part of the room (yes we still share a room, we're both 17) was in the same condition, but I'm the one who got punishment.

Now, to give some context, I do in-person school, work 24 hours every week, as well as being a captain in extracurricular activities, and take college courses and still do my chores of the house. I'm a busy person and don't manage to get to sleep until 1-2 AM due to homework. My sister works, but her BF mainly does her homework for her and no extracurriculars. 

Nonetheless, I blew up at them. I called them out for not doing their part of the housework and that they were being hypocritical, as they had my little brother (8) clean their room, which I used to do. I told my mom she was unfair and called out my dad for having very high expectations when he doesn't do housework.

Cool girl, care about her a lot, just had our issues (not willing to discuss this aspect) and weren’t meant to be together. But I was very much in love with her and still care deeply about her.

This is obviously amplified by the fact that I have to see her and talk to her every day while knowing this.

I’ve obviously apologized but things are still weird.

We thought it would be less stressful but certain events happened and the new to the field landlords were upset with us ( I'm being super vague I know) but in the course of these events we fixed the issue signed an agreement that any changes to the place has to go through them first, If the changes we made weren't fixed in two days time, they were going to serve us a 30 day notice, we just moved in! 

Since then, we needed to follow through with an inspection, they did come through but of course there was a power outage during the walk through and found we still needed to do a few touch ups here and there. No rush apparently, but we needed to get it done in two weeks time, meaning before the end of the month. I'm assuming so they can decide to give us the 30 day notice. 

Well, a few days before the end of October (also they never followed up with a set date for the next and final inspection)
 The plumbing was backed up! water started to come out of light fixtures! 
I immediately told them, plumber came by, fixed it, but now they are setting up an insurance inspector to come by to see the damages due to the plumbing.

That being said, my partner and I haven't even bothered unpacking anything because we feel like we are walking on egg shells in this place and we still don't know if they even want us living in their house. The feeling has gotten worse, especially now due to me finding one of the landlords checking on my stories on Instagram, just last night!

232,"First post and on mobile so apologies in advance but I need advice ASAP. My mom and I feel very strongly about candidate A. My dad, her husband, feels very strongly about candidate B. Every 4 years, they stay home instead of voting because their excuse is that their votes “cancel each other out.” Well this year I approached her in advance to join me on Tuesday to go vote together and she agreed. This evening, I said “see you Tuesday!” And she said she’s not going to vote since her and my dad agreed that it would be pointless to vote this year for the cancelling out reason. She threw out every other excuse as well like doctors appointments and a ton of other BS. She has mild agoraphobia but if she can leave the house to get dinner she can leave the house to vote. 

My advice I’m begging for from you all is what more can I say to convince her? The best I have is that if we both go and he stays home, then that’s +2 for Candidate A and -1 for Candidate B. But I tried that and she said he would just vote too and it would be pointless but I know for a fact he doesn’t care that much. TIA!

237,"Originally posted in R/AmITheAsshole but was told to post here.
Hey folks this just happened and I was wondering how you’ll see this. So my moms a little bit of a helicopter parent but maybe we should talk about that later. Here’s the details. My mom does not live on the same house as me, hasn’t for a few years. Divorced my dad, and moved out on her own. She still loves me, I still love her, but now that she’s out of the house, I’ve discovered maybe I was a bit of an entitled kid when she wasn’t in the home. Without her babying me, I started growing up and learning how to do stuff my self. For some reason she insists on calling me multiple times a day and she seems to like to make drama out of very little things, but I don’t know if I’m reading too into it. Thus I’m here.

Another detail: I’m 19 and trying to get a job whilst I wait to get into college. This last bit has been made a little harder by the virus goin around. But anyway, in between the face time lagging, she insists upon doing FaceTime every single time rather than just calling me, was talking about some stuff, briefly, and saw my hand wandered to a Mio bottle. Ya know, the water flavoring things. She asks what it was. I said it was mio. She asks if it’s the energy drink kind. I say no. Why? “Well, because you don’t need to be drinking those! People have had heart attacks drinking them!” Okay, I get she’s being paranoid for my safety, she always has been, but who does she think she is to tell me what I should and shouldn’t do? Yeah, she is my mom, but she doesn’t even live in my dads house, where I do currently! Plus, I’m 19! Oh, and one more important detail. I wasn’t even going to drink the energy kind. I hate energy drinks. It was her mood about the whole thing. 

I responded saying that it’s not her business, I could drink them if I wanted. Yeah, not my proudest moment, but I did not like her overstepping her boundaries. She got pissed, said something about either having a smart mouth or having an attitude, or disrespect, I don’t even remember. I just sighed and we moved on but I do want y’all to know before you pass judgement and tell me how I should proceed. I love my mom and she loves me, but I also wanna take steps to preserve and increase my independence from her and my dad. So yeah.

So, was I in the wrong or what? Either way; how should I proceed?",02Nov2020,1
238,"I overthink **everything** in life, and this is no exception.

Lately, I've been sleeping well. My days seem to have a very ""*light*"" feeling. I think I might have added a skip to my walk! Why? Well, I think it's because ""*I don't care.*""

I'm happy with my life. I'm not depressed or going through some sort of mid-life crisis (I don't think). I'm in my 40s and have lived through a lot. The younger me lost a lot of nights of good sleep because I worried about everything, wanted to please everyone and well...just wanted to be perfect.

Here are some examples of my *I don't cares*:

* **COVID**: I used to watch the numbers and read every article about it. Then I decided to stop because it was driving me nuts. Now, when people talk about it, I literally say, ""*I don't care. Just tell me when it's over and where I  have to go to get the vaccine.*""


* **WORK**: I was a real keener, always going above and beyond. I have been in a couple of situations where upper management showed what I do doesn't matter. So, now I coast like everyone because ""*I don't care.*"".


* **MEN**: I used to get upset when I didn't get the attention I craved from my SO. I used to do quite the circus act to get his attention. I stopped. I stopped trying because ""I don't care,"" If he wants to message me, he'll message me. If he wants to talk, he can talk. I even think maybe I want to let him go...maybe...I think *I don't care*.

I really don't mind this feeling. I feel so much lighter. I sleep well at night!!! 

But here are my questions: 

* **Is this what happened to the Grinch? Is this how his heart shrunk two sizes too small??**
* **Am I becoming cold-hearted?** 
* **Where did all those feelings of worry go?**
* **Has this happened to anyone else???**

* **Could this be a bad thing????!**",02Nov2020,1

240,"So my dad has told me that i have some money in an education fund saved for college. I tried taking a few classes at community college when I was 18 after I graduated high school, but was so burnt out from taking AP classes and working so hard in high school that I was done and couldn't focus or make myself go to class or study and such. I'm also pretty sure that I've had undiagnosed ADHD most of my life, and that has probably been the reason behind my perfectionism and procrastination, and I'm pretty sure the reason why I got diagnosed with depression and anxiety in my teens but why the medication never really seemed to help. Whereas every time I've recreationally taken a stimulant like adderall or vyvanse, I've actually been able to like take care of myself and get the things I need to get done, done, on a daily basis.

ANYWAYS. I am a 22 year old woman and I don't plan on trying to go back to college. I was a kennel tech from ages 16 to 18, for 2 years at a vet clinic and 6 months a dog training/boarding/daycare/grooming facility. I've been a dog trainer at that facility since then. I used to want to be a vet, and then when I decided I was burnt out from school already, I changed to wanting to be a dog trainer. So I do feel very lucky to have gotten into my dream career so early on in my life. However it is a very physically demanding job. I work full time, up to 9-10 hrs at a time 2-3 days a week (plus a few shorter days every week to make up 40 hrs to a week), and am on my feet all day. I know I'm young but I am already exhausted lol.

My fiance has been getting into survival stuff, and we've both always loved camping and nature and such. He recently came to me with the idea to, instead of wasting the rest of our lives working and throwing money away on rent or trying to save up for a down payment and being locked into a massive amount of debt aka a mortgage, that we should save up while we are living at his dad's (we had to move back in after our lease was up at our condo and covid started) rent-free and buy a few acres of land in TN, KY, or CO (we currently live in TX but want to move somewhere colder and those were the states cold enough for us where I could find the cheapest land). We would start out basically camping and probably partially living out of our minivan (no kids but we have a 6-8 lbs cat (2 yrs old) and a 3.5 lbs dog (13 yrs old)) while we build our own cabin/house with the trees on the land, and eventually build a garden, greenhouse, get more dogs and cats, get some chickens and goats, build dog kennels, a dog training shed/classroom, a tattoo shed (I have a tattoo gun/kit and have a done a little practice with it in the past but would love to keep practicing and eventually making a side hustle out of it), etc. 

We would basically be living off the land as much as possible, hunting, growing, foraging, etc., making money selling produce, furs, making things out of wood/bone/paracord/etc to sell, eventually I'll do dog training and tattooing, etc etc. I've just been going crazy living like this where I feel like all I do is work, eat, sleep and never have time to do anything I want to do, and when I do, I don't have the energy to. Its like being forced to be on your feet all day and working for someone else and being around other people all day just wears me our and exhausts me and drains me, whereas when we go camping and I spend all day running around exploring nature and chopping wood and dragging firewood back to camp and cooking on a fire etc etc I get tired out but I feel like satisfied and content and happy and like I actually did fun work all day important work directly related to surviving and stuff. So thats why I want to live like that. I don't want to waste my whole life working. 

So I've already asked my dad about it once and he said he'd have to check on what the penalties are for taking out the money to use it for non-education purposes and if there are any taxes to take it out and if anything has changed since the last time he checked. And so later on I asked him if he had checked and seen what was up with it. He told me he found out that there were mostly penalties, not taxes. But also that the stock market has crashed recently. But even if it isn't the full amount, even a smaller portion of the money would still be enough for what we need to move. I'm just getting so tired of living here in this awful state (especially with the politics rn...) as well as living like this having to work full time. Its been a little while again and so I want to bring it up again but I don't know what to ask now. Or how to word it or whatever.

I just really really want to move asap and this money would help us so much. I feel like I'm going crazy and my mental state has been deteriorating but every time I go outside in nature or go camping I feel fine again. I just want to be happy and start the rest of my life asap and be happy with my life and live the dream life that I've literally always wanted ever since I was a kid. So maybe if there are any kind rich people/millionaires out there who want to change someone's life with one (very small to them) donation im right here lol.

Tl;dr: how do I ask my dad for my college edu. money (knowing that there will be penalties taken out of the money for using it for non-edu.) at 22 yrs old (female) to use to move out and buy land to homestead on and live my dream life?

I love the kids, but it's not enough and I'm getting to an age where I need to advance my career, and go to grad school. 

The day where I let them know if I'm re-contracting is coming up soon.

I'm applying to grad schools but now I'm having cold feet. I love the pay that I have, the opportunity to travel in this country, learn the language, AND very importantly. I'm in love with someone here. I know everyone (including myself) has always said to follow your own individual path, not factoring in a relationship, and never ever sacrifice your dreams for them. This person is staying here, and they are ""my person."" You know? I also have great friends, and hobbies here. I want to start my own YouTube channel and learn social media marketing skills that I have time for because my job doesn't require a lot of work.

BUT, grad school: I need to further my career. I also already asked for recommendations from people who have written them, told my family I'm coming back for it. And if I didn't have the relationship, I don't know if I would re-contract just because I have to get this degree. It's also a ton of money and even more student loan debt, but I would be able to have a better (and more stimulating) future job. It will be worth it in the long-run.

I just don't know. This country is my home, I have no desire to return to my home country if I didn't need another degree. Doing an online grad school may set me back as an applicant to other jobs, just because grad assistantships and internships are so crucial to my program. I also hate how everything is so ""up in the air,"" I don't know what the grad schools will say, if they will even accept me, and I don't want to tell my school that I'm not re-contracting on such flimsy hope.

Do I:

A) re-contract, staying at a crappy job but having the life I enjoy and building more outside skills like video editing 

B) go to grad school for a few years, building the foundation for a career

C) do online grad school abroad, sacrificing some important projects and having to deal with time zone difference by staying up at odd hours.

D) Say I'm re-contracting to my job until I have the security of grad school confirmation and then drop the contract even though it would hurt my reputation and I would have to pay a severance fee. 

E) Re-contract at my job, apply to grad schools and then once in, ask for a deferral for one year (even though it's not likely to be granted)",02Nov2020,1

So far this has not been a problem at all. I am currently sitting at a 3.6 gpa. However, I fear that 2 of my grades that are based on curve, could fall to a borderline b (88-89). and therefore bring my gpa down below a 3.5.

252,"My new boss is married and has kids. We clicked right away with the same humor and personality. We talk so easily and joke around. He just gets me.. all of my weirdness and all. No one ever gets me.

He texts me a lot through the day but never during the evenings or weekends. I respond to be nice and also because it’s just nice to have someone to joke with and talk to. 

He compliments me a lot and is very kind and patient and accepting of me. It feels so nice to be seen and heard and treated with kindness. 

I don’t date due to trauma in my past and usually anyone who is attracted to me is a weirdo or pervert. 
I have a dysfunctional family and I am a very messed up person. 

It just feels so nice to be seen by someone and to have someone just get me and accept me and even compliment me on things I consider to be flaws. 
I’ve never had that before.

I do feel weird about it because it seems he doesn’t text when he’s at home when his wife around. I also
Noticed they have joint social media which is kind of weird to me for younger couples to have joint accounts and might point to one of them cheating before?

He’s never even been inappropriate .. our convos tend to be about the work day or books or just silly banter. Sometimes we complain about work to each other or share weekend plans. 

I can’t tell if he’s just being nice to me or if he’s just targeting me because he sees me as someone he can manipulate. I do tend to be silly and joke a lot and laugh with people so I don’t know if he took my personality as flirty when we first met. 

The thing is, I can easily see myself getting sucked into something with him because like I said... it feels so good to be noticed and complimented for once. 
I’ve always said I’d never be a home wrecker and honestly I have no intentions of doing that to his wife. But I’m afraid I could get caught up in something emotional. 

Does it sound like maybe he’s trying to use me to cheat on his wife?

What should I do? I really enjoy talking to him. I have very few friends and no one ever really talks to me. 

I’ve never felt such a strong connection to anyone before. It’s very surprising and I just don’t know why he has to be married and have kids. Why can’t I just attract a decent person?",02Nov2020,1

261,"I (16f) had a fight (details would take too long to explain. It started out as a disagreement and quickly spiraled into a really tense, sad argument that lasted a few hours) with my best friend (16f) a few nights ago. I (stupidly) wasn't thinking too hard about what I was typing, and one text clashed with another in a bad way and I ended up offending her really badly. It was one of those things where one badly worded sentence mixed with another stupidly worded sentence and distorted what I was saying so that it was a really vile thing to say.  At first I didn't see the problem, since it was 2 separate texts, so I didn't correct it until she called me out, at which point it looked like I was trying to backpedal only because she pointed it out, when in reality I genuinely chose the wrong words and stupidly didn't give it a second thought before I sent the text. I immediately explained that I worded it poorly and didn't mean to say what I said, and admitted I was a complete asshole, and apologized. I feel awful about it still.

My problem is this: I sent her an apology the next morning, and she said ""it's fine. My feelings will recover. I know you didn't mean it in the way you sent it. Let's just move on."" But the thing is, I still feel really bad. And I'm a very sensitive person, so if our roles were reversed, I would not have been able to move on that quickly. So there's a part of me that's worried she's still be mad at me, and even though she said she wants to move on, I have the urge to message her and make sure she's not still mad/try to explain myself again. But I realize that in doing so, it would turn into her reassuring me that she's not mad and/or comforting *me*, and I realize that she shouldn't have to comfort me for something that  *I* said that hurt *her* feelings. The fact that my instinct is to keep pushing it and apologize again worries me. I don't want to make my guilt and insecurities her problem. I also don't want to play the victim. 

So, how do I just move on and forgive myself? She already said she forgives me and doesn't want me to feel bad, but I just can't stop worrying that her feelings are still hurt and she's just trying to blow past it.",02Nov2020,1
262,"So I'm renting a room in a house and have 3 female roommates. I am a female as well. We all have one bathroom and one kitchen to share. The two roommates are foreign exchange students. Whenever they cook in the kitchen they are in there for 3 to 4 hours. Its annoying when I want to cook something but its not the issue I was considering making a complaint about. There's been a few nights where they talk very loud in their language while they cook together in the kitchen. They'll play videos on their laptops and talk to family on their phones and its very loud. I've lived by myself for years this is the first time I've lived in a rooming house. But in the leasing agreement for the common areas the behavior is expected to be considerate and no loud noise. If they want to talk loud all they want is fine they have their own bedrooms to do that. But the kitchen is a common area we all share. 

I'm most likely going to assert this issue with them once they start being too loud again. Im planning on saying they need to keep noise level down as there's other people in the house. If that doesn't work I can complain to the landlord but there's only so much they can do. Am I over exaggerating or being too dramatic about this? I knew moving in a house with 3 or 4 other strangers id have to put up with b.s and just everyday things that come from living with others. I don't hear men complaining about this with their roommates. I am starting to think it is an entitlement behavior from chinese foreign exchange students in them knowing they can say whatever they want around others in their language.

263,"TL;DR: my teammates make fun of a friend who’s clearly upset with her spot on the team.  Considering whether and what to tell her

So I’m on a sports team, and a bunch of my teammates are super toxic.  I’ve only been doing the sport because I actually enjoy playing it, but some of them almost made me want to quit.  Among these, I have a couple of friends (I say this loosely because I don’t really talk to them outside the sport), while most of the others are either lukewarm or simply don’t care about me.

One of my friends, let’s call her P, has the same sort of attitude about the team.  Both of us don’t get much playing time, and she has never been in except in our senior game when she had to.  As a result, she’s pretty miserable on the team, and I try to make her feel better.  However, I don’t know her that well and it’s hard to connect

Anyway, we had one of our team parties after practice, one in which P didn’t show up.  She told one of the girls that she hurt herself and couldn’t practice.  Instantly, some of my teammates started talking shit about P, saying that she was a liar and they would be glad if she actually quit.  *A team captain* said, and I quote, she wouldn’t miss seeing her “miserable face” every day.  That just made me think *oh, you knew she was upset to the point of faking an injury and yet you didn’t do anything about it?  Some captain you are!*  I felt really uncomfortable and, being the nonconfrontational person I am, just hopped on Among Us to stop listening to them.

They decided to make a get-well-soon card as sort of a backhanded gesture, so that she’d be embarrassed in case she was lying.  When the card came around to me, I said I was uncomfortable doing this, keeping my eyes anchored to the screen.  They asked me why I didn’t want to wish her well, and accused me of being suspicious(?!)  Then, they poked fun at my phone usage… as if I didn’t just see them insult my friend and get extremely uncomfy.

She seems to be back at practice now.  Should I tell her what they said at the party?  If so, what?  This could destroy my already fragile relationships on the team, but I would feel bad if she just kept being so sad.",02Nov2020,1

266,"This is a long read. It’s a terrible thing. My girlfriend’s mom was diagnosed with stage 3 pancreatic cancer a few months ago and it’s really been downhill since then. There’s been some good news like, her tumor markings going down and her doing chemo therapy, but they were recently told an infection left too much “dirt” for them to be able to operate on the tumor, and the chemo isn’t working so they have to do radiation. One of the doctor’s said her mom would have 18-24 months after the radiation. Whether that meant she had that much time to live or if the cancer comes back within that time in the same spot there’s nothing they can do, we don’t know.

She told me she would want to drop out of school, give up on so much stuff she’s worked on, and more of the sorts. I am always there for her and listen to everything but I feel like it’s all I can do. There’s nothing I can say or do to make anything better and I don’t know what to do.

268,"Throwaway. TL:DR at bottom. please don’t let this get buried. 

I used to live in New Jersey and I had friends there. I was 14-15, and around the time I was grow up in Jersey, I did really shitty things. Such as stealing, lying, sneaking out, and other fun stuff. Come to find out this was due to lack of attention from my horrible father and my mother causing my mental health to take a horrible toll. Although it doesn’t excuse what I did, I’ve grown into a much better person after moving away from bad influences and my father. 

I had a bad falling out with my friends. It’s a very messy story, and it’s very personal, but basically my mother faked her suicide to guilt trip my brother and l into caring for her (which we ended up not doing) and my friends and I all thought she was dead. When it turns out she wasn’t, they had all thought I’ve lied to them about her dying and since then have dropped me. I felt like a piece of shit since then, since I could never fully explain what happened because I ended up moving to Oklahoma, to move in with my mother.

Fast forward to now. I’m 18, I’m living with friends due to my mother trying to attack me and family members being unreliable, and I’m trying my best to even see another day. I’ve found my escape in TikTok and making funny videos, and I even got a following. I posted something about an ex boyfriend, saying something along the lines of “I can’t believe I dated a tenor I theatre kid with a forced vibrato” and I guess my ex (M20) found it. The entire friend group has been liking my posts to taunt me, they’ve been commenting rude things, and even one of the girls (I’m pretty sure) is being fake nice to me so she can get on my side or what not. My ex ended up screen recording it and showed my username and said some shit. Of course, my ex friend group found it and commented awful things under it. 

I’m stuck right now. I’ve already messaged one of the girls telling her to leave me alone and she left me on read, and I messaged my ex saying I didn’t appreciate his video and for him to take it down. I’m trying my best to move on from the past and to stay strong, but thus the nail in the coffin for me. I had tiktok as an outlet to post and do what I wanted, but I couldn’t even live freely on there without them following me. I don’t want to take legal actions about online harassment, but it might be the only choice at this point for them to stop. please. any advice is appreciated.

269,"This is my first post so bear with me if i make no sense i’m not good at this.

So I(18) helped a friend(18) out in august so they could buy something they really needed at the moment, because  they said they’d pay me back as soon as they saved up enough to do so. It was like $200 through cash app, and i didn’t think twice because they were my friend.
Then around the beginning of September they decided that they weren’t gonna be available to text people anymore, because they wanted to focus on their new job(?) and didn’t want to associate with anyone not directly involved with this job. I thought fine whatever at least we’re still friends(wrong!) they just want to focus on their job and i can ask for the money later.
Recently I reached out through instagram (because i changed my number and wanted to avoid the hassle of explaining that i changed it) and asked for the money back. They asked for my cash app and i provided it. And to avoid any problems i requested the money in cash app because i still had their cashtag in the app. 
However, they clearly declined my request because it literally said “*cashtag* declined your request”, yet my ‘friend’ informed me through instagram that it said ‘canceled’. I tried requesting again just in case it actually canceled, but cash app won’t send the request because “this person doesn’t want to exchange cash with me”.
I don’t know what to do, i’m so sad i honestly thought we were still friends but i think she actually cut me off completely and now doesn’t want to pay me back.

275," 

Hi all,

At 23, I feel like such a goddamn loser and failure. I have been trying to improve, but I really want some motivation and advice on how to remain motivated. Especially, since I am quite alone. My parents aren't as helpful as they think they are and that amplifies my feeling of loneliness in this world.

Let's go over a small list of negatives (unfortunately, all of them could be a book) before we get to the positives:

* No real friends, maybe 1. Most people are just good co-workers or peers that I get along with. Never really get invited to events or parties. -
* Not the greatest looking person as well. So I think that also is one of the reasons that I have trouble finding friends or starting a conversation with girls. I've been told multiple times that I am ugly, scary looking, and look dead.
* recently broke up with my girlfriend, who told me that my depression and anxiety had ruined her personal development. She also basically told me I am someone who could never meet the standards for any person that I ask out. She also said a loser like me will never reach their goals. A couple of months later of self-improving and adjusting my mindset, we bumped into each other and talked for a bit. She claims that all my improvements are generic and fake because the foundations of my improvements are all based on things I have read from books (A Map of meaning and 12 rules of life). These comments killed me inside.
* Horrid GPA of 3.6 undergrad... Not even a competitive for a professional school. However, I just got permission to switch into a Ph.D. program in a field that I love, but I realize now, I'm probably going make only 50k CAD a year as a scientist. With how the cost of living is going to be down the line, I'm going to be lucky to ever travel or buy my first place without my parent's help. I totally get it, my fault for choosing such a shit career.
* Terrible personality. I don't how to put it, but I am one of those guys that think I'm funny when I'm actually not, which is probably a big red flag in my personality. I tend to over hype things up. I am very confident in my knowledge; however, I do say ""I'm not sure or I think but you have to look into it further"" on topics that I have maybe 50% information on or uncertain on. This has made people think I am arrogant and cocky.
* People don't value my opinion or, even worse, do not listen when I talk to them. maybe im not a dominant person in the room so it doesn't matter or I am actually an idiot, probably the latter.
* I still live with my parents, despite wanting to live on my own in order to gain skills and responsibilities. BUT it makes sense at a financial level. I get made fun of this because people always tell me that I don't have to worry about anything since my parents are around to help me if I need it.
* A lot of people make fun of me because when I was 18 my parents were in a position to get me a new car, free education, and built me an investment portfolio, which I now manage on my own with advice from a financial manager when needed. These same people give me stick for never having to work for anything.
* Everyone underestimates my abilities. I always get comments like ""Oh you went to university, I didn't expect that from you since you attended public school"", ""WOW you won some big scholarships, no one expected that from you since you are not the brightest"", or ""You are the last person I would ask help for, but since you are here let us see if we can resolve this issue"".

Positive Improvements I have made, which is not much lol:

* lost 60ish pounds. The next goal is to lose more weight so I can have a flat ab region and a more defined jawline. This can then be the basis for me to pursue an athletic build, hopefully.
* Revamped my wardrobe with the help of some guides from subreddits and got a nice haircut
* I've started to read more on random topics, such as astrophysics, coding, colonialism and war history.
* I thought about getting into more hobbies, not sure what as of yet. Maybe biking or making beer.
* I'm trying to care less what people think about me
* I've certainly increased my volunteering hours to at least 15-20 hours a week. However, sometimes it does dip below 10 if I am busy with other things.

Thanks for reading this ramble of notes... I really just want to improve as a person, but I need help.",02Nov2020,1

277,"For the past few months I've felt like my life has been going downhill a bit. I (20M) am a college student and have been learning online, at home, since March. I love my mother and everything she does for me, but my two friends went back to their respective universities and I have been stuck between working and feeling like I am failing my classes. The past few days my Instagram feed has been flooded with peoples Halloween photos with their friends and it is really bumming me out big time.

Along everything happening my dog began to get sick around the same time as corona started and we don't see her lasting through the new year.

I try to stop myself from believing it, and saying “that’s not true” or something along those lines, but I end up just doing it anyway because I’m scared it’s going to be true.

279,"So I recently acquired a computer from my father for university as mine had stopped working. I have had it for maybe a month or two. I went to log in to a particular social media that I had not the whole time I had the computer, and I noticed it was logged into an account with a similar name to his own, only not recognizable had it not been on his own old computer. I saw there were some notifications and I curiously checked them out. It turns out he had been messaging another woman for quite some time, however, it was really long ago. The posts were really intimate (romantic and lovey-dovey like) and were hard to read as I know my father to be a really wonderful guy.

He and my mother have been married like 40 years, and these messages dated back to like 2011, and clearly they (my father and the mistress) had some sort of falling out in 2013 as she stopped responding. However, there were posts on her wall from as recently as the beginning of 2019, but they weren't intimate. It was just him saying some life event or job thing or whatever. And from what I collected he had been seeing her in the 2009-2013 period. I know my parents were having a rocky time then, but it seems really out of character.

What do I do? Do I just let it go since it was so long ago? Or do I mention it to him? My father and I are not the kind of close where we talk about personal stuff, but this is really getting to me. What if he is still talking to her or another woman, even?

TLDR: My dad might have cheated on my mom like 8 years ago and we are not close enough to just talk about it. Help!",02Nov2020,1

281,"Is my boyfriend lying to me abt his ex?

So my bf (30M) has been dating me (19F) for 4 months now. 

A bit of backstory... 

He was in a relationship for two years with his ex who was manipulative, controlling and apparently would check his phone every waking moment of his day. He was going to get married to her when she cheated on him with her ex boyfriend while they were on a break. I met him through a dating app and we seemingly hit it off. he told me how if his ex found out she would “trick” him into having him add her on snap because they had raised a puppy together which he later gave to her when they broke up. And that she would try to “lure him” back in by sending nudes-keep in mind she’s a 29 year old teacher who would basically do anything to pull him back. And she would harass me if she knew that I was his girlfriend.And he would “probably not respond to her nudes” according to his own words. When he told me all this I stayed quiet and nodded that I understood the situation but in reality it makes me wonder if all this happened already during the time we’ve been together. I haven’t met his parents which he insists he keeps his life private from them because they would nag him to get married and that they think I would leave him-which I wouldn’t because I love him so much. But I don’t think he will introduce me until we’ve been together for a year.. He’s trying to tell me to wait to tell my own parents until there is ‘stability” in our relationship. He also says that he doesn’t have any social media other then snap because his ex made him delete it all back when they were together. Which is also suspicious as he claims to not have any social media. I can’t be in love with someone who is still in love with their ex. Keep in mind they broke up a year before he started dating me. Also initially in our relationship he lied to me about his name and career-because he thought I wouldn’t want him because the career I’m planning to go into (medschool) he isn’t in-(he initially told me he’s a doctor but he’s not rather a vet) but I still forgave him and took him back.

Present:

We met up yesterday for Halloween and on the way back he casually mentioned how his ex was still single. I asked him how he knew since they didn’t talk at all he told me she hit him up two months ago and said that he told me. I immediately confronted him that he didn’t tell me which he said that she just sent him a message (which she would send whenever she wasn’t dating anyone) and he didn’t respond-that there was no “conversation” at all.  He immediately assured me that he wouldn’t ever get back with her during this lifetime at all. About two weeks earlier we were talking about his ex and he then told me how he didn’t know if she was single or not. I feel like he’s lying about when she hit him up. I don’t wanna check his phone as I’ve never done that and I trust him but this has me thinking. I love him so much-gave him everything but if he’s cheating on me..I have no words.

285,"Hey everybody I need some help. So long story short I just recently moved to a new area looking for an improvement to my lifestyle. While I get back on my feet I decided to stay with my mother until I could get a job and all that. Basically one of my siblings had decided to take my wallet which had my ID my ssc and all my credit cards with a couple hundred bucks in it and dispose of it. I know it was one of them because my mother was out in Washington at the time and the last I saw it was in my room before I decided to take a nap. I woke up to find my wallet missing. My younger sister who is 18 is the most likely suspect due to the fact my other siblings are between 8-11 so to me that's only one possibility. With that said I had to give up on the search for the wallet after a while. Its been 3 months since basically my whole life was stolen and I've been struggling ever since I'm still with my mom and unable to move back out due to employers in my area requiring ID. I had my mom order my new ssc  so I can get my birth certificate and therefore a new ID. I'm just looking for advice I've been very down mood wise since this happened I had to cancel all my credit cards and now I also have no access to any of my money either. I went from being very well off to basically being a homeless 21 year old man mooching off my mother who has been struggling herself and it really hurts me knowing I'm not able to help like I used to. If anyone has any helpful advice please lmk I'm feeling really down on my luck even tho I know it's just a matter of waiting for my new paperwork. It's just a real hit to my pride in all honesty, I worked really hard to bring myself from the low point I was at to just getting to be middle class.

288,"The last 10 years of my life have been extremely difficult. From the ages of 29-35 I was left on unemployment benefits with a severe mental illness that went undiagnosed until 2015. It took my mother 6 years to get me to the hospital although several people told her they thought I had a mental illness and needed treatment. (She has always been neglectful, right throughout my childhood as well.) I could not take myself to get treatment as I didn't know I was sick (a symptom of the illness). I was treated in 2015 and then worked low paid casual jobs until 2019 when I had a relapse which cost me my job/s. Although I recovered again I was put on medication for life which has resulted in 40kg of weight gain that I cannot get off even with strict diets (the medication makes it impossible to lose weight). After I recovered I spent a year looking for work. I finally found a full time position but it's only lasted a few months. I was made redundant last week due to downsizing. I have no partner to lean on. 

So I find myself as a 40 year old female unemployed with no partner, no children, severely overweight and still renting. I doubt I will be able have my own biological children due to my age and unemployment. I have no confidence anymore when it comes to dating due to my size and mental illness diagnosis. Due to the long periods of unemployment I have financial issues. I am also very angry with my mother for ignoring my illness for 6 years. If she had gotten me help earlier I may have had time to have a family, but now I will never know.

I need some advice on how to pull myself out of this situation financially. 

I also need advice on how to deal with the relationship with my mother. I can't forgive her and feel she is responsible for a lot of the issues I now face and things I haven't been able to do.

There was battery inside so I flipped through the 4 pics on the camera. Both from 2 weeks ago, no deleted photos.

290,"I (F) have been going easy on my friend (F) who has recently gone through some friendship issues and has felt really rejected and lonely as a result. 
Because of these issues I’ve been allowing her to be more touchy and affectionate with me than I would usually be comfortable with because I want her to feel loved. I know she has some issues with affection as it is, and is generally very affectionate and touchy with people, but it’s getting a bit too much for me. I am okay with her kissing me on the cheek or wanting a hug, I think that’s fine. But I’m not always comfortable kissing her back or having my ass slapped etc. I personally always ask before touching anyone, like ‘Can I have a hug?’ Or ‘can I hold your hand?’ Because it gives people the opportunity to say no, but I don’t think this concept has ever crossed her mind. 
I am a pretty chill person and I get over things quickly so I’ve probably never appeared uncomfortable or irritated by the interactions and I think it might be shocking to her if I suddenly asked her to stop touching me all the time. I don’t want her to think I’ve decided I don’t want to be her friend anymore (the way her ex friends did).

294,So I’m a leader at my youth group but I feel i haven’t done enough to call myself a leader. I’ve been reflecting on what Gods done in my life recently and now I kinda wanna do a sermon if my youth pastor will let me. Last year I had bad OCD and I was set free by God long story short. I still have bad days but it’s SO much better then before. I’m gettin these thoughts in my head tho like “I’ll fail measurably if I do it” “I can’t believe this is actually me that wants to do it” and just a ton of self doubt. I also have a stutter so I feel like I would bomb the whole thing bad trying to do a sermon with a stutter. Since I’m a boy I know the stigma of guys being treated poorly for having mental issues and not being taken as seriously as girls. Guys feel like they have to keep it secret to be “strong”. So I feel like if at the end of this sermon I prayed with the boys at my youth group that could set a lot of them free and take a leap of faith. I feel like this could help so many guys (and then have a girl pray with the girls) but I can’t get myself to do it and ask my pastor. And I also can’t get over I actually wanna do a sermon.

295,"I don’t really know exactly what the point of this is I just want replies. I need to just let out my feelings and situation because it’s on my mind.

My girlfriend(17F) and I (17M) have dated for about 9 months. Things have happened in our relationship that have had lasting effects onto our current state.

About 4 months into our relationship I initiated a break w her because I started to really fall in love with her. The last time I fell in love with someone (last year) I got cheated on and was deeply effect by it for a bit and fell into depression. That relationship was January-August. 

So anyways during that break I was hanging out with my friend(16F) and we ended up making out. It was very hard to explain that the reason I initiated the break wasn’t to get w/ this girl. I honestly can’t say why I even wanted a break looking back besides of how I felt In the moment. My girlfriend was upset but we “moved” past it.

Our relationship steadily decline after this. We had little stupid arguments that didn’t matter. She’s less clingy than I am while I am more emotional as well. I overthink a lot and saw innocent actions and things of hers as in someway harmful towards our relationship whether it be me jealous, not getting enough attention. Etc.

 Even arguments that weren’t even arguments just little disagreements and half kidding arguments seemed to stick with her. We grew more and more distant until September 25th she told me the way things were she was growing distant and wanted to take a break to reset things. This break only lasted 5 days. Because of it’s short span I think she missed me, but didn’t genuinely heal or get over our problems.

These past few weeks leading up to Halloween have been great. I’ve gone above and beyond as a boyfriend trying my best to make her happy after realizing how much I was hurting her. We eventually got into our first fight since our break and it didn’t go well at all. She said how she’s so stressed for school and how she might suggest a break again. I told her she’s messed up for suggesting another break and at this point we should be done if our relationship is so fragile it’s going to end after one breakup in like a 2 week period.

She wanted to continue to work things out but I said I wasn’t sure because idk if she truly cared enough. The morning after Halloween (this morning) I woke up to a text from her saying maybe it’s best if she stay friends after coming up with this realizing while she was high and drunk during Halloween.

I obviously was appalled and hurt and even questioned why she felt that way. She told me she hadn’t fully ever gotten over me kissing the other girl on the break, and she can’t be in a relationship with someone who only cares when they want, and only is nice when they want. She said that the only reason I was nice after the break in September was because I realized I was going to lose her. And yeah that is partly true I also changed because the last thing I wanted to do was hurt her and make her unhappy over stuff that didn’t matter in the grand scheme of things. She then named all these times that I was simply “busting her balls” or just messing with her. Not realizing that this all was effecting her for so long made me feel terrible.

She said that our relationship is making her unhappy. It hurt a lot to hear but I realized how many things that I’ve glossed over and how many of those things stayed with her. We kept talking about things and she said she wants a future with me. She just needs time to heal and mature and said that for us to have a chance again I need to do the same. We both had faults in our relationship I just highlighted mine in this. But it was probably more my fault than hers. 

She told me there’s no time exactly for how long it’ll take but she just knows she loves me and wants us to be together again, she just doesn’t know when that’ll be. And the better we both follow with this plan the better it’ll work and the more chance it’ll have of succeeding.

I really see a future with this girl and I just want for us to workout. She’s never been one to lie to me about things and I genuinely see how the things that I’ve done have effected her. It just bothers me so much knowing im the bad guy this time. And hurts me knowing I made her unhappy. We still are texting and said that when things get better and some time goes by we can hang as friends. 

It’s just so hard for someone who overthinks to be comfortable with this when there’s no Time factor given. Like idk how long it’ll be until she’s healed, I know I can’t speed it up. I’ve realized my faults but now I need to work on other components of myself to make sure when we get back together, the little stuff won’t bother me, and I’ll be more secure in myself. And she’ll heal from the pain that has been cause in the relationship, and learn how to manage her feelings better and how to go about things. Stress effects her to the point where she seems to act very different, especially w college applying right now.

I just want to know your guys thoughts I guess on anything and any advice on what I should do to better myself and not feel so upset about this. I know I won’t get over her anytime soon but I just can’t get my mind off her",02Nov2020,1

Main concern:
Does it make sense to go to the trades program for 1 semester to just see if I like it and if I do then stay in the program... Or should I not go and really do some intense research about what program I want to pursue in September maybe it being Powerline technician maybe not.

299,"I [17M] have generalised anxiety and possible panic disorder but am unmedicated and not currently in therapy. I feel as if I am incapable of displaying any type of negative or positive emotion in any meaningful way except when I'm panicked but even then I keep it to myself. 

I have no issue displaying affection to my girlfriend of three years and have a small but close friend group who I enjoy being around. I'm fairly introverted and while I do enjoy going out with mates I would rather be at home either by myself or with my partner. 

However, I feel like in my day to day life I am just incapable of showing any emotion. People often recognise me as never getting angry or frustrated and being incredibly rational but not in a positive way. When I argue with my girlfriend (she occasionally gets upset about how I dislike going out and meeting new people as she is very extroverted) I can't show any type of anger or sadness. It seems as the more emotional a situation becomes I dissociate from myself and can be incredibly monotone and unreactive. On the inside I feel empathetic and caring but I cannot translate it to others and I can see how it is off-putting or how I seem depressed/boring etc. 

Over the last 6 months I have begun to experience panic attacks which occur approximately every 2 weeks or so. They make me feel very disassociated and scared. Physically, my chest tightens, I get black spots in the corner of my visual field and my vision generally goes blurry and I generally just have a very strong sense of impending doom. I cannot identify any trigger but they generally occur when I'm alone. I have no reason to be anxious and it feels more like a primal/physical response than a psychological one. Generally, the episodes are self terminating and I feel fine afterwards although remain dissociated. 

The only time I have cried in the past few years was when I had a heart arrhythmia. While it turned out to be inert, at the time I was convinced my heart was about to explode and once it had subsided I cried from the stress. The reason I reference this is because I feel like it is a good summary of my emotions. Unless I am in physical danger I don't feel as if I can express emotions to others. 

Ultimately, I feel like I could fall under a number of illnesses: GAD, panic disorder, some type of emotional disorder, schizoid personality disorder, DP/DR, depression etc. I don't want to diagnose myself and I feel like I just need to talk to a therapist and there isn't much advice that can be given to me over a reddit thread but I also just feel so lost and numb.

300,"Hi everyone. It is 5:30 am here in London and at 8 am I’m headed to heathrow airport, where I’m flying to 10:25 to Warsaw and landing at 13:55 local time. After that I’m flying at 16:25 to Rzeszów which is only an hour. My concern is being bored out of my wits waiting (it only takes twenty min to drive to the airport as I’m in west London) as well as being bored on the flight lasting 2,5 hours. I do knit and will have that with me. I have ADHD and I am really worried.

301,"I'm a guy too and I've been friends with him all my life, for over 20 years now, so this is a difficult situation and I want to understand his intentions but dont want to make things more awkward by asking him this openly as we hang out almost every day. 
He acts and sounds masculine, he goes to gym every day, watches ufc, trains kickboxing, likes cars.
He is one the most homophobic people Ive met and often calls gays fa**s and says theyre mentally ill, not normal etc.
On the other side he constantly makes very nasty gay jokes towards us, all his friends, where he says hes gonna fuck us and what not. He also asked me if im gay few times sometimes as a joke and sometimes as accusation. (I thought its cause im not masculine like him)
He had several short term girls and even a longer relationship so it make things more confusing.
I could ignore all of this but not while ago he got very drunk and did several weird things in one night, he was hugging me a lot and even licked my cheek while hugging me and later actually grabbed my balls.
Im not homophobic at all but that really made me feel weird.
Ever since that I started thinking and I remember he said he chooses new shoes for weeks sometimes, he is very obsessed with his body and his clothes, saw this summer he also shaves chest. He acts maybe even too masculine sometimes.
I noticed he is in very good relation with his mother but has a very complicated relation with his father and they argue often.
So I did a few tests lately (i know i shouldnt)..when I dont hangout with him for two days he gets very sulky like we re in some relationship. If i dont answer one of his calls same thing. He is one of most easily offendible people Ive met too. 
Few days ago few of us were hanging out at friends place and at one momen me and him were messing each other, usualy guys stuff, who is stupid, who is a pussy etc. And i noticed when he makes a joke he always looks at his best friend (which he even calls brother) for confirmation. So when he made few jokes and looked at him every time I said to him ""you should have sex with him"".
He had no reply this time so we continued playing video games and soon after his best friend asked him something and he couldnt look into his best friends eyes, he was very uncomfortable keeping eye contact and had a very awkward face.
Also, the next day he went on a gay jokes rampage on my expense like he wants revenge.
Also, if this is anything important, and dont think im bragging cause looks are unimportant in the long term relationships but i objectively have very good looking face as I was told by every girl I was with and theyre were all beautiful girls too.
I shouldnt be bothering with this stuff and I dont want to get into anyones private life, I just want to know what the hell is going on. I feel like a sexual object lol and its starting to be too weird

306,"Throwaway, and I apologize for the vagueness of the title.  I’m 23 years old and I’m currently studying math at a pretty good university.  I’ve switched my major a bunch of times before settling because I just wasn’t quite sure of what I want to do with my life.  As of right now, I feel like I’m reaching a tipping point.  COVID has made getting an education unbearable because of online classes.  I’ve been getting good grades pre-online classes but ever since we’ve made the switch, I’ve been struggling.  Learning math through videos and online notes sucks and I spend the majority of my time stuck inside my apartment trying to understand the material.  It’s taken a serious toll on my mental/physical health and my grades.  What’s worse is that I don’t think I even really want to be a math teacher anymore (especially considering job prospects once I graduate).  More and more, I’ve been getting these creeping feelings that school sucks and that I would rather just work a decently paying job (nothing too grand) and live on my own.  After this semester is over, I plan on taking some time off to work while living with my family.  I was thinking of just finishing my degree at another time, if at all, when the pandemic dies down and I can go to class in person.  I’ve also considered enlisting though that seems a little far out.  Another thing is that I feel like I’m not really doing the best that I could be doing.  I have potential, and I want to better myself and do more, but it just feels like I am stuck in a rut and I am not sure how to proceed or where to proceed to.  I should also mention that my family have been supportive for the most part.  If someone has advice for me, whether it be career or present situation related, I would very much appreciate it.  Thank you for reading this.

The comment really threw me, since we’ve always been pretty close, so I asked what? And she told me to remember there is a mother-daughter relationship, not a friendship. She didn’t clarify any further, nor did she say if she was talking about me calling her by her first name (which I always do).
I’m just really confused, and a little hurt. It’s not like I talk to her about everything. I definitely talk to people my own age about my life/problems, but she’s the person I’m closest to. Especially since we moved before covid, so I don’t really have other people around me rn.

So he asks about guys I’m dating because he will hear me talking about it with my best friend, asking about their last name. He even made up a story one time when I asked him why he wanted to know their last name about how he thought he knew someone who worked with a guy I was seeing. Mind you, the guy I was seeing is 24 and her dad is like 50. Also another thing wrong with that excuse is if that’s true, your talking to your coworkers about your daughters bestfriends love life???? That’s how I knew it was a lie. 
Also he always sits in the living room so he’s in the middle of everything. He always watches me walk, to the kitchen, to my room from the hallway to the bathroom. He looks at me every time. He will purposely go out of his way to be in the kitchen with me at the same time even though he didn’t have anything to do in there. There have been about 5 instances where I’m in The kitchen, he will walk in the kitchen, open cabinets just “looking around” and then walk out. OR open the fridge and then just walk out. But it’s only when he sees I’m already in there. But he will try to talk to me each time. 
And it’s getting really uncomfortable for me.
He’s very disrespectful to his wife. He even one time told her to shut up because I was talking.
They don’t sleep in the same room.

Tl;Dr: I think my dad kicked me out after constant arguing and him recently stopping his anti depressants. I hate living there and living with my mom isn’t an option (her and husband are emotionally abusive). I’m staying at my GF’s house right now and don’t know what to do. Idek if I was kicked out or not. 

I live in West Virginia if anybody has any help to offer (programs or anything) 

First, background. I dropped out of WVU a few weeks ago. I was majoring in Electrical Engineering. I withdrew and enrolled to start community college classes in the spring for EET. Recently, I’ve decided to just become an electrician and I know the process in order to do that and plan on starting soon. 

I got a job lined up at UPS and I’m waiting on them to call me to start anytime this month. I spend time at my girlfriend’s house when I’m not home, and that’s about it. 

My dad:

My dad owns a trucking business he is very busy with, he recently started tapering off his antidepressant he’s took for years. He tapered for two weeks and stopped yesterday. I’m facing the effects right now. 

I also can’t stay with my mom since I moved out there two years ago because her husband ignores me and they both are very emotionally abusive. My dad is too but it took time living there to realize it. 

Yesterday I hit the side of my truck’s wheel and broke it while driving (went off the road a little and just knicked the rim on the pavement) and broke it. Nothing major. But, since my dad decided to buy such a huge lifted truck the wheel cost $450. It happened right in front of GF’s house, and he showed up screaming at me and going crazy. We took the wheel off and went home. He threatened to take all my electronics and music instruments but I talked him out of it.

Last night after all this he started going off more and I told him he can’t stop taking his pills in two weeks. He did this when I was younger and broke my Xbox by punching it. He told me I was stupid and I’m not a doctor, and I can’t tell him what he can and can’t do. Even after I said I’m just looking out for your health. 

This morning he left and was real smart and angry when he asked for the car keys. He came back home and yelled at me angry to help him outside. I was carrying my phone and his checkbook back to the house and after my confusion from what he said (called the checkbook my laptop) he said he couldn’t see straight and told me to help him inside. Then said help me outside. I asked inside or outside. 

He yelled at me to leave and go away. I texted my gf and said it might be time to get me. Her parents are really supportive of me and treat me better than my mom or dad ever have. He saw I said that and threw a fit screaming and yelling. Called my mom (haven’t spoke since the divorce) to get me and asked if I wanted to live with her. I said no and he told me to call her to get me. That’s when he yanked the phone out of my hands and saw the texts. 

He got even hotter and started screaming more then called my mom. I grabbed my toothbrush and hairbrush and took off running up the highway. My neighbor saw me and picked me up. He took me to the store where I met my gf and her mom.

I walked around in my pajamas everywhere and have no clothes here. I ran down the highway and had cars honk at me. I called my mom to explain why he called her and she said I asked for it when I went to live with him. I don’t expect any help from her anymore but wow that was really mean. 

Me and my dad live with my grandparents and his sister and her husband. I got screamed at this morning by my grandma, since i broke the wheel in front of GF’s house. My entire family hates her and her family. 

My dad told my mom on the phone he’s tired of dealing with me since I don’t help (he treats me like a servant I cook and clean after him) I won’t get a job (waiting on ups to call me I can take the test for my electrician apprentice license in December) and honestly I can tell he doesn’t like me. 

We argue all the time and he gets on my last nerve. He treats me like a little kid and only speaks to me to tell me what to do. When he gets mad he screams and my therapist told me I’m better than that. So when I stand up for myself he gets even madder. My whole family sticks up for him since he has always had his way and is babied. 

I have a feeling they won’t get a hold of me and now I’m stuck here with my gf and her family. They are poor and don’t have a lot so I feel bad staying without being able to support myself.

My moms mom who lives in Tennessee also offered to drive up and get me and let me live with her. She said she can get me a job easily and I can start my life or career or whatever there.

I don’t really want to leave my gf and her family since i already know I have something here to support me.
I also don’t know how I can get any of my stuff out of my house, since my dad will claim none of it’s mine even tho I bought some music stuff. He will say it’s his cause he paid for it.

The first thing he said to me when he saw the truck wheel was “take that stupid s*** off) referring to the button up I had on since it was cold outside. The house behind us caught on fire with me inside our house and melted our siding. He rushed home from work to make sure everything was okay and our house didn’t burn down, and didn’t even stop to see me first he went to grab his computers and business stuff. He also took all the money off my debt card earlier before I could get it out at the ATM.

I feel like he hates me and he doesn’t care. I think this is it and now it’s time for me to start taking care of myself. Idk what to do and I’m sorry this post is so scattered I’ve had a crazy day and I have to get it all out.",02Nov2020,1
313,"LG's [CGX 48"" TV](https://www.lg.com/us/tvs/lg-oled48cxpub-oled-4k-tv) looks so promising as a monitor. As a TV with OLED display, 1ms, 120hz, sync, HDMI 2.1, and other specs, it is super versatile and I think may be a good investment that should last me at least 6 years. What do you all think? It has everything I need from a monitor, except for the following:

* curve screen
* USB-C
*  KVM

&amp;#x200B;

**Why I want to get it?**

This looks like a 2 ultrawide monitors on top of each other, meaning mega ultra productivity! I am a college student and I made a little money from my iOS engineer internship and looking to invest on a monitor. I am usually cheap but I was told by my mentor to invest a bit more to get higher quality products that will last. I can see myself using this as my main monitor for coding the next couple of years, but it is so pricey that I had to ask reddit for professional advice 😏 before purchasing. $1200 is already a lot for me (I like to invest and grow my money) and if I buy this, this would be the most expensive I ever purchased with my hard earned money (15"" MacBook Pro 2016 was $1200 and 12.9"" iPad Pro 2018 $900) last year and really want to know if this is a good monitor/tv for everything and will be worth for long term.

&amp;#x200B;

I also want to get OLED because I feel like it is way better for my eyes too for the long run. **Does anyone feel fatigued when using this TV as monitor for productivity for hours**? Backlight bleed is not something I am scared at.  


**Payment Plan**

I plan to pay within 24 months and invest the last 18 months and pull out what I need every 3 months.

# If not, these are my other options

**Budget monitor options**

* LG 43UN700-B - has USBC, not curved, 4K, 8ms, 60hz, no free sync for $600
   * I love the height but not ideal for gaming
* Samsung CJ890 - has USBC, curved, 5ms, 144hz, 4K for $900

**Break the wallet monitor options**

314,"So context here, I’m currently a senior in highschool and I’ve always been pushed by my family but eager to go into a prestigious environment.
let me give some background for those who’d read, I’d appreciate it.
I’ve always been a great student, throughout elementary school and middle school with all A’s, no more than a B maybe once every other quarter, typical smart kid. I went to public school, but my freshman year I entered a small catholic school, I got decent grades, a few B’s, in all honors, won a few awards for highest average in a few classes (don’t think they’re too big of a deal but feel free to doubt that). Either way things were going great but I was never “perfect”. I ended my freshman year with a 3.5, and my app more year with a 3.7 (weighted 3.7, 3.9), never took AP’s during my time there. At this school, I wasn’t happy though, I never fit in, and I had this social gap that I needed to fill in order to feel happy or this is what I think of it as, so in my time there I wasn’t the happiest. For my junior year, I begged my mother to let me go back to public school which she eventually agreed to for my junior year, it’s here where I debate if I should’ve stayed at TC. In a six month span, I go through a lot of strain in my life, as I look forward to my junior year, I begin to loose weight, grow up a bit more, I get a job at a summer camp, do some coaching for lacrosse, things look good, however in June of 2019 my father has a major heart attack nearly killing him, he’s doing great now, but at the time things were grim, it took a big toll on my family, my mother a strong woman is torn apart and unstable, within a few months in the beginning of the school year my grandmother passes, giving me a sense of guilt, and putting my family out of tune again. And through the summer a brought along some trouble with a few close relationships with friends. All of these factors came to what I think now as putting me on a bad footing for my junior year which at the time I thought I could handle. So here I am, back in public school with the kids I grew up with, I lost 50 pounds, I’m playing for the lacrosse team with my 6’ 1, 170 frame, and I’m beggining to hit it off with everyone, for the first time I’m feeling good about myself, and at peace, considering everything going on outside of school.
My issues looking back are on the academics, at the time I was taking
* Ap eng
* Ap physics
* Ap Spanish literature
* honors precalc
* Apush
* health
* civics
for me in school, I never had to study much at all, I had poor studying skills because of this. My first semester ended terribly by my standards, a C in physics, no matter how hard I tried I couldn’t get the material, apush was a struggle getting a B first quarter and C- second. Also Spanish literature was a C - B average. Precalc I ended up nearly failing the first quarter so I dropped down to CP. civics, English, and health were all A’s. So far, I’ve bitten more than I can chew with 4 ap’s, but I don’t think it’s the time that needed to be put into the classes but my procrastination. right before quarantine, physics was a C+ avg, Spanish a B-, Apush a B, and everything else at an A, I was best in class for my precalc as things needed some time to pick back up going into the school year, but anyways I still struggled. Going into that fourth quarter with quarantine was diffferent, I ended up getting a low grade in English bringing my A+ avg to a B for the yearly, my physics ended with a C+, my Spanish teacher was going through her finals weeks a of pregnancy and I was doing all of my assignments late which ended up not getting graded, which pulled my final grade in Spanish to a D, and Apush ended at a B-. My junior year was ended with a 2.8, 3.1 weighted and I feel that it was a total mistake keeping me from where I wanted to be. 
The quarantine didn’t help, it threw me off, I couldn’t stay on task, but also it made it too easy for me to just slack off, but what really totaled me was a pregnancy scare with my gf, it completely put me into survival mode, instead of working I spent the whole month of May praying and working towards if something went wrong in that case. She ended up fine thank god.
Through the summer, my parents made sure I felt like sh!t about my poor effort, so they kept me from some big events, pushed how I wasted my time, but also encouraged me to reorganize myself and hit it hard senior year. 
Now here I am, Nov 1st, I am taking
* Ap Psych
* Ap Csa
* business law
* ap English lit
* communications and journalism
* accounting
* calculus
The end of the quarter is a week always, and I have all A’s and one A- in psych which will most likley go up at the end of the week, I’m feeling good, I feel like I’ve turned around from my junior year. Due to being part of my journalism class, I am a writer and reporter for the school newspaper which happens to be one of the most renown in the east coast and I’ll talk more later on about my EC’s. 4.0, weighted 4.3 (at my school)
a good friend of mine, her family happens to be one of the top donors at Brown and I’m in the process of getting a letter from them for recommendation. I wasn’t able to take an sat in the spring but I have mine on Saturday. I’m pursuing a degree in law. I know I need another safety school but my list is
* brown
* johns hopkins
* georgetown
* unconn
* drexel
* university of Delaware
* New York University
* Boston University
* The George Washington university
I live in Fairfield county, I’m of Hispanic decent, first generation from my moms side, raised in a heavily catholic background. I’ve played lacrosse for my whole highschool career, I am captain of the team this year, was captain my sophomore year at my old school, singlehandedly pulling the program together for one more year and it’s last year ever. I’ve coached for a summer, about to begin working at a Lacrosse unlimited store, I am very passionate about the sport. I am bilingual, perfectly fluent in Spanish as I am English considering my Colombian background. I currently am employed as a simple cashier at a supermarket, and over the years have been close with the church doing volunteer work, attending community events, and doing on and off volunteering for a few other organizations such as KidsHelpigKids.
At the end of the day, I am currently happy with myself, I’m at peace, I’m healthy, I have my father who’s been saved, and I’ve turned my grades around. With the colleges I’m looking to go to not too big of a school that’s in the East. My dream would be making it into brown but considering that I did not early action anywhere, i got a 3.5, 3.7, 2.8, and 4.0 currently (unweighted), and I am yet to take an sat, I feel that my junior year mixed in with my already sub par Gpa keep me from being in that elite tier and I can’t think of any justification for my mistake. I’m not here begging for pitty or to hear the “don’t dwell on the past” but I’m asking for advice on my mindset for the next 2 months. I feel that I’m just barley above average, my extra curricular aren’t amazing, so really, should I quit on my dream to make it into and ivy, or not, how can I improve my chances this late into the game, and any advice on the other schools listed, especially BU and JHU.

It gets annoying because firstly I’m going to be 17 in a few months and hugging and cuddling my mom isn’t something I want to do at this age. Secondly all my other friends’ moms don’t treat them like my mom treats me. Thirdly she does all of these things every day. Quite literally everyday I’m not exaggerating. And lastly whenever I tell her I am too old to be doing these things she gets angry. She will throw a fit and storm off to her room. After that she doesn’t speak to me and completely ignores me while giving me mean looks until she gets over it a few days later. Afterwards she reverts back to her usual self.

When it comes to my spending I get free tuition and so I don’t have any monthly bills besides textbooks. I make about 16k a year since I only work max 30 hours a week. Is it okay for me to buy a truck that’ll cost 25k? I have 8k cash to put down and I have good credit(about 720). I know you should only spend 20% of your income but financing the truck and making sure the payments are under 1k a month for 24-36 months is something I know I can afford. Is this a bad move?

My 'father' whom I've never met, messaged me recently to ask me if I want to text and I don't know what to do. I haven't replied yet and I don't know if I should but I also don't know if it will always be at the back of my mind and I'll regret not replying.

He was really horrible and hurt me when I was a baby, which thankfully I don't remember! He's never once tried to contact me, I'm 25 now and I just really want to know why now? I obviously have wondered about him over the years and I have so many questions but I don't know if it will be worth it. 

I had a great childhood and I have been fine my whole life with out him, thanks to my mum. I love that woman so much, my best friend. I don't want to hurt my mum if I decide to reply, she has said it's completely up to me but I don't know, I'm just worried. I don't if it's the shock of him getting in touch or whatever but it's just really messed with my head and I don't know what to do!

326,"So, how the argument started. My dad came into my room and said I needed to spend more time with my grandma so she can get off his back. I told him I work 6 days a week (10 hour days) and I can’t do it. I told him to ask my sister or brother. He said my sister can’t because what she is doing is more important. So, then I said is what I’m doing not important? He said no.

I started arguing with him and then he left. 

So here is some background. 

My sister goes to college. 

I went to college but almost killed myself but decided to take a semester off.

It has been the best thing I have ever done in my life. I am a lot more happier and I don’t have thoughts to kill myself constantly. 

I have ambitions, hobbies, a life. Things I actually love. 

Before, I was just doing what my dad told me to. Whatever he wanted me to do, I did because I was afraid of him. He was abusive all the way up to me being 19.

I was depressed, I wasn’t happy. I wanted to kill myself and I suffered from anxiety and depression and OCD.

Like, what the heck. I’ve learned so much that will help me with my future. My sister has learned chemistry and biology. I’ve learned how to talk to people, how to run and manage a restaurant (my dad owned restaurants and they needed help so I helped him).

I’ve helped people. A lot of people. I’ve helped people mentally, with their situations, and help homeless people when I can.

My sister has done none of that.

And even if I didn’t learn anything, I’m having fun. For the first time in my life, I’m having fun. 

My family thinks that if you are not in school, you are a loser. A failure.

I was talking to my mom and she said “at least she will have a respectable future.” So, does that mean what I’m doing is not respectable.

Like, I don’t know. Am I overreacting?",02Nov2020,1

336,"NGL, ashamed to be asking a subreddit, but anythings worth a try. **TLDR at the bottom of post because it's sort of long.**  


Recently after mixing in with some other people at school, people have started to like me and it's making me uncomfortable. I've never been good at intimacy at all, it used to be not so bad and just some bad stomache feeling once in a while, but now I feel lots of dysphoria (not gender specific, just exisiting if that makes sense) and can't have friends sometimes because I feel disgust (not their fault, I just am bad with people close to me emotionally and physically, been like this even when I was 3 I remember I would feel uncomfortable with my parents). I used to be a lovely person but now I'm self-centered and a bad influence, so yeah. I don't like people that I don't adore around me because I get physically sick if they get too close, and for some reason they get influenced off me from interests to self destructive habits.   


It turns out quite a few people have taken interest (friendly, crushes and I think some are just messing around with me) in me recently. Some have gotten too attatched and it's really freaking me out. I feel anger whenever they keep trying to get close, and I don't lash out at them but tell others I just can't stand them and I feel guilty about it now. In certain classes I'll just have crowds and when one person comes in, their friends who like me will come over and I don't like it at all.   


Right now I avoid them when possible and try not to engage and keep it short and polite when they do talk to me but they keep coming back. I'm so scared of telling them directly though because I am actually scared they might commit suicide or hurt themselves as its almost happened with them and other people in the past. They keep offering me free stuff, trying to talk with me every moment and once I got close to one of them and we were just friends but was holding me like a couple would and yeah. I objectively morally do not deserve such care, and don't want it unless it's from parental-figures, and from experience of being obsessed with someone I stopped liking them when I realised their thought pattern, so maybe if I just always be honest about how bad a person I am in a way that doens't seem pity-pulling?  


I'm sort of just looking on how to cope and how to not just yell out ""GO AWAY SIMPS PLEASE STOP IM NOT A GOOD PERSON AND I HATE WHAT YOURE DOING STOP BEING NICE PLEASE JUST NOT ME TRY SOMEONE ELSE, BECAUSE THEY'D APPRECIATE IT MORE AND IS A GOOD PERSON."" because that's not nice of me or good for PR and I feel sexist to men for calling good-hearted people simp. It feels like the more of a bad person I am, more good things come my way and I'm not ready for that.  


Extra context??: Uh I'm 14F, this is mainly about one person but also some others but also those other ppl might just want to be my friend so IDK. I grew up heavily involved in an r9k discord since I was 12 (recently cut ties with most of them its ok), they supported me tons under the guise I was some 23yo guy, but were really anti-women or pedo (some got actually arrested) I think alot of them had bad pasts with ladies and I can understand attitude to hating/chasing them in some people but i don't like it when people place me above or below.

345,"I’m 21 years old [F] and have been living with my high school sweetheart for 3 years. Over this period of time, our relationship soured significantly and has become toxic. Tonight things came to a head and after a brutal fight we had a long talk. We agreed that we loved each other, but we are ultimately too different to work out. It’s bitter sweet. Relieving because it could be really great to move on and we’ve had so many fundamental incompatibilities. And it’s bitter because we both still care about one another. 

I moved out with her when I went to college and so I live away from my family and closest friends. We’ve agreed to live as roommates until our lease (and my semester at school) is over. We’re hoping we can even be friends since we really talked things over throughly, but we’ll honestly have to see. Regardless, I think we can stay out of each other’s way that long. 

My parents recently sold their house and are looking for a rental in-town before going elsewhere. They don’t know where yet or even if they’ll leave our home town, they just wanted to sell before a COVID induced housing crisis.

I know they’ll be there at least another half year because my brother’s graduating high school. I’m hoping to stay the spring semester if not a little longer, while I decide how to proceed. 

I’m embarrassed because I’ve always been pretty “independent” and they’re really pull yourself up by your bootstraps type people. On the other hand they always loved having me home over breaks. Then though, they had their own place which was large enough. They are having a tough time finding a rental already and I’d hate to be a burden on them. But I’m happy to even sleep on a air mattress or anything to have a place to get back on my feet. 

I’m embarrassed the relationship failed. I feel so ashamed for needing help. I feel awful in general. I was wondering how to ask if I can move back in for a few months. I don’t know how to break it easy. 

Most of all, I don’t want to be a disappointment...",02Nov2020,1
346,"Am fully receptive to all advice and criticism, just please don’t be mean about it :( 

Background: okay, so I broke up with my girlfriend about a month ago over a very unique set of circumstances that no one had any control over. I loved her very much and we stayed friends after the break up which definitely did not help but it made sense to continue that kind of relationship at the time. 

We talk regularly and we still very much have a physical relationship that’s pursued by both sides. She still refers to me as “love,” “babe,” and whatever, still wants to cuddle and all of that. I said flat-out that if she wants to go back out there dating-wise, that’s fine obviously but tell when you’re doing that so I know that physically we’re going to be done. I understand having to move on, I don’t want her not to. I’ve been very open about what I’m doing on Tinder, how I did download for a bit and deleted it. I don’t want to date other people when I still have feelings for someone else and I don’t want to date while I’m still in a physical relationship because that wouldn’t be fair to anyone. 

She says that she isn’t into dating anyone right now and that’s all fine, whatever. Again, I’ll be glad when she does but I want her to tell me so we can cut off the physical relationship we still have because I also think that it wouldn’t be fair to me or the other person she would be talking to. 

We fucked yesterday, and she said “I love you” unprompted before she left my apartment. 

I see today that she’s texting another person and apparently it’s in an intro-to-dating way. I said that I think she’s hiding something from me and she told me “you broke up with me so you don’t get to be jealous,” but I’m not. I got mad because I feel like I shouldn’t be involved with her in the way that I am at the moment if she wants to be dating other people. I think it’s a scum move to come into my apartment, hug and kiss me hello, cuddle up to me on the couch, and be texting someone else. She asked me for a hug after to calm down and I said no, I don’t want to because now we’re friend-friends, nothing more, nothing less, and I’m not very physical with my friends at all. I see that she’s upset and I think she may have been crying but I’ve been very honest about what I expect from what we have and while I do not think that she was lying to me, I think that she was not being truthful. 

I don’t know. This entire month has been really fucking weird. 

I’m not too proud to apologize but I don’t think that I am in the wrong. Again, am open and receptive to criticism / advice but please don’t be mean about it :(",02Nov2020,1
347,"Warning, long story!!

So, I (M) am friends with this person (F), and around last month, she started bringing up that I did not try enough / care enough in our friendship. I found that really odd though since I call her almost every day with the exception of me having to do work and other personal things. And she would sometimes ignore me for hours if I did something to annoy or anger her and I would try a lot to get her to talk to me but I just stopped trying so much because it was a lot of work and it happened sometimes. And she took that the wrong way thinking I don’t care about her when I really do and then we got into this fight recently but I didn’t say my opinion to her because she was crying and emotional and I wanted her to be happier rather than being depressed for a couple of days so I decided to not say my side which was probably the wrong move but she said I’m a bad friend for not calling her or deliberately ignoring her calls even though I’m busy with school. And she would leave me to talk to other people and I was fine with that but when she came to talk again she told me who it was, I guess to make me feel jealous I’m not sure, and it didn’t bother me because I don’t want to force her to talk to me if she doesn’t feel like it but now she starts saying I didn’t try hard enough and now I don’t care about her which makes no sense because I do and I’ve even bought her a present that she wanted and I don’t know what to do because I still want to be her friend (I’m also too scared to say my opinion or else she will get even more hurt so I really am confused).",02Nov2020,1

351,"My girlfriend has emotionally unstable these days. When she is in good mood, she told me that she is depressed from a lot of things like feeling under-achieved in her career (although she is above average in terms of career and finances), feeling no one  love her, no one is there for her and so on.

I try to help her too. But i am not good with words. Whenever there is a problem, I tend to focus on solving that problem and not on emotions. But it is generally because I don't know how to make people feel better. I am not a fun guy either. For my own problems too, although I suffer, I try to stay focus, plan and keep going forward without letting my emotions kick in. So when it comes to helping someone with emotional issues,  I am not a good fit. 

 Another problem is that we are currently in long distance relationship. So I cannot take care of her physical wellbeing either. 

To compound to the problems, I have also been under the weather lately. I have many problems in my life as I am trying to change my career right after I graduated from university. It feels like my whole life is at stake at this point. So I am generally stressed all the time although I don't let people know about it. 

When she is depressed, she tends to get upset at me even with minor details. It feels like I am walking on thin ice everytime we talk. Although i am normally very patient, I am also short-tempered lately in response to her. She told me that she just wants me to love her, but she get upset at me so often that I don't even know how to make her feel loved anymore. 

So we don't get along at all those days. I can still see her suffering. And she might hurt herself as well. She told me that she have done so before. But I don't know how to hep her either. Is there something I can do? Is staying away for now really the best option?",02Nov2020,1

We spoke on the phone for a few hours and we even commented on how easy and great the conversation was. We found out we have a lot on common and there was flirting and whatnot. We then met a few days later for dinner. It was more of the same (good conversation) i tried to be as flirty but respectful as possible; in hindsight i never found a good balance ( first date in a while). There was lots of compliments and touching of hands and arms. I walk her to her car and i gave her a hug and we said goodbye. Next day i comment on the quality of  our date on how it was great. She replied with more “tame” texts and i could feel something was up. Next day i ask if i left a bad impression ( bad move i know smh ). She then sends me this... “You definitely didn't. I kind of recently got ghosted by a co-worker and I still have lingering feelings. Which is also why I stopped using tinder. I just don't feel open to the possibility of getting my feelings hurt again. I'm sorry, you seriously are great company.”.... So thats where i am at now. I ended up saying,” getting ghosted sucks but to hmu whenever”, now idk if thats a good response but basically there has been no activity since.

Instead of checking it the next day, I waited another day because I was scared that I would have an email that required a immediate response (I didn’t, thank god!) 

I can barely stand to look at my sons grades at school, and the longer I wait to check them, the harder it becomes. Same goes for HOA letters, credit card statements, etc. Basically, I avoid anything that could potentially cause me stress, even though I end up even more stressed over not knowing. I am a 34 year old woman, professional, mother, wife, and homeowner. I am aware that this is absolutely unacceptable behavior for anyone who wants to be successful, but the anxiety I feel when I think of tackling problems is often too much for me to bare.

359,"I'm in my late 30s and I feel like I've done everything I can. I expect I will live long as I have always taken very good care of myself physically. However, I'm not sure what point there is to it or what I'm supposed to do for another 50-60 years of this.

I read one study on male life satisfaction which said men tend to derive a lot of their value in life from their jobs. I'm lucky in that respect. I work as a doctor and it is very gratifying work. It suits me well and people tell me I'm good at it. 

Besides that I don't have many ideas. I loved video games when I was a kid because I was too weak/small for sports. I gave those up though when I hit puberty because I wanted to be more attractive to women, and I thought I should do something more interesting/valuable with my time. So then I picked up music and learned around 4 instruments pretty well. I spent years doing that but it got repetitive eventually. 

I learned some basic circuit design and soldering to build some electronics. I learned computer programming and designed some programs. I was learning a new spoken language but it just seemed pointless after a bit so I dropped it.

I've traveled but not over the whole world. Though honestly I don't know the point at this stage. Where would I go? Why? Who would I go with? I can't think of any good ideas. I think if I just booked a flight somewhere I would get there and feel lonely and isolated with nothing to do and no one to hang out with. I've read of good looking guys doing this and then meeting random women there on Tinder but I can't do that.

I have all the material things I could want. Nothing more I want to buy I don't own. A lot of my money each year now goes into retirement savings not because I care about retirement - I just don't have anything I want.

The only other things I would have liked to have spent time on would have been having kids but I've had some medical issues and I wouldn't want to risk having kids with the same problems. Plus also it would have been really nice to have been able to date around or have sex with some hot girls. That is probably my biggest unfulfilled wish. But I was unwell when I was younger and I'm also not physically attractive enough for dating sites/apps. Now I'm too old too. Just deleted my last app today and I'm done. I've thought about sugar babies but I don't know if it suits me. 

I spent thousands of hours in bars/clubs when I was younger, including trying to chat up women. Not keen to go back to that. I've volunteered plenty when I was younger. I don't see the point in that now since as a doctor I am helping people in a more valuable way than I ever could as a volunteer. I feel like the best public service I can provide is working as hard as I can to make people happy/healthy/successful in life.

I work out every day but that doesn't take long. I've skydived, scuba dived, snowboarded, skied, skated, swam, wakeboarded, skateboarded, and biked all the nature trails within 2 hours of me. I've learned to cook all the things I like to eat, but most days I just like simple/plain food.

I've always been a very motivated person. But for the first time in my life the weekends come and I really don't know what to do with them. I don't really have any goals or purpose. The idea of another 50-60 years of this seems tedious. It seems like it will be a vast expanse of repeating the same things over and over while I get older and older and just wait for death.

Any ideas?",02Nov2020,1

361,"Straight off the bat, my ex was incredibly distant during the relationship and refused to ever hug me or hold my hand let alone anything else. 

From this it’s kinda of spawned this subconscious feeling of unworthiness, like I’m not good enough to be loved and the worst part is that I’ve recently met the sweetest guy. He’s so kind hearted and funny, literally everything I look for in a guy, but still those thoughts linger.

I’m really willing to try and make things work with him but it’s hard to allow that vulnerability again when half of me avoids relationships out of a fear of rejection I suppose. 

Anywho, I don’t really know what to do and figured the best place to get unbiased advice is the internet, so let me know what y’all think. Thank you!!",02Nov2020,1

The following days I past her sometimes to say hi, but it seemed like she didn't dare look me in the eyes anymore. We had a bit of a rough patch the past year. With her deleting me on messenger and such. 

I guess it's best for me to move on? 
She didn't add me again now, so i think she's not interested anymore..

367,"So there’s this friend who I really like. Is a very important part of my day, we talk a lot. It’s all really fun, and I really adore this person. But this person sometimes says and does things that kind of hurt me, or makes me feel very shitty. I have sometimes expressed this, but there’s very little to no change in behavior. Some days when I’m already feeling bad about things, she still does her whole routine that she knows makes me feel bad. It’s like she doesn’t really care that I get upset, as long it’s funny for her to see me triggered. 
So as much as I love her, I try to avoid her on my bad days, but I feel like it shouldn’t be like that.
I’m always there for her, and I always know how to read moods. Everytime she’s going through something, I listen and empathize and help her out. Our conversations are generally a lot of savage banters, but if it’s a rough day for her, I’m nice and understanding, and go easy.

370,"Well okay, that's not technically true: I also have £1500 in a savings account for when I eventually move out of my parents place. But said amount is for said event. Currently unemployed, but give £150 to my parents every month (my request; I wanted to go higher).

Shops and stuff are going to be closing for a month now, so I shouldn't be doing any care free spending in the near future, but I think this has been a wake up call in how poor I am at managing money. It hurts to see that I started this month with £1,536.83. (Side note, how bad is it that I spent £631 in only a month?)

Thinking/looking back at my transactions, I had a really bad phase of donating to any sob story I saw advertised on websites. I'd check if the cause was legit, but I was throwing around £20 a pop; sometimes more if they were so close to their goal. I couldn't help it: those kids were crying and suffering: I fell right into their manipulation.

Not all my investments are so noble: there's of course buying food for lunch at college (usually no more than £10) and video games that I am desperate to play (even now i'm contemplating games i've wanted for awhile that are also on sale).

Some of the changes I need to make are obvious; stop doing the above. And I have another payment (student loan) down the pipeline.

371,"I'll try to explain this best I can but sorry for any mistakes, it is really hard for me to put my feelings towards this into words.

I broke up with my ex in February and since then slowly started dating again. I realized through this that our relationship was very toxic and it left me with abandonment issues and the feeling of not being enough. This seemed to prove (and also implement) itself further during a few failed talking stages. So I thought to myself I'm going to use this to try myself out and have the typical post-breakup ""hoe phase"". Went quite alright even though i never felt satisfied by anyone. I recently met this guy that seems to be everything I ever wanted: we have the same interests, the same hobbies and he is very good looking. We even talked about my lack of romantic interest and he told me that I shouldnt worry about it and would only help me not to get attached and get my heart broken. 
Through him I realized something may be wrong with me. The usual crushes I would have disappeared. I didn't think too much of it and we started hooking up because I still find him physically attractive and hes good in bed. Our most recent hook up left me feeling very confused though: Sex was never something that satisfied me completely and I didn't really get aroused so we awkwardly had to stop and even when we tried later that night, same problem. I wanted it but it was like my body was blocking everything. The times before I had a similar issue and we tried to work around it/blame it on circumstances/etc. This time was different though because there was nothing else to blame. It has to be something underlying because I felt comfortable and safe with him, so that's not what I couldve responded to. 
It's like I want sex but when it happens I think to myself that its not worth it/cant satisfy me. Since then I feel really bad about my body, cant touch or look at my private parts or chest because everything fills me with guilt. Theres this constant thought that if ""I'm not good enough to date"" I should be ""good enough for sex"" and now I cant even be that. I know it sounds extreme and I know that I am worth more than just physical stuff but that's just how my brain phrases it... And I realized that when I meet someone and they do the things I always wanted someone to do for me, I loose interest. Anyone maybe knows what to do or how to cope with it?

Tldr; I dont feel romantically or sexually attracted to anyone anymore and dont know how to deal with it.",02Nov2020,1

But I work in a nursing environment and I was talking to a resident and he's the kind to joke a lot. Like ""oh I want a side of steak with my meal"" type of jokes. But when i was walking away he goes ""hey woman!""
And so I said in a joking way, ""that's not my name""
""Well you don't got a name tag.""
""Well, you don't have one either but I don't see me calling you ""man"". 
Him and the guy next to him didn't seem offended but I feel like shit. It wasn't funny and i feel disrespectful.  To anyone who says I'm overreacting, maybe. But I just so badly don't want to have any problems here and I open my stupid mouth and say some dumb shit like this.

374,"So recently I sort of stopped hanging out with my “friends,” and it’s a long story but I have a lot more time to myself now. Before covid id hangout with someone probably 2-3 times a week and I was very social and stuff, but now I hangout with someone once a month and for a number of reasons I’ve just sort of just kept to myself.

I just feel like I’m trapped in my mind in a way, and I have these racing fantasies about hypothetical situations, situations with girls, fantasizing about other situations in everyday life and like it just feels like a show in my head. And at night these fantasies almost come to life and I’m not really controlling them and I’ll be in a state of half awake and half asleep, and it’s like I’m experiencing these fantasies like they’re really happening, I’ll experience real feelings and be able to picture everything in my mind. 

It’s like playing movies in my mind or like tapes, and I see myself in the third person most of the time, and I’m like the main character. This used to happen when I had a crush on a girl, but now I’m doing it to girls who I know I have no chance with, and i just play games in mind.

It honestly just feels mentally taxing but I can’t help myself ,and I might just ruminate and ruminate for hours on end and sometimes I’ll have that vividness I’m describing, but usually it’s only at night. 

Yesterday for example I was just having this situation play out where for some reason I was contemplating the logistics of going skinny dipping with this girl, and I was thinking about all the intricacies, the emotions I was feeling, and then I played it out in a way that I felt would get the outcome that I wanted. I’ve been feeling more lonely and like I feel like a psycho for thing like all these things and I feel sort of troubled by them. 

And I’m exercising myself a whole bunch and I try to tire myself out, but my mind just races and races. I’ll weightlift for an hour and run 5 miles which might take around 40-50 minutes, and I’m sort of exhausted but I’m just gotten used to it. 

I have started trying to read at night also but really the only thing that works, is if I stay up until I’m utterly exhausted and that’s pretty much the only time I’ll fall asleep super easily.

On the other hand, I do not receive any sexual interaction from her side. During this whole time we’ve been together she has only touched my junk twice. This obviously makes me feel sexually unsatisfied, which, in turn, makes me horny all the time.

When I tried to talk to her about this she said that it’s a psychological thing. I gave that talk another shot and she says that she feels like a slut when giving me hj/bj.

377,"Haha sorry the title is so dramatic, but the background is that my parents are in a really, REALLY toxic relationship. They will go out of their way to not talk to one another and piss each other off. They are constantly angry at each other and they treat each other like animals, screaming at each other. Sometimes even resulting in violence.

After years, I've finally convinced my mother to leave my father. The plan was to move to another apartment and my mom would separate from him. But something happened... you see my dad was supposed to mail in the rent, but he never did, and we ended up being 2 months late for rent.

We only found out about it because a man came to our apartment. But because of this, it stained my mom's record and no apartment would accept us, making it so we can't leave until next year.

The thing is, my parents aren't bad people or bad parents. But they are so bad for each other and I just want to see them both happy. I want them to separate for their own good because, in the end, I'm afraid they might end up killing each other.

But here I am in the middle, and I don't know what to do. Is there anything I can do? Are there people I can go to for this? Because I do feel that it is affecting me, and my little sister. Please if any of you can help, it would be more than welcome.

378,"Throwaway because this is kinda embarrassing, also don't want it tied to my actual account. Also mobile, blah blah blah.

I'm very lazy, and can't get myself motivated to clean, haven't really in over a year, resulting in my roommates to take care of the common areas. In the last place I lived, my roommates would occasionally shoot me a quick text or mention something passing by, but wouldn't really bother me that much, and therefore, I rarely washed my dishes and took out the trash maybe twice in the year I was there. 

I also rarely ever took care of my room, including picking up any food, so it stank by the end of the year (mentioned to me by my parents as they were helping me move out), there was an occasional cockroach, and there was a huge black spot on the wall from where I put my feet up, obviously saying that I didn't clean myself well, and, though I'm still probably not 100% where I should be, I've been improving on that aspect. 

However, what I haven't been improving on, is helping take care around the house. I moved in my new apartment mid July, with two roommates I haven't met before. They've had meetings with me twice so far about my uncleanness twice so far, the first in early September and again today. One of my roommates is now barely here due to me being unable to clean after myself. 

The talk today is, at least for the moment, really finally sticking with me, for the first time since I moved away from my parents. I've already pretty much finished cleaning out the food in my room to lessen the chance of roaches, though I know there's still a lot I need to do, and I'll need to keep up with helping my roommates clean.

What I'm worried about is falling back to where I was, and not being motivated enough to even try to clean up. After a couple days of being motivated and actually doing some decent cleaning, how do I continue the process even when I'm not feeling up to it?",02Nov2020,1

381,"Hello,  I need a little help. For a little background, I have bad anxiety especially when it comes to talking to people when I feel like I am being an inconvenience. I am studying Fashion Design and I am earning my associates degree at the end of this semester I have my capstone project which will be shown in an exhibition at my school. On my dress, I will be beading, and I recently bought my beads and spent 135$ on beads, objectively way too much. But I bought them because I didn't want to bother the nice woman who owned the store, more than I already had. My Mom is paying for all of this and I told her it was 100$ (I have issues with impulsive lying I'm working on it but when I'm stressed I can't help it) and she was furious, while we aren't exactly poor my parents have always stressed budgeting and not wasting money on unnecessary things. She told me that she was expecting 20$ or so on the beads. So I just spent a few hours reworking my design to use fewer beads.  I'm pretty sure the store does do returns, (I did email them haven't heard back yet) and I managed to save 75$. Now that brings the real price tag down to 70$, but the fake one to 25$. 

&amp;#x200B;

What I am very stressed about is should I tell the truth to my Mom, my Mom really doesn't like it when I lie and usually gets angry with me. I'm also worried about the store owner whom I now have to go back and take away the 75$ she made.  This lady was great she was super helpful and nice and I feel so bad for going back to say I don't need more than half the beads I bought from you the other day. I know this is probably my anxiety going nuts again but I can't seem to calm down on this.

Sorry, this is so long I shortened it as much as I could.

P.S. I'm worried I make my Mom look bad in this she's a great loving Mother whose always there for me but just doesn't take crap from anyone.

I’ve been dating my (28)boyfriend for over 2 years now. Him &amp; I first started by hooking up. He first asked me how many ppl I hooked up with &amp; I lied &amp; said 4 or 5 because I was embarrassed to tell him that he was the second guy I hooked up with. I meet him because we worked in the same bar together. My ex boyfriend before him used to work there as well &amp; we were highschool sweethearts. I broke up with after I turned 19. So my boyfriend knew my ex boyfriend from highschool &amp; knew about our relationship &amp; break up. 

My current boyfriend is the next guy I hooked up with after I broke up with ex boyfriend &amp; we happened to get into a relationship 6 months later. There’s a 6 year age difference between us &amp; I knew he hooked up with a lot of girls before. He hooked up with 24 girls. I felt really embarrassed when he asked so I lied about my number being higher. I know it’s wrong to lie but my lack of experience with other people made me insecure because of how experienced he is with other girls. 

Last year he started acted really different, he did a lot things that were really wrong &amp; it hurt me a lot but i choose to forgive him because I love him a lot. He eventually told me that he’s acting diffident &amp; did all those horrible things bc he’s hurt over the fact that I was hooking up with someone else while I was hooking up with him. He believes that I hooked up with a 40 year old regular at our bar. I told him it’s not true but he refuses to believe me. He says everything points to it &amp; im just lying. I explained to him about why I lied about how many people I hooked up with but he just thinks I’m trying to cover it up. I don’t know how I can make him believe it’s not true. 

He said he had a hunch at time when we were just hooking up &amp; people told him that I did. He said during the time we were just hooking up, I had a “gaping vagina” &amp; it closed up right after we got exclusive. I truly didn’t hook up with anyone else but he says if that’s the case then I should be able to explain why my vagina was like that. 

He went through my phone &amp; Uber trips &amp; he thinks I’m just really good at covering my tracks. He keeps saying he just wants me to admit it, he doesn’t care that I did but he doesn’t like how I’m capable of continually lying to him about it &amp; let him suffer. He says not having answers affect him mentally &amp; affects every aspect of his life. But I honestly didn’t do it &amp; I don’t have any answers for him because it never happened.

387,"Figured this would be the best place to post this, as I have made my intentions clear and we are definitely not dating, just friends who sometimes have sex. I’ll try be brief cause it’s an absolute shit storm of a story. So I (24) have been sleeping on and off with this girl (24), who we will call Y for about a year and a half. Her previous ex was extremely controlling and physically abusive towards her, as a result she developed some psychological issues. Mainly just PTSD from the relationship, however, she continues to go back to him as she has admitted an unhealthy attachment to him due to shared trauma and a long history. Now I know this dude, use to be friends back in the day, however, I heard he went off the rails, got into heavy drugs etc. But relationship wise from what I’ve heard, in summary, this dudes toxic. I can count at least 5-6 times Y and I met up, only to not chat for months after cause she went back to him.

Now I’m extremely relaxed, this chicks good to talk to, the sex is fun and we have good conversations. However, I don’t like Y in an emotional attachment sort of way. She’s admitted her feelings to me prior and I was honest and said I’m not looking at anything serious/I’d like to stay friends etc and from memory she immediately went back to her ex. Since the convos are on and off, I’m talking we maybe talk for a week, meet up 2-3 times and then I don’t hear from her for 2-4 months and then we rekindle, rinse, repeat. The 2-4 month period where I don’t hear from her is cause she gets back with her abusive ex and then something traumatic happens and then it’s over, but really it’s not. 

Alright that’s the back story, now heres my role. So shes spoken pretty highly of me to her mum we’ll call her X, not sure why but I’ve spoken to X a few times through fb. X obviously detests the abusive ex of Y, but from what I gathered X seems like a genuine caring mum, so I pay her the same respect but try to avoid all the drama. Anyways the last big incident involving the ex and Y once again involved police, not sure on the details but he was on parole for another offence with Y. 

Me and Y met up a few nights back, she stayed the night as well.

389,"I find it very difficult to get to sleep most nights, mostly due to anxiety causing racing thoughts, overthinking and ‘mountain out of molehill’ type thinking. 

Sometimes it’s also my body that won’t fall asleep, my heart will be too fast or I just won’t be able to physically relax despite being mentally exhausted. Again an anxiety symptom. 

I’m writing this at 8am (UK), having not slept since I woke up for work yesterday at 3pm. This happens a lot, partly due to not being able to fall asleep, but also because I’m so bad at waking up once I actually do get to sleep that I reach a point in the night where I’m too scared to sleep incase I miss my alarm and end up hours late for work or uni.

394,"tl;dr: Already went to Japan with friends once. Before the pandemic I wanted to go on a solo trip to Japan this December. Pandemic hit plans were postponed until things clear up. Lately I've been wanting to postpone the solo adventure in favor of going with a few friends. Issue is one of my reasons for the solo trip to Japan was to help determine if I'd like to move there, if at the very minimum for a couple of years. Should I subdue my feelings and solo this trip or should I embrace them and further postpone/cancel my solo plans? Thank you very much for reading this and for any help you can provide. ありがとうございました！

&amp;#x200B;

I've already been to Japan with a group of friends once for 2 weeks. Not sure if this will help with your advice, but I thought it might. Before the pandemic, and after my first trip, I was planning on going on a solo trip to Japan around this December. Obviously I'm not doing that anymore, but shortly after this pandemic is over (basically when a vaccine comes out and restrictions have been lifted) is when I've decided to postpone my trip to. My confliction is that before the pandemic I 100% without a doubt in my mind wanted to solo this trip, maybe talk to some locals at bars (learning Japanese right now) and just have a casual time of exploration and fun. More recently, however, I've been wanting to see if a few friends would like to join me on this trip, the issue is part of me still wants to solo this thing and so now I kinda don't know what to do. Another catch is one of the reasons I wanted to solo this trip was to see how I would enjoy Japan if I were to move there alone (since I would like to move there for at least a couple of years if not the rest of my life). Of course 2 to 3 weeks in any country isn't enough to make such an important decision, it doesn't help that I'm not actually living there and am just vacationing thus only enjoying the fun side of Japan without exposing myself to Japan's negative side which I know exists, i.e. working conditions. But, it's honestly the closest I can get to the feeling of living in Japan alone short of moving there myself. I would greatly appreciate any advice from anyone about whether I should subdue my feelings of wanting to go on this trip with a few friends or embrace those feelings and postpone the solo trip.

396,"Hi guys 

I don’t want to see the world as a “dog eat dog world” but it’s undeniable that the world is full of people who don’t have your best intentions in mind or perhaps don’t even register your intentions at all at this point and just see an opportunity to gain something from nothing. 

I live my life for myself but when I see people struggling I like to help because I know that when I have been there myself personally or if I can understand their position, I know I’d surely appreciate the help.

I sincerely don’t give to receive or for self gratification or for the undying debt and gratitude of the other party. 

I always try to give someone the benefit of the doubt and try and see the best in them and nurture the best in them because I know the impact of the right people at the right time appealing to the best in you. 
Even just the most random acts of kindness of strangers have impacted my life. 

Time and time again people take advantage though. I try not to get bitter, I don’t get vengeful. I just try and empathize with their situation and see the human experience within them which allowed themselves to become so desperate to abandon their morals and take advantage of someone and say “well.. perhaps if I was in their exact circumstances, perhaps I might become so desperate as to take advantage of someone also” and kinda just try to forgive and move on. 

To hold onto each indiscretion and take it personally would be so so so consuming mentally, physically and legally.

My friend told me years ago that angry or resentment is like hot coal. If you hold onto it, you’re only hurting yourself. The other person doesn’t care. So I try not to hold onto any indiscretion against me and try to find the humanity in their decision.

Time and time again though I’m shown that people will take advantage if you let them.

So I guess what I’m asking is. What’s the alternative?

Do I let the negative experiences win and accept that life is just a “dog eat dog world”? 

I refuse to think that way because then those people who have given me the negative experiences have won.

I’ll just become another dark person in these increasingly dark times and perhaps someone who does truly need a hand will miss out and be consumed thinking the world is just a horrible “dog eat dog world” and perpetuate the behaviors that will lead to more people doubting if they should help or just help themselves until everyone is just out for themselves.

When she came back to the hospital she was acting somewhat normal again, but then it happened again she just had an episode where she was screaming in pain and acting the same way. My dad took her to the hospital again and they did nothing. Now, tonight she was acting even more insane, screaming in pain, saying random things, completely lost her mind. When she first went to the hospital the doctor said that she was acting this way because of a panic attack but I don’t believe that it’s a panic attack anymore because she was acting like this all day today, just delusional, she wasn’t listening to what we were saying and not answering our questions. So me and my sister took her back hospital because we generally don’t know what to do, like when I say she lost her mind, she is completely gone and acting like a complete crazy person. She can barely stand on her own and tonight at the hospital she was so out of it she couldn’t even answer simple questions like what year it was, who the president is, or how many kids she has.

404,"Hi all,

I've been at my current retail workplace for the past year and 8 months on a part-time basis. I'm a university student graduating soon, and I've been wanting to seek new opportunities that are related to my degree and would be beneficial for my professional experience.

My current workplace is soon entering a peak period (coming towards Christmas/New Year) which is the busiest time of the year for them. My director has informed me they are expecting me to work more shifts during this time. This time is incredibly stressful each year. We're usually short-staffed, and it's generally exhausting for everyone. We pretty much work the whole year in preparation towards this end of year period. 

I have been actively applying for new positions and discussing career progression with mentors and peers. However, this plaguing feeling of guilt has overcome me for if I was to have to go ahead and quit my current job. I understand that moving onto a role more suited to my university study would be beneficial for me, but I feel like leaving my current employer so soon before this peak period when I know that they need me to work would be selfish. The thought of quitting my job has been on my mind for the past few months, and I have found my workplace to be toxic (rude managers, gossiping, poor treatment of staff, high staff turnover). Which is probably why I have this awful, selfish, guilty feeling to decide to leave.

If anyone had any advice on how to overcome this feeling of guilt or how I could approach this situation, I would really appreciate it. Thank you : )",02Nov2020,1
405,"So I started university in a foreign country last year and feel into the wrong friend's group. I didn't realize initially how toxic it was for my well being.

Among that group, I hate this guy the most! He is such a narcissistic person who has no respect for personal boundaries. He would often try to make jokes about my personal life, talk shit behind my back and push me down.

Also, once when I was drunk, he (and that group of friends) sexually assaulted me and he thinks it's funny and would often tell others about that incident to embarrass me.

All this happened in a span of 4 months when they used to live in the same student house as me. But once, that group moved into another student house together, I have continuously avoided them and am doing my best to cut them out of my life

All in all, he and that toxic group's effect was so bad on me that it deteriorated my mental health and I was considering to drop out of that university.

So anyway, for the second year, I have moved to another building which is quite far away from where these people live and have been living well, until yesterday, when I received a message from the guy where he tells me he is also moving to my building. His room will be on the next floor of my room ( which means if my room is on floor x, his will be on floor x +1).

Since he told me that, I have been feeling anxious and am recollecting bad memories about how I was treated last year. I really don't want to see him but now I have to deal with seeing him in the elevators, corridors, common areas etc. All this is making me feel really nervous and uncomfortable.

Their roommate(hereafter referred to as L) and I get along well, and she's certainly not afraid to make jokes/innuendo about us, but I can't tell if she's serious or not, and I really don't want to be the guy who thinks that just because a woman is comfortable talking about sex and making sex jokes with him means that there's anything deeper going on. But at the same time, my roommate's spouse say that when asked about some of her ""jokes"", L says that she's serious. 

I suppose that on the surface, the situation is pretty simple; ask L if she's just joking or of there's actually something going on here and go from there. Here's my problem with that; I really don't want to make things weird with these people. They're my best friends, and I like what we all have, and I don't want to make any kind of move that would jeopardize that. And I know rationally that I probably wouldn't mess anything up,  but the idea that it could happen is enough to make me nervous. 

So, I  guess what I'm asking is this; should I trust that my friends a) know their roommate better than me and b) would be understanding if L and I started dating, or should I just chalk it up to we're all just really good friends and comfortable enough with each other to make suggestive statements and jokes about each other and leave it at that.

My boyfriend is a key to my happiness and successful future. I don't want anyone on here to say ""focus on your career"" or ""there's more to life than men"" when honestly Iv been there with having a fancy career, having tons of girlfriends, investing time in other things, but nothing makes me happier and fills me with more joy than the thought of marriage, children and our own little happy family.

He always says I am, and he has said we will get married in the near future when he and I are both financially ready.
So recently I've been struggling with my depression, and my boyfriend is definitely having a hard time motivating me to do things.

This meaning shes forcing me to go to ""motivational trainings"", forcing me to go to college and do all of those things, waking me up every day, asking how i am doing 1000 times a day etc etc. The problem is, i thought my mental health was getting better, the psychotheraphy helped im sure, but in reality my mental health is falling apart and at this point likely worse than it has ever been, i just cant tell anyone since they are ""proud"" of me getting out of the what they considered a mess i was in. My parents believe that i am 100% incompetent to do anything on my own let alone lead a life and that is driving me insane, and realistically i have no general life goals or direction.. other than listening to depressing emo or rap songs and making a few of mine own for fun with no real effort. My moms says that if i dont put myself in the ""right"" place that she will by all means neccesarry, but her definition of living a good life is clearly different than mine. I never valued material things at all, while both my parents opsess over making money and are honestly rich, but would never give me money directly. I managed to save up enough money for me to live on my own in a rented small apartmant for some months to a year max, and im seriously considering just doing it, since living this forced life where im controlled and told to do with basically no free will and treated as if i would die of a heroin overdose if left on my own is driving me insane. Do i do it? When do i do it? how do i do it? what do i say to my mom, she knows way more than my dad does.. please help me",02Nov2020,1

I’ve been staying at my friends house ( we sleep next to each other and do sexual stuff ) the last week and a half. 4-5 days ago friend has a sore throat one night, takes some medicine and is fine 


Next few days I’m sneezing a few times a day, have an occasionally runny nose, occasional watery eyes, throat almost hurts / feels weird , 


**excess lucid, spitting out mucus etc**

Yesterday/ this morning I started losing my voice but today it’s kinda there 



Now for the last few hours I definitley have held in a few coughs. Out of respect for his roommate I want to leave before I start coughing which I feel like I will start to but I have family at home



Can I go home or should I wait to get tested? Doesn’t the sneezing indicate that it’s more likely a cold than corona? As welll as the phlegm?",02Nov2020,1
426,"I'm 2/3 of my way through university (we have three years in New Zealand) and I think I may have made a mistake. I decided to pursue Fashion design and I love it...but I suck at it. I can't sew. The classes go by to fast and I struggle to keep up. I got my results back and I failed a core class (4.5 points away from passing!). With the pandemic situation I let my grades slip and I didn't have the energy to continue struggling. It's my fault I failed. If I tried harder I would've passed. If I had tried just a /tiny/ bit harder.

Is it really worth it though? To struggle through a degree...and then what? Am I cut out for the world of fashion design? This year (my second year) I decided to take a minor in Ecology and Biodiversity...and my marks a good. Better than good. I'm not struggling in the slightest! And I enjoy it. 

So the question is; do I switch majors? Can I even do that this far into the game or would there be consequences like graduating later than my peers? How do I tell m parents that I had a change of heart (I'm always changing my mind about things and I don't want them to think I just gave up). And I don't want to give up. It hurts to think I came this far and failed. I took so many extra classes to catch up with my design major that were significantly harder than my Fashion classes (such as coding!!) and I managed them. But that was before the pandemic.

I'm mostly writing this to get it off my chest. 

I realized during the pandemic that I don't really /want/ to work. I realized I only applied to university to delay the inevitable. I just want to spend the rest of my days reading books and enjoying my hobbies. But you need money to do that. I've rambled off the path I originally came here to ask advice for:

429,"I'm a second-year university student and I have long since been struggling with ADHD symptoms, especially with classes and homework. Before COVID I thought what I was experiencing was normal because everyone online seems to make jokes about forgetting homework or attention and so on. Currently, because classes have all been online, I've noticed how difficult it's been for me to continue doing work for long periods of time (I noticed my friends working for 3+ hrs straight on schoolwork a day where I can go maybe 15 minutes every hour). Honestly, I convinced myself that I was lazy.

My father is very demanding about school and would probably see me using ADHD as an excuse for my procrastination (I regularly do essays the day they are due). But he majored in psychology and will understand my struggles with school if my symptoms stand up to a doctor's evaluation. My mother, on the other hand, struggles with her own issues and is 3 months in recovery and I don't want to worry her or put something more on her plate. I want my parents to see this as an actual problem and not an excuse but I don't know how to approach them about this.

434,"I am 13 years old, and my uncle recently came up with a proposition for me. If I learned trigonometry from a tuition teacher, he would buy me Minecraft. I studied trigonometry, and asked my uncle for Minecraft.

At the time of this deal, my parents agreed, but now they are back tracking, and saying that the only way I would get Minecraft, is if I download it on my mother's computer, because they didn't trust that I would be responsible if I had unlimited access. That would be a perfectly fair point, if not for them already agreeing to let me install it on my laptop. As a compromise, they suggested installing it on my laptop, but only with parental controls, on that app specifically.

I still do not like this situation, so is there a way to install a keylogger on my own computer to find out what is the password for the parental control settings? Also, I previously tried to use screen recording to find out the password of their iPad, but that didn't work, so will keyloggers even track the password?

I’m only 21, so quiet young, and never slept around or anything, mainly because Covid happen right after my break up and I’m not really that kinda person to even be with random strangers like that. Anyways, this guy I’ve known for many years who’s also my age has been talking to me since April, and expressed many times how he’s wanted to have a casual fling with me. For some reason I’ve been putting him off for like 6 months now, and won’t get the hint. I’m not confident in my body, but honestly I think I’m just not attracted to him. He almost begs for it, and I feel like I have the upper hand in the situation where I don’t even need to work for it, which I find desperate and sad. Also, I’ve mentioned to him I want to hangout first, and he only asks me to come to his house for sex. I don’t like the feeling of being used that he gives off to me, and I also don’t enjoy how he doesn’t want to even hangout with me before this sexual encounter he wants with me. Sometimes I feel ashamed I don’t sleep around, especially after my break up almost a year ago, but the one guy who’s been interested (I also haven’t had a job since covid so not much exposure to other men) I’m just not over interested in sleeping with and dealing with that whole situation.

441,"So, for context, I'm doing this part time online thingy that involves  web content creators. I was made the senior editor in the first week of October and continue to be so. I report directly to my supervisor/owner.

What bugs me the most is, since the past month, he has made it a habit to call me for every little thing. It's getting annoying now. He usually designates Saturday for reviews but ends up calling me 4-5 times a week anyway. And that's for stuff as trivial as changing the title, or some query about the newbies- stuff that could easily be handled over text. 

I hate it everytime my phone rings and it's him. He sucks away a lot of my time every time he calls (an average of 15-30mins, sometimes upto an hour). I would pick up the phone promptly in the initial days.. but now I have resorted to being selective.. just to send him a signal that I'm not that easily available.

He is shameless enough to insist on calling even when I ask him to talk over text. I want to slam him with an iron chair. 

What should I do? I don't want to sound rude..but I also want him to stop with all these calls.

I'm 15, my little sister (7yo) has 2 hours of online school in the morning and the rest of the day she spends on her tablet. I don't think a 7yo should own a tablet but whatever, her father gave it to her. My mom is a single mom and has been buried in work, so she doesn't have time for her . Her dad only comes to see her once every week - so the responsibility has fallen on me.Online school takes up most of my day +loads of homework (cause teachers really think we're on free now that we're at home), so I don't really play with her anymore.

On the first week of school I vomited every day soon as I got into school but luckily each time I made it to the toilet. This went away for about a month or so until last week when halfway through the school day I vomited again and this happened every day for that week. This is where the story takes a turn, I went into school today on the bus feeling like I was gonna vomit again but I tried to hold it in because all the previous times I needed to throw up on the bus I held it in until I got into school but I vomited everywhere: all over my clothes and over my seat. Luckily at the time there was no one sitting next to me but everyone noticed and were told to exit the bus and walk to school. I then got sent home and I’m writing this now. I’m expecting to get bullied for this now haha. My close friend has suggested that I might be nervous which I’m not.

I’ve notice a lot of old high school friends don’t ever hit me up and have been doing fairly ok despite the pandemic. They all come from really supportive families and my family hasn’t supported me financially outside of a roof over my head since forever. I’ve basically had to crawl out of my situation at home myself and have been supporting myself for a while and I used to feel really proud of that.

We stayed friends till the pandemic hit in mid March. After that I could not see her in person (haven't still) but we stayed connected virtually. Mid June she asked about our future and I was still determined to stay friends but we wanted some future. We did not talk over a month after that call. And after that we talked but it was not the same as before and we just texted now no video calls or even phone calls. In September she drops the bomb on my birthday that she loves me but does not give nay context. I tried to ignore it but somehow during this couple of months I started feeling for her. After my birthday she started ghosting me now and than and give weird replies why she wasn't available. Now I'm confused I have feelings for her and she has been a good friend in the past when I had no one but I don't know what to do now. Talking to her leads to more feeling and getting attention and being ignored randomly is too much taxing rn still in pandemic.

453,"Hi! I’d really love some opinions on this. This year I made friends with this guy on a road trip I went on with my best friend. I already knew him before but not as well as my best friend. For added context I did ask my boyfriend is he was okay with me going on this trip and he assured me he was. A lot of things happened on the road trip (natural disasters, getting stuck places etc). One night our off roader got stuck in a valley and me the guy had to walk out for hours to find help, it was freezing, there were landslides and we nearly died. We were only saved by pure coincidence that two other campers had gotten their vehicle stuck too and they gave us a tent to share till morning. We were stuck together for nearly 30 hours away from our friends so had a lot of time to talk and bond over something relatively traumatic. The trip was crazy but obviously everything was as all platonic as all of us are in long term committed relationships. 

When I got back my boyfriend didn’t want to hear anything about my trip, or how I’d had a really good time, literally anything. He made a lot of insinuations that I was lying about what happened (getting stuck, the tent etc), was angry about pictures we all got together because I looked “happier with him” etc. He’s never spoke to the guy and decided immediately he didn’t like him, for no reason in particular. He doesn’t want me to be friends with him at all, which I’m very sad about because I think he’s a genuinely good person and someone I get along really well with. There’s nothing there and honestly I don’t have many friends so I was happy to make a friend and sad that my boyfriend was so against this. There’s really no reason for him to be, we’ve had a few arguments that haven’t been resolved. He’s said most recently he “doesn’t care what I do” and that “if I cheated on him I’d be doing him a favour” and that I can be friends with this guy as long as “he never hears about it”. I feel his attitude is very controlling and he really doesn’t have a basis to be so angry and I suspicious. His accusations of me lying and cheating etc are very hurtful as I’ve done a lot for my boyfriend to prove I’m trustworthy, honest and love him. Also I don’t know why he’s jumping to those conclusions. 

Honestly I really need help because I’ve been in abusive relationships before and I tend to let myself just be controlled by other people and do everything to make them happy vs doing what I want (even if it wouldn’t hurt them). I kind of told him ok I won’t be friends with him but I feel I’m letting myself be walked over, if he had a reason to feel this way I would probably have a different perspective, but it doesn’t seem like he has a reason other than he just “doesn’t like him” despite having never interacted with the guy in any capacity. 

For a little extra context I originally met these guys (not my bf) playing league of legends and they’re in a group I’ve been playing games with since I was 16 with my best friend. If he doesn’t want me to be friends with this guy I assume he won’t be happy with me playing games in the same group as him. This would mean an essential part of my social life is cut off and half the activities I do with my best friend too. As I said before I really don’t have many friends so this is all kind of sad and weird and confusing for me. 

TLDR: my boyfriend doesn’t want me to be friends with a guy friend, has told me that if I do be friends with him that he can’t hear about it. He has no justification for not  liking him or judging him and has said he “trusts me but not him”. Feel like I’m letting myself be controlled and walked over, equally don’t know if he needs a justification. Is keeping my friend worth upsetting my boyfriend ?",02Nov2020,1

456,"He’s 25m. We’ve known each other well over a year, we kind of sort of work together.. our work is project based and we’re never on the same project so no issues or heavy interaction there. (We work in a laboratory and have very similar skills so it’s pretty much guaranteed any given project will only need one of us.) 

We started talking a whole lot more than before in July. We met up and hung out a few times with insanely good vibes. I definitely caught him staring at my boobs a lil bit here and there, and there were a few moments of pure connection like the kind where you just stare and smile. Neither of us directly addressed it because hanging out in that sense was new.

Things continued to grow. In late September, due to COVID, he moved about two hours away. This was a pretty serious decision but his rent is so much lower that I sincerely couldn’t have made an argument against the move if I wanted to. Regardless, he wrote me a list of pros and cons before he made any decisions and made it clear he was taking my opinion in high regard. I made it clear I want him to do what he feels is best, and that I would still definitely be in touch even with him moving. 

We still talk daily, and egregiously. People have noticed and are definitely curious what is between us- Some of our texts take 30+ minutes to type out a reply to and honestly our connection runs quite deep. This pattern of long novel style paragraphs, zoom calls, and Snapchats aplenty has been going on since July even when we could easily see each other. We’ve both shared that we feel like we understand each other socially, financially, at work... and in domestic ways. We’ve talked about family, he’s quite excited/nervous to meet mine. I feel similarly about his. 

Sometimes in the weekly work zoom meeting he listens and reacts to my own ongoings as if they’re ‘ours.’ 

He told me he didn’t like a coworker who comes around to aimlessly flirt with me on very rare occasions. I asked him if he was jealous, he said yes. I am not interested in the other coworker and I made that clear to him by asking the coworker to be less flirty in the work chat which everyone totally respected. 

The other day he was talking about something he wanted and said “you, my parents, and my friends.” I wanted to ask if he’d purposefully intended to include me as my own category.. but I wrote it off as maybe a Freudian slip or just tired ramblings. 

Lots of normal flirtation, but not really ‘friendly’, stuff like this going on as we laugh and bond and enjoy our way thru these weird times. 

Here’s where I start to need advice.. His schedule is overstuffed, as is mine, so we rarely get to see each other right now and it will likely remain that way thru December, and then pick up into the same pattern from February to May. He’s been talking about how he’s unhappy with and wants to make life changes to allow himself enough freedom for happiness. He needs this. He’s been complaining about how when he considers driving over to this side of town or even just taking time off that isn’t meant to be productive he just kind of gets anxiety panic. He seems extremely legitimate in this. I could clearly feel how much it was tearing him apart to keep essentially all of his social interactions strictly virtual for the time being. His rent is much cheaper.. but he’s nearly always home to an extent I’m not surprised he’s feeling trapped. He wants to spend time together and with his other friends, but his workload is also not something easily changed at this time. After May he has plans to switch it up. 

I’m not sure how I can best support him thru this time. He claims to love how I continue inviting him basically everywhere I go because I always have a text from him and it’s easy to reply like “hey I’m at (location), probably won’t be able to text back for a minute but come on over” with lots of heart emojis but sometimes I feel like I’m aggravating his anxiety even though he says I’m not. 

I’m also not sure if like maybe I just need to ease up on the entire relationship and zone out for new perspective. I don’t think it’s friendly for someone I definitely have mutual attraction with to want to buy my mom dinner in a formal setting.. but it’s also probably not best for me to ask what his whole entire intentions are right now. 

I want to hear him explain his feelings toward me a little more openly than “you’re an amazing person to have around to say the least.” I wanted to reply like “thanks but tell me the most?” But I didn’t because I fear I’m being disrespectful or pressing my own wants. On one hand I feel a purely selfish desire to have him near me, on the other I feel like I’m not being as respectful of his life choices as I could be because I’m bending into desire. 

His friendship is most important to me above all.

I finally told my mum how id been feeling about myself/things in general and at first she said 'Oh! You can get a therapist!' then it was 'Oh!.. We'll just try things at home..' then 'I know this medication that your sister takes for something similar..' and now we just dont talk about it, even though this was literally last month. And i don't feel any better. I feel like all the little things build up until i just burst into tears. I decided to show my parents a movie I liked and they just talked about how bad it was the entire time. I get yelled at for spending too much time in my room but then when I come downstairs my mum is either doing work or cooking tea, then she goes to bed. So I dont get time to talk to anyone anyway. I dunno.. I know this is all stupid, I have friends who have actual diagnosed illnesses so I never really feel like I have the right to complain.

I met this girl last month and we started dating not too long after, it’s been almost a month and I’m in love with her, she has confessed she loves me as well and I believe her when she says it. This girl is amazing because I have never met anyone quite like her. In my eyes she is perfect and just the way she takes care of me In all the little ways really makes me feel how much she cares about me. She is going off to college next year and I’m so afraid she is going to meet some other more attractive intelligent college guy. I’ve been her first real love and many other first things for her. I don’t know if this is just paranoia because the relationship is still so young but I do not want to lose this girl. The thought of us ending or her leaving me for someone else scares me, and I don’t know how to get over this fear. I know she is younger than me and I feel like she is going to want to experience other guys and relationships.  Any advice on this would be great. I’m not sure if I’m just overthinking it or what.

460,"A friend of mine has been ignoring a huge infection in his mouth for the past few weeks, his face is bulbous and he's sleeping 12+ hours a day but he's refusing to get it checked. What can I do?",02Nov2020,1
461,"So basically, I’m not looking to be shamed and I’m not angry at this person. Honestly, I just feel so down, upset and kinda depressed. Please don’t judge or attack me. Long story short: a guy made out with me and I do not remember it at all. 

I had gone out with a group of friends recently. And this guy I knew him mostly on an acquaintance level, seemed pretty nice and never flirted or approached me in that manner while we were sober. I get to the party and I’m already a little tipsy but I can recall the events and there’s no sexual undertones, innuendos, touching or flirting. I start drinking with the group as most people do. The last thing I remember is talking to a friend then I blacked out. I do not remember a huge portion of the night, about 6 hours completely lost from my memory, I don’t even remember getting home. 

A couple days later I’m told over the phone that I had made out with this guy and that we were “all over each other”, I was heartbroken to tell you the truth, since he had never implied that kind of interest in me and i thought I was seemingly safe. I was also told him friend was playing wingman trying to set us up. So I just need some opinions/insight and advice on this and if I should feel guilty and just accept it was my doing or idk 

Just some side notes: we’re both 17 so there’s no big age gap and yes I know to be careful with drinking. 

Another side note: I’m bisexual and lean more towards women and really do not do this hookup thing like ever.",02Nov2020,1
462,"My housemates and I had a very small party for Halloween (&lt;10 people, COVID-safe by our local guidelines, don't worry) and invited two of our neighbours around. They're also students and seem like nice guys so we wanted to meet them. We've been talking to them via text since we moved in, one of our housemates leading it. He's been very flirty with one of the guys in particular, who's been very good-natured about it but has clarified he's straight.                            
                                             
So they came over and it was fun, they were both kinda shy but nice guys. Lots of flirty bantering from my one housemate, but the guys took it in stride in a group setting. A couple hours later, everyone's a little more drunk but I was starting to sober up a bit. I noticed my housemate becoming a little more uninhibited and openly making moves around our one neighbour. It didn't seem like anything he was uncomfortable with but my housemate was at one point clambering over the neighbour's chair and deliberately putting his butt in his face.
The incident that triggered me into calling him out was towards the end of the night, my housemate was laying down next to the neighbour and kinda blindly reaching behind him. In doing that he started groping the neighbour's thigh. The neighbour quite firmly took his hand and pushed it away and my housemate said ""Oops, was that your knee?"". Look, it may have been an honest mistake, I'm sure it was but it made me hella uncomfortable and I was the only one in the room sober enough to notice. I messaged another of my housemates (she was sitting next to me but I didn't want to make a scene) and she seemed kinda off about it, but again, only sober one.
The neighbours left pretty soon after, not because they were uncomfortable but just because the night was wearing down. Once it was just those of us who lived in the house left, I - mostly sober but a little buzzed still - called my housemate out in front of everyone. Not my best move, I accept that I was a little tactless there. Everyone else seemed to take it as a funny story which bugged me.                     
                                                    
I was in the kitchen a little later with my housemate and he brought it up and started to get kinda...hysterical isn't the word, but it was on the way there. I told him I thought it was inappropriate and he should respect people's boundaries in the future. He got upset again and said I'd made him feel like a predator and that if the guys were uncomfortable they would've said something (which, not the case when people feel too powerless in a situation to speak up). I wasn't trying to make him feel like a sexual predator or anything but - as he brought up - this isn't the first incident. We'd literally spoken that evening about how he'd made one of our old housemates last year uncomfortable by kinda mounting the back of his chair (the guy described it as 'humping his back'). It seems like a pattern of behaviour with making inappropriate passes at straight guys.                                      
                                             
Another of our housemates came into the kitchen then and immediately started consoling him because he was getting a little visibly upset. They were telling him all kinds of things like ""oh don't worry you didn't do anything wrong, they're just insecure straight boys"" and implying them being uncomfortable was somehow homophobic. Look, I don't blame my other housemate for saying this - they were drunk and trying to console an upset friend but that narrative is really concerning. So, straight guys aren't allowed to have boundaries with gay guys or it's homophobic? It can't even be that, because my housemate has sort of done it to me too and I'm not straight. Last year, we were all sitting around and he started grabbing my leg and asking weird questions. I was for sure uncomfortable even though I knew it wasn't anything sexual, just past my boundaries but I felt too awkward to say something (still do if I'm honest because I'm not even sure if other people would think it was over the line and I don't want to seem overly sensitive or whatever).                                
                                          
At that point, the rest of my housemates came in to the kitchen and also somewhat consoled him. It just straight up looked like I'd cussed him out or something. He was saying ""I thought that's what you all love about me, that I have no boundaries"", which I really wanted to shut down but, didn't want to seem like any more of an asshole. I talked to a few of my housemates the next day and they didn't seem super thrilled about it, but since I was the only one who saw it, naturally they weren't as concerned.                           
                                  
So, here we are a couple days later. The neighbour texted my housemate and said he had a good time and it was nice meeting us all, so he mustn't have been too uncomfortable with what happened. Part of me wants to go talk to him and apologise for how my housemate acted but I also don't want to make him feel like a victim or anything. I haven't had a chance to talk to my housemate yet, but I want to with a clear head. I want to lay down for him why it was inappropriate and why he shouldn't do stuff like that in the future. But I definitely feel like the asshole in the situation. Maybe I'm making a mountain out of a molehill? I just keep thinking if it were one of my female housemates having their thigh unwelcomely groped by a strange man, we'd be bringing down the thunder on that guy. I really want to message our neighbour just to check in that he's okay.          
                                    
So, am I being a dick? Should I have minded my own business? Should I talk to him about it again?",02Nov2020,1

467,"I work at a petrol station in the UK. Obviously the dangers of flammable gas and fuel should be taken very seriously working somewhere like that and I’m not saying otherwise, but this honestly kind of disturbed me. My boss put a message in the work chat today saying to keep an eye out for suspicious people at the fuel pumps and linked a video underneath. I won’t post the video unless someone REALLY wants to see it because it might show someone dying, but the basic summary of the video is this:

About a minute into the video, a woman walks up to a pump and begins to fill up a Jerry can. At this point nothing is suspicious. I would’ve authorised the pump if it was me. There’s nothing telling about her actions at this point. Once she has filled the van up enough she pours the fuel on herself and sets herself on fire. The video continues on as people around her panic as she eventually falls to the ground, it being unclear whether or not she died. 

So I’m shaking writing this, not knowing if this woman died, but knowing that I would never have chosen to watch this if someone told me ahead of time that she did. If my boss did send that video through knowing that the woman died, then he knowingly showed everyone in that chat a video of someone killing them selves and I am not okay with that.

I guess I want advice on what I should do? How to find out if she died? Should I just ask my boss directly or go straight to some sort of authority to report being shown this video without consent?",02Nov2020,1
468,"I'm freaking out. I've been having some health problems and I'm in a foreign country. I'm so far away from my friends and family and am extremely scared. So far, the doctors haven't been able to figure out what's wrong. That's what scares me even more. It would be easy if they just told me to take some medicine for a couple weeks. I haven't told anybody that I'm having problems. I don't want to scare them and to be real, what good will it do since I don't actually know what's wrong. Hospital visits make me so anxious and it's difficult as there is a language barrier. I'm just trying to maintain a calm but a lot of days I just wake up scared and that feeling has persisted for over a month. Of course, I did the stupidest thing which is google symptoms (never do that). Not really sure where to turn, who to talk to. I am incredibly alone here.

469,"Yesterday I went to brunch with one of my best friends. She was just introduced to someone and they hit it off really well. They’ve only texted so far, but they’re already talking about marriage, kids and houses. I cannot stress enough how happy I am for her. She’s been hurt by many men in her life and finally she’s found one that is willing to build a future with her. To say I’m anything less than over the moon about this would be an understatement. She deserves to be happy so much.

Also while at brunch I went to the bathroom. My husband and I have been trying to conceive for awhile, but we keep coming up empty handed. I had been feeling light headed and otherwise unwell (not COVID related) for the past few days. I thought maybe this was finally the time we’d been waiting for. So when I went to the bathroom and saw blood my heart sank. My friend and I are very close so she knows my struggle, and also knows when I start. I may or may not have mentioned being hopeful that I was pregnant at an earlier time, but it definitely wasn’t mentioned at brunch before going to the bathroom.

Anyway, I returned from the bathroom and she was talking about how this new man she’s just met wants to have more children within the next four years. Despite the fact that I was happy for her I had just had my dreams crushed again mere seconds before this. I tried my damnedest to cheer for her as loudly as possible because she deserves that, but it was overshadowed by my personal loss (for lack of a better choice of words). 

Anyway, we left brunch soon after that and I got to thinking about how my response wasn’t as genuine. Considering she knows most of my struggle already, I sent her a message letting her know what happened and apologized for not cheering more loudly, something that she clearly deserves. I couldn’t help but think I rained on her parade, even though I was just trying to provide context in my less than stellar attitude. She was so understanding, told me how she knows of other people who struggled and were eventually able to make it happen. She told me that she looks forward to meeting my future children as much as I look forward to meeting the man that makes her so happy. 

Awhile later I messaged her and apologized. She was sweet about it, but it didn’t mean that I didn’t mess up, or have something to apologize for. The last thing I want is for her to think she needs to walk on eggshells for me. 

Anyway, I should message her today (as we do message every single day), but I don’t know what to say. I kind of feel like a dog with my tail between my legs. I definitely exposed my vulnerability and acted a fool in the face of her happiness. Whether or not she forgives me is irrelevant because I don’t forgive myself. What do I do now? Help.",02Nov2020,1

473,"In about 6 1/2 hours, I’ve scheduled myself for a COVID test at my local Kroger. I don’t know if I’ll even get the results back today, but I’m terrified of the symptoms I’m experiencing. At around exactly this time two years ago, in 2018, I developed several blood clots in each lung at 18 years old from the birth control I was taking at the time. I am a marijuana smoker, and was back then, and I realized I needed treatment when suddenly, smoking would cause intense lung pain and would immediately plunge me into a panic attack. Panic attacks were something I never experienced before this, and haven’t experienced since I had a pulmonary embolism (blood clots).

After going to the ER, I was hospitalized for 3 days when they found the clots and was on blood thinners for 6 months. After they were gone, I was tested and told I am not at an increased risk for clotting, no blood disorders, it was likely entirely caused by the birth control I was on.

Now, exactly two years later, the symptoms I’m experiencing are mirroring that, with some additional symptoms that could also be COVID.

I’ve been feeling weak and fatigued for a week or so now, slowly becoming more and more out of breath for the past couple weeks. Two days ago I dealt with upper back pain on and off all day (similar to pulmonary embolism symptoms, but also something seen in COVID patients), and I attempted to smoke yesterday morning which immediately plunged me into a mild panic attack (identical to the kind I experienced when I realized I had pulmonary embolisms,) and my breathing has been labored ever since. My lungs ache, and feel heavy, it’s difficult to breathe when laying in certain positions, when I’m laying on my back it feels like there’s a weight on my chest. I’m not overweight, I’ve never experienced anything like this before other than when I had a pulmonary embolism. Just standing in the shower yesterday had me breathing like I had just run up a flight of stairs.

I’m not fevered, I have not had a persistent cough (the worst it has been would have been sometime last week, in which I would cough intermittently every hour or so.) I live with my boyfriend and am constantly in very close contact with him, but he is not experiencing any symptoms, which spikes my blood clot-related anxiety. I have been drinking a ton of water and took Tylenol last night, but I’m terrified of what’s going on in my body.

At first I was content to wait for the results of my COVID test today, but the facts of my boyfriend not experiencing any symptoms, the occurrence of my smoke-induced panic attack yesterday, and the fact that it may be a day or two before I get my results is keeping me from anything even remotely close to relaxation.

I’m debating calling my doctor in a couple hours to set up an appointment as soon as possible, but then my anxiety is making me wonder, is that soon enough? What if it IS blood clots? Is it possible I wouldn’t make it to the appointment? The thought alone is causing my breathing to become even more difficult. Both results of this test would be equally terrifying. 

If it’s COVID, I have to do my best to rest and heal, and pray that my boyfriend (who does not have insurance), or my parents who I also live with (mother has pre-existing conditions) do not catch it from me. And if it’s not COVID, then... if it’s not COVID then I could think of no other explanation than a pulmonary embolism, which IS very life threatening and an ordeal that was very traumatic for me at 18 and I hoped and prayed I’d never have to experience again.

I’m only 20 years old now, and regardless of what is afflicting me now, I’ve committed to bettering myself and focusing on my health after this, probably cutting back on marijuana use (I am a heavy smoker, but have never smoked cigarettes, or even vaped,) and implementing some major lifestyle changes like exercising and choosing a healthier diet. I hate taking medication, and will do whatever I can do make myself healthy again. I’m just terrified in the meantime, and my anxiety is making me question how long I have to act, if my symptoms are of this disease that has spread across the world or if they’re something technically even more deadly.

After typing all this I have decided to definitely make an appointment with my real doctor, but I’m just trying to figure out how to take care of myself in the meantime, how to get through the next few days, how to keep myself calm and prevent myself from triggering a panic attack over whether or not I’m going to die in the next week.

I’m worried the conversation will die out because I still have feelings for her and I’m trying to go into this mindset that probably nothing will come from it but I’d like to try and stay positive. 

When I’ve sent like not a shit text she’ll always come back and say yeah ahah or have a nice run. From that like the conversation should have died from my response which I do avoid but I just wanted to see what would happen.

478,"I don't even know how to start this. The title is really dumb, but I don't know how to call this situation.  Snd sorry for the formating I'm on my phone.
 
So yesterday my boyfriend and I have broken up, the reason for this, was him loosing feelings or so he told me. The thing is wednesday everything was really fine and he's been normal or I'd say he even made more love gestures for example he brought me a small gift home because he took too long and and and. 
The day after he started acting weird and it really felt like he is losing feelings for me and friday we sat down together and told each other we needed to talk. 
That's when he said he isn't sure if he still loves me. In the end we agreed on still trying and seeing what happens. Basicly the next day I spend a lot of the time crying which I think led to the thing that happened the next day. 
He was out with his brother and I texted him I wanted to talk again and he said he wanted too. I told him it'd be okay if he doesn't love me or isn't sure and the only thing I'd want is him by my side. Yeah.... he went the other direction and told me he doesn't want to hurt me more and even me saying that pains him, but he told me ""he needs me as a person"" and that he's afraid he's never seeing me again. After hearing that I got up instantly told my sister if she could come get me and my stuff. 
Sorry for the long intro, but this is where I don't understand anything anymore. 
He spend the time my sister needed to come get me (2 hour drive) with me and when she told me she is there, I asked him for a last kiss. He started crying and I kissed him (with permission) but after I pulled away he pulled me back in and kissed me..??? My sister and I spent like 2 hours packing my stuff (I told her I cant do it alone) and he stood there crying and just looking at me. 
He then started telling me stuff like give me 2 weeks and I'll be at your door to get you or like ""rent in 'your City' isnt expensive right?"" Or even offered me to drive with me and all such things. 
He also said stuff like maybe now isnt our time, maybe in a year..? ...What does that mean... 
After we were done and ready to drive away he gave me a last hug which was like 5 minutes because he couldnt let me go. When I sat down in the car he leaned in again and kissed me. Oh and also while packing my stuff I asked him like if he has doubts and he went yes also if he regrets it and he told me he does so much. 
I just dont get what happened. What it means... he even gave me his flat keys and told me I could come everytime without even asking. Or even said if I still wanted in like 1-2 weeks we could continue the relationship... WHAT? 
I talked with my sister about it in the car and she didnt even think we were broken up she just thought it was again because of his family or that we had an argument. After I explained everything she said like maybe he has another one and wants to see if they fit better or like that maybe his family threatened him again (his brother hates me because he is very controlling and Toxic and said he should have something better (looks wise) and made a lot of moves against me... and no not just me also exes of his when they were together).

So yeah, how do I act now? Do I hope for something? Do I even text him,which I think is a bad idea but he told me to. Do I maybe really just one day appear at his flat or wait for him to do so. Or am I just hoping for too much and it meant nothing?",02Nov2020,1

481,"Okay this is going to sound crazy but please bare with me I promise it’s true.

My best friend we’ll call him A, when he was 14 he was in Romania with his uncle they went hunting, he was attacked by a beast with glowing red eyes and ginger fur. That same day they’d been in the town and they were being followed by a guy with ginger hair and a ginger beard. That guy went missing.

A can hear and see things we can’t, he can hear heartbeats, people arguing streets away. He can smell animal blood, when his eyes glow red his vision changes and he can only see directly in front of him with everything looking red. He also sees a wolf whenever he gets angry and his vision changes.
 
His girlfriend, B, also has a wolf who protects her, with Amber eyes. 
When I am scared, I see either blue or lilac glowing eyes in the back of my head. Another thing about A is he loses control of himself, he growls and his eyes glow, he gets really really strong and his back starts to feel like it’s burning. 
Last night we were in the local park(uk), it’s surrounded by a forest and there’s a skate park, we were on our bikes messing about it was pitch black and we thought we were alone. Then he changed again, his eyes were glowing and he was saying “he’s here, he did this to me, he’s come for me, I’m going to kill him” he was angry and shaking, I couldn’t see anyone or anything, he kept saying “he’s right there he’s right in front of us”
I finally got control of him and got him to agree to leave, and as we were riding away 2 figures appeared right behind us out of nowhere, one of them was completely black I couldn’t see his face, the other one was white with ginger hair and a ginger beard and his eyes were completely black. He was walking after us and was right behind us we were peddling as fast as we could. A could hear his heartbeat. We managed to get away, He said the guy lost our scent and that it was being masked by squirrel blood and tobacco.
I’m genuinely sh*t scared. I don’t know what to do, it sounds like something from a movie.",02Nov2020,1
482,"Alright, some context about me, first: I'm a 15-years-old boy (although I might be trans) and I consider myself to be a femboy. I wear thigh high stockings, skirts, leggings, sweaters, Converse shoes, etc. to school. I have a sweet and cutesy personality. Anyways, enough about me.

I'm in love. I know this girl in my algebra and Englidh class named Madison. She's a tall, chubby Asian girl and I think she's amazing. She's super into anime (like me) and speaks several languages (Spanish, Yiddish, Zulu, Mandarin, Greek, German, Finnish, and Georgian) and is super nice to everyone.

She's also a fucking genius. I've known her since kindergarten and have seen her incredible intellect on display several times. She often does these huge complex math equations in her head and on paper, and gets them right or near right. She's been in gifted classes since sixth grade (we're in ninth) but I don't think that's enough to accommodate her intellectual abilities.

But she's also pretty autistic. Like, she only has 2 friends, both of whom are autistic nerds like herself, and spends a lot of time in a class for kids who struggle socially. She tends to obsess over certain things (currently eastern philosophers, linguistics, and anime) and rarely wants to do things unrelated. She'll go into class, speed through the assignments (always getting an A+ at the end) and sit there either watching anime on her laptop (with headphones, of course), learning a new language, or reading about obscure eastern philosophers.

She's had her fair share of meltdowns in class. I remember she once submitted an essay in English, with the entire essay in Greek afterwards. The teacher congratulated her, and everyone started yelling at her, calling her a one-upping asshole, and she had an awful meltdown. It was horrible to watch.

She tends to be reclusive. Early on, she was very extroverted, and for the longest time and wait by the classroom door and each day of every school year and hug everyone who entered the doorway, but sorta stopped after she got in trouble for it in seventh grade. But other than that, since fifth grade she's become pretty lonely.

If you catch her on a bad day (what she calls ""the blue zone,"" I'm not sure why) she just gets scared when you talk to her and she doesn't say anything.

People also bully her a lot. Everyone thinks she's an idiot and a bimbo because she tends to be lost in her own world. A lot of times she'll finish up her assignments and roam the hall for the rest of class humming and saying sentences in other languages, and people will purposefully knock into her just to piss her off and ""knock her back into reality"" (what a bunch of dicks, right?)

She's soooooo cute. I wanna hug her and cuddle her while stuffing our face with Sour Patch Kids and watch anime together. But given her being special, I'm not sure how to approach this.",02Nov2020,1

484,"TL;DR: Mother talking behind my back, giving me the silent treatment. What to do when she begins talking to me again?

My mother and I (F17) got into an argument this morning about what my  disabled brother (M6) did while she was asleep, which she placed the blame for onto me. I tried waking her up because I needed to get to school and she refused to wake and when she did she screamed, threatened and pushed me. 

She told me I needed to move out because I was no use to her, so I left to walk to school. I got half way to a bus stop when she pulled up next to me and coaxed me into the car, apologising and holding me while i sobbed. She dropped me off at school and I got sent home before lunch time because I began sobbing when a teacher asked me if I was alright.

My grandmother came and got me, informed me that my mother came to her house after dropping me off and told her I was a “out of control brat” before my grandfather told her not to speak about me in that manner. My grandmother dropped me off at my home and then pulled off to leave while I walked towards the front door, about to open it before hearing through the front door my mother and my uncle swearing and cursing my name. 

My uncle is  emotionally unstable, is known to be verbally abusive and he can easily manipulate my mother’s emotions- so hearing my mother calling me names and mocking me behind my back sent me back into tears. I ran away back to a park, made contact with my grandmother and she came to get me an hour later. 

My grandmother marched me into the house, saying she would set her daughter straight. My mother pretended to be happy to see me until my grandmother began scolding her and it sent my mother into a rage, where she began calling me a spoiled brat, an abuser and a useless waste of space in her home. My uncle jumped in on the name calling and my grandmother left me at home with them. 

Mum didn’t speak to me all afternoon, so when my boyfriend (M19) called me asking if I wanted to go have dinner with him, I jumped at the opportunity. I explained everything to him on the phone and he is in support of me. Just as he pulls into the driveway, I get a phone call from my work, firing me due to changes in company policy. 

While having dinner with my boyfriend and starting to feel better, I get a string of phone calls from my mother and my aunt- from what I gathered my mother reported me as a runaway to my family and told my aunt I was abusing her. I didn’t come home for another 2 hours because I was busy having dinner with my boyfriend.

I come home and my mother, uncle and cousins all look at me, but nothing is said so I take myself away to my bedroom. I know that silent treatment is what I will receive for the next 2-3 days but I don’t care. I hear my uncle and mother screaming (to each-other) about how I’m self absorbed and unhelpful with my disabled brother.

so I’m on hour 10 of silent treatment and honestly loving it because I don’t have to be subjected to being compared to my abusive ex stepfather, unprovoked comments and unnecessary anger. 

But I’m unsure of how to deal with things when she begins talking to me again?",02Nov2020,1

490,"Hey guys so I’m an 18 year old female and my boyfriend is a 19 year old male. We have been together just over two years now. 

Our relationship has ran like the usual typical relationship. 
We would always go out, we would both pay(share; I pay for food so he pays for the movie and vice versus), also the silly arguments here and there over nothing. 
We do not live together. We live 1 hour difference(yes it seems long but we both don’t care. the drive is good) we have always gotten on so well. We really do love eachother. 
Anyway since October 2019 he has been unemployed because he simply “did not want to work anymore” 
Also since the beginning of this year, he has been without a car and drives his mums car.
He currently is on Centrelink payments.
He has become very lazy since this year, he won’t try and get a job, he sleeps ALL day and then goes out at nighttime.
He started not eating and not sleeping properly so eventually I convinced him to go to the doctors and they diagnosed him with anxiety. Which he has now tried multiple different medications for it.
But he claims that none of the medication works. But he skips doses when he is meant to take it every single day at a certain time and go to bed. I try speak to him about it but he gets so defensive about it.

I’m so supportive, I am always there for him and always going to his appointments and driving him and sometimes even helping him pay for his medication. I want him to get back on his feet, but he just seems to not want to. I’m struggling to support us. He is currently getting $200 from Centrelink a fortnight but he spends it on shit that he doesn’t need. I know I’m his gf and it’s not my job to control his money but I feel I do get a say considering that I’m spending all my hard earned money and all of my effort on him. 
I’m trying to help him I really am. I try to give him advice and tell him to start saving for his future ( he always says he wants a family with me and a nice house and a nice car and all of that) I give him encouragement and pep talks to save and I be supportive without nagging. 
I’ve told him before that if he wants to see a future with me he’s going to have to change something.... he won’t get a job... he doesn’t want to. I just feel like it’s getting too overwhelming for me.

There’s times where I ask for him to come see me.(I drive to him a lot more than he does) but he tells me he has no money left.... so I send him money for petrol to come and see me, or I end up driving to him and then if we go anywhere I drive my car, use my petrol, food, drinks, movie... I pay. 
I pay because I want to, I want to be able to go get food or go do fun things with my partner, I’ll see something that I know he would like (a perfume or a gift) and get it for him and I don’t get anything in return. Which it’s not about getting something back. It’s the effort and thought. It just gets to a point where I don’t want to anymore because I’m not exactly earning much. $300 a week. I’m also trying to save for future, I would really love to buy a house, save for my future children, spend money on myself. It upsets me. Quite a bit. Every time I’ve tried to speak to him about it he gets defensive and says “ok stop making me feel bad”
I feel like I have to pay him to be my boyfriend 
Like for example. I haven’t seen him for almost 2 weeks.... I’ve been working most days. I’ve asked him to come see me after work one day or on one of my days off. But he tells me he can’t drive all the way to mine because of a new medication he is on.... and I understand that so I offer to go and see him after I finish work. But he then tells me “I’m seeing my mate tonight” 
He sees this mate almost every night aswell. Tonight when I said I’d come and see him he told me “my mate is coming over” then I told him well can you maybe make some time for me tonight and he told me “but I want to hang with him” 
So me being respectful and supportive, I said “okay all good”
And then I went and cried. The feeling of my boyfriend not putting in effort really upsets me....


I just don’t know what to do... I sometimes think that I dont want to be with him. I’m getting to a point in my life where I want to start my future and I want a partner who is successful and reliable. But I also don’t want to not be with him. 
I have tried speaking to him about this before but he just gets all defensive and says things like “so you don’t want to be with me because of my mental health which is something I can’t control, I’m getting help” “you’re not supportive at all” “so much for sticking by me”
He puts those words into my mouth. Even when I try and simply speak to him or ask him a question. He claims that I’m “having a go”
I’m just so stuck.",02Nov2020,1
491,"I live in an apartment above an office. The landlord plans to sell the entire building so he can retire. He mentioned January 2022, but recent interest and development around property have occurred and I’m worried it’ll be sooner as opposed to later. He wants to sell to someone who won’t destroy the building, which may take awhile (and whoever bought it could become the new landlord) but if he wanted to sell it to someone who’d knock it down to build a parking lot, he could have it sold by tmrw. 



I’m living here bc it’s all I can afford. If it does get sold to a new landlord, an apt complex across the street is going for $1600/month, so I know my rent will get jacked up. I’m scared to start looking for an apartment again bc I didn’t have a stable income last year when I was looking so I couldn’t prove that I could afford rent, and worry I won’t be able to find anywhere nice or affordable. My income is more stable but it’s still low 



I’m not really tied to this area so if I have to move out I could leave my hometown but I’m so broke and indecisive idk what to do. I’m tired of moving practically every fucking year.

They are all fine it seems but after getting home yesterday I stared to burp alot and my stomach hurt. Overall I didnt feel well. FFW to today at midnight I woke up with my stomach hurting REALLY FUCKING BAD severe cramps and I ran to the toilet with dirreha and nausea.

493,"Hi there, I have had swollen tonsils for a few months now. Originally I came back positive for a strep test, and was given amoxicillin which did nothing. I have from then on tried 2 other antibiotics, a steroid shot, and 2 types of steroids. I then got a throat culture that came back clean with normal flora. I have gotten a CT scan that only showed swollen tonsils, and I have been tested for mono twice and don't have it. I got an std test that came back clean, although two days before this all started I had a new partner and oral sex was done. I am a mystery, and I'm at college and my insurance isn't covered here.

494,"Warning, long story!!

So, I (M) am friends with this person (F), and around last month, she started bringing up that I did not try enough / care enough in our friendship. I found that really odd though since I call her almost every day with the exception of me having to do work and other personal things. And she would sometimes ignore me for hours if I did something to annoy or anger her and I would try a lot to get her to talk to me but I just stopped trying so much because it was a lot of work and it happened sometimes. And she took that the wrong way thinking I don’t care about her when I really do and then we got into this fight recently but I didn’t say my opinion to her because she was crying and emotional and I wanted her to be happier rather than being depressed for a couple of days so I decided to not say my side which was probably the wrong move but she said I’m a bad friend for not calling her or deliberately ignoring her calls even though I’m busy with school. And she would leave me to talk to other people and I was fine with that but when she came to talk again she told me who it was, I guess to make me feel jealous I’m not sure, and it didn’t bother me because I don’t want to force her to talk to me if she doesn’t feel like it but now she starts saying I didn’t try hard enough and now I don’t care about her which makes no sense because I do and I’ve even bought her a present that she wanted and I don’t know what to do because I still want to be her friend (I’m also too scared to say my opinion or else she will get even more hurt so I really am confused).",02Nov2020,1
497,"Hi everyone! This will be the first time I'm sharing something personal online. English isn't my first language so please excuse any grammatical errors. I'll be posting in bullets for the details:


• a college senior
• passed all subjects, ready for graduation, but haven't completed my internship and haven't defended my thesis
• messaged a prof that I plan to forge my internship manager's  signature (since he won't sign the certificate unless the needed hours are completed but I plan to continue my remaining hours after graduation), pass the certificate, so I can defend my thesis
• prof didn't respond to my message, just seen zoned it, so I did it anyways just so I can defend my thesis
• passed the cert to the prof
• next day, was going to defend my thesis but same prof told me I need to be in grad practice or else I can't march
• stayed for grad practice instead of defending my thesis
• next day, went to dept. chair's office for defense but got called by the dean regarding the forgery issue
• prof gave the certificate I gave him the day before to the dean
• got scolded, was not allowed to defend unless needed hours are completed.


Got my heart broken and hated myself for failing my mom. And for trusting the prof. But what irks me the most was that the same prof approved some of my classmates certificate even if they only served less than 100hrs out of 300hrs needed just because their internship company gave them the certificate. Prof could've told me no in the first place when I asked him about it and I wouldn't have done the forgery. I needed some adult guidance that time because I was so desperate to not disappoint my mom.


• finished my needed internship hrs and got the certificate
• was told to go to the dept. chair for thesis defend
• went to the chair but she wanted lots of stuff changed
• tried to make tweaks but I felt empty, hurt, depressed, hated myself 
• everytime I try to open my program, my heart hurts so much I began to cry. So I didn't.


That was it, a year ago. It's been a year, right about the expiration of my INC. I haven't thought, touched anything related to my thesis or even a simple mention of ""graduation"", or the school name hurts my heart. Even a year later, right now typing this up, it still hurts. I don't know why it does.


My mom, when I told her what happened, she scolded me and how it was my fault and ended the call. 5 yrs ago, she was the one who made me depressed in the first place so I kinda feel free without communicating with her, less toxic. She also thought I already got my diploma but she never really asked how I felt or if I'm doing fine. I'm not in good terms with my mom now but I still want to make up with her coz she's my mom. And I want to show her my diploma.


So I need some advice regarding this please. Should I finish my thesis even if it hurts my heart? Even if I don't have any interest on my course? Even if I'm doing fine now, emotionally, mentally, physically,  and financially(I'm running an online business), better?  Even if it doesn't really matter to me? Please help me.",02Nov2020,1
498,"So I’ve been chasing this girl for 4 months, and it’s been a very interesting situation to ya the least. We both liked each other at the beginning, and then I came on too strong and admitted my feelings which in term ran her off. We remained friends, and I ended up apologizing to her about it and she replied with “you didn’t mess up anything”. So I tried again and it’s been on and off with her on me. Sometimes she acted like she likes me, other times it seemed like she wasn’t sure.I finally got the courage to ask what was up, she basically told me that she hasn’t been sure this whole time and wasn’t trying to lead me on but doesn’t know if she has feelings or not. 

So I told her let’s try a date, no commitment, no labels, just two friends going out on a date and see how that makes her feel. Well the week leading up too it, she became more interactive in our conversations over text. Then started me to ask to hangout. (Which is odd because I was the one to plan all of our hangouts) and it was nice. So the night of the date went great, we went and played mini golf and the spark felt there. Afterwards we went and parked my truck down by the river, when I asked for a kiss. This then lead to a make out session, where she asked me this “would it be inappropriate for me to suck your dick on the first date” so then we both exchanged oral sex. After we cuddled and for once she wanted to stay longer with me, asked me if we could hang for 5 more minutes and such. Then told me she definitely wanted to try another date, and when she was meeting my mom. What does thus look like? Does it seem she actually caught feelings? Or should I be worried",02Nov2020,1
499,"I need objective view points. Sorry this is so long. 

It started back in 2016 when I became ill. Days turned into weeks, weeks turned into months, and then months turned into years and years (five to be exact) of traumatizing, debilitating illness from having an undiagnosed autoimmune disease. I lost pretty much everything that made up my life: career, independence, social life/circle, happiness, myself, and pretty much my family. 

I was at the mercy of my mother, who is an amazing person in her own right and would do anything for me, but she is sometimes very immature, highly emotional/emotionally reactive, and has extreme self esteem issues that cause her not to take responsibility for and understand that she has to be financially responsible and honest. She went through a period of lying A LOT. We have always lived with my grandparents. I hated it at times, but it was actually a pretty charmed life. I grew up in a nice house, in a nice area, and I was very safe and privileged given that my mother was not a financially responsible person. She ALWAYS had a job and worked very hard. She is the opposite of lazy. But she has never been financially responsible or literate. I mean this as, she has always made a living wage salary, but always living paycheck to paycheck, even while in her parent’s house, where—in hindsight—she could have been hoarding money to have an amazing retirement. After everything we’ve gone through, she sees that now and feels a lot of shame. 

I feel like I can’t blame my mother 100% because she grew up in a household with very old school ideals. She was supposed to be the domesticated wife and her husband would take care of her and me. That didn’t happen. My father, who she says they pushed on her (not arranged, but always being pushed together and excuses for his bad behavior so she’d try to work things out), is an extremely abusive person. I don’t even know him, but he tried to get to know me in my twenties while I was sick. I wasn’t having it and he pretty much told me that I was an ugly, fat POS who should kill themselves (lol). I cried for an entire day because I believe I’m fat and ugly and it sucks to hear some loser that I don’t even know say it, but I didn’t care otherwise. I have literally nothing to do with him, but I could see in that moment how abusive he was. He had also been threatening my mother to have me get in contact with him by a certain date or he would send people after her. She had a restraining order on him when I was thirty because of this, even though he’s never been in my life. 

Whenever I didn’t want to live with my grandparents, I would get nuts and berate her for living with them. It wasn’t out of no where, though, it was always the undertone in my family. My mom’s some big loser because she lives with my grandparents and is a huge burden. They never said anything like that to us, or made it seem like that. We were a functioning, mostly happy household. A family. I didn’t know any other immediate family. That was my house and my family and life. Living in my grandparent’s upstairs. Seeing them everyday. Having breakfast with my grandpa in the morning. Him picking me up from school when I was little and taking me to the park. Him coming in the living room while I crunched on all nighters for college, asking me what I was doing. Sitting downstairs and talking to him before bed time while he watched the news. We were a normal family, but some people in my family didn’t respect us being there. My mother is the only divorced person in my family, even if more people seem like they should be, and I really believe people have always looked down on her and made her feel like a loser because she doesn’t have that traditional kind of life, and she’s not good with money. She was never taught how to be good with money, though. It’s not a total excuse, but when you grow up in a family where everyone thinks your husband runs your life, you’re not prepared to run your own, if you get me. Even ***I*** was financially illiterate for the majority of my life because of this. I had to teach myself about money, and the only reason I actually did is because I squandered an inheritance from my father’s side of the family. About $100k, completely squandered because the judgement squad could sit and watch me in judgement, but would never sit me down and actually help me. I understand some people will say that’s not their problem to, but I grew up in a family that had extreme boundary issues, was in everyone’s business (especially my mother’s and mine, probably because my mother made it their business looking for support and not knowing that she was just feeding herself to the lions), and it really wouldn’t have been irrational for someone to sit me down and be like, “hey, do THIS, not THIS, or THIS could happen.” 

I see my family as very judgemental people who are faux supportive. They act like they’re supporting you, but then somehow you’re looked down upon when needing help, and they’re like exasperated to do it. My mother has always been the helper, and she raised me to be the same. She was always baby sitting the kids, the dogs, helping with people’s events: hostess, server, dishwasher. I saw her always doing this stuff and then being deeply disrespected, especially by my aunts and uncles (her brothers and sister), and I was like WHAT ARE YOU DOING THIS FOR?!? I did watch the kids and help out a lot, but I would never do the other stuff, even though I was respected. It’s like she was the black sheep and I was always beloved and therefore trying not to be a black sheep like her. One degree of separation of black sheepdom. 

While I was sick, my grandparents decided to sell their house, and of course my mother wasn’t prepared at all. Not only that, but my grandfather (who isn’t a bad person, he’s just...whatever he is, he’s actually dying now so I don’t want to speak ill of him, for the most part he was an amazing person) pretty much told my mother and me that she could never make it on her own and would always need someone to take care of her. She was in tears hearing this, but she really fcking internalized it and I think it’s a huge reason of why she messed up so badly. She has always been made to feel like she can’t do anything and has always believed it, and then when it came time to fully take care of everything and some things went wrong, she just fulfilled the prophecy. She had close to no savings. Decided we were going to move to the southern part of the US, and screwed up absolutely everything because she had no idea what she was going to be getting herself into, and had never been out on her own completely. Albeit with her now disabled child. It was horrible timing. We eventually ended up moving even further south, a place I’d never move to, and the economy was so bad, and she had such little savings to keep herself afloat, that she went completely bankrupt and almost made us homeless. She lied and lied and lied and lied about paying rent on time, lied about how much money she had, lied about every big and little thing. She says it was to “protect” me because I was so sick, but all she did was put me through trauma on top of the trauma of chronic illness. She made me this angry, paranoid person. I didn’t trust her or anybody. I became so paranoid about her lies that I started to believe everything was just some big plan to off me. She lied so much that all I had was my imagination to run wild. The entire time, my aunt (her sister) was pretty much calling me everyday to be like, “is this happening, that happening? Did you get a job?? She’s not going to take care of you.” She was constantly in my ear. Would make me even more stressed out and paranoid, and then I would lose it on my mother in the wee hours of the night—obviously making everything worse. I’m sure she felt like SHE was going crazy and couldn’t handle what was happening. She fell into a deep depression and started going to bed at 6 and 7pm. I would just go insane, sick in my room, talking to my aunt who I was leaning on (feeding myself to the lions) but was just poisoning the situation more. Likely with her own anxieties about her own life that only looks as lovely as it does because she has her husbands money to sprinkle on everything and make it go away. 

Eventually we had to go back to my grandparents’ now one bedroom apartment. I was livid. I was a twenty-eight year old having a temper tantrum in the car about going back, so she lied some more about just going back to get money from a lawsuit. My aunt came over to see me and disclosed to me that my mother borrowed $3k from her and lied about being able to give it back by a certain date. She also said that, “no one wanted to see me end up homeless.” That’s when I really lost myself. I realized that I pretty much was homeless and was so sick that I couldn’t do anything about it. Just a few years ago I had been a normal, healthy college graduate. Had an entry position in my dream career. Had a great social life, had my family, money, independence, and now I was sick, had nothing, no one, and was homeless. I suffered from extreme suicidal ideation and cried every single day. It was the lowest of the low. I was sleeping on my grandparent’s couch—I’d NEVER slept on a couch in my life purposely, and I thought that I was in hell. And while I was in hell, my family pretty much completely abandoned me. I was the loser on the couch. No one respected me being so ill. They didn’t believe it because I couldn’t get a diagnosis. I gained even more weight, etc. my life became a huge mess. 

Fast forward to today, a year later, and I was THANKFULLY lucky enough to be diagnosed. Five years later, but still. I am being treated and on medication that makes me almost 100% functional. I taught myself and my mother (as much as I could) about money, investing and savings to be at a point where we’re actually in a really nice place with a decent savings riding this pandemic out, and my mother decided to go back to school to further her education after everything that happened—she hasn’t been able to get work because of the pandemic, but she’s even still taking classes. but now I still have no family. Of course they’re there, but I feel SO much resentment towards them. I don’t know how to forgive anyone. I know they think I’m a loser or whatever they think. They just like shiny objects and, actually my life looks sort of shiny right now to the outside view, but obviously all of this other, non-respectable stuff has happened. Like I was sick and poor and well obviously that makes me garbage. The worst of it is that my younger cousins who used to worship me look down on me and don’t interact with me at all. 

I had a little falling out with the daughter of my mother’s sister, who I practically helped raise. She used to be obsessed with me, but while I was sick I was starting to see this dynamic that freaked me out. There was a lot of anger and resentment that I had, sort of secretly, towards her mother for the way she treated me and the way she treated my mother over $3k. I probably didn’t mention it but my aunt is VERY well off. $3k to her is nothing, but she made it seem like lending it to my mother was the end of the world. I wish I’d known my mother took it because I would have made her give it back immediately, as I know how abusive my aunt is to my mother and would never actually be a safe place for her to fall, but whatever. I should also mention my mother paid her back in full. $500 almost immediately, the rest about a year later when she had it again. Anyway, I started to realize that my cousin was ignoring me at whatever family gathering my then-sick ass could make it to, but she’d ask me to help edit her papers (I’m a lit major) over text when we weren’t together. I saw this dynamic of how my mother was always treated. Disrespected and like garbage, but always good enough to help out. So after a few times of ignoring me in person and then quietly asking me to help with her papers. All I said was, “guess that’s all I’m good for, eh?” And she LOST HER MIND. She is 18, by the way. Was younger then. She lost her mind over that one sentence, took me off of her one social media account (that was for close friends) and also got my other younger cousin against me, who also used to be obsessed with me. 

I see them being obsessed with my other, prettier, nicer lifed cousin who is bright and shiny on the outside, and they do not interact with me at all anymore. It’s so hurtful. I can’t believe that I went through this horrible thing that was not my fault, like illness, and then I am looked down upon??? I have obviously taken myself almost completely out of the equation. I have so much anger, rage, resentment towards my entire family. But I’m the one left out. I’m the one no one interacts with anymore, or with my mother who simply went through a really bad time. I don’t understand how people can just discard good people because they went through a hard time and kiss the asses of actual real garbage. I mean there are people who have went to PRISON in my family for something terrible and THEY are respected over us, and I can’t help but think it’s solely because they have money to continue living their big, luxury life. 

I just need opinions on this from the outside. Were we the POS? Am I the POS and I caused this, so should live with it? Sometimes it’s too much to bear. 

TL;DR: I [31 F] went through a bad time with undiagnosed chronic illness and financial ruin. My mother caused a lot of problems that caused a huge fracture in my family [multiple people] and now no one interacts with me. I’m heartbroken and just want to move on/know if anyone can see what I did wrong and how I should fix it.

The thing is she had a crush on me when I had a girlfriend 2 years ago (if i was single, i would date her 100%). Now she has a boyfriend but she tells me that she has some problems with relationship and wants to see me and to spend time together. (I am single)
  
What do you think? Is there somekind of a romantic subtext?",02Nov2020,1
504,"Ok this is going to sound pretty dumb and I know my problems sound insignificant compared to most peoples and I’m sorry if I sound dumb for asking these questions regarding the situation. 

I’m a 17 year old girl that’s still in love with her a boy she can’t even call her ex. Trust me I know how stupid that sounds. For the sake of the argument we’ll call me Samantha, the boy I’m in love with will be called Toby and his current girlfriend Tracey. 

Toby and I go to high school together and have been really close since year 8. We first met when he moved to my school in 2017 and was in my math class. We sat next to each other the entire year and because really good friends but that was it. Through out the year I started having feelings for his best friend who well call Steve. Steve and I had a completely other situation where we dated for a while on and off but that is all irrelevant to this story until later. At the time I met Toby I was 14 and he was also 14 being in the same year as me. In year 8 he started dating his now girlfriend Tracey and they dated for 2 years before ending their relationship. When I was in year 9 I was in even more classes with Toby and we became allot closer but nothing came out of it until the end of the year because I was still on and off with Steve for a very long time. Steve was my first love and I couldn’t seem to let that go. Steve and I had been broken up but planning on getting back together the same year Toby and I were becoming extremely close. To me Toby and I were just friends but to him he had feelings for me. I genuinely had no clue he felt this way about me and every time we hung out I would always talk about Steve and he never said it he approved of our relationship but he put up with my rants. At the time I was spending time with toby he was still seeing Tracey and I was still in love with Steve but then things got more complicated when Steve and I officially ended on bad terms and toby broke up with Tracey. Throughout the whole of 2019 Toby and I stayed extremely close and he would say things to me which indicated he wanted to be more than friends. I never picked up on any of this until one day we were messaging and he tried to make our conversation sexual. I didn’t really know what to say and I tried to tell him I wasn’t exactly comfortable speaking like that with him but he reminded me of I used to speak with Steve like that. A week later and lots of thinking I initiated the idea of us having a sexual relationship with the possibility of it becoming more because I had finally accepted the fact that I had feelings for Toby. That night we talked about hooking and all of that. This continued regularly throughout the whole of 2029 before it became more serious towards the end of the year when I was telling him how I wanted him to take my virginity and suggested towards us being in a relationship. He quickly agreed to the whole virginity part but was trying to explain to me how it would be to complicated for us to be in a relationship. His reasoning was that we had two very different friend groups and our social status was extremely difficult. I was devastated because I was in love with this boy. To the point where I would be in a horrible mood if I wasn’t talking to him all day. We would see each-other at school and kiss and do other Things you so it wasn’t like it was just an online relationship. He met my family and I met his and we spent allot of time together outside of school as well and we cuddled and did all that and acted like we were in a relationship when no one was around. I thought everything was going good with and thought that we would just eventually get into a relationship and never thought anything of it. Suddenly out of the blue on of my friends that knew about us called me to tell me that Toby had gone to a ball with some girl. I was so upset. To the point where I knew it wasn’t even worth it to try and message him. For 2 weeks all I did was cry and ig NoThe fact he hadn’t even reached out to me after I had stopped talking to him regularly. And then a week later after we went back to school I heard the news. He had gotten back with his ex Tracey. It killed me and it still does. I love him and would have done anything for him and he treats me like I don’t mean anything to him. 

5 months pass and I still don’t talk to him or anything but I’m still not over him and can’t get over how heartbroken I am. Then came around a party. I went to this girls party in our year for her birthday and almost everyone from my school and in our year was there. I was drinking allot and then noticed that Toby had a bottle of alcohol which I wanted to try but really I just wanted to talk to him so I went over and hugged one of his friends and asked them to ask Toby if I could have a drink. They did and then Toby walked over to me. I was expecting he’d just let me have a sip but instead he pulled me aside and asked if I hated him and how he missed me. I was so drunk to say anything I just walked off. It was really cold that night and he kept coming up to me and trying to give me his jumper even though his girlfriend was standing right infront of him telling him that she was cold. I kept declining but he gave it to me anyway. Which led to them having a fight. I felt so bad because I liked his girlfriend as a person and had no problem with her at all. He kept pushing it and then I went home that night really happy that he missed me. He began to message me which gave me extreme anxiety because I didn’t want to overstep my boundaries. And then another party came around and him and I we’re together all night talking as friends like how we used to. I got so drunk and told him he broke my heart and he apologised and we talked things out. Since then we’ve been talking and then one night about 2 months after the second party it became sexual and he still has a girlfriend. He was my first. Fist person to see my body and first person I believed I couldn’t live without. I sent him whatever he wanted and did whatever he asked all whilst not saying anything to his girlfriend about us. When we went back to school he would kiss his girlfriend infront of me and admitted to having sex with her even when they were broken up and we were practically dating and she knew we had something serious going on. I then found out the girl he went to the ball with the night that ended our relationship he also had sex with her and it fucking killed me. I cried at school so much and I never cry. I can’t technically say anything to him because firstly I’m not his girlfriend so it’s not my place and I’m so scared to lose him but also there’s nothing I can do about it now.

I genuinely love him and I don’t think I can be without him it’s just he treats me badly but then says he cares and doesn’t want to lose me. I don’t know what I should do. I understand I sound bad for talking to him when he has a girlfriend and she does so much for him also. But he’s the first person I really love and I’d do anything to just be in his arms again. Please tell me if he’s still worth it and if I should continue to try and be his girlfriend again. 


Edit: we were dating but not publicly 
Also when I say social status I mean he isn’t as popular as me and I have more of a reputation getting with boys in our year which completely isn’t true but he refuses to believe it.",02Nov2020,1
505,"For context, I’m a 20 year old guy and i feel like this year (especially the last few months) I have felt more and more stressed, usually coming in very spontaneous bursts that I don’t deal with very well. I tend to worry about a lot of things too regardless of impact, and regardless of how seemingly big or small the problems is. This week alone I accidentally dragged my coat into some paint at my friends house and the situation made me feel so stressed that I ended up crying to my friend in the bathroom and going off over everything bothering me recently.

Yesterday I went out with a bunch of my really close friends to a bar. I’m not a very heavy drinker and I usually just stick to beer or cider but my friends wanted me to try something new and enjoy myself (which I am thankful for) but then I ended up having too much, ended up drunk, threw up several times, and had a complete outburst at the pub with everyone there and having to walk out of the pub to calm myself down. 

Even small situations like spending £5 on something will stress me out as my income is very low at the moment, which isn’t helped because I can’t find a new job cause of covid which is also stressing me out. My friends will do one small thing that annoys me and I find it very hard not to lash out or get annoyed by it, and I don’t deal with stress well at all. It’s just been a very stressful year for me with relatively small reason as to why. 

To finish this story off, how should I deal with stress? Is there any chance I have some sort of mental health condition as I’ve been feeling like this for a while now. I just seem to worry and stress about so many things big or small that it’s actually starting to bother me.",02Nov2020,1
506,"Is something like this ever forgivable?

So I am 19 and I met this girl on Omegle and we got along well. I’m in Maryland and she is in England. We exchanged Snapchats so we can keep talking. I asked her how old she was and she said she was 17 so obviously we can only be friends and do streaks and whatever. She persisted and said what if she sent this and proceeded to send a pic of herself half naked, so the I left the chat so it can automatically be deleted. I told her that that was inappropriate. 

The next day she decided to spam pics of herself again so I did the right thing and deleted the chat again. I reacted negatively to the ones I did see and told her again that it wasn’t right and after some time I decided to unfriend her. She then added me on another account, expecting an explanation(because I’m too nice unfortunately) she explained that she was actually 18 and that she actually wanted a childhood she never had(which doesn’t make sense with what she did). She said her mom kissed her out with nothing, not even ID for proof. She later apologized and asked if we could be friends, I initially said yes but after thinking it over I had to unfriend her and block her on her accounts. (I asked r/legaladvice and r/relationship_advice on another throwaway about what to do and they told be to just block, report and move on.)

The chats are deleted and I have nothing saved. I never sent a nude pic back either.

Is something like this never forgivable or should I just be reasonable here and after a few weeks/months or so talk it out? I asked my Best friend about this and he said that I could but it depends, that in this specific situation she is just a random person on the internet and I owe her nothing. I just don’t like the feeling of blocking someone forever.",02Nov2020,1
507,"So I’ve been chasing this girl for 4 months, and it’s been a very interesting situation to ya the least. We both liked each other at the beginning, and then I came on too strong and admitted my feelings which in term ran her off. We remained friends, and I ended up apologizing to her about it and she replied with “you didn’t mess up anything”. So I tried again and it’s been on and off with her on me. Sometimes she acted like she likes me, other times it seemed like she wasn’t sure.I finally got the courage to ask what was up, she basically told me that she hasn’t been sure this whole time and wasn’t trying to lead me on but doesn’t know if she has feelings or not. 

So I told her let’s try a date, no commitment, no labels, just two friends going out on a date and see how that makes her feel. Well the week leading up too it, she became more interactive in our conversations over text. Then started me to ask to hangout. (Which is odd because I was the one to plan all of our hangouts) and it was nice. So the night of the date went great, we went and played mini golf and the spark felt there. Afterwards we went and parked my truck down by the river, when I asked for a kiss. This then lead to a make out session, where she asked me this “would it be inappropriate for me to suck your dick on the first date” so then we both exchanged oral sex. After we cuddled and for once she wanted to stay longer with me, asked me if we could hang for 5 more minutes and such. Then told me she definitely wanted to try another date, and when she was meeting my mom. What does thus look like? Does it seem she actually caught feelings? Or should I be worried",02Nov2020,1

They are incredibly intimate with each other emotionally, and I have a sneaking suspicion that he might like her too. (For example, she wanted a specific type of Irish cream and he went to nine liquor stores trying to find it. Who does that??? He also tells her he loves her from time to time during their conversations.)

My friend recently broke up with her boyfriend, and this guy is about to move to Chicago for his residency (He's a doctor.) I feel like it's now or never if they're going to get together. She is terrified that if she tells and how she feels, he will end their friendship. So I offered to talk to him for her.

I've seen them interact, and it's like they've been married for years. They're very compatible, and he is so attentive to her you would think they were already in a relationship.

521,"I am an 18-year-old from Spain doing online school with no friends living with my mom and her boyfriend who is sensitive and takes offence to things I do in a farmhouse. I used to live with my dad in Asia. I was about to start my last year of high school when I decided to move back to Spain. I was feeling lost and bored in Asia and wanted to start my life. My plan was to move back with my mom, finish highschool online and get a job or something.  A month after I arrived in Spain my mom's boyfriend got offended because I got frustrated when I was skateboarding. Apparently, for him, me getting frustrated was enough to end it all with my mom, which made me feel like shit because I don't want to hurt her. Anyways, 5 days go by without saying a word to him or him saying a word to me and we are back to being friends. One morning I wake up to my mom saying if I want to go on a road trip. I decided to go even though that it's really tough for me due to my crippling anxiety. The whole trip and day were good except for a couple of things which I didn't find as troubling but other people did. I used to be a very happy smiley person that would be the life of the party but that changed after 5+ really bad years. I was diagnosed with bipolar and I had really bad anxiety. This sorta changed how I acted mainly due to the really strong medication that they were giving me. Nowadays it's way harder to relate with people and have a good time with other people and I often feel more comfortable alone even though I hate being by myself. During that road trip, I barely said much because I didn't have anything valuable to say and I had a resting bitch face which is now the new normal for me. During the trip my mom would say ""cmon smile or act happy he brought us here to have a good time, he is spending his time and money on skateboard parts"".  I was happy and grateful for what he was doing I just wasn't showing it guess. I ended up getting mad with my mom because it really annoys me when people ask me if I'm ok when I am. I am not a victim or someone's puppy. Anyways, this is where started going downhill. We were at a store and he made a joke and pretended to hit my balls and then he softly tapped/punched my arm, sorta like what you do with your friends. I decided to give him a pat on the arm back which is sorta what you do in those situations. Apparently, that was disrespectful and got told off by my mom. The thing that I don't get is that he tried to pinch my balls without me being fully ok with it, but a pat on the arm crosses the line. After that, he once more thought of leaving my mom. There were a couple more situations after that similar to these which occurred after my girlfriend broke up with me. After all of this, I was really fed up and affected by this to the point that I wanted to run away or just move away. I decided not to because that would be too painful for my mom instead I decided to just act differently around both my mom and her boyfriend. With my mom, I act just like how I was 5 years ago before all the bad stuff happened. With him I just act like a whole completely different person, I really watch out with what I say and do making me extremely stressed. To conclude whatever this, I am right now at the point where I just want to disappear, I don't care about anyone, I don't know who I am it's like I've lost my personality, my soul. I don't want to keep living like this. I'm alone and slowly going crazy. All I want to do is do drugs because when I do I feel like myself again.

529,"So a girl I like called me few days ago and told me she broke up with her boyfriend. We talked, she came to my place the next day, we cuddled, kissed a little bit and agreed that she should come to a sleepover a couple of days later. She came yesturday, we were having a great time until we started having sex. She seemed to enjoyed when i teased her, she even starts blowing me all by herself (I didn’t initiate it). She was blowing me and after 5minutes she gets up and tells me that we should go back to watching movie and asks me if i told anyone about her coming to my place (I tell her that i did tell one friend). After a few minutes i dress up, but she pulls me to herself and starts kissing me and undressing me again. We started having sex. I was on top for a few minutes but then she wanted to switch (I thought it was strange that she wanted that soo soon). After 5minutes of her on top, she gets off and tells me she is sorry but she can’t do it becouse she keeps thinking about her ex. I was understanding becouse i really like the girl. Next morning after i dropped her of at her place, she texted that she is sorry and that it isn’t my fault but that we can’t do this and should just be friends. She still wants to hang out and talk, even tho we weren’t friends before. 
Have I done something wrong? I was a little nervous when having sex - I am not really good at it, and my penis is average (16cm). Is that the reason she stopped in the middle of the sex? Or is it really becouse her ex as she tolds me - I see she definitely isn’t over him, becouse she talks about him a lot and the breakup was a shock to her. So I understand all that but is that really the reason you stop in the middle of the sex? Would it still messed her up if we were having really good sex?

I have nothing wrong with that and I trust him but when spending that much time with someone especially of the other sex I’m scared of his old crush feelings might resurface. I don’t know if I’m being paranoid about it or overthinking it for no reason.

535,"TL;DR at the bottom.

Yesterday I was looking around on Reddit and was going down a rabbit hole leading, as these rabbit holes often do, to some NSFW subs. So I am clicking posts and I come to a subreddit that serves the particular niche of NSFW selfies/snapchats. Here is where my dilemma arises.  

I click on one post which was listed as one of the top posts when sorting by ""Hot"" despite being posted by a bot approximately 8 months ago. It is a selfie of a nude girl in a mirror with only the lower half of her face visible, and it looks familiar. It isn't obvious who this person is, but with various context clues I realize that I am looking at the inside of a dorm room at my school (my university has distinct dorms) and the individual in the picture is my girlfriend. The picture appears to be taken during her freshman year, before we started dating. 

I don't care why she took it or who it was going to because we weren't together, she had another boyfriend, etc. Not my business. However it is very clearly intended to be private and somehow found its way onto the internet, either through some sort of hacking of her device or being posted by her ex. There's no way of knowing. Anyways, I do a reverse image search on google and find out that the picture was leaked onto the internet around the spring or early summer of last year, and it's been on over a hundred sites, but I don't ever see her name mentioned or find anything other than that one picture.

Here is my dilemma:

It is clear that she did not intend for this to be posted, but she has never mentioned this or anything like this. She isn't clearly identifiable, but it wasn't hard to see who it was. I know for a fact that its her through various clues like the setting, phone case, etc. To this point, as far as I know, she is unaware of it and it has not done any damage to her directly or caused her any harm. However, as I understand it, to report images that are potentially ""revenge porn"" or non consensual, the individual has to report it themself. In other words, to do anything about it, I have to tell her.

I know she would be mortified to find this out and I don't know if telling her would cause more harm than good. Is it the best idea to tell her? Or do I just try to forget it since it hasn't caused any issues in the past year its been public? Sorry for the long read, I appreciate your help.

&amp;#x200B;

536,"I learned that a previous employer (healthcare) violated HIPAA and Blood Borne Pathogen Policies. I was treated REALLY poorly and left after a few days. I finally got the money that they needed to reimburse me for after MONTHS of asking for it, and I was happy to leave and never see them again. However, I am a bit upset because she treats so many employees (especially new ones) SOO poorly (over three people since I left have had the same feeling and only about 8 people work at both offices combine so I feel that is concerning).

537,"I'm sorry this is so long, hopefully someone makes it to the end.

One of my close friends (lets call her X) has planned to have a baby shower this weekend on the 8th. Our friend group has obviously been aware that this was coming but now as the date reaches more and more things have been stopping again due to Covid.

While hanging out with X, the father of her babies and another friend (call her Y), X explains how her mother in law had a scare and we just got into the topic of covid. After leaving her house I expressed to Y how I dont feel too comfortable about the situation anymore and she expressed the same feelings.

How X was planning it was having 25 people in her roughly 1,100 sq ft house to celebrate, taking place in the basement. Now she's hosted gatherings there before (in the previous years) such as friends-mas and New Years . Our friend group consists of roughly 11 people and that alone was pretty tight, its really hard to think 25 people would fit.

So Y and I decided to bring it up to X and explained to her that we don't feel comfortable being around people that we've never met before or seen in awhile (including one of or old co-workers who has been posting snapchats of herself around all her new coworkers without masks, smoking, etc) especially in such a  tight area. We told her we'd come earlier in the day but leave before anyone who wasn't in our usual friend group comes.

Understandably X got really upset at this. She explained that this would be her only time to celebrate since this will most likely be her only pregnancy since she's having twins. We told her a few options including splitting the baby shower to have our group over one day and the other group the next (we'd clean up and prepare for the next day of course so it wouldnt be much on her) or a drive-by baby shower like the one who mother-law set up for earlier in the year. What she wants if for everyone to meet each other and be together.

So what X ultimately decided was to have our friend group over Saturday and host the baby shower as a drive by on Sunday. Saturday she said wouldn't be part of the baby shower instead she said its her last ""hoo-rah"" since after the baby shower she's probably going to do some serious quarantine-ing and not be able to see anyone.

Now for the ""drive-by"" baby shower, she's going to have a set up in the BACKYARD. As she explained in the text, people will ""come, take a picture, grab something to eat and stay to chat if you'd like"". Her backyard is equally as small as the basement (probably a little smaller) since she has a huge pool that takes up the whole lawn that she doesnt want her baby-daddy to take down since ""he's been doing everything on his own"".

I know it's important to her, but it's frustrating that now she took both Saturday and Sunday, but still expects everyone who comes Saturday to come Sunday? Y and I had pitched a lot of ideas, offered help, kinda settled on a lot. I feel like X is being selfish really, but am I wrong for being so upset with her? I dont want to take away her day and I know she's pregnant so she's feeling a lot of things right now. I just really am not sure if im feeling too much.

Also, not going isn't an option. X would be super upset, she cried when we told her we wanted to leave early. Now she knows and explained that its not something she can control (our discomfort and the pandemic) and that how people feel is understandable, but she's still gets upset.",02Nov2020,1

I don’t wanna suffer in silence anymore and the only way I think I can find peace with myself is to just send her a paragraph of how I feel, but not so much a sorry letter right.

Has anyone else dealt with someone who they can’t get over to the point where it’s hurting you mentally.

541,"This feels so silly to type out, because so many people have it far worse than me, but I'm struggling.

I'm (F25) struggling because the UK just went into lockdown again, which essentially cages me at home alone. My partner, who I live with, works out of the house for most of the day (essential infrastructure job). I work from home in a job I hate, where I barely have enough to do to fill the hours (but that at least is secure). I'm lethargic and really struggling to motivate myself to do anything. 

We're moving into a new build in a few weeks (fingers crossed nothing goes wrong) and then at least I won't be stuck in a flat, we'll own our own house and I'll be able to rescue a dog, which I think will solve a lot of these issues. (I know this may ring some alarm bells, but please don't worry, I've wanted my own dog forever, we've always planned for one as soon as we could move into our own home, I've grown up with dogs and always loved them, this isn't a snap decision and I know dogs aren't just for lockdown!!)

In the meantime, despite spending most of my waking hours alone because we live in a 2 adult household I technically can't visit my parents and form a 'support bubble'; my two main hobbies are both outside the home, and have been closed until December; I live at least an hour away from nearly all my friends even if I could see them, and I don't have many in the first place, despite being someone who thrives on friendships and social contact; and I can see an end to at least some of the issues in a month's time, but this is helping and frustrating me in equal measures because this solution is entirely out of my control and may even get pushed back because of corona.

On top of this, I feel guilty because my problem isn't that I or my loved ones have coronavirus or that I'm worried about income security, which so many people are at the moment, and I should feel grateful that I at least have a home to feel impatient, bored and lethargic in and that I'm not dying on some corona ward. 

I don't know what to do with myself now, and really I just want someone to tell me how to get through the next month without being a complete fucking sad case.

And then id get my Friend to also go there (secretly) to try and capture as much footage as possible, And Ill essentially tell him the clarification, and then ill tell him to start it, then once the bois are at it, ill pull out my knife and stab 1 of them, and then I'll tell the other one, to Stop bullying me, or else, and then walk away. (btw my friend will basically be behind a wooden hut, or in it, and then once everything is done, and if he decides to press charges, essentially it will fail, because I have exact footage of what happened.

Now that I’m on a journey there I started to hate it. I hate to go to my club and I really hate to travel and stay at hotels even for a few days.

Issue is one of my reasons for the solo trip to Japan was to help determine if I'd like to move there, if at the very minimum for a couple of years. Should I subdue my feelings and solo this trip or should I embrace them and further postpone/cancel my solo plans? Thank you very much for reading this and for any help you can provide. ありがとうございました！

I've already been to Japan with a group of friends once for 2 weeks. Not sure if this will help with your advice, but I thought it might. Before the pandemic, and after my first trip, I was planning on going on a solo trip to Japan around this December. Obviously I'm not doing that anymore, but shortly after this pandemic is over (basically when a vaccine comes out and restrictions have been lifted) is when I've decided to postpone my trip to. My confliction is that before the pandemic I 100% without a doubt in my mind wanted to solo this trip, maybe talk to some locals at bars (learning Japanese right now) and just have a casual time of exploration and fun. More recently, however, I've been wanting to see if a few friends would like to join me on this trip, the issue is part of me still wants to solo this thing and so now I kinda don't know what to do. Another catch is one of the reasons I wanted to solo this trip was to see how I would enjoy Japan if I were to move there alone (since I would like to move there for at least a couple of years if not the rest of my life). Of course 2 to 3 weeks in any country isn't enough to make such an important decision, it doesn't help that I'm not actually living there and am just vacationing thus only enjoying the fun side of Japan without exposing myself to Japan's negative side which I know exists, i.e. working conditions. But, it's honestly the closest I can get to the feeling of living in Japan alone short of moving there myself. I would greatly appreciate any advice from anyone about whether I should subdue my feelings of wanting to go on this trip with a few friends or embrace those feelings and postpone the solo trip.

To all who read/respond to this post, thank you very much and I hope you have a great rest of your day! ありがとうございました！",02Nov2020,1

564,"I (17f) have been dating my boyfriend (18m) for 6 months. We have known each other since elementary school though. About a month ago, I bought condoms and I kept them in my purse because we decided we were ready to have sex. My mom went through my purse about two weeks after that because I had her lotion and forgot to return it. She found those, took them to my dad, they screamed at me, grounded me, said I can’t see my boyfriend anymore, all that. Well we still found ways to fuck anyways so I ended up buying some more one day before I came home from work. My parents finally took me off punishment this week. But they told me they knew that I bought some again because they picked up a receipt that I dropped. They told me that I was wrongfully defiant, disrespectful, and that I make parenting hard. I apologized but told them I don’t personally think I did anything wrong and that I think now would be a good time for us to just all have a conversation about this to voice opinions and concerns. They told me they refuse to talk about it because they should have had the last word and I should have respected it. Days have passed since this confrontation and they are still very angry with me. I’m in Georgia, age of consent here is 16, and I was only being responsible. I also wasn’t sneaking my boyfriend inside the house. We always kept it in the car or another place we could find. I tried having a conversation about this with them but I guess they don’t want to talk.",02Nov2020,1

So go read that one to get an idea of what I’m talking about! Though it’s a bit outdated compared to what I’m planning now!

I’m thinking of maybe taking a smaller zoo or Wildlife Park, and turning it into something great! Or maybe working my way up in a facility like [White Oak Conservation](https://www.whiteoakwildlife.org/) and running things there!

Something a little more realistic!

While I’m happy to have gotten the responses that I got, it still left the question of “Am I Doing The Right Thing” completely unanswered.

I wanted to know IF I should create the park in the first place!

While I do want to give Endangered Species and a safe place to live and a second chance at recovering their populations. Non-Releasable Wildlife (injured, orphaned, nuisance, etc) a permanent home and another shot at life. And a chance for people to interact with the wildlife and learn more about them. I don’t want to see the animals suffer emotionally or mentally under my care. 

I’m not even sure if I even sure if the concept of captive wildlife is truly okay or not. Even if it it’s justified. Would they be better off extinct or dead, but “free”?

Nor am I looking to do The Truman Show with animals, like what most people accuse zoos and other facilities of being like! (Which I thought about alleviating by giving the animals control as to weather or not they’re out and if people can see or interact with them!)

But sometimes, the alternatives are few, and though I can’t know for certain what’s going through any of these animals minds, I don’t think they’d want to die!

Plus, I’m the case of the endangered species, Captive breeding can be very helpful in conservation. There’s a lot of species that have it to thanks for their continued survival!

And as someone who’s had many wildlife encounters and experiences, it always means more and has a stronger impact in person!

So I guess it’s really not a black and white issue. Which makes all the harder to truly figure out!

Should I maintain captive populations and give these non-releasable animals homes, or would they truly be better off dead or extinct?

I bring this up because Quote had a Tower of Heaven remix with him.

569,"I went out drinking on Halloween with a bunch of my buddies. Everyone at the bar knew each other or had friends of friends. One of the guys we took the bus with was dressed up as a sexy cat. Now that didn't make me think he was gay because a lot of guys in our building do some pretty sus stuff just messing around. 

At the bar (I'm 10 shots and a beer deep at this point) one of my buddies kisses the cat guy and says to me ""bet you won't do it too pussy"" I said something like ""I'll do it alright, I'll just do it better"". I dipped the guy down and kissed him and everyone laughed, no big deal. 

At the end of the night as we were leaving the last bar we went to, I was carrying my buddy around and we were trying to get a cab to the club. Everyone else was worried about our curfew and I was close to 30 shots in so we ended up just all taking cabs back to our building. 

I blacked out between the cab and my room but I remember freaking out about some stuff and everyone calmed me down and the guy dressed as the cat ended up laying in my bed to keep me from waking up my roommates. Dont know how long we layed there but we ended up legit kissing and touching each other and stuff. It never ended up going as far as sex but, I mean, it was basically all there. I've only ever seen this guy in the hallways and at the gym and talked a few times, but he's good friends with a lot of our more senior guys here.

Thinking back on it now that I'm finally sober, I don't really know how to feel. I'm a little disgusted with myself but at the same time I don't feel any resentment towards the guy and honestly I wasn't blackout drunk when this happened. 

Does this mean I'm Bisexual? Was it just beer goggles? Should I try to explore this more or am I looking too deep into something that was probably just a fluke? I don't want to lead on a gay guy if I'm not actually into that but I also don't want to make someone feel like they're gross or did something wrong.

Him and I are both teens, he likes Star Wars, EDM music, video games (his favorite game is rainbow six) he occasionally reads webtoons (he liked tower of god, which had an anime art style and he used to watch other anime shows), he takes Japanese, he’s pretty into dragon ball and dragon ball games.

And since we don't eat home for every meal, some of us still have to go to work or we are just tired of eating the same fruit everyday...

These fruits goes bad and get thrown out sometimes or my dad will go around and keep asking us to eat it (int he most insensitive to our day kinda manner) 
He even scolds my helper if she didn't cut the fruits out and serve them (when no one simply wants to eat it, he wants her to cut and serve it right in front of us so that we will eat it.)

“I’m going to be honest and I want you to say nothing, first I want you to just delete all the photos of me on your phone and we really can’t be friends, I’m sorry but I have to prioritize my relationship rn and I can’t talk to you rn. so please just don’t share this conversation and if people ask please just say we don’t talk”

But within the last month he just wanted to hook up with me which made me feel like crap. Finally, he told me he wasn’t even interested in that and should just be friends. 

Well he started putting other women in my face so I started dating my guy friend from college. We went out to the club together one weekend and he promised to drive us so I could drink and relax but he left me at the club for another girl ...even though we planned to spend the night together. I had no where to stay because I wasn’t at my hometown. I lost my keys that night because before he left apparently he gave them back but I don’t remember.

I had to leave my car for a few days and pay for a tow and new key. I got back home to my dads and needed a ride to work. So I started paying for ubers to and from work. One night there were no ubers available so I called him to pick me up. I get off work at 10, he came at 9 but my boss told me I couldn’t leave early or I’d be fired. I told my dad that and he just left so I stayed there with the night shift. Around 2-3am I broke down and called my mom and she paid for my Uber. 

Anyway my mom later went on my Facebook and found I hadn’t blocked my older brother who was inappropriate with me when I was a kid (he was an adult) and I told my family. She said I was just as disgusting as he was and so I went back to my dads...who has now kicked me out because that same brother needs a place...I have trouble blocking my brother because I love him even though I understand he’s toxic. I just don’t talk to him. 

My friends are definitely disappointed in me and concerned because I’m not a person who drinks or smokes ever and the fact I had such a crazy weekend is concerning.

Last August i met a girl on a dating app, she lives in my village, just a few minutes away on a bicycle. We started to talk and we both felt a thing. So we quickly decided to meet. The first time we met we spent 5 hours together just talking and it felt so good for me. I'm a big introvert but she made me feel good and so i had no problem talking about me and my hobbies,  etc... After the first date she told me she felt the same and we decided to meet again the next day. The second date went as good if not better, and we saw each other a few more times until my finals came up and i told her i had to study. She told me she had no problem with that, that school come first and that she understood. So for 10-15 days i texted a bit less  and had no time to see her, but i still sent at least a goodnight message every day. When i was done with my finals and asked her to meet again, it felt like she was a different person, answering only half my messages ( and i'm not the spammer type of guy ), always having escuses when i wanted to see her, or saying ok but then ghosting me. She deleted me from FB and denied it when i asked her about it. I tried my best to see if i had done anything wrong but she wouldn't tell me anything.. so we went our separate way but she left me heartbroken because i hadn't been this happy with a girl for years...

6 weeks later, i get a message from an unknow number. Since i had deleted her number, i did a quick google search with the number + her name + the name of my village. I did that because i knew she was looking for a job and often posted small jobs offerings ( sorry my english is not perfect, i mean like facebook posts offering to do babysitting, etc ), and so i thought a match would show up to confirm or not that it was her, before i would answser the message. I wasn't ready for what came up with that google search...

She was registered on an Escort site, with full naked pictures ( except her face ) and all her ""services"" and prices. I knew it was 100% her because i recognised her belly button piercing, bracelets and a tatoo.

Now i don't know what to do with that, i want to finally get an answer as to why she ghosted me when all was going so good,  but some part of me wants to get reveange on her for leaving me heartbroken by threatening her with her little secret. i know it makes me a bad person to think that so it's why i came to this subreddit for advice...

Not only that, but management is like family and they'd be more than willing to work around whatever schedule I need. They'll just be happy to have the help.

Is this really such a big deal? I'll only be there for a month (December) and if it ends up causing a lot of bullshit I feel like I can explain that and have people work with me to make it better.

Let me know what you think??

Tldr: I need some part-time money and I'm considering going back to the restaurant where my ex and current bf still work.",02Nov2020,1
597,"This is generalising and a rant so if you don’t wanna read that then skip past this

So TLDR: in my experience girls just want the “finished article” when it comes to men. Everything nowadays is instantly a “red flag” like having insecurities, having problems such as stubbornness.

I feel like the term “red flags” gets thrown around way too easily, like yes, I am a human fucking being that’s lived a pretty standard life, a rough upbringing, social anxiety and insecurities develop through these things. Maybe instead of looking for Peter perfect or the “finished article” give a guy like for example myself, a chance, a guy who wants to work on himself and self improve. Who wants to improve his mental, emotional and spiritual well being. And yeah I know nobody is looking for someone who is “perfect” cause there’s no such thing, but you get what I mean, someone who doesn’t suffer from practically any insecurities of their own and can entirely focus all his energy and Patience and time and attention to you.

In this era, the era of instant gratification, of wanting results yesterday, no girl has the time or patience for a guy like me who just needs reciprocation, time, patience and understanding. I’m just so sick of this shit, here comes the cliche line to send into the void of Reddit, being a straight average looking man is depressing as fuck!!! You don’t have a chance!

I find this all frustrating as I’m a m 26, who is decently good looking, in good shape, fit and healthy, I wouldn’t say I’m intelligent because I think it’s arrogant to call oneself intelligent but I think I have certain pieces of knowledge that are interesting that I can share. I have a passion for sports, video games and movies. I love exercising, I enjoy drinking and socialising even though I do suffer from social anxiety, I am really self aware and take care of my appearance, I dress well, have a daily skincare routine, and like I said, am active and look after my physique.

598,"I’m a 28M, I’ve lived a pretty mundane life in all actually. I’m a poster child for “gifted kid burnout” in that I never learned to really do anything that didn’t come naturally to me. I’m lazy, and insecure.

So I moved to California from Ohio in March because I wanted to see how I’d fair by taking improv classes (I used to do improv comedy). 12 days later, Quarantine hits.

It’s put me in a unflinching mental state of “this was a bad idea”. The friendships at home I’ve lost, the opportunities shutting down, even the toxic relationship I was in seems so nice in hindsight (mostly because she was hot, and I’m a fool).

I managed to get fired from the job I used to solidify this move, then found a nearly identical job.

So I moved out here, and all I’ve done is lose since I arrived. It feels like my life, my time, is just being wasted.

I’m thinking of moving back to Ohio, getting a dog in a studio apartment and just settling into the reality that I was never meant to come out here.

I’m kind of at a loss, and nowhere, and no one feels like home. It’s been a crippling loneliness and fear all the way. 

I could use some sage advice, some friendly nudge, because I’m mostly just spending money to live here for the views. At a loss.

600,"So, (long story short), I received a call from Aldi letting me know that I got the job AKA ""hired after the designated screenings."" But I also did a phone interview with a Grocery Co-op job I really want, and they would let me know today (Monday) if I go in for an in-person interview because they liked my phone interview. But I am supposed to let Aldi know TODAY (Monday!!) if I want to accept the job. So, do I wait for the Co-op to let me know if they want me or just accept Aldi? Aldi, of course, pays more, but the co-op gives a discount on all the health/food items etc, which are things I am interested in knowing more about. But, the only issue with the Co-op is that my old friend, (who ghosted me for no reason after I called her out for being mean to me), works there with her new best friend/college roommate, so I would see them often and it might be awkward. What do I do? The Co-op would be much more laid back, get to wear whatever I want, but the money won't be as good as Aldi, as I am saving up to travel next summer. With Aldi, I could transfer to other locations if I decide to move out and find a job in the city I want to live in. Any suggestions?",02Nov2020,1

605,"So he has two offers. He can either work as a Ford rep and for 4/7 days he’d be on the road going to different Ford shops and telling them how and what they need to do in order to maintain a good shop. He would make 70-100k a year there with health, dental and life insurance. There were other benefits I believe but this seems like a more stable option.

The other one is that my brother in law was planning on buying this property right down the road so he’d be able to walk there. Its a mini auto shop with an incredible location in the center of town, great shape, great town in Maine. But he’d only make 60k at most I think maybe a little more for running the entire place. Hes always wanted to run his own place but this job doesn’t come with any benefits and pays a lot less.

Now, however, he’s just gotten very irritating. He needs someone to keep him company 24/7 it seems. Before my mom left on her flight to go to my sister to help her out because she was pregnant, she’d be over there with him from 7 AM - 9 PM. Most days my dad wouldn’t even get to tell my mom bye before he left for work and I wouldn’t see her until she came home to get in the bed to sleep. He told me he wished she hadn’t left because (in his opinion) she was needed here more so she could keep him company.

Every day after work (I work until 6 PM and I also take 5 college classes) he tells me to come visit with him and eat with him, when all of us are struggling to fix him meals because WE ALL HAVE LIVES and my aunt and her grown kids have children and jobs. We are all just very exhausted after working yet he expects us to entertain him and not leave until 9 PM because he gets lonely... He will guilt us as well, telling us he’ll cry if we leave. We have to tell him we have work, school, other obligations etc that we have to tend to. I don’t think he understands that life doesn’t stop just because someone dies. My grandma had severe dementia and he wanted her to be at home instead of in a nursing home yet he was unwilling and unable to help care for her and the rest of the family had to tend to her care which was unfair to us. She was bedridden, could only remember 3 people, was hallucinating, had to wear diapers, had no understanding of where she was, the whole 9 yards.

In my opinion he just needs to get into a routine and find hobbies and things to do to occupy his time because we are all beginning to resent him deeply for guilting us into spending every free moment with him. The door broke and while he was eating breakfast with a good friend of his at a restaurant, my aunt and her husband and their kid came and fixed it and I went over there to see if I could find my earphones, and after he fixed it he said “Well I don’t want to be mean but we all better leave before he gets back or we’ll be here until midnight.” It’s so hard to leave because he guilts us and we are all frustrated. I don’t know if my grandpa doesn’t realize this or if he simply doesn’t care but either way I’m about to snap. He refuses to watch tv or anything else even when I mention it to him. We all miss her to death but we can’t mourn and cry the rest of our days. That’s not healthy and that’s not what she’d want.",02Nov2020,1

i just turned 17 years old last month. i was in highschool , (wouldve been a senior this year) and had a job up until the summer, which i lost due to COVID related reasons.

so during this summer i was pursuing joining the (US) military. they told me i could join, and said if i dropped out and got my GED i could leave within the next 3 months. so i did just that, and turns out they were lying to me, and told me that i couldn’t leave until i turned 18 but i could still join. then when i said no because they lied, they flipped it on me and said nobody made you drop out, and if i don’t join i’ll never be shit with my life. 

so here i am a month later, not in school with a GED, just turned 17, and struggling to get a job. i’ve tried literally everywhere, applying online to walking into every store once a week asking for an application. on top of that, i just got my permit as in the state I live you get your permit at 17 if you pass the written test.  i’m making money from things i can’t put on a resume, and trying my best to find anything that’ll get me out of the house. all job opportunities i’ve been given have disqualified me due to age (18+ are priority due to covid) 

i haven’t been able to find a job after searching since i lost my previous one, and i’m losing my mind having nothing to look forward to and wasting so much time not doing shit with my life.  i just would like some advice on what i should do with myself that will benefit my future. i don’t necessarily need a job or anything, but i would like insight on what to do from here that will be best for me so i’m not wasting this year. 

all the best, and safety &lt; 3

I was speaking to other people and she started speaking to my boyfriend very flirty... giggling... putting arm around him... hugging him. Fine. See her done it to everyone. But he was doing it back. We were the only other couple at this party so I shrugged it off like whatever. 
Flash forward an hour and someone turns off the main lights (tiny oven light on) and everyone’s dancing. I am other side of room. He dances past her to get his drink and dances back to where he was but he’s checking her out and they’re looking into each other’s eyes. Not giggling. It was an intense look. The “I’m checking you out” look. 
Then he dances past her again closer to the same place to look like he’s getting something and then dances back. I think he held he might have held onto her hips that time as not to “fall over”. Sure.

628,"So I just turned 21 a day ago and I am usually content on just a birthday cake and a dinner with the people I love. I honestly do not expect much nor do I even ask for anything.   
However, considering it was my 21st birthday, my parents did not give me a gift but they gave my sister (23F) a $1000+ pendant for her 21st birthday, alongside paying for a fraction of her birthday party as a significance of a milestone reached. Sadly, my 21st came during a pandemic and I understand that I cannot host a party and there isn't much that could be done due to the restrictions imposed on gathering. However, I am starting to feel a little bit envious that my sister got a gift (disregarding the price) whilst I did not receive anything at all for my supposed milestone achieved. They did not forget my birthday as they wished me and my mom gave me $100 to spend on my birthday dinner with friends (credit is given where it is due).  


Also, a few days prior to my birthday, though my parents brought me to a nice birthday dinner, it was also their first time meeting my girlfriend of a year. I was so excited for them to finally meet but for the entirety of the dinner, my parents ignored my girlfriend's presence and didn't ask her a single question about her name, interests etc (when I say ignore, it was as literal as treating as if she wasn't there). This got me really upset about their disinterest and lack of hospitality towards my girlfriend. Granted that it was their first time eating with a 'stranger' (hence might be awkward) and they paid for the meal, I was still very upset that nothing was done to include my girlfriend AT ALL. The entire dinner was them using their phone, walking around looking at the view, and just talking amongst themselves. My GF and I left the dinner really baffled, having prepared really hard to make a good impression of her on them. I broke down as I felt really embarrassed and the past few days has been really miserable for me.  


Am I just being a brat and expecting too much? Am I wrong to just want a small gift, regardless of the price? Am I wrong to feel that their lack of hospitality towards my GF was uncalled for?

633,"Little background, my brother doesn’t really care for money. To him it’s a very low priority in his life even though he’s got plenty of it. 

Now his car broke and he needed to get around. So I offered to drive a few hours and give him my car to use for 2 weeks while I take his car to get fixed close to me because I know some people take a look at his car. He agreed so I drove and gave him my car. 

All in all, everything went fine and the car got fixed, he brought my car back and he has left with his car again. 

Now here’s where I need some advice. For me, a thank you is more than enough. It’s not even needed in most cases, because he’s family and we are always there for each other. Now he has left me a quite a significant amount of money to say thank you. I really appreciate it, but I really want to give it back and I know he won’t take it back as money. 

So I need some help on how to pay him back. I’m really terrible with gifts and he basically has everything he wants (for now), but I feel bad just keeping the money. 

Any idea on what’s a good way to pay him back?",02Nov2020,1

The thing is that this semester, I'm failing 5 of my classes with 0's and I'm sure that I'll have to drop them.

Growing up and to this day, my parents expected nothing less than perfection from me, and they are not strangers to using violence and mental abuse to make sure that happens. It's because of this that I've been putting off telling them that I'm failing and I'll have to potentially withdraw for this semester.

640,"My best friend has been diagnosed with ADHD, BPD, and depression. She's ""high-functioning"" at the moment, but in a constant state of existential crisis. 

I used to have severe depression myself, but now I feel at such a loss as to how to help her. 

We normally have such high-concept, philosophical conversations and have bonded over a cynical worldview when it comes to politics, economics, etc. But now I'm at a place where I'm like ""yes the world is bad but when I have a nice oat milk latte or see a pretty sunset that's enough."" She rationally understands this but it's very hard for her to internalize.

She's had a lot of traumatic events happen this year. I try to redirect her energy onto the good times we have together and it does seem to help in those moments. But I don't know how to deal with her increasing misanthropy. We moved to London together recently (where she's from, I'm not) and she's struggling to reconnect with her friends here. I've known them for years through her now so I suppose they're my friends too. But it's really hard for her to socialize with them, or anyone really. I am very loyal to her, but put in awkward situations when I hang out with her friends when she's not there and they'll ask me what's wrong with her. I think it may be elements of BPD that cause her to be like this? Of course I don't say that to them I just excuse it with the her stress.

She describes herself as ""uptight"", but it's almost unbearable the commentary she'll make about other people. She's even told me ""I don't understand anyone else's life choices. It really repulses me the way other people live."" It'll be something as simple as a friend suggesting a restaurant that she's deemed ""uncool"" and then she'll get in such a bad mood and will abandon dinner plans. 

She's unbelievably wealthy, but doesn't feel well-connected which I think might explain some of her resentment. She's constantly expressing how she doesn't have the right friend group and wants sophisticated, well-educated friends but that's who we hang out with? Like our friends all went to top universities and we've bonded over similar cultural tastes. It's like no one is enough or if they have one personality quirk she can't see past it.

649,"I had a childhood best friend who had strong romantic feelings for me. We were best friends for many years. I loved him dearly as a friend but did not return his romantic feelings. 

After we both graduated from high school, we kept in touch very sporadically. We live in different cities so there is quite a bit of distance between us. A few years ago, when we met up, he hinted at his romantic feelings again. But I was already in a relationship at that point so I rejected the notion again.

After that, our contact slowly turned to non-existent. When we did speak, he said he still considered me one of his best friends, and I thought he meant it. When I got engaged two years ago, I told him pretty much right away, because I still considered him my dear childhood friend. He said he was happy for me and my fiance. I also invited him to our wedding this year, which he said he would try to attend if his circumstances allowed. But the wedding ended up being postponed until the next year due to the pandemic.

He has also had a girlfriend since 2017. A couple of years ago, when they visited my city, my fiance and I met up with them for brunch. When we met up, she was fine at first, but then proceeded to act less and less friendly to me. After that time, my childhood friend became even more distant toward me. Which I understand - if his girlfriend didn't like me, I guess he had to put her first.

I just found out they recently got engaged. I don't know when it happened, but he didn't tell me at all. No text, email, nothing. I found it a little bit hurtful, considering I told him my engagement before even announcing it on Facebook AND invited him to my wedding. I treat him like my friend and he doesn't treat me like his. Maybe it is a little naive of me to think this friendship would last.

What should I do in this situation? I guess just forget about him? I'm not going to reach out to him about his engagement, considering he didn't even tell me. I'll probably not re-invite him to my wedding next year either, unless he tries to contact me first, which is not likely. I also don't want to experience any unpleasantness from his fiance. It is a bit painful to end our lifelong friendship like this, but I can't connect with him if he doesn't want it.",02Nov2020,1

669,"Hello. This is a very hard post for me because I don't really know what to do about this and I'm kinda anxious.

I have this friend I've known since 7th grade. (We are all in 11th grade now) We weren't best friends but we were still kinda close all the way through high school but her best friend in middle school hated and talked shit about behind my back a lot, so I wasn't very eager to get closer to my-now-friend (?) I'll call her friend B.

When we went to high school, B, my friend and I all went to different high schools. I still kept in contact with my friend and we became very, very close. She became my best friend. Since B wasn't around I assumed she got over me and stopped talking shit about me. I told my friend that I'm bisexual (my family is very homophobic and only a few close friends know that) and some other secrets because I trusted her a lot.

Then she mentioned that B still talks shit about me a lot. She said she doesn't do anything to stop it and just says okay, yea etc until she stops. I got really sad because if someone talked shit about my best friend I would defend them. It was clear that my friend liked B more than me or at least she didn't like me enough to stand up for me. I still thought maybe she just doesn't have the courage to stand up for me so I decided to ignore it.

At 10th grade my friend moved to USA and we had a huge fight after a month or so. (It's not about her moving to USA lol, a private matter of mine) I begged her (yes!) to forgive me but she didn't. After a few months she suddenly texted me and I acted cold. 2 weeks later she contacted me again and I decided to befriend her again. To be fair nothing was the same anymore.

I noticed that she talks shit about B a lot. I told her to stop her friendship with her if it's so toxic like she says. I also told her to stop talking shit about her to me because it's annoying but she didn't stop. She then tells me she loves her a lot and they both know they talk shit about each other behind their backs, that's normal for their relationship. I asked if she talks about shit behind my back too and she said she didn't. But then confessed she would when we weren't talking to each other if B and her talked more during that time. (apparently she fought with B too but they made up) I no longer see her as someone I can trust, let alone a best friend.

The only reason I'm still not confronting her is that she's so damn dramatic and if I try to talk to her she will just make a drama out of it, maybe even spill my secrets. I'm so mad at myself for trusting and loving her so much. If she tells my family that I'm bisexual, I'm dead. I don't want to talk to her anymore and I want her out of my life because she feels so toxic, but I'm afraid she will just tell my shit to everyone around.

They didn't believe her when she said she needed a certain hygienic product, she's currently running low on medication and might not have the funds to get more (assuming that they even agree to drive her to get them, which they probably won't), and just last night my great-uncle called and said that he wanted to come over and ""fix"" a perfectly good lock, causing my grandmother to basically barricade herself in her room. She was crying to my mother over the phone because she was so afraid.

It is important to note, ever since they started speaking again (my mother and grandmother were estranged from each other for probably about a year or so), my mom's noticed that my grandmother does have memory and possibly some emotional regulation issues. I won't say exactly what she was diagnosed with, for her privacy, but it does have an effect on her day-to-day mentality. However, she says that a doctor told her she was fine enough to take care of herself, and aside from some off days, she's functional and is mostly taking care of herself.

Due to a number of reasons, my mother can't move back to take care of her. My great uncle has been threatening legal action over a law that doesn't exist (he wants to force my mom to come back to ""deal with this""). My grandfather is in the hospital with unrelated illness, and hasn't been answering phone calls, not that there's anything he can do to help in his situation. My mom wants to contact the CLSC, (my great-uncle and his daughter *claimed* they were already there, though considering they've lied about nearly everything else, I don't believe them for a second), but what else should/can we do to support my grandma? How can we be there for her through this? And as a side-question, how can I help support my mother, who's taking a toll on her emotional health over the situation?

Thanks so much in advance, and I hope everyone reading has a good day. Sorry if this is a little long-winded. I don't know all of the details, but this is the situation as far as I know it.",02Nov2020,1
680,"I'd like to say I'm a mature person for the most part, and one of my strengths is treating people respectfully. This makes me usually pretty good when interacting with strangers or making friends online. Most of this involves being passively kind. In my opinion some people would appreciate if you're more persistent with checking up and just like chatting. This may be because they're feeling lonely or depressed or something else. With these cases I guess I go overboard and I'm just too much. I don't know how to word it. I'm pretty chill and it's certainly not that I'm too optimistic or too high-energy. 

For example the most recent time this happened it was using snapchat and if they didn't respond for like 3 days I tried messaging again. Sometimes when I did this it would seem weird to see 2+ messages go unread over the course of the week, and I didn't like seeing ""delivered"" so I just deleted it. After that I realized this person was just ghosting but I wasn't mad at all, and just curious. But I think from the other persons perspective these are the qualities of an impatient/desperate person.

What should you do in situations like this? Or is it case by case? Also I don't know what subreddit is best for this. Thanks",02Nov2020,1
681,"Promise this ia for real... the timing of this is because of the election tomorrow.. please no political debates 


For the last 20 years my grampa (moms step dad) has lived out of an RV traveling the country and we hear from him randomly. He just will randomly call my mom and then time will go by and we realize we haven't heard from him and my mom will call and check in. 

They don't have a very close relationship but he is her only family left so this how they do things. He likes his independence and it has never ever been an issue til recently.

He is in his late 80s. Lives now in a RV community in Arizona. 

When Trump became president he started claiming his neighbors were all spying on him because he is anti Trump. He says these people watch him and spy on him and try to retaliate against him for being anti Trump. 

He claims to have changed addresses... phone numbers. They still find him. He has switched his phone number more than 5 times since this all began.

So my mom has been trying to contact him for months and finally today he called her back
 
He said he is on his way to an undisclosed location and he can't talk on the phone now because he found a bug in his house.

He said when he gets to the undisclosed location he will call her back and explain further what is going on.

My mom believes this could actually be happening to him. 

I, on the other hand, for years now have been telling her he has something. Wrong with him mentally and she needs to figure out where he is at... fly out there and see for herself what is going on. 

She always finds a reason not to go.. I think she is scared of what she is going to find. 

She says he can't prove any of this even if she went out there. 
I said to go out there and make him go to a doctor and get evaluated she said it's not just that easy. 

She says he seems completely normal and perfectly fine talking about anything else ans he remembers things from our past correctly. 

He is absolutely adamant that these Trump people are spying on him.

He said today he went to take money out of his savings account for a new car and somehow his neighbor knew how much money he took out 

I know it is possible this could be true and there are people out there who target the elderly but thus sounds so far fetched.

We have had police do wellness checks when we desperately can't contact him and everything always ends up ok.

687,"Hi all, newbie to reddit and I need some advice and probably a reality slap in the face. 

So, I met my ex bf abt 8 months ago in an online game (not gonna specify which one exactly). We met, talked, got into a group of friends and eventually started dating. The relationship was mostly good, we talked a lot every day until our jobs caught up to us and we started losing topics of conversation. I didnt think about it as ""bad"" but as a thing that will pass by bcs our work had been nearly finished and we had a strong connection. We still had ""I love u""s and all that stuff until one morning he just brojke up w me bcs of reasons above and also bcs he just got cold over time. Now, for me this was out of the blue because he never said prior that he has any problems, nothing. I thought we were on a same page w that. I was heartbroken but I did not want to make it weird for our friends, so I told him when he gets back to game that we all can still play to which he agreed. Thing is, my plan was to let my feelings pass b4 that as he stopped playing altogether.

This is where it gets weird.

That same day after I cried my heart out, I invited some friends to play and we all got on voice. We did not invite him as he was not playing anymore and I need some time to heal. But, he decides to join voice chat aswell and start talking about some random shit. That caught me by suprise and made me very sad. But my friends are also his friends so I just kept my mouth shut. 

Two days later he asks ""how are u?"" and I apologize and say I need more time b4 I can talk/play w him. He accepts that and says he wont force anything until Im ready.

Thing is, we have one more group, one which he did not want to play anymore w bcs we were not performing well enough for him. We have a fixed schedule every night when we play pvp and each time he spams us w messages when we start playing, saying even that he will come back. Last night he joined voice chat again blabbering some random shit again even though he knows that we cant really respond normally bcs we are fighting. Each time his messages pop up or I hear his voice, my heart shatters and I continue to cry after each session. Im trying to get rid of feelings and the hope that he will come back to me, but his behaviour makes it hard for me. Also I percieve it as very rude bcs I told him I need my time.

Is it fair to ask him to stop doing these things at least while I try to heal from breakup? He did not seem to miss playing w our friends, even shitting on them, hence why I continued playing w them as they lift my spirits up. At the same time, I dont really want to gatekeeo him out of the games just bcs of my feelings.

I love maths, I find the work good, I’ll be able to answer questions during class and also able to do my homework. But when I have a test is where I go wrong. I feel like I get overwhelmed and I start to overthink everything. 

A few months ago I did an algebra exam. I got just over 50%, and majority of the class got above 70%. I could easily do those questions at home or during class and score above 80%, but as usual, I capitulated and worries myself during the exam. 

I have another maths exam later this week, on circles and lines. I’ve spent a few weeks revising the test. I was feeling pretty good, until one of my maths teachers said that the test is going to be hard. He said he hadn’t seen the test, but he knows it’ll be hard 

So I’ve got even more anxious about the exam. So until the test, I’m just going to spend my time doing exam questions. 

But I fear I will capitulate and overwhelm myself again. It’s annoying, I can do well on the exams if it wasn’t a test, so I try to psychologically tell myself it’s not that big, but I know what I’m telling myself, so it doesn’t really work.

698,"I (25F) have mid-back length hair that I've never died/bleached before, and I haven't used any heat in 2 years. I take big pains. Silk pillowcases, cold water, multivitamins, protective styling, regular trims, expensive products, etc.

The only damage is thin ends and frizz due to pretty serious iron-deficiency anemia. I've also had the ""Japanese straightening perm"" done two times in the past, 10 and 4 years ago. Both resulted in straight, silky, 100% frizz-free hair, 100% no visible damage at all.

I went to this new hairdresser because he had great reviews for the Japanese straightening specifically; he is the owner of his salon. I booked an appointment for a small chop and a consultation and chatted with him, and opened up to him about my anemia and hair insecurities. He highly recommended the straightening as the ""only fix"" for my hair.

When he did the treatment, I noticed he did the whole thing ""twice"" as though it didn't ""take"". I kick myself now for not confronting him about it. Basically he slathered on chemicals, waited, washed my hair, dried it, then straightened it, two times. The other places just did it once.

When he finished, I could see right away that my hair was frizzy all-over and damaged. The ends are fried to shit, fried right off. The curly and melted texture is clearly chemical damage. I immediately pointed it out to him. I told him the ends still look curly. He brushed me off and said, ""it's damaged. That's because you straighten your hair"". I stopped him in his tracks that I don't. He basically was very rude and laughed at me like he openly didn't believe me, and said ""lots of things cause damage"" like talking to a child.

He offered to patch-test a new keratin treatment on me that he'd never used on clients before. The results were really underwhelming to me; my hair was still damaged and frizzy. He made a big show of it, calling it a ""miracle"" and calling over his colleagues. He offered to do the treatment for me another day for ""only"" $100, ""only on the affected area"" (I have a feeling it's just going to be the ends). I left unsatisfied. With the keratin, the total spent would come to $500.

I've washed my hair for the first time now, and the ends are FUCKED. They're totally melted and I have no idea what to do, I've spent so long nurturing my hair. Has anyone gone through this?

As i met my friends one night we talked about the complexity of the situation and my friends were nagging me about forcing him to move out. I honestly dont remember why someone suggested that he could move home to his home country as a valid solution, bc its ridiculous when you think about it, but i said no he cant. As a follow up someone asked why and i should have just said something along the lines of; bc he doesnt live there anymore, and he does not want to live there. 

Its kinda fuzzy how everything went down since this was last winter and we were a bit high, but basically instead of what i should have said i said something along the lines of;
I cant talk about it but essentially there are a lot of trauma for him to face there. I think my friend kept going and being like ok but maybe he needs to face that trauma... 

And instead of being like... you know what this isnt even rrlevant, there are tons of reasons he doesnt wanna go back to his home country and none of them doesnt even concern our living situation bc our living situation is more based on temporary convenience than anything else....

703,"Hi, I’m posting this because I don’t know what else to do. I have two sons ages 10 and 14 and oh my god I can’t anymore. My husband passed away about five months ago now and without him I can’t manage our children.  His death, though I don’t want to go in to detail, was tragic and no doubt traumatic for both boys.  I have tried to take them both to therapy but this has proven to be quite difficult. 10 year old goes but doesn’t talk (I have tried four different therapists). 14 year old flat refuses and considering he’s taller than me and stronger than me, I can’t physically force him to do anything.  Not to mention that he is extremely manipulative and gets what ever he wants. I know every parent says how intelligent their kids are but he really is, he skipped a grade (two in math). If he doesn’t want to go to school, he’ll convince me to not make him go to school even though I know exactly what he’s doing. He has no respect for me whatsoever and my younger son copies everything he does. It’s not like this defiance is a new thing either, it’s been going on for years, specifically with me, but never like this.  If his father had told him to do something, he’d do it, usually no questions asked.  I feel like my own children hate me and it breaks my heart.  I have explained my situation to some of the therapists and told them about my oldest’s behavior and they all say the same thing, that I need to stand my ground, learn how to say no and that I need to punish him, but it’s not that easy. Any punishment I’ve given him he’s found a way around.  The thing is too, it’s not like he’s a bad person.  And yes I know all parents say this, but I hear nothing but good things from teachers and other adults. The parents of his friends have commented on how kind and respectful he is.

However, my wife and I both work full time. She works a more traditional 4-5 day a week job and I work several long shifts in a row so one of us is usually home to watch the little one, albeit by ourselves usually, so that’s been tough but we’re getting by. 
I am also currently in college, I not very happy with my current job, it’s a long commute and it doesn’t have much of a long term appeal to me, but the money is good. 
So my shedule for the last few months has been: work three 12+ hour shifts in a row, come home and slog my way through my online classes during the week, while trying to take care of a baby and keep up my relationship with my wife and maintain the house.

708,"Long backstory. I'm currently 16, so it still takes some time until I can move out from my parents house and start a life of my own.

The thing is, I don't know if I'll be able to or do it in the way I want to. My parents are rather controlling of me, and while they are not necessarily bad, I know they are somewhat abusive and toxic. 
Problem: although I am already old enough to know how to cook and care for myself, I am still super dependent on them to a point where it's ridiculous. My mother still insists on picking out my clothes in the morning, refusing me to develop my own style. Coming from school, if there's no food I will buy something from my parent's money. I never had some kind of job before. I fear that I won't be able ho make the change from living with them from living on my own and being able to cut myself off from them.

Why I want to do that? I recently found out that my dad is (probably 90% sure) cheating. Idk how, but selective memory let me remeber the name of a site my father acted suspicious about when I was maybe 12. Looked it up: it's escorts and prostitution locations. Other times he was stupid enough to use incognito mode but not close it later, leaving my younger self exposed to topless women and sexual stuff. On the laptop the whole family can use there's a lot of unsecured porno. My memory's too bad to remember if there were some 'weird', maybe illegal things too, although I have a light suspection...  I have a younger brother (12) and fear that he might find something like that and leave traumatized too.

Although I often say I hate my parents, more so my mother for being controlling and emotionally demanding, I think this is not fair for her. My family is strictly christian (and homophobic, racist... you get the idea) so I don't know how they would take this all. Most importantly if they found out I'm a bisexual leftist atheist. The worst combination in their eyes.

I am torn because I know I most probably need some kind of therapy due to my psychical and memory problems besides having major aggression issues, but my mother asks me 'aren't you ashamed of yourself?' every time I do something she deems as 'socially dammaging for HER immage'.

That's why I'm thinking of dropping every little thing I found out in the course over the years, about myself, my family, and cut all contact. I really feel horrible each time I come home from school, like the atmosphere darkens when I enter the room.

My friends have basically told me I can't do anything until I got my studies and found a possibility to live elsewhere. I know that myself. Still, should I do it when I have the possibility to?

I don’t remember most of the evening but I remember she was very stressed once we got to the car because I had to drive us home as she only has her permit but I wasn’t sober enough. She drove to Target but I remember she sounded very stressed which is very understandable since she still doesn’t have her license. After the target trip it had been about 3 hrs since we drank and I was sober enough to drive us home.

We’ve been texting in the 2 days that passed since Halloween but I can tell she’s mad at me. She texted me Halloween night after we got home and she was like “i hope you’re ok but let’s never do something like this again. i’ve been crying since i got home” so basically she was having an anxiety attack. I comforted her and the next day she said she was fine and that it’s not my fault but I feel so bad. She didn’t have to clean my vomit and take care of me but she did because she cares for me. I’m planning on getting her some food as a sort of i’m sorry gift but I don’t know what else to do. She hasn’t been texting me like normal and she’s barely talked to me. 

We’re super close so it’s easy to tell when she’s actually mad. I completely understand why she should be but I don’t know how to fix it. I want to just give her space but I also want to apologize a million times, but I don’t want to be annoying. Any advice would help!!",02Nov2020,1
710,"You can look at my last two posts for some reasoning. Basically, a combination of things has made me feel like my (27m) six-year relationship has run its course. We’ve lived together for close to three years, having moved across the country and back to our hometown. “We’ve had our ups and downs” rings true, but a nagging voice in my head over the last couple of months has been telling me it’s more than just downs. That I’m genuinely not happy, or at least not as happy as I could be.

I’m happy to go into the details of what led us here and how I feel, but I don’t want this to be too long and very little of it is exciting. We got together in college and in my later 20s I’m realizing that there is an incompatibility I cannot exactly articulate but i can’t deny it. 

I’m looking for some advice on how to approach ending this long term relationship in a way that’s thoughtful to both of us. I 95% support her financial (rent, utilities, most food and entertainment) and she doesn’t have a simple support system to fall back on. Her parents live here, but her older sister already lives in their spare room, friends won’t have her stay because of COVID, etc. I’ve never ended a long term relationship before, let alone one where we live together. I am lost. 

I also am dealing with the ongoing guilt and second-guessing because I really do love her so much. I often tell myself that since I love her I should just stick it out for a month, six months, a year and maybe my feelings will change. But that is just so unfair to us both...the last few days I’ve been thinking I need to pull the bandaid off and so I’m trying to keep my head down and get the advice and support I need to do the right thing. 

Any and all support is appreciated. Willing to give more details here or over DM if anyone is interested in helping. I really appreciate your time",02Nov2020,1
711,So I’m set to get out of the military in spring of next year and I’m torn between going home or staying here for school. I have my benefits so I’m not so much worried about finances. One of my biggest reasons for wanting to go home is my friends and family. I moved away for the first time in my early teens and I moved back shortly before joining the military. I just feel like I didn’t have much time with them and I really enjoyed the short time that I was back. I’m not sure if what I’m feeling is just nostalgia for a time that’s passed but I don’t think it is because when I went home on leave in 2019 everything was great like it was before I joined. So should I go reunite with everyone back home or should I explore this opportunity to be in a new place. Thanks.,02Nov2020,1

I'm pretty sure people can relate but 2020 is by far the most life changing year of my life. I lost my virginity, had a friend pass away, had mild symptoms of coronavirus earlier this year, being isolated has developed a minor depression for me, I went through an intense ear infection that was so painful that for the first time in my life surrendered to the pain and broke down crying, and most of those things created an anxiety for me that I don't know where the hell it came from because I've never had anxiety like this before. So many people had died this year and it really got to me to the point where my arm will feel sore from work and I'll think that it's going to develop into a tumor and I'll die. I've been thinking about life and death lately and it makes me want to appreciate life more because death can come so quick and easily. I'm pretty religious so I pray from time to time wishing I can push through this year because it's very overwhelming for me. I just wish things can go back to the way they used to be. If anybody else is going through something this year could you also comment it so that at least I'll feel like I'm not alone in this? Or if somebody has any advice on how I can cope with this I would appreciate anything honestly. Thank you.",02Nov2020,1

Everyone used to love her, but now she's a nuisance. She has no self-esteem. She's dead inside. And I'm responsible. When she was a baby, I used to love her. I would hold her, play with her. I would cry when people won't let me hold her. I don't know what went wrong inside me.

So i (17f) and boyfriend (19m) have been dating for 15months this is my longest relationship, a little throwback he has had long relationships in the past, when we first met he used to say that he hasn't lost his v card and i believed him (i hadn't lost it yet) 7 months later he told me the truth that he had lost his v card to a prostitute and was in a physical reationship before after i lost my v card to him, ps he seems like he loves me we had our ups and downs one time he stopped giving me time as he was too busy playing video games when i asked him he told me ""i became engaged in games because you said something that hurt me"" i asked him what it was as i don't recall saying anything, there are many other things like this which made our relationship to be on and off. Like his many female friends or him liking pictures of every single girl he sees or not believing me when i told him his friend had a crush on him (i proved it later) he also would repeat his mistakes over and over again.

I generally like the friends that ive found in school but sometimes i feel like they expect me to listen to all of their problems and give them all of my support. This of course isnt a major problem, its always nice to be able to help someone who struggles with something.
The only problem is that they never give me any support in return.

I didnt notice this behaviour at first but after having known them for quite some time, i pick up on things almost all the time. 
For example i tried to empathize with a friend who had skipped a school day because they were stressed. I had also recently done this (i had a crying fit outside school lol) and mentioned it when talking to them. They then just called me a bitch and got really mad about it. 

This has happened other times as well, mostly its just in the form of trying to one-up me when i tell someone about my struggles and/or saying that im just “complaining”or just outright ignoring me. This happens at the same time as they are talking about how depressed they are and how much they struggle with school and at those times they expect me to be supportive.

I try to ignore this when it happens but sometimes it can be annoying and very frustrating. They are also usually very nice people, i dont understand why this is happening? Do they just dont care about me or my feelings at all?

739,"My best friend who I love with all my heart has started this pattern whenever we hang out. First of all she’s on her phone so much and I am getting to the point where I just want to swat it out of her hand. Am I not a good enough conversationalist? How can I be a better one if I’m boring her? 

Secondly she hyper focuses on my cat when i’m trying to talk her or trying to do things with her. She’ll spend so much time looking at my cat, interrupting my conversation to talk about my cat, ask me questions pertaining to my cat. We were watching a movie the other day and she barely looked at the screen. 

Onto the topic of the movie. She is always always asking questions during the movie. Asking me to clarify things, asking me what happened, needing backstory. She’s an extremely smart person and I have no idea why she asks me these things because i know if she just watched the movie she could figure it out just like normal. She’s also always asking me what happens, like she doesn’t even want to watch the movie she just wants me to turn it off and give her a short play by play. 

Lastly we will then start talking about her interpersonal problems which is fine but I feel like I’m so exhausted by the end I almost don’t care. 

No matter what is happening however, she is always apologising. For literally everything and it annoys me so much. Then she sometimes ends up asking me if I’m annoyed with her and I just want to scream at her to stop apologising for everything she does, says and thinks. I’m getting so frustrated because I don’t want to navigate this weird labyrinth of trying to engage her with me and having to walk her through things and then having to validate her and tell her she doesn’t need to be sorry for anything.

I (23) live with a female (23) who I've known since high school initially there wasn't any issues because I was dating someone else long distance, but that relationship ended this year and now I've recently gotten a lot more time to pay attention to my roommate. Unfortunately, due to us getting along really really well and her being attractive, I've come to romantically like my roommate. 
I already understand that a relationship will never happen, since she hates intimacy (which I really like) and she's made it clear that she likes every quality I don't have. The problem is that this is always on my mind when we hang out, and although it's fun to hang out with her, I've been getting some serious depression from the interactions as of late. 
We plan to move to a different city together soon, which means I'll be stuck with her for a long time after that happens. I'm wondering if anyone has tips to make our interactions less painful or if anyone thinks I should just move away from her.

752,"Just a bit of back story here.. I'm 27f. I have 3 kids. I have been with my boyfriend for 3 years. I was with my children's father for 7. 

Two years ago my ex stopped taking our kids for visits, changed his number and address. He blamed me. Posted all over social media bashing me and trying to convince everyone I was keeping the kids from him. That wasnt the case, at all. I have so many texts asking him if he wanted the kids before he changed his number and I never got any sort of response. This all started because I asked him for child support. That's when he stopped taking them. His mother would take the kids randomly but it's so rare that it's like not even worth mentioning. 

Anyways, my boyfriend and I still made it work. We put together a schedule and worked around it. We couldnt afford daycare, so I was forced into a 4am to 2pm shift while my boyfriend worked 3pm to 3am. We never saw eachother. It led to a lot of issues. We split up for a short while because of it but obviously worked it out.

Then Covid hits. My kids school closed their doors and they still remain closed. My work then closed their doors and again, remain closed. Thankfully my boyfriend still has his job and was able to switch off to day shift so now we do see eachother. But this stay at home, homeschooling 2 kids while trying to do the preschool thing with my youngest, preparing 3 meals a day, constantly cleaning up after every single person in this house and hand washing all of our clothing in the bathtub because the laundromat is closed has taken such a toll on me that I am always pissed right off. From the moment I wake up in the morning, I'm counting down the minutes to bed time. 

The reason I'm posting this is because I just had a complete fucking meltdown. Like, lost my shit entirely. This sounds so stupid but I have literally not stepped foot outside of my house since March. Due to my boyfriend working 7 days a week now (for literally months), and everything still being closed.. I've just been trapped inside. My boyfriend does all the errands on the way home because it's easier. But now I feel trapped. 

So anyways, I get a phone call last week from my sister. She has quarantined for the past 2 weeks, as recommended, but she is here in the states to visit me! My first visitor since last year. I was so fucking excited guys. Like I actually felt happy and not irritated for the first time in forever. 

Well I get a call this morning and I'm still fucking rip shit mad. My ex, who apparently tested positive for Covid, showed up where my sister is to hang out with his buddy and now I cant even fucking see my sister. So this cock smooch loser who hasnt seen the kids or paid for his kids tests positive for Covid and still goes around passing the fucking virus around and now my only chance of human interaction is out the fucking window. Hes still destroying my life and hes not even a part of it.

755,"I have a friend who kinda ghosted me and our group of friends and I need closure. But I don't want to hurt her. I will call that friend S for this post. 

So I was close with S and then she started drifting away to a different friend group. She would only hang out with me if her other friend group wasn't available which kinda stung. Then quarantine started and she completely stopped talking to anyone in our friend group for a while due to severe depression and anxiety. So every other day for like a month I would send her sweet and simple messages letting her know that she is loveable and stuff or sending dad jokes/something cute and funny. Finally she responded and then told me everything that was going on and thanked me for the messages. She is really going through a difficult time. I was there for her and was supportive but then I became the only person reaching out. She always would respond warmly and if I asked if she wanted space she said no. So I was just really confused. I stopped reaching out to see if she would reach out and its been almost two months and she hasn't reached out meanwhile she calls with a friend from her other friend group almost every day. I felt betrayed for a long time and somehow that has turned into slight resentment. I feel like our friendship has faded and I really need closure.

So I want to send her a message letting her know that we can't be friends anymore (but I would say it really diplomaticly). I don't think she would really care too much. But here's the problem: my family gives money to S's mom and I don't want S's mom to feel bad and stop receiving money because I know they're desperate. My mom gives them money, helps give them legal support bc S's dad is trying to get full custody and he is a bad guy. So I feel like I need to cut off the friendship for my own emotional health as its been dragging me down for months but I feel like I can't because S and her family need my family's help. 

Any ideas on what I should do?",02Nov2020,1
756,"I'm a recent college graduate (May 2020) who was lucky enough to have a job lined up right out of college. My family friend who is around my parents' age (late 40s) offered me a job at his company that manufactures high performance race parts. It's a small company with just 11 employees that was founded in 2016. Since day 1 I knew this was not a good culture fit. I consider myself a liberal, but I'm not a very political person. That is until the last 5 months of constantly being barraged by my coworkers with conservative talking points, jokes about liberals, minorities, women, the holocaust, casually using slurs like f\*\*\*ot, the list goes on. I absolutely despise all but two of my coworkers and it puts a tremendous toll on my mental health. I know there will be no point in trying to reason with them as they are all 30+ and set in their ways. An example of this was when I noticed a very lax attitude when it came to covid. No one here would wear a mask the entire day, and my boss knows this. But I expressed to my boss (family friend) that our shop manager never wears a mask when talking to customers, even when they're wearing one themselves. My boss had a conversation with him, he started wearing some super thin bandana for about two weeks and then went back to mask-free again. I don't care at all about what I work on, I'm only motivated by beefing up my own resume with cool video and experience (I manage our YouTube channel and instructional content). I've gained over 20 pounds since I've started, partly due to bad habits but also emotional eating because of the stress of constantly having to be around these people that willingly antagonize me because I care about covid. My boss is hardly ever at the shop so he doesn't really know what I put up with. My 6 month anniversary with this job is on the 18th, but I don't know how much longer I can take being here. I don't want it to look bad on my resume if I leave after a year, but would I be able to explain why to a future employer? Or would they just see my first full time job ended so soon, then pass me up because of it? I want to work somewhere that values kindness and respect, where our work matters to more than just rich white people. Any advice is greatly appreciated.",02Nov2020,1
757,"So this is a pretty simple one. Sorry for formatting, mobile, sorry if its not the right sub, yadayadayada.

First let me say rhat she is a good cat, very sweet and loving for everything that is us. We're very fortunate to have found her given she was in a tree as a 6 week old and was covered in pests and stickers. She is the light of my day and my boyfriend and i both love her guts, so please keep advice subjective to help and not giving her away or up. 

She has developed a horrible habit of jumping up on the countertops and tables, most often whenever we are not around. Often times we will walk into the livingroom or kitchen after being in the other room/sleeping and we will find her jumping off of the surfaces and running away to avoid us getting onto her. We have tried everything; loud noises, spray bottles, popping her, etc. 

We have a cat tower next to a shiny sunny window that she LOVES so access to high spots is covered for a good part of it. We keep food out for them (we have 3 cats total, but kitten is focus) so its not as if she is searching for food. They always have clean water, tonnes of toys to play with, etc. She is the only one we catch doing this on a consistent basis. 

Now the really big issue with this is that through this jumping, she has also developed the habit of tearing up plants. My boyfriend and i have a very special plant that we got from his grandfathers funeral, and guys...... she has tore. This. Plant. Up. It's a large plant, so we can't put it in a hanging basket or on a ledge. We also can't keep it outside because of our climate/type of plant it is. It has caused an obvious point of tension in the dynamic because we can't figure out ANYTHING to keep her away from it or food surfaces. 

We also aren't very able to put up any high spots for her to climb more because we live in an apartment and don't have very much floor space/can't drill willy nilly into the walls to put ledges to satisfy her urge to climb. 

I'm sorry this is long and messy. If anyone has any suggestions i would love to hear them; we love this cat but she wreaking havoc. Thank you in advance!",02Nov2020,1

759,"So my dad is not like super cheap but he's cheap where it counts. So I'm 17m i live with my dad and it's just us, like I said earlier he is cheap where it counts. He likes to go out and party and do all that and is willing to spend money but our living situation is kinda stupid. Like we live in a ridiculously small ""house"", and at first I understand it was just him living alone but now I live with him and I need my own space. Money isn't an issue mind you, he's a realtor, he has like 80,000 just sitting around in this house because of some issues with banks. So like another example, he does not want to buy me clothes, I got into a fight with him because I said I wanted some new pants and be got mad because he gave me like 4 pairs of hand me downs that I don't wear because I told him I don't like them (he wears what I call ""cholo pants"" where they are really baggy at the ankles). Some more context, I hardly ask him for anything because when I lived with my mom, we didn't have money so I always felt super guilty to ask for things, even basic things. I'd always go to my grandparents and do some chores for them for cash and buy the things I need myself... It's also because everything with him is about money, he grew up in a poor ranch in Mexico, so he knows how to save money and be cheap but he makes ridiculous money now and his bills are only like 500$ a month in total. I'm just kinda fed up with it, I can count most of my actual possessions on my hands because I could only bring my clothes, which was just 1 suitcase so I don't even  have a lot of clothes and I never ask for anything due to guilt and I don't know how to talk to him about this, he's really busy and we don't connect emotionally a whole lot so I'm not sure what to say to him or how to say it to him.

765,"As a bit of backstory, I had known my friend, Soren, for three years. I loved him, he called us 'platonic soulmates', and my mother jokingly said he was her favorite child. But something happened over the summer that he decided I was manipulative and abusive to him. So he shut me out (blocking my number and Instagram), without a single word for warning. I was torn up with guilt and confusion because it wasn't until several months later I learned why he did it. I know this won't mean much, but you ask anyone in my family and they say I take +20 damage for being mean to other people. I worry constantly that something I say will be taken the wrong way. This was like my worst nightmare come true. Long story short, we're not really on speaking terms. 

Yesterday, I got a text from a mutual friend, Alex. They wanted to know how bad things were between me and the Soren. They were planning a safe birthday party for themselves and wanted to know how I would feel if they invited Soren. Immediately I wanted to say no. I didn't want to see Soren, I didn't want to speak to him, I didn't want to be in the same room as him. But Alex was asking me if they should invite him, they were giving me that power. And I realized I would hate it if I vetoed the list. Alex's parents are very strict, so they're probably only getting five guests. Soren and Alex are still on good terms as much as I know. 

I know I can be civil around him. I know I can ignore him and have a good time. But Alex is worried about it being uncomfortable and I'm worried about Soren causing a scene. 

Should I ask Alex to leave Soren off the guest list? Or bite my tongue and have a good time?",02Nov2020,1

773,"( Disclaimer: This is an alt account. I live in the middle east and some of my real-life friends know of my main reddit account so it would be dangerous to post it there )

So, a bit of backstory:

I'm a 16 year old male teenager living in a muslim majority country in the middle east. My first doubts about Islam started when I was around 10, but I was somewhat too young to care, and being in a rather biased environment I just shrugged the doubts off and kept on following the religion. The next wave of doubts was when I was 13. It was a bit different this time because I realized that I was gay, and became aware of all the social consequences that came with that. I went through somewhat of a difficult phase, feeling that I was somehow broken, wondering what was wrong with me. Then, after realizing that all the stigmatization around homosexuality came from religion, I delved a bit further into the matter. Found out that, as is the norm for most of the kids around these parts, I was only muslim because my parents were, and I didn't even have much faith. I then found some things that they don't necessarily teach us but that were a part of religion: we were told Islam abolished slavery when it didn't, I knew the women's rights situation in Islam wasn't stellar but I found in the hadiths was *much* worse than what I observed in society, I found out that sharia law throws around death penalties for harmless crimes like apostasy or fornication... Needless to say, I did *not* know that was the religion I believed in. So I decided to leave Islam, and I felt a lot better. No more spending every waking day hating myself, no need to pledge an oath of celibacy for all of my mortal life, no need to be restricted by arbitrary laws made by something I couldn't even see... Life was great.

But then, a few days ago, I got invited to this online community for muslims and I... honestly don't know how to feel. It seems like if you try hard enough, anything can be justifiable. A prophet marrying a child? Age of marriage was lower before industrial revolution, children matured faster back then. Apostates getting murdered? Public apostasy in a society where religion is at the heart of the community is highly dangerous and tantamount to treason. All the stigmatization around sex, gender mixing being forbidden, the horrible marital system and the questionable women's rights? We do not need to know the wisdom behind his decisions, our lord knows best. And beyond that there's some stuff that actually makes sense...? I'm not exactly experienced in philosophy of history or other such fields, but the people there seemed very knowledgeable. They seemed to have proper reasons to reject atheism or polytheism ( infinite regression being impossible for the former, something about the oneness of necessary existence for the latter ) and asserted with confidence that the historical miracles that happened around Islam's conception were proof of the prophet's prophethood...

Now do not get me wrong, I'm not rejecting the possibility of Islam being true out of mere laziness, but there's some things that are really weighing on me right now. Firstly, I'm a mere layman, I have no idea how to judge philosophical arguments or how to distinguish historical facts from hearsay. Yet some people claim that with deepened study of all of this, they became certain, and they're certain that anyone would become certain, that Islam is the irrefutable truth. Which brings me to my next point, not only I am not exactly interested in philosophy and history, but these past few days everytime I ponder about something about Islam, I feel unbelievably bad. Islam being true just comes with so many complications... I'll have to give up on any hope of romantic love and remain celibate for as long as I breathe ( I know this sounds silly but I've always fantasized about experiencing romance, it feels very important to me ) I'll have to just accept that all of the amazing non-muslim people I know are going to hell, for no other reason that they weren't muslims. That the values of freedom and liberty I've always believed in are nothing compared to the worship of god, that it's okay to shove your beliefs down everyone's throats, to stone people for trivialities. And well... even if I said I wasn't, I still am somewhat lazy, and Islam is neither simple nor convenient as a way of life.

All this pondering has taken a real toll on my sanity, I find myself being distracted in school, thinking about it right before sleep ( and thus having a harder time sleeping ). It's made me shed a few tears, and really, uncertainty has never been a worse nightmare.

776,"Okay so I (18F) have moved out of my parental house about two days ago. I am panicking rn so that’s why this post is so quickly after moving into my new home. I’ll give you guys the backstory on my decision of moving out.

About 1.5 years ago, my mom and dad had a divorce. It was not a bad divorce at all, but even though my parents were still living in the same house, my dad got a girlfriend within two months, and lied about it to all of us. My mom moved into a new house about six months after the divorce, but without any spare room to make into my bedroom. The idea behind this all was that my brother (13M) and sister (16F) would be living with my parents for a couple more years while my parents expected me to move out soon for college. Therefore, I was kind of forced to go live with my dad, which was no problem at the time.

Well, life went on and I got a really sweet boyfriend and I went over to his house more often and often, and I caught myself rather being at his house than at my dads, and being almost embarrassed to bring my boyfriend over. This because ever since my mom had moved out, the whole house had turned into a mess, with a gross bathroom, gross kitchen et cetera. I am doing a sabbatical this year, which means I can’t rent any student rooms nor lend money to afford any rooms/apartments, so my only solution was to stay with my bf more. I got into more fights with my dad, until I stumbled upon a room in the same city as where I live now, and within my budget. 

I interned for the room and I managed to become the new tenant, which sounded great at the time. I loved buying stuff for my new room, decorating and stuff. But it didn’t sit right with me. I ignored the feeling because I was still kind of excited to move. But every moment that I have sat alone in this room, I have cried because I’m scared. I’m scared of being weird in front of my housemates, of not knowing regular stuff, and scared of growing up. Suddenly I miss my old home, despite despising it in the past. And I am wondering: should I stop renting and move back in with my dad? Please help me out, I don’t think being here with these doubts is good for my mental health.",02Nov2020,1
777,"Went out on date with a woman I’ve been seeing for 5 months. I thought I did everything right, we were intimate, she asked me to become my girlfriend, etc. Dropped her off home and then the next morning I called. No answer. She texted back six hours later asking what happened since she noticed the missed call. I told her I just wanted to see how the rest of her night was. 

Then I tried to make another date, which she responded completely indifferent with lack of enthusiasm saying she would know later in the week. She said if we couldn’t go out this week she would still video call me whenever she could. I agreed and said to let me know when she was free to video call. She told me she would, and that she would text me “soon”. 

I thought that meant last night but she never messaged, yet I see her on social media liking posts and not messaging me. She used to like posts about relationships but now she’s stopped.

He’s been telling me why Biden is great and Trump is terrible. If I can even say anything about the subject, I lean farther towards Biden. His biased comment still sat with me though. My own therapist has a fucked mindset. He is practically brainwashing me. 

I recently found out my dad tried to kill himself a year ago, but he ended up cheating on my mom instead. My mom is a bad alcoholic and she’s got depression. She tried to kill herself a month ago and threatened she wanted to take me with her. Put simply- it isn’t a fun situation I’m in.

Everything is losing meaning, yet for some reason I’m keeping a clear mind. I am still capable of questioning the things around me. I am clear headed, even though everything around me feels like a thick fog. I’m analyzing everything, keeping calm, but I’m still drawing blanks when it comes to my questions. 

Everything is so fucked down to the core. Finding out my peers were as brutal at they were sucked (I found out the hard way through bullying). Then having my own parents be such terrible influences, that changed my positive mindset. The one person that was supposed to help me, my therapist, also had bad intentions. The things I see on the news, on social media, they’re terrible. Everything feels intolerable.

781,"Hi guys,

So basically I have no idea what to do. I'm 18, and I worked at a nursing home all summer so I have a decent bit of cash saved up. I'm currently in University, all online because, yknow, Corona, and I'm living at home. My Mom went out today to pay the rent (about 1000$) and get her winter tires put on. The tire place basically told her they couldn't let her leave on her old winter tires, they're so old and worn down. So, she had to buy a new set. Another 1000$. Now I never considered us poor-poor, maybe when I was a lot younger, but we're just on the other side of ""comfy"" I guess. Money's always a little tight, that's always the way it's been. My parents are separated, my dad delivered pizza for most of my life (about 6 years ago, he went back to school and got a much better job in social work), and my mom hasn't worked since I was about 8 due to some problems with her hips and back, among other things that I won't get into. And that's that, whatever, I can't change it. So that 1000$ she had to spend on winter tires today was her grocery money, basic necessities money (shampoo, toothpaste, those sort of things) as well as the money she was saving for Christmas shopping. To put it bluntly, we're broke. 

I told her she didn't need to get me more Christmas presents and that what she already has bought is enough but she fought me on this so I left it alone. I offered to lend her some money but she declined, saying she'd never be able to pay it back. She won't outright say it, but I know we're going to be in a very tight spot shortly. She told my Grandma she just wants some money for the tires for Christmas (still a while away), which would give us some money to work with but I'm very aware that that's not enough. So here's where I need advice:

Do I just give her money, even though I'll never see it back and I may need it to help pay my tuition this coming semester/next year? And If I go with that, how can I do it in an anonymous manner so she doesn't know it's me? Because if she knows it's me, she won't take it. 

Or should I move in with my dad? Him and my stepmom both have full-time jobs, but my dad is taking a second job delivering pizza, which is worrying because I thought he was in a good spot financially (finally), so I don't know if I would be just adding to what I suspect is financial strain over there.

783,"When I was 9 years old, I had an accident and was declared legally dead. They said I was dead for a couple of minutes before being revived in the ambulance. But I remember waking up in a place with infinite yellowish/brownish rooms with some strange wallpaper and being trapped there for what seemed to me like weeks but was actually a couple of minutes. The whole place smelled like wet blankets, murky, and I could vaguely remember strange noises. I remember just running around and crying, trying to find the exit, but all the rooms I went in were the same and it just kept on going, like a new room or hallway would form every time I entered a new one. I haven't thought about it for a while now, up until the start of quarantine. It felt like being a glitched game server, like being in some strange backroad after you ran out of gas in the middle of the night. The whole thing was just creepy and disturbing and had been bothering me for the past months. I don't know if it was a dream I was having, but if that's the case, it had to be a lucid ass dream because I've never thought or seen a place similar to that at that time, and I was legally dead, so how could that even be possible. Every time I think of it or hear a specific type of buzzing, it sends chills down my spine. I don't know if I was hallucinating, dreaming, or if this was something paranormal. Any explanations, what do I do?",02Nov2020,1
785,"I've had this group of friends for almost 2years now and I used to look up to them I thought they were ""cool"" because they would party alot and smoke weed and drink ALOT like I'm the only one out of the group of 5 of us who isn't an alcoholic. Anyway about a year ago I REALLY got into weed. Like I smoked weed all day every day (though I never let the habit get in the way of my school work or responsibilies) and I did that for 9 months then my grandma caught me and I don't smoke at home anymore. The only time I smoke and drink now is when I'm with them which is usually twice a week. I don't want to smoke anymore it gives me anxiety almost every time I get high. I tried to quit but I got back into it because they would pressure me into doing it. And we get drunk together everytime I see them I could count on one hand how many times I've hung out with them sober. And lately I've noticed a change in how I feel about them. Yesterday one of them sent a picture of like 20 empty jack Daniels bottles that he has in his drawer and everyone else laughed and all I could think was ""I don't want to be like this that's sad."" I don't know what to do i know the most obvious is to just cut them all off and find new friends but I can't just do that I genuinely care about these guys, I also never really had a real friend group before I'm extremely introverted. My friend group all graduated last year and I don't have anyone to hangout with at school so I usually just do my school work or read and I'm honestly okay with that I don't want to go through the trouble of making friends.

786,"I’m gonna keep this short because there’s so much I could say but i won’t. I (17) have been absolutely tormented by my sister (27) for as long as I can remember. I know people will say this is just what siblings are like, and that siblings fight and it’s natural. However I know that, because I also have an older brother (22) who i used to fight with all the time, and still do occasionally. The difference is that me and my brother bicker, we argue over me being annoying or him stealing the remote and silly stuff like that. My sister absolutely disrespects me in every way, she bullies the entire family. She doesn’t get punished because my parents think she’s a lost hope, so in return me and my brother are dealt more chores and tasks because my parents are too scared to ask my sister to do her share.
I know i haven’t gone into detail about the things my sister has done to me, but i don’t wish to type them out because i WILL just start crying lol don’t call me dramatic i cannot state enough that the things she does to this whole family are not “sisterly”.
A couple weeks ago, i had a talk with her, I sat her down and told her the things she does and how deeply they affect and hurt me, so if she didn’t know how she made me feel before, now she does.
However, she has shown no remorse or guilt, everytime she does something and i tell her how upset she is making me, she laughs and says she doesn’t care.
Now that i know that SHE knows how she makes me feel, and still doesn’t care, I was looking for advice on how to continue, because i know i can’t avoid her for the rest of my life, but she is a grown woman, and i know she will not, and nor does she want to change.

My mother didn't give me an allowance for which I was responsible for and whenever I asked for money she would give me how much she thought I would need. She made all the decisions. Indeed it was somehow the money she worked for. 

The only money I had or have are from birthdays or other events (given to me instead of gifts). I usually gather that money and use when mom doesn't give me any. This year I broke my phone for example and used the money to pay for a new one. Like that money I use are for one special thing. But at times I don't get money is like I need to make the better out of them. 

I can't work because I am a university student (not US). I need full attendance to enter exams.

But I do need to know how to look at prices, how to see which deal is better,  which product is better, if I buy this I can't afford that. How are you responsible and thinking beforehand when buying something?

He can’t picture a future with us and he says it’s just how his brain works and that he couldn’t picture it with anyone. He says he wants to be with me a lot and I’m the only one he wants to be with right now. I’m the type of person that likes to be in a stable relationship where someone can say yeah I see us together in a year and I think I want to be with you for a long while. Basically the most committed thing he’s told me is that he thinks he’d want to try and stay with me when I go to college (about 6 months). He says we just have different ways of thinking which is true but I can’t imagine how someone could not picture I future with someone if they really love them is what I think kinda.

793,"Okay. So here’s the entire story. It’s pretty long and there are some details about sex on here. 

I met this guy on Tinder and we started talking. I asked him what he was looking for because I like to know before I just agree to stuff.. He said that he was mainly looking for a hookup, but if it developed into something more, than it developed into something more. I told him that I was looking for the exact same thing.

We agreed to meet up in person before I would agree to go back to his place. We ended up going back to his place.. His room was clean, and he lit a candle because he was worried his room smelled bad (it definitely did not. It actually smelled good). After he lit the candle, we got in his bed, and turned on a comedy movie (ya know, one you don’t have to pay attention to to understand what’s happening). Instead of just going straight into foreplay, we cuddled (he initiated it) for about 15 minutes before we started kissing. We had sex, and after we were done, we cuddled for about 10 minutes before he asked me about round 2. Obvi I was down, so we did round 2, and after that, we cuddled for the rest of the movie.

I don’t know what it was about the sex, but the way he held me was not casual (at least, I don’t think so). We did it missionary, but he would wrap his arms under my armpits and across my back when we did. The way he kissed me was with so much passion, and let me tell you. The sex was AMAZING. He went down on me but didn’t expect me to go down on him (he didn’t even ask me to). When I told him to use a condom, he never once asked to take it off (I’ve had hookups in the past BEG me if they could take it off.. I’m not on birth control, so that’s a no go). He could tell that he hurt me at one point and instead of playing into that, he stopped and asked me if I was okay. I told him it hurt (he was too long for me, sadly) and he told me he would reposition himself so he wouldn’t hurt me. We kissed a lot during sex and it just amazes me how good the sex was. 

After we were done, we cuddled in his bed till the movie was done. After the movie was done, he got up, wiped his sweat off with a towel, and then offered me a towel as well. We got dressed and he walked me back down to my car. He kissed me goodbye (on the lips).. it wasn’t like this was a peck. This was a passionate kiss. He told me to let him know when I got home. 

Ever since then, he has texted me everyday about what my plans are for the day. If I was busy for that day, he still texted me and made random conversation. I went to his place again recently and we went for another 2 rounds and it was still at good as the first time.. Whenever I left, he not only gave me a kiss, but he gave me a hug as well. 

So I guess the big question is:

Does he like me as more than a hookup? 

I understand me and him talked about what we were looking for before, but I feel like I am getting mixed signals from him.",02Nov2020,1

799,"I don’t know where else to post this so I thought this sub was appropriate. I’ll try and keep this short.

I’m a 28F and living with my parents since the pandemic started because of some mental health issues (I’m bipolar). We live in the suburbs of a major city. 

Things are pretty rough at home and it’s a really toxic environment. Because of that, I’m ready to move back to the city and be on my own again. The problem is, I’m having major anxiety over the thought of being alone during the pandemic. I work from home and I am really worried about being by myself all the time and how it will affect my mental health. I’ve lived alone in the past (and actually loved it) but that’s when I was going into an office every day and had a pretty active social life, which I don’t really have anymore. I also just started my job a little over a month ago and haven’t been super busy so the days feel even lonelier. 

I’ve been thinking of different options for my move. I have a couple friends in the city, so I was considering getting a place walking distance to one of them. I’m considering getting a dog. My company’s office is actually open but only like 5 people out of 100 go in, so I could go there a couple times a week. I’ve even looked at Craigslist for people renting out rooms but haven’t had much luck finding something that seems to be a fit. At the moment I’m looking at high-rise buildings with a lot of amenities so there’s more of a community feel. 

But even with this planning, I still feel extremely anxious about the thought of being alone so much. Has anyone else dealt with this?",02Nov2020,1
800,"Ok so a couple years ago I went out with this fuckboy. (22M). I had never been out with anyone and I was so infatuated with him because he was super charming and sweet to me. He was my first kiss and I lost my virginity to him. Eventually, he got a girlfriend and stopped talking to me. I was super sad for an entire year. I couldn’t stop thinking about him and was low key obsessed. 

He recently broke up with his girlfriend so he started messaging me again. Even after a year and a half I was unable to get over him. I agreed to hook up with him and we have been having some really amazing sex ever since. I feel like I defs have feelings for him which are not being reciprocated. He only asks me to sneak over to his house late at night and doesn’t ever want to go on real dates with me. I’ve just accepted that this is not gonna go anywhere and I need to try and move on. 

So in an attempt to get over him, I downloaded a dating app. But i’ve still been sleeping with him while dating other people because the sex is really good and I can’t stop. However, now I feel like I’m comparing everyone I go out with to him. 

I met a really nice guy who I have a ton in common with. He’s really easy to talk to but I don’t feel a romantic connection. Maybe it’s because he’s not as charming as the fuckboy idk. We’ve been out three times and haven’t even kissed yet. 

I was considering breaking things off with this guy because I didn’t feel a connection. But was conflicted because we also have a ton in common and I think we could be friends. However he messages me EVERY DAY. Sometimes multiple times a day. It’s too much for me and I feel like he really really likes me if he’s messaging me this much. So I’m not sure he can handle just being friends. 

On top of this, my mom recently found out I’ve been lying to her whenever I go on dates. This whole situation has been causing me so much stress and so I told the guy about it. I mentioned that I wanted to take a break from dating and just focus on school for now. He said he understands and doesn’t want to cause me stress. We said good night and I went to sleep. 

Then, this morning I was surprised to find another message from him. He said “you said you didn't want to date and I respect that but what about just being friends?  I think you're a cool person and I don't know what's wrong with just being friends for now “. I would be down for this, but I still need space while I deal with this drama with my mom. I’m not sure I could explain having a platonic guy friend, and she’ll ask where I met him from as well. Additionally like I mentioned before, I’m not sure he’ll be able to handle just being friends. 

Sorry for the reaaaaalllyy long post haha

Tl;dr - I have a ton in common with this guy, but I don’t feel a romantic connection. I’ve been going through a lot of stuff lately and need a break from dating. I told him this and he asked to just be friends. I feel like he likes me way too much and can’t handle just being friends.",02Nov2020,1

I accept this and try my best to be part of the solution and not the problem, and I realize I need to understand the disproportionate social advantages. As of late, she has constantly been saying how much she hates men and as her partner I can empathize with that, of course I can’t completely understand how she feels, but it makes me sad to think that I’m indirectly labeled a piece of shit no matter how hard I try to advocate in my community, support minority and female leaders, and correct idiots around me in an educational manner.

808,"I’m recently back with my ex after about a year apart, having previously dated for about 5 months. Yesterday after sex we started talking about other things we can incorporate in bed. 

I started listing things off and I wanted to dig into her character a bit so I brought up polyamory, specifically an orgy. I brought it up rather jokingly. She hesitated for a split second and gave a slightly hesitant “nnnnnoo,” as if to kind of brush it off. So I pressed a little bit more, giving a face that says jokingly “come oooon.” I wasn’t really joking though, like I said, I wanted to dig a bit deeper to understand her true character, or at the very least what she’s into. Finally she says “well maybeee. I don’t know, what’s your synopsis?” She said that last bit in an interested and semi jokingly tone. To me the maybe sounded a bit excited but it could just be a sort of confirmation bias on my part looking back on it. I then tell her that it’s a deal breaker for me, I can’t be in a relationship with someone who is even slightly interested in polyamory. 

She took back the maybe and said that it just seemed like I was interested in polyamory the way I was looking at her and played along to see what \*I\* was really into. She said that her initial “no” was hesitant because she was thinking about how gross an orgy would be and thus the slight hesitation, and that she wouldn’t want to even have something on the lines of a 3some saying that she would consider it cheating. 

We continued having a back and forth about this making the same general points. But I told her I would take her word and that we should simply let it go, so we did. She acted not like herself for maybe half an hour after but we made up and it was back to normal.

A little about her, I know she suffers from social anxiety slightly and when we first started dating, it took her a while to be comfortable with having sex with me. She said she made mistakes before with letting someone take advantage of her for sex, someone she didn’t know entirely. She told me she didn’t sleep around when we were broken up and I believe her, she went as far as to say that she even waited for me. She went on a couple dates but never hooked up with anyone and was constantly thinking about me and was always waiting for the right time to try again. She has a few questionable friends that she loves but for the most part is a solid individual. I admittedly do question her morals at times but for the most part she’s a good person, good to her family, opens up her heart even when it inconveniences her, and genuinely expects nothing in return.

Last night she also brought up how she wants to be able to have some time to herself, nothing crazy, just a day or even an hour to recharge. That we can still text because she loves to talk to me and is always thinking about me. She said last time we were together she lost herself in the relationship and it was completely draining by the end of it. Last time we were together we spent almost every minute that I wasn’t working or she wasn’t in school together, it was all admittedly on my own accord. 

I currently sleep over her place maybe twice a night every week and we hang out maybe 4 times a week, we text when we’re not together, but neither I or her force conversations, mostly just light check ins with conversations speckled in. Either way, I can completely give her that space if she needs it. Hell, I feel like I owe it to her. 

I guess I’m trying to rationalize as I type this all out but the bottom line is…I’m not sure I can be with someone who would consider polyamory. Maybe I would feel differently if she was honest about it and I got a definite yes or no. What bothers me most is that after that conversation my trust is wavering a bit and I feel like I’m dating a different person than I was a couple days ago. I’m saving face but it’s draining me. What should I do, what should I say, what should I not say?

Hello so I met this girl on a week long volunteering course and I really like her. She showed mixed signs of liking me back. Examples: constant eye contact and smiling, randomly walking up to me and standing really close, stuff like that basically. Also, another girl even said to us that we would make a cute couple she didn’t react negatively to it. So now the course has ended and I have her Snapchat. We’ve been talking on that for a few days and now the conversation has fizzled out. She takes ages to respond to messages and it’s pretty dead.

812,"So, I have ADHD and take Methylphenidate, or generic Ritalin, and I had gotten a 3-month script for it. However, I was out of town and didn't realize that I didn't tell my psychiatrist(Zoom Call). I get a text saying that I have 3 more days to pick it up, or it will be voided. I just got back from vacation, and now it's no longer available. This is Walgreens btw

Does anyone know if I call my psychiatrist again, will he know if I picked it up or not? If not, how do I go about getting another script without looking like a drug dealer? 

Also, the reason why I'm asking here first and not my psych, is due to his availability and I would have to schedule an appointment. If the appointment is unplanned, like this one, I will be charged $150.",02Nov2020,1

She also doesn’t call prescriptions in until you pay the invoice for the appointment, but the thing is there was no invoice in my account/I got no notification about it the day of the appointment, so I didn’t get my meds. Now I have one pill left and have called the office twice, they’re saying they’re going to “remind” her again to call it in. For reference, the appointment was on Friday at 1 pm.

823,"Basic information, I am a minor and yes I do live with my mother. And this post may contain touchy subjects.

Okay so as of recently, I have formed my own opinions about politics since this year has been crazy. My opinions do conflict with my mothers opinions and that’s fine. But tbh, my opinion isn’t really that important since I can’t vote and nobody really listens to people my age about politics. But my mother cannot stand the fact I do not agree with her about everything. It legit drives her up the wall.

But I have a twitter account. I don’t really do much on it. I’m just on social media to keep up with my favorite artists and actors. I don’t really talk politics on it. But that account is my “getaway” I guess you can say. I share things on there that I don’t share with most people. And I’ve met really cool people through that account. I don’t want anybody in my personal life following that account so I obviously blocked everybody that I knew of. My mom being one of them.

We got into it one night and she admitted she’s been stalking my account. I got upset and told her that she’s been violating my privacy. But she said she’s just “being a good mom” by checking up on me. But then she started running around and telling everybody i’ve been supporting pedophilia. which is so disgusting i cannot tell you how much i despise pedophiles and pedophilia. And that i’ve been brainwashed and she just “wants the best for me” now I know this wouldn’t be happening if we shared the same opinions and I know she’s just trying to beat me down because she can’t stand opposing view points. But I’m also worried because I was out on that account. I talked about my sexuality and my mom is heavily against the LGBT community and has threatened to disown me if I was ever anything but straight. She’s threatened me with that ever since I could remember. 

I’ve been giving her the cold shoulder ever since this incident and now she’s acting as if she doesn’t know what’s wrong and why i’m mad at her. I don’t know how to get through to her thick skull that she’s being batshit crazy by telling everybody i support pedophilia and that she violated my privacy.

This is someone I do really care about but my own words and desperation have me feeling like such a fool. I made a total ass out of myself and regret not handling it with more grace, or taking ""the high road"".

I have come to more senses and have been internalizing a lot that was right and wrong about the relationship, and am still hurt by the way it went down but I know that it is what it is now.

826,"My wife and I have been married for a year now. We mainly got married because we did long distance for a few years (she was in the US, I’m in Canada) and she moved in with me in Canada. I’m able to sponsor her since we are married and get her permanent residence in Canada.

She took a break from school and wants to finish up her degree now. She has quite a large amount of student loan debt, and will likely need to take out more loans to finish up her degree. 

The thing is, she can’t work or do anything in Canada until she gets her permanent resident card, which I applied for a couple months ago. 

She basically mentions her student loan debt very often and told me multiple times that she wants to pay it with the money I make. I also just spent $7k for her liposuction procedure that she wanted so badly.

She now wants to get a Brazilian butt lift and keeps mentioning it, of course I’ll be the one paying for it because she won’t be able to afford it. She’s very insecure about her body and no matter how much I tell her that she looks just fine it won’t make a difference. I understand that what she thinks about herself is all that matters but it’s frustrating to me that all I hear from her is complaining. 

I love her and I’d do anything for her, but lately the thoughts of ending the marriage have been floating around in my head because everything seems to be about her. Her liposuction appointment was another $900 because she’s an Outland patient (so no free healthcare for her lol), and as I’m writing this I’m having a panic attack because I am suffering from anxiety, and finances make me extremely nervous. I’m in debt because of her surgery and she keeps talking about a BBL and all these things she wants to do. I just cancelled my PS5 pre order so that I can cover the hospital cost, and I’m thinking about downgrading my car too. 

I just don’t know what to do. Whenever I try to tell her that I don’t feel comfortable paying for all these things she gets mad and defensive and I am getting tired of this. I feel like I’d be better off alone so I can save money and fulfill my dream of becoming successful in life in terms of money. Am I selfish for wanting to achieve my goals? I just don’t see myself being able to do it while being in a relationship and making someone else happy while I’m sacrificing my happiness.

As a side note, I was disowned by my family for being in a relationship with her( my family are very conservative and strict muslims).

I sacrificed so much to make her happy, but I now have doubts about if this is the life I want to live.

I guess what I’m asking is, am I wrong for thinking this way? Am I a bad husband? 

I’m sorry if I sound like a little bitch but I feel like I don’t have anyone else to vent to at this point.",02Nov2020,1

831,"2020 was a roller coaster of a year for me.

I’m in a weird pickle. Originally I lived in Ohio, had a Fortune 100 job. I quite, moved from Columbus Ohio to Texas to go into business with my dad. Discovered my retired former Fortune 500 COO dad has a drug problem, confronted him and he kicked me out after 2 weeks. I went 7 months without a job. Lived out of a motel 6 and worked nights during Covid lock down, and burned through my savings, went into debt, somehow finished my masters this spring and supported my girlfriend at the time, no longer together.

I took a job in San Antonio, TX. Now I’m not sure what to do? I feel that I could get a job back at my old company in Ohio but not sure if I should try to go back to the “old life” plus I feel I might have to handle my dads drug issue and help my mother in Texas. He’s on meth, cocaine, weed, drinks all day every day.  I feel like my old life is “dead”, thinks certainly won’t be the same after all this.

Younger brother lives here. He’s not going anywhere.
Know the area. Lived here for the past decade

Aunt lives here
Cousin lives here
Other cousin lives in Houston
Parents are an hour outside Austin
Job Details.
Base Salary 
8% 401k match (dollar for dollar match up to 8%)
3% 401k match bonus
10% performance bonus
Christmas bonus - one pay period
Up for promotion in January. Boss already said he is promoting me after being there 7 months.
After the promotion, base salaries will be equal or this may succeed Columbus job. “Total compensation(benefits, matches and all) at current level already exceeds what the next tier level/ job level would be in Columbus.

At what point do you settle down? At what point is there enough money. I moved around a lot as a kid due to my dads work, I don’t have “life long friends”. 

It’s just a lot to decide I have an apartment in San Antonio on a 3 month lease and currently crashing with my brother in Ohio. I have a couple months to make a decision. But I need to get back to a sense of normalcy, but a house and move on.",02Nov2020,1

840,"So, as the title states, I want to get on birth control. Not only because I am reaching that ""age"", I know hormones wise, it'll help my period become regular and help with other hormonal things. 

That's the main reason I want to get on it. I have a very irregular period (I've had it for 3 years now) and it's always 2-3 months apart and when I do have it, it's super duper heavy. 

Another thing is, because of the hormones, I know it'll help my acne and I have very severe acne and It's a insecurity I have. 

Those are the main reasons I want it. Another things is, I'm 16, and although I don't plan on sleeping with anyone, anytime soon. I think it's a good time to talk about it I guess and make sure I'm being extra safe because condoms break. I have a boyfriend and we've been together almost 4 years (Don't at me please, it's a long fucking story) but my parents don't know we're dating. (Again...stupid but a long story) But I can't go anywhere anyway due to Covid.

846,"So I'm not sure what to do. Before you think that it's plastic surgery, I can assure you that thats not the case.

Basically I want a tongue tie release. In case you don't know, a tongue tie is the short string (frenulum) under your tongue. When it's really short, you're tongue movement is very restricted. No, I don't care about the aesthetics of it. I'm not bothered by a short tongue. What scares me is what I've read can happen when it's not fixed. Headaches, TMJ, messed up teeth, sleep apnea, trouble swallowing, and neck problems. Even tinnitus, which I recently developed out of the blue and am desperate to fix.

I'd rather tell my mom because I feel like she make take my worry a little more seriously, unlike my dad who just calls me a hypochondriac and basically says deal with it. It's not a serious or even an expensive surgery ($500 max and the actual surgery itself, which is done with a laser, takes less than 5 minutes.) The recovery time is super quick, only a few days, and pain is mild and you need nothing more than basic ibuprofen. Hell, as someone with a job, I'd even pay for it myself. They would just have to agree to it. It's not their body after all. 

But despite all of this, the thought of asking terrifies me. My parents and I have a very joking relationship. We're all really close, but when it comes to serious things, we usually just suppress them, sweep them under the rug, and wait for things to blow over. It also doesn't help that this isn't the first time I've wanted some procedure done to benefit my face for one reason or another. I wanted filler for the longest time to fix my dark circles. For another period of time I also wanted a nose job because I had a bump on the side. However those were all for aesthetics, while this would actually benefit my health and prevent problems in the long run. I just had wisdom teeth removed to prevent future problems with crowding, so why wouldn't I have my tongue tie fixed, a much easier procedure, to prevent future problems with sleep, neck tension, teeth, etc? 

I think I'm scared of my mom thinking I'm crazy or something. Stressing out this much over a tongue tie. But I want her to take me seriously. I suppose I could just wait till I turn 18 next year, but knowing that there is a problem and doing absolutely nothing to fix it despite having the resources to will kill me. I think I've always been an anxious person, so maybe that's why. I just don't know what to do. I've never truly sat down with my mom and just been purely vulnerable before. How on earth do I even ask.",02Nov2020,1

851,"Hi All,


My 28 year old sister is abusing her Xanax prescription. I am 24 and we both live at home with our mom. I work full-time while applying to med school. My sister has never held down a job for longer than 6 months and mostly lives off our retired mom (67). The situation has gotten significantly worse since the beginning of this year. 

Our mom is a huge pushover that will give into anything if bugged for long enough. My sister likes to take advantage of it. About 2 years ago, she begged mom to let her boyfriend move in with us as he was getting kicked out of his own home. Neither of them contributed to any bills/mortgage and he was the one that got her into doing drugs. Furthermore, there were multiple situations where my mom’s money went missing and was never found. They both slept all day/night and we would see them for maybe 2 hours a day at most, the rest of the time they spent in her bedroom sleeping. She also had a stroke around this time most likely due to her unhealthy lifestyle. Once you mom asked the boyfriend to contribute to the mortgage, he dumped my sister and moved out. 

This is when we started noticing her acting ‘off.’ Nothing crazy at first, a stumble here and there, slurred speech, gritting her teeth. For the past 9 months it’s been getting progressively worse - she comes out of her room half dressed, confused, slurring. She becomes aggressive when she is told no. This summer she went to the hospital twice because we found her unresponsive and were unable to wake her up - the doctor attributed this to the Xanax. We tried taking the pills away, so she got someone to drop off coke at our home. When we tried to take the coke away, she kicked mom in the stomach. She is prescribed 90 pills a month, sometimes she will take upwards of 10 a day. I tried reaching out to her provider - I assured them I didn’t want any information regarding her care and that I didn’t even expect them to confirm that she is a patient, I just wanted them to be aware of the situation. I haven’t gotten a response.

My mom and I are desperate... Last night, she stole my moms CC to send money to some creepy man she met online who told her he was going to be shot unless she sent him the money... We shut off her phone and changed the password to the WiFi. I told my mom to go in her bedroom and lock the door because I am scared she is going to kill us both in the night. She becomes irate when she doesn’t get her way, she kicks, punches, pushes, threatens.... She spent all night banging on my moms door and then the fighting resumed again in the morning. 

I don’t want to have a relationship with my sister anymore - she has made my life a nightmare since I was young. It used to be hysteria and violent outbursts, but now that she is abusing her prescription, the situation has gotten a lot worse. I live in constant fear for my mom. I’m scared she’s either going to hurt her physically or give her a heart-attack. There’s nothing I wish for more than a peaceful retirement for my mom. I want to move out, but I literally can’t leave my mom alone with my sister. I don’t know what I’m going to do when I have to go away for med school. 

Is there anyone I can reach out to? The provider isn’t answering. Maybe the pharmacist? My mom is too much of a pushover to send her to an inpatient rehab, even if she decided to do so, after a full-day of begging and harassment by my sister she would change her mind.... Also, my sister doesn’t actually want to go so they wouldn’t be able to hold her anyway. 

Sorry this is so long. I appreciate any advice.",02Nov2020,1
852,"my boyfriend started working as a server at a restaurant about a month ago. 3 weeks ago this girl (we’ll call her sam) started working as a server there too. sam has a boyfriend she lives with which is what makes this complicated and confusing for me. 

anyways so it started 2 and a half weeks when she got  my boyfriends number off the work contacts list and asked him if he could cover her shift. a couple days later he texted her and asked if she could cover a shift. nothing wrong with that but then sam started texting my boyfriend more and more. my boyfriend went out of town and she texted him to ask him why he didn’t come to work and where he was. whenever he doesn’t go to work she will text to see where he is. i thought that was weird but i didn’t say anything or let it bother me because i know they are work friends. days later she texted him around 12 am when she got off telling him how much she made that night and in my head i was wondering why she wouldn’t just bring it up at work the next time she saw him instead of texting him so late to have a pointless convo. a week passed and i went in there for the first time to eat with friends and my boyfriend later told me that she mentioned to him that i dress like a whore. he quickly defended me and told her i wasn’t one and showed her a couple pictures of me because she didn’t see my up close and sam then said i was pretty apparently. 

i thought that was inappropriate of her to talk to my boyfriend about me like that and make negative judgement when ive never met her or said one word to her. that’s where i started to not like this girl. now this week she has texted him twice being like “hi buddy i better see you at work”  before their shift. in my mind i’m wondering why she would care enough to text him to ask if he’s coming to work when she could simply go to work and see if he’s there. the second time she did he replied saying he wasn’t coming in and she was basically like “noooo why” and then she proceeded to ask my boyfriend to bring her a coffee to work.. he  immediately showed me and i told him don’t respond. 

my boyfriend also said the last time he saw her at work she briefly mentioned something about him meeting up with her and her friends at the local bars. my boyfriend agrees that if i were in her place and if i were to treat a co worker how she was treating him he would be upset but he says that’s how she is and it’s innocent because they are friends. it’s hard to tell her intentions because she has a boyfriend. i can’t tell if i’m overthinking or if her behavior is flirty and inappropriate. 

if it is flirty and inappropriate and does get worse how should i go about it? he said he would say something to her if it got worse but he doesn’t want to make it awkward at work or have her say something like “i have a boyfriend it’s not like that.” i don’t want to be uncomfortable every time he goes into work but i don’t want to cause drama at his work.  

TL;DR my boyfriends coworker is starting to be too friendly and it’s making me uncomfortable. am i over thinking and if not how should my boyfriend go about addressing the issue so i’m not uncomfortable when he’s at work.",02Nov2020,1
853,"After writing the whole thing, I realized this is all over the place but here it is.

Title says it pretty much all, I constantly feel bad/guilty when I talk to others that aren't as stable (it can be financially, mentally, etc,) as I am. 

I moved from a different country to the US with my family and when we moved, we were $10,000 USD in debt. I worked 3-4 jobs while going to college, NEVER bought clothes or went on vacation for 5 years and my entire family worked 60-80 hours a week. My sibling at one point worked 96 hours a week for 52 weeks with only 2 days off. Now I have a really good job, make a decent amount of money, mentally I am so happy (I have always believed happiness &gt; money) and same for my family, my sibling make decent amount of money and is happy.

I also got my US citizenship so that's a bonus.

But now whenever I talk to someone else, just like I was talking to this girl literally 10 minutes ago, she's in the US on student visas so she's struggling financially, and I felt so bad when she asked me what I do and about my lifestyle because now my lifestyle is pretty good. I ended up just answering in 1 word answers to all her questions.

And this isn't just with her, it's everyday thing for me, even at work since I still work 2 jobs (help family with their business), I am never worried about money while people who work with me are always kinda jealous of me and I genuinely feel bad for having it better than them.

Or when I talk to some of my other friends, I go through the same feeling because most of them are usually saying stuff like ""work was bad, i don't have money for this bill and that bill"" and since I have a really good family that supports me and I work 2 jobs I don't have to worry about any of that. 

Why am I on Reddit whining about this? Because I wanted to talk about this, it's almost like more happy I become everyday with more accomplishments, more sad I feel about them when I look at people around me. So more like honestly I just wanted to kinda take it out because I can't really talk about this with anyone. So take it however you want, read it (down vote it if you want to) but I am glad I out it out somewhere lol

854,"Hi all!

This is my first time posting and I could really use some advice.  My birthday is coming up and my roommate wants to celebrate it with me.  I had a simple idea of ordering and sharing pizza and a cake.  She wants it to be more special than that and has expressed what I see as disproportionate disappointment and frustration that I wouldn’t want something more special for my birthday.  To give an insight, she has said things like “I just feel like everyone should feel special on their birthday, and what you have right now isn’t enough” and “I feel bad expecting more for my birthday when you don’t want a lot”.  Her judgment makes me second guess myself and feel weirdly guilty.

She’s brought it up a few times and wants me to plan something else/more.  I don’t really want to plan anything else and I have expressed that.  She said that she would plan something for me, but doesn’t want to because if she did it would be “too much for me”.  I’m thankful that she recognizes that we have different expectations, but that doesn’t seem to deter her from pressuring and judging me for not wanting an epic birthday.  Needless to say, I’m kinda overwhelmed and pissed off.  These conversations make me not want to spend any of my birthday with her because the pressure and expectation ruin the “celebration” vibe for me.

I should also say as a side note that I come from a family where emotional and psychological abuse (among other things) was deeply ingrained in my experience and I am working hard in therapy to establish my own identity and not allow myself to be controlled by others.  So, all of that is to say that confronting this is really challenging for me and feels kinda scary.

How do I prevent this mind fuck on my birthday?  And on a larger scale, how do I gracefully put an end to these passive-aggressive/controlling comments, yet still keep the peace because I have to live with this person for another year?

Looking forward to your thoughts!",02Nov2020,1

856,"A close friend of mine, with whom I used to run with and casually work out at the park joined a touch rugby team and had a blast.

I was never a fan of exotic (I am from Italy. Rugby is quite exotic for most of us. American football completely alien) sports, and completely ignored the existence of anything close to a game with a oval ball until the day I did give it a try. 

I must say the game is interesting... Yet a bit ""dull"", so to speak, mostly because it's people ranging from 60+ and up, so there's that. Age gap too big, I can't find joy in just playing without the team bond. I am half their median age. 

I did my homeworks and discovered a obscure American football team in my city.
Now, American football really sparked my interest. When I was a kid I wanted to play it, alas there were no teams close by, and every other rkid was playing wither soccer or basket, so I ended up playing soccer. 

I tried to join in. 
Got in touch with them was told to show up at the practice. First impression, much on the contrary of rugby, where I was literally thrown into the pitch and told how to play on the go, here everyone was stuck up and was flexing like ""yeah we are one of the top teams"" 

""nah man we don't do flag here it's tackle mostly"" 

""do you even know how many downs there are in a game? "" 

In the end I was given the mobile number of the coach and I was to text him after some tournament that they were to partecipate in. 

OK. 

O sent a text message to the coach, he informs me that flag is not their main focus and that they do tackle mostly. I literally had to beg the coach into letting me try at least once, and they fixed a day where I was told by my boss to stay and work overtime. 

I notified the coach with plenty of time ahead and said I was sorry but was willing to get out of work earlier the next days to catch up.

Absolute silence for a whole week. Then he just tells me ""trainings are suspended due to coronavirus""

To go to work I drive by their training pitch and, surprise surprise, the team was out there, training.

Is this the norm for American football when you're past your prime age?

Should I just give up and move on?

861,"This is my first post ever. I need to just kinda vent/advice. 

BG info: Mom 65. Dad 53. Me 30. SO 49. DD 9. I live with my parents at the moment because of situation and money and some other b.s. so yeah. My husband lives 2 hours away because he can get a better job/pay, but visits every weekend when able (Over time and such so yeah).

Story time:
So the day before Halloween as I am coloring my SO for his costume (he was Darth Maul/OC, I was Darth Talon, so bad ass not gonna lie). With the house my Father owns is very old and you can hear everything for Damn near anywhere. SO and I are in the bathroom abd start to hear a fight in the kitchen between my parents. We cant hear everything but it starts to get heated. I finally go out and see my Dad pissed off of my Mom and my DD sitting looking scared. I instantly tell her to go upstairs and ask w.t.f.

A little more info: my mom has had a lot of medical problems in the last 10 years (3 stints, broke both wrists, 3 surgery for wrists and one shoulder, car crash, fibromyalgia, arthritus, hoshimotos (sp), and some other things). My Dad (slightly far Right thinking) suggested CBD oil. So I got some for her. Its flavored, Tiger's Blood. My DD has had issues with taking things (sweets, pretties, yeah... Another story).

Onto the story:
Apparently my Mom let her ""taste"" the eye dropper. I thought it was a an unspoken thing to not tell DD because ""it smells good so it must taste good"" thought process. My parents had a pact of sorts to not tell DD and never allow that in ""his house"". And i was told. I was livid. (I am okay with CBD oil, it's got a lot of amazing things and helps. But for my DD who has no medical issues? Fuck no)

My Dad yells at my mom some more (Not really but its that loud talk) ans then walked away. She looked at me and tried to defend herself. Said ""it wasn't full"" ""it was only a taste"" ""she wanted to know"". I told her ""no, you don't get to do that"". My SO comes out and tells her that she cant make desisions like that about our daughter"". My mom suddenly starts to raise her voice at my SO and be yells at her telling her that she has no right. She starts/says ""you don't yell at me in my house"". Again he yells ""I don't care. She is our daughter"" and goes upstairs. I say ""You had no right Mom.""

So for the past few days I have not talked to my Mom because I am really pissed with her. Apparently she made up with my Dad Sunday (she had to apologize or he was going to kick her out of the house (they are not married) because she went against what they agreed too). Sunday Morning she tries to start in on how DD did this or that, trying to talk to me like nothing happens. 

My SO and I want actual apologies and I want one for my DD because my Mom (Halloween Day, after being ignored by every adult in the house because she did fuck up and we, Dad, SO, and I, are talking and having light conversations, w/o her) comes into the kitchen and tries to say ""while I was taking my inhaler DD tasted it"" and tried to blame my DD.

And today she is trying to be ""buddy buddy"" with me and I have been cold towards her. And she honestly seems to oblivious.

I feel like my voice is very high pitched. It can sound at times like helium or like there’s a veryyyy strong pinch in the background making this nasally baby sound. Sometimes I have nasal fry and I think that’s from embaressement of my voice. When I hear a video of how a four year old boy talks that’s how I naturally sound. It’s not very soothing and it’s honestly pretty disturbing to listen to. I’m a 20 year old female. I know I shouldn’t care what people think but I always have to be aware of my voice at least a little because it can really make someone wanna cover their ears- and who wants to sound like that.

863,"Hey, I’m a teenage male and I’m just not feeling well lately. I joined reddit this weekend so I could privately share my feelings and to ask opinions on things I did and want to do. So this will mostly be me sharing some stuff. My parents divorced about 8 years ago and fight alot. They have a lot of financial disputes and because custody is 70/30 in favor of my mom my dad shows how much he dislikes that alot too. Most of the time I’m with my dad we fight because he has a lot of anger towards my whole moms family and especially towards her but only has me to vent to. I noticed him doing this more often about a year and a half ago and it has only gotten worse. Most of time now I say it when I don’t agree with him and we fight then, also when I want to do something outside of the house when I’m with him he hets really mad a lot. When I’m woth my mom it is very uncomfortable in a completely other way. She is very overworked from injuries she had combined with taking care of my grandmother since she was widowed 2 years ago, all while working a full time job. She is very tired a lot of the time and doesn’t show with anger that she is upset, but just kind of makes the whole environment in the house revolving around her feeling bad. When I had a bad day at school or feel very numb becasue of some things that I’m in therapy for, she often ignores it and rambles about her having a pain in her ankle or something. I now that I should be compassionate towards her because of all the stuff that she has going on, but lately I just can’t find the energy to and I close myself of in my room whoch makes her sad which makes the environment in the house worse which makes me close myself of, and that just goes on and on. In school I feel enstranged of my friends because I try to balance being social with them and some other friends that are in the same class as me. The only place where I feel really safe and happy is with my gf but she lives away and we have both very bussy lives outside of school and we can’t hang out alot. I know a lot of what I see as problems are probably not that bad but I don’t really know what to do and I hope reddit can help.
P.S. I go to therapy because multiple reasons but the relevant one is my parents always were negative toeards me about negative thoughts, saying things like I don’t like this or I feel bad about this or that was something bad and they got mad at me for that(mostly my mom).

I studied something in the same niche, but not the same thing. (I didn’t study sales lol). So it was kinda boring today. And when I drove home. I felt like... sad... and didn’t really know what to think. Now I‘m almost about to cry, because it’s just... boring? And doing this, every day is exhausting, not because there’s much to do. No... because there’s not much to do and it’s not what i expected. It doesn’t feel like a dream coming true. It feels like... I wanna go back to what I studied.

I’ve known her for about 4 months but we don’t hang out or anything. I’ve slept in her bed and cuddled with her a couple times. I have feelings for her. I don’t want them. she’s a very toxic person and a fuckgirl. She’s made it clear she’s only interested in messing around in general. (We are both bi girls btw) we went to a house party for Halloween. Our mutual friend was telling me how hot I looked and A agreed and said “you really do,really fucking hot” but saying it to herself for some reason? Anyways we show up to this house party and me and my friend felt so out of place lol we were the only white people and no one was speaking English lmao A started dancing and tried grinding on me and I jumped like a fucking rabbit and told her I’d have to be fucked up to dance with her like that. A put a whole bottle of beer in my mouth and started giving me (and other friend) drinks all night. A got me fucked up. My vision was blurry,I was having trouble walking etc...I was out my mind and started to dance with A. grinding bumping groping horny dtf type dancing. 
(A is Latina and apparently this is normal dancing for them). A had passed by me and said “ugh you look so fucking-“ like she was frustrated lol  We were dancing and really close already so I looked up and kissed her.she kissed me back and I pulled away and continued to dance. It happened a second time but when I pulled away A kissed my cheek and I kissed her neck and then back to dancing lol then I was unconscious. They put me in a room and I threw up twice and then just blacked out. A was taking care of me. I woke up to A taking my clothes off when we got back home. I woke up before A took off my pants and bra and told A to stop. A said it was okay that I need to take a shower. But I didn’t want  to be fully undressed and bathed by someone I barely know in such a vulnerable state. 
I said don’t touch me you weird ass bitch. But A insisted. Our friends mom came in and told A to stop and to put a shirt on me and put my hair up. So A did. I don’t recall what they were talking about but A said “she’s sleeping with me tonight” and last thing I remember was being thrown on the bed and being very cold. When I woke up A was spooning me. I went my friends room and asked him what he remembered because at that point my memory was blurry. He told me I kissed him and mentioned how he wondered where I would sleep because his brothers bed was empty. A walked in and I said to them both “I’m sorry if I did anything weird to you guys I was really fucked up as you can tell” A said “you didn’t no worries”. A mentioned that she didn’t get drunk or tipsy until after we were blacked out. I remembered our kinda makeout and told my friend. He was really shocked. We all went to get breakfast and he brought it up and asked A about it. A said “yeah we did. I was surprised she (aka me) was coming at me and was like woah! She was the only person I kissed last night.” A continued “I didn’t really know where I would sleep” This had me really confused and made me feel extremely guilty. It made me feel like she didn’t want to kiss me and I forced it on her. I started to replay the scene over and over again to see if I was really out of hand. But it went down as I had remembered. I don’t know what to think. Am I at fault? Did she really not want to kiss me? Was she only saying that to save face in front of our friend? Was she going to pretend like it never happened?

870,"I've had feelings for my good friend since highschool. We went to different colleges, so only saw each other for a few months out of the year. But last year, I was living at home while applying to medical school. At first, we were spending multiple days a week together. I thought I maybe had her, based off things she would say to me etc. She even eventually basically confirmed that during this period, she was considering dating me. However, I guess in the end I didn't make the cut.

Now, I live in an entirely different state for medical school. But I cannot stop thinking about her. it gets in the way of my studying and makes me incredibly depressed. I am very inexperienced with dating, and the thought of her hanging out with other guys makes me feel like less of a man. I miss her, and constantly think about that period last year where we were really getting along. I still am social, and am on dating apps. So it's not like im not trying to find someone else. But I don't think the feelings will ever go away. I love her, and there's nothing I can do about it. I just have to be in pain.

I find myself just wanting to go back home, and be around just incase. I know it sounds silly, but I want to be close and at least keep subtly trying, even if we still just stay friends. If I could get her to consider it once, maybe over time I could make it happen. I don't care if it takes years. I have already been feeling like this for 7 years. Any advice?",02Nov2020,1
871,"Lemme give you the backstory. We’re not in a relationship so that’s why I’ve came to this subreddit, but I don’t really know how to continue from here. Basically the story goes from the 15th of last month this girl(20f) and I(20m) have been talking, and it was going really well, I asked her out to get coffee, nice and simple and she agreed. The date was great in my opinion even got told I’d be getting a next time. The day after the date was a game night with my friends and she came along, it was just four of us and things went well as far as I could tell. We all crashed at my place on the couch as the other two were a couple, but fast forward to the morning and she left in a hurry because her ride was here. So we all go back to sleep and I message her later to see how she’s feeling since we were all hungover from drinking and she tells me a bit rough but okay. That night she goes to work and I think nothing of it, I just waited to get a reply, but i was left on delivered for hours, and when she came back the reply was very dry. Again, fast forward to last night same thing, left on delivered for hours while she’s active, only to get a dry response for the three messages we sent in total. It’s the same again today and my thoughts are she doesn’t want to talk anymore, but a mutual friend who works with her and set us up says otherwise but the sudden change to amount we’ve spoken is very noticeable since we were talking all night since day 1 pretty much. So I’m at a loss for what to do.",02Nov2020,1

873,"sorry guys this post might be a long one 

so long story short i moved to san diego and ended up taking over a lease for this guy and moving in with his female roommate. i told her i had a cat with claws, that do get trimmed, she was fine with that. she was never very friendly and we do have an age gap of about 10 years (i just turned 25f, she’s about 34) but she was okay. 

things got sour after about two months when she texted me and told me it was not okay to wash my cats water and dish bowl (dry food, dumped the food in the trash before rinsing and washing of course so just a bit of food residue would be in her bowl, nothing dramatic) and to clarify the bowls were left in the sink *clean*, i was in a hurry to get to work that morning. i usually would never leave any dishes in the sink. i am totally okay with compromising if that makes her uncomfortable, but she had mentioned she never had animals and i grew up with many and my parents always washed the bowls in the sink, with a different sponge of course, as i do, so i thought it was normal. i was fine with what she was saying, it was the way she said it to me though. 

you can ask someone politely to fix something if you have a problem. don’t tell me what to do and not to do in a house where i pay 1000 dollars to live in and i’m also on the lease. not what you say, it’s how you say it ya know? 

she didn’t like that i stood my ground and never talked to me once in person again until she told me she was moving last month. she heard me tell my friend she was kind of a bitch (i went on to say ok she isn’t a bitch we just don’t talk at all) but she didn’t hear that apparently. i felt bad and apologized but she said she felt “unsafe” now and needed to leave. i said i would move cause she lived there longer and i didn’t like the place much anyways. i even offered to help her find someone to take my room. she said no she still was moving. 

my cat scratched up maybe 6inches by 3 inches of one part of her couch that isn’t hardly visible, and to see the damage you really have to look and in direct sunlight because there’s just some fibers hanging out.

she told me i needed to reimburse her and i totally agreed, i took responsibility i’m not immature

i said i would buy the couch originally bc i had sold mine when i moved. she wanted 500 for it which i thought was a little steep as did my parents. she’s had it for about two years. it’s from ikea it’s an alright couch. she says it was 800. now it’s 1000 apparently. i also moved into a place where i don’t need a couch and would’ve been paying for a storage just to keep it. i went back with a fabric shaver and managed to make it almost impossible to notice. i told her i didn’t need the couch but that i would give her 250 for damages as my uncle is a lawyer and when i sent him pictures he said that was reasonable. 

she said that isn’t enough and that it’s 250 to clean the couch alone (i never sat on the couch once and my indoor cat sat on one arm of it here and there) and wants 500 for the couch, not even to buy it, just to clean and fix damages. i told her i would give her the 250 or if she wants to get an accurate estimate from a professional and give me receipts i will pay whatever it comes out to, but i am not blindly giving you 500 dollars. she said no and that it’s my job to get an estimate on her couch. i said it’s not and she can take my money or get estimates. she now says she’s taking me to court. am i being unreasonable? has anyone else dealt with this situation? i’ve never been in legal trouble in my life 

also she had told me she was also moving out and even sent a long email to our landlord telling her when she would be out by, i lightly cleaned my room and bathroom (vacuum, mop, threw away groceries) and called it good bc no matter how much i have cleaned apts in the past i’ve never gotten the full deposit back or i’ve had to pay a cleaning fee still. so my parents said not to worry too much about it because management will come get it ready and deep clean for the next tenants. now i fear she’s gonna use this against me too, if she had communicated she was staying and management would not be coming to clean, i would’ve done more. 

anyways sorry again long ass post, but please help i feel like i have been reasonable",02Nov2020,1

There weren't any places I wanted to go to as a 16 year old, and because of the recent pandemic, have been using it as an excuse to further delay getting my license. I have received my Permit, but since there wasn't any urgency to actually drive, have mostly just been letting it sit in my wallet. The extent of my driving experience has been going out with a licensed driver maybe around 10 times.  However, for reasons I don't want to get into and also because I don't want to make an alt account, I will just say that I need to learn how to drive and pass the test within a month. 

 Is it possible? I know that this is something I should've taken care of as quickly as possible and only have myself to blame. However, I am willing to devote all 30 days to learn how to drive, so I am hoping that I receive some advice on how to efficiently expedite my learning and prepare myself to pass the driving test. Things like the most essential skills for a driver, what to practice for the test, what to look out for as a beginner, what you wish you knew before driving, etc. Any advice that could help me learn driving as fast as possible, I'll accept graciously.

I live with 5 other girls and we’ve been discussing housing plans for next year. originally we planned to find a bigger place next year to include our other friend, Z, who doesn’t currently live with us. However, then we decided that we might stay where we currently are. I told Z this, but then I later found out that my housemates all called Z when I was out of earshot, without telling me, and they all proceeded to deny that the conversation about staying in our current house ever took place and that I was talking nonsense. So then Z thought I was a liar. But luckily I had a screenshot which clearly showed us agreeing to stay in our current house, which I then sent to Z. Now Z is very upset with my housemates for both accusing me of lying and for lying to her about their intention to stay in the house.

She has now found other people she wants to live with next year and has asked me if I want to join them. I’m really not sure - I like my bedroom in the current house, and maybe this is a temporary blip, and my housemates have said sorry and are trying to make it up to me, but I really don’t like the way they all went behind my back with that phone call and made me out to be a liar.

I felt bad for leaving, but I don’t feel like it’s safe to stay there until they have thoroughly cleaned and sanitized the school. However, it doesn’t look like they will be doing that. And they are still planning on holding classes tomorrow as well.

I can't think of anything else I could do to accomplish my goals), and I don't know how to 1) Finance my goals, and 2) How to get there. 

The only thing I am sure I want in life now is to travel and live in different countries, staring with France/South Korea. After months of thinking of what I want to do, that's the only thing I know I want out of life so far, but of course it's an unrealistic life.

To me, it seems as if I can't stay in both countries for a year and experience the culture, as neither my family or I are rich. I came here looking for some options on what I can do when I am older to help me at least visit both countries and finance them. Preferably I'd like to live there for 1 year each for both countries, but that's unrealistic, and if it was possible, I wouldn't even know how to get money to do that.

In regards to college, I think I could get in to most? Let me know if this sounds nice:  I do have a 4.0 GPA, one extra curricular named Mock trial (None this year. Thanks COVID.), and that's it. I have no skills or talents at all, so I am not sure how good that would look on college applications.

I speak ""2"" languages, and I plan on learning French and Korean.

891,"Tldr; company promised me promotion if I meet goals, I met the goals but did not get promoted; manager, coworker that does the same work as me, and an asshole that doesn't even work on this project anymore did. Advice on confronting management??

&amp;#x200B;

I am a 24 yo female with a BS in general biology working in a biotech start-up. I have been working at this company in the same entry-level position for a year and a half. At some point mid-year when I passed my anniversary, my manager L began talks of a promotion for me and his other direct report A, saying that upper management had said that as long as we continue to meet our quarterly goals and drive our project forward, then he doesn't see why not. L continued reassuring us throughout the rest of the year that he was making a case for our promotions and that it will come.

Well it came... but not for me. This morning, the company announced the promotions for the quarter, and I saw that L and A had gotten promoted along with a handful of others in the company, but not me. Normally I would not feel entitled to any raises and promotions but...

1. I have met all of my quarterly goals pretty much since I started working here.
2. A and I do basically the same work, she is of a higher position than me, but I have been working on this project longer than she has, so we have been learning and contributing the same amount at the same pace. I am confident (and so is our manager L) that the accomplishments listed for A's promotion in the promotion announcement email was basically exactly what I also did, without question. We even have the same first name and it wouldn't have mattered if they copied and pasted her accomplishments under my name. 
3. Ever since the pandemic lockdown (in California) and the reduction of staff on site at our facility,  ALL of the project's work was left to JUST me and A... I did probably 45% of the work that drove this project to where it is now. When I started on the project, it was more of a high-risk, Plan B type of project that was getting built from the ground up and L, A, and I worked tirelessly to make enough progress to convince the company and its board of advisers to switch directions and make us the Plan A. Within the span of a year and a half, even with reduced hours with the pandemic. Which I think is pretty fucking badass. Our trio has a reputation in the company for working really fast all the time lol.

So I've already set up a meeting with upper management to make a case for myself with all of the above, but there is one thing that *really* ticked me about the promotions that I'm not sure would be appropriate to mention. It's a long story, but this other coworker K got a promotion for his contributions to the same project. K is a fucking cunt. He was also the original scientist that got assigned to work on this project a couple of months before I started and he was the one that hired me on as a full-time when I graduated. At the time, we were the only ones working on the project. I immediately started having problems with him micromanaging me and sending me unprofessional and petty emails, but I stayed on the project, tried to keep my head up, and just kept working. It was obvious that he didn't have the best social skills because he really isolated himself from the rest of the company and also only said inappropriate things in writing, like over email or on a comment on a shared Google slides deck or something, which makes me think that he didn't exactly know that what he was saying was not okay. It only made it easier for me to file complaints to HR. 

A few months later, L and A got assigned to the project and after about 4 or 5 complaints to HR, L became my new manager. K started being an ass to L and A as well, so he got kicked off the project near the beginning of this year and was assigned a new project that he works on by himself. He's not allowed to talk to me anymore and he doesn't get anyone else on his project with him. He will never be a manager at this company again. 

So how the fuck did he end up with the promotion for his ""contributions"" to this project?? I think it was wrong for the company to not fire him after a dozen complaints to HR and basically reward him with exactly what he wants: to continue making 6 figures without having to work with anybody. And now they are rewarding him with a promotion for work he didn't even do and I get nothing. I dealt with all that as my very first experience in the industry fresh out of undergrad, still decided to stay on this project and try to work with him, drove half the monumental progress that our project has seen this past year, and I still get nothing. Just a petty salary that can barely cover the living expenses of Southern California and a meeting with upper management. That's all I fucking get. 

Would I be stepping out of line if I mention this? I understand it's not really my place to say whether K deserves a promotion or not and obviously I'm not gonna mention the pay, but is it fair to say that I feel wronged and cheated? That I think the company is sending off the wrong message by rewarding him and leaving me to the dust? My manager tried to reassure me that I'm ""on the radar"" and that my promotion is coming soon within the next quarter or two, but that's what he's been telling me for the past two quarters. He also said that it's because I've only been working for a year and a half, but the position I would be promoted to requires either an MS or 2 years of experience. I think that's bullshit because I have literally been doing the same work as A who is three positions higher than me and has an MS with probably over 10 years of experience. I have no motivation to work for a company that doesn't care for their employees' work ethics and chooses to focus on petty numerical requirements over actual quality of work. I took the week off to chill and apply to new jobs, but I'm not fully ready to leave this company if I don't have to. I want to get this conversation with the big boss right tomorrow.

894,"I'm 20 years old and have never been good at keeping a factory job. For me it's never been the issue with waking up, it's always been my anxiety. I allow my anxiety to control me, and in result I end up being late to work, or leaving early with some made up excuse on why I have to leave. 

I required a job at a factory 3 weeks ago and loved it very much. My job was simple. Take these pieces from this cart, and put them on another cart, wrap them in paper, and box them. Simple as that. 7am-3pm M-F sometimes Saturday. As soon as I got off work, it was straight to the other job. Health care provider, 3pm-7pm sometimes 10:30pm-6:30am. I've been there for about a year now. 

Well recently my health care provider job offered free College tuition paid for by the state for being an essential worker. I opted for it, took it, signed up and got accepted today. Unfortunately my allergies have been really bad, and due to my factory job also being an essential work place they told me I couldn't risk getting anyone else sick, if I'm not 100% sure it's allergies, how can they be? So I stayed home, but in my luck they also decided to let me go today as well. 

I'm out of 1 left with another. I've always felt pressured by my family to have 2 jobs, and now that I lost one I don't know how I'm going to break it to them. I got accepted for College today, and lost one of my jobs. I've always kept the thought in my head that it's not like I don't have a job already, I do. They pay good, and plus with me getting ready  to go school it'll be great for me. But, how do I tell them I lost it? I've had 3 factory jobs in the cours of 2 months and quit 2 lost 1.

900,"I hope I'm not downvoted to oblivion because I am truly asking for advice here.

I was raised in a far-right, racist household in a racist community and during high school I held a lot of racist attitudes and beliefs. For the past 5 years I have made significant efforts and strides in moving as far away from these attitudes as I possibly can. I am vocal in defending liberal and antiracist attitudes among family and peers, and I empathize with the struggles of black people and I'm willing to do what I can to understand and support them, even if it means sacrificing my own privileged opportunities. I am in my university's juvenile advocacy program, where I am a mentor and advocate for a minority youth in the juvenile justice system, supporting him against the racist legal, economic, and education systems he unfairly deals with.

However, this is all well and good as an ideal which I am working toward, but when I am put in situations with actual individuals I sometimes find the old attitudes coming back. This has become a serious problem since I got a new roommate a couple months ago who is black. He is up until 4am and has no regard for me and my other roommate sleeping--I am woken up consistently from doors slamming in the middle of the night. He smells very unpleasant and is almost constantly smoking blunts in the apartment of some poor-quality weed, which travels through the vents to all the rooms of the apartment. He is frequently heard screaming over video games to his friends in his room, and he talks/sings loudly to himself in the common areas. He doesn't clean up after himself in common areas. He left a magnum condom wrapper in the living area in an apparent need to boast about his penis size.

I know he is an individual person and of course not representative, and I guess my main point here is not to complain about my roommate even though I had to get some of that off my chest. It's just that I am noticing extremely racist attitudes I thought I had eradicated rising up again, and I don't like this feeling of regression to an earlier, more ignorant, hateful version of myself. It's not good for me and it has the potential to unfairly impact others. Does anyone have suggestions on how to deal with these feelings that are arising?",02Nov2020,1
901,"Hi guys,

I can’t even finish an anime or show that has anything more than one season. What is wrong with me? All I do is lay on my bed and somehow find something useless to do on my phone.

Every time my mom passes my room she says, “Get up from your bed, you look like you’re sick.”., maybe I am sick.

910,"As the title states, I don't know how to stop disliking my bf's sister. She hasn't done anything specific or malicious towards me. I just don't like her. We're different types of people. We're nice enough in person to each other and can have a conversation about things while being relatively friendly, but beyond that, I just don't like her. I keep trying to find some good in her to convince myself, but I keep finding more things I dislike. 

For example:

*  she insists on having animals but can't afford vet bills for them and doesn't live a lifestyle conducive to owning a dog (Ie, routinely is out of the house for 14+ hours a day hanging out with friends) and then wants me and my bf to dogsit when we have other things to do
* Punishes the dog because the dog made a mess because it was left inside for 14+ hours with no one home
*  doesn't want to work and wants to find a sugar daddy to support her lifestyle and is living off of government money (pre-covid) because she refuses to apply for jobs she's actually qualified for
*  3+ nights a week comes home at 3am LOUDLY with her friends with benefits waking up me and my bf when I sleep over (I don't care that she's sleeping with whoever. I care that they don't even make any attempt to be quiet while they know other people are sleeping)
* constantly complains about how little my bf cleans when all he does there is sleep/shower/brush teeth (everything else is either at work or at my place)
* threw a huge fit when my boyfriend wouldn't let her drive his car (that she pays nothing towards) after she failed to listen to the rules he set while using it 
* has cost my bf thousands of dollars in rent and food money because she didn't have government support and wasn't working because she was being picky with jobs (Wouldn't work a part time gig at a fast food place for example because she didn't want to)

913,"Yesterday we had an argument that was a continuation of one from a couple days before. We’ve been together for about a year and 4 months and he recently started getting angry at me all the time for no reason, yelling at me every time I talk etc. It happened again yesterday and I told him I couldn’t deal with it anymore and he suddenly went out of control and started saying ‘fine I’m gonna fucking kill myself’ as he walked into the bedroom and started looking for something (I don’t know what, he just kept muttering ‘where is it’ and ‘gonna fucking kill myself’). 

I had to physically restrain him while I was having a panic attack because it brought back a lot of trauma that I couldn’t handle. I was scared that I wouldn’t be able to stop him as I’m much smaller and weaker than he is but he calmed down and then acted like everything was fine. I was still having a panic attack and sat in front of the door as I was scared he’d try to make a run for the bathroom or something, and while I was doing so he kept sighing and acting like it was an inconvenience.

Later on I had told him he wasn’t leaving my sight as I couldn’t trust him on his own right now, needed to make sure he didn’t do anything bad. He said he wanted to make food and I walked out the door first so he could follow but he tried to slam the door on me. I jumped back through and grabbed onto him and he was smiling, laughing. I was terrified that he was going to shut me out and kill himself and he was just laughing.

We have talked about it now and are trying to help his mental health to get better, but I can’t deal with the fact that he threatened to kill himself like that especially knowing about my past. I feel selfish for talking about myself in this situation but it’s really weighing down on me and I don’t know what to do. I feel that it’s incredibly toxic but I can’t lose him because I love him with all my heart and he’s all I have. My family hate me and all of my friends moved to different groups and stopped talking to me so now he’s the only person in my life. He still has others to talk to but he always says I’m overreacting and he has it worse so I should stop complaining about it.

921,"Hi all, in a massive dilemma right now. 

I was planning on moving to Vancouver in the new year and this has been on the cards for a very long time. I was supposed to move there last June but COVID hit so I had to postpone it for a while since borders were closed in Canada.

Since I only finished college last June, I ended up going back to my previous employer as a graduate architectural technologist. Last week, my employer offered me a promotion if I decide to not to go to Canada. The promotion is into a managerial position where I would be in charge of two junior staff, training them up to scratch, taking them out to do site surveys etc. It’s a great chance to get into a leadership position. 
However there are three things setting me back from making a decision.

1. The office is incredibly small and the work is largely confined to just residential project (one off houses or extensions/attic conversions). We may get 2/3 commercial projects and even then, these are small stuff (conversion from bar to bar and restaurant, bathroom extension to a sailing club). I’m looking to dip my hands in the bigger commercial projects like schools, mixed use high rises etc.

2. The pay rise isn’t that great. I’m presently on €500 per week take home and if I take the promotion, it goes up to 558 per week. An extra €58 to take on a large responsibility doesn’t really cut it out for me. I’d reconsider it if take home was over €650 per week. I can’t really negotiate on the pay as I have virtually no leadership experience. 

3. I’ve always wanted to experience living abroad for at least a year or two. Travelling is my number 1 goal and every penny I save goes to travelling. 

There are advantages and disadvantages for either paths.

If I take the promotion:
Pros:
1. Great opportunity and a chance to work in a leadership position.
2. I can live with my parents, rent free and little to no bills for utilities or food meaning I could save a lot.
3. I could be in a position to be able to save easily for a mortgage within 3/4 years if I wanted to. 

Cons:
1. I’m stuck working on boring projects and I’m afraid that I would get bored or worse, burn out from the job altogether.
2. I’m living at home so social life could take a hit. If I were to rent, social life may be better much but it’s extremely expensive to rent in Ireland.
3. I’m only required to be in the office 2 days a week at the moment which is great and if I take the promotion, I’d have to commute everyday (1hr15mins each way) as I would have to be there everyday to make sure the junior staff are being looked after.
4. Travelling is limited to just 2 weeks per year. I get 4 weeks off per annum, two during summer and two over the Christmas break. Can’t really travel extensively over the Christmas break and two weeks feels way too short for me. 

Move abroad to Vancouver:
Pros: 
1. Get to experience the opportunity to live in a different country for however long I wish to do so.
2. I can work in a practice which specialises in commercial projects.
3. Living in Vancouver would be fantastic with the Canadian Rockies on the doorstep where I can go skiing in the winter and hiking in the summer. 
4. Lifestyle outlook is much better in Vancouver than in Ireland (grass is always greener on the other side metaphor applies here).

Cons: 
1. Still have to rent which costs quite a lot. This means I would have less disposable income not to mention that Vancouver’s rent are really high (comparable to Dublin) and groceries are apparently dear. 


I really cannot decide what to do. I’ll regret going and not taking the promotion and I’ll also regret not going and taking the promotion. Gut feeling isn’t telling me anything.",02Nov2020,1

My bf (21) and i (19) have been dating for ~7 months and i’ve know his family since the beginning of the relationship. 

Yesterday her sister (18) was crying when we got home (i stayed over at his house) and my bf went talk to her along with her mother but she just told them she had a fight with the guy(17) she’s dating 

Today in the morning everyone left for work and i stayed at their house, when suddenly i heard her sister crying, so i went out to check on her and hugged her, then she told me what had actually happened... 

On Saturday she had a little gathering here at their house and this guy she’s dating was acting all weird, and when she asked what was going on, he told her he was on cocaine (which he did in her bathroom) 

Soo the problem is that she talked to him and turns out he does this on the regular because he feels the need to escape, but she’s really a healthy girl and not into that kind of stuff, she was really heartbroken and shocked. She just told me they talked and he told her he would decrease his consumption, and she believes him. 

Now, i don’t know if i should tell my bf, because it’s something that she trusted me on to tell me, but i’m also worried for her, because i don’t see her on the regular since my bf and i are long distance and i cannot check on her as much as i’d like. She’s quite into this boy since she has never had a boyfriend and he was like the first one she really liked.

**

I'm (24F) in my first serious relationship with my bf (34M), it's been 3 years and we're living together. 

But lately I admit that I have doubts. These 3 years were not the happiest time of my life despite him being a genuinely good person. He has his inner demons. 

I have my reasons for thinking about breaking up. It's not clear in my head, but I do have this kind of thoughts. As I'm slowly crawling out of depression, I'm starting to realize that maybe I have other plans for my life. 

Should I share these feelings with him? Or should I wait until I'm sure of what's happening in my heart? I don't want to bottle up then open up at the last moment and dropping a ""we're done"" without any discussions first. Yet I don't want to talk about this now as it could ruin everything while I'm still that unsure. 

He has no one - friends or family- except me to eventually support him. And I'm afraid that having this kind of talk will trigger his ancients drugs addictions- as it has done many time in the past--and make him relapse. So I don't want to hurt him if it's not important enough.

935,"TLDR: Uncle stole $50 from me, and my brother caught him stealing food from our pantry and shoving it in his bag, we invite him over a lot and thought he was cool until this. He’s also really broke and unemployed. 

Ill try to keep this short, but it’s a lot of info, first my uncle is pretty broke, he doesn’t have an addiction, he’s just broke. He’s almost 50 and has nothing. He is currently unemployed and my dad has been inviting him to our house every few weeks to sleep over, he’s been sleeping here every few weeks for 5 months now.

Basically we’ve been missing food, sealed food my mom buys, and my brother caught him in the act without him noticing, my uncle was shoving all this food from our pantry in his bag. 

We have cameras in our house and he always unplugs them, and he questions me excessively if the cameras records, he even asked me like 50 times if my VR sensors in my room are cameras. Months ago I was missing $50 from my shoe box I leave at the top of my closet, I found my shoe box on the floor with the money missing while he was there and instantly screamed at my brother for stealing it. Shortly after my uncle offered me $50 (which he never gave me but probably offered it because he felt bad my brother was taking the blame) for helping him with his unemployment papers. My other uncle (his brother) caught him stealing toilet paper/food/water and even said one time he was missing $20 from his wallet one time and almost certain it was him. 

I was thinking of inviting him tomorrow to watch the election, I have some spy cameras coming in tomorrow that’ll I’ll setup to see.



He’s my dads brother, my dad doesn’t believe me and he never defends me and always picks his brothers over his children, I still remember when I was 14 he held me down while my other uncle punched me in the face, and to this day lies about it. My dad even told me straightup he will never believe me and will always chose his brothers over me.

I always loved my uncle, thought he was cool and after this I feel betrayed and NEVER expected this from him, i always invited over my house cuz I loved him coming over but now he just lost something worth more than the $50 or food he stole.

936,"I (18f) recently got a job, and have been saving money to move out. My dad (43m) and me both have bipolar disorder, but our ""manic phases"" are much different. He gets very aggressive towards.. everyone basically. Yelling, cussing, threats, and this ends in tears and me and my brother (10m) go to my grandparents. He's been this way since I was a baby. He's always ""worked on it"" with his therapist, and takes medication on and off, but he drinks, and this makes the medication not as effective, and sometimes he doesnt take it for long periods of time. 

I on the other hand, become really depressed and turn mainly to SH or I just cry it out. I keep this private from my family, and only talk to my therapist about it. 

My conflict is my mom (42f) works 3 days 2 nights overnight, and sometimes, my dad takes this as an opportunity to ""slip up"" by not taking his meds, drinking a lot, and lashing out at us. I was planning to move out once i have the money saved, but Im worried about leaving my brother alone with my dad. He's never been physically abusive to him, but as anyone whos been through it knows, threats and screaming and cussing is still harmful, and honestly, I dont want my brother to become as troubled as me. 

This is where I need help, my solution is I was going to tell my mom that I'm not comfortable leaving my brother alone. He could either stay at my future place with me, she quit her job and I could send them money to ""make up"" for what she'd be missing, or my dad needs to leave. They have marital issues outside of this, and they've considered divorce for other reasons (him cheating multiple times and the way he treats us and my mom) which basically everyone encouraged for her to do. If she did this, they would not be able to afford the house, but she could finally move to a cheaper state and I'd of course go and help with money and my brother. My mom and I have always wanted to move out of state. When I've tried talking about it before, my mom gets offended because I need to mind my own business and hes not my son and she gets offended.

TL;DR - dads gonna fuck up my little brothers head with emotional and verbal abuse like he did to me, how do i tell my mom without upsetting her it needs to change?",02Nov2020,1

I've changed my degree/major a few times so I graduated late. I changed jobs because I was not happy with it (I only took the first job because it was easy to get).

I'm finally in a field that I want to stay in but I'm literally just starting out.

942,"When speaking with someone through a dating app how do you know you “like” them and want to pursue something further. Is it measured by a spark when you meet, the qualities they have or do you just know deep inside? I’ve met someone and spoke to them for a few months prior to actually meeting due to the pandemic happening. I’ve become attached to the online personality of that person but did not feel the same spark or vibe when we met in person. They have all the qualities I would want in a person I would marry, such as being kind, supportive and loyal. The spark for me is what excites you about the person, makes your in person conversations flow smoothly and when you leave you miss their presence. It could be due to the lack of meetings or the current situation in my life with the pandemic and losing my job etc. But at the end of the day, I do realize that a spark can be developed with time and even form after marriage, maybe patience is key or I need to listen to my gut.

My question is how do you know you want to proceed with someone, how important is appearance to you ? Or does personality and their qualities matter more? Do you need to feel a spark or a great vibe when you finally meet a person to proceed forward or is balance between all these things needed. Personally, I think spirituality and maturity is important to me but a great sense of humour and playfulness is also valuable and is it safe to say that if you don’t feel any sort of spark after numerous meetings then it probably will never happen.",02Nov2020,1

He broke up with me by text after ignoring me for 4 days and I personally had a hard time getting over the break up. Because it was my first relationship and I did love him. 

Saying that though, I don't love him in the same way anymore. I wish him well. I love him in the sense of I think hes great- but I wouldnt ever feel comfortable being in a relationship with him- I dont think I could trust him. He also obviously doesnt hold feelings for me as he is with someone else and has been with them since a year after we broke up. 

I have gone though periods over the last few years where I didnt ever want to speak to him again. I've also have gone though missing him being around- we were friends before we ever were romantic and I think it stems from that.

Hi all
I'm going to try and keep it short. My mother in law has for a while been complaing about a pressure and pain she feels in her buttocks. I ignored it thinking maybe it was bowel movement issues or weight gain or anything. Today however, she asked me to call the doctor and ask if anal sex could be causing her this pain. I immediately asked her if that was the case, was she in fact having anal sex with her husband. She broke down and said yes she does but she isn't happy about it. Numerous times she has told her husband she doesn't like it and it's painful but he's quite stern and angry in general so it's no surprise he tells her to shut up and deal with it. If she refuses he won't talk to her properly and becomes moody. Now, alot of things make sense, for example he wakes up in a mood with her or refuses to eat what she cooks but most of all it makes sense why she would keep complaining of a pain. I think the pain is getting too much and that's why she decided to open up to me today.
My problem is, now that I know I'm conflicted as to whether I should tell my husband that this is the case or is it better left unsaid?",02Nov2020,1

I currently have 6 or 7 good friends, plus my friend group of 3 others. but the friend group plus most of my friends have abandoned me at all school breaks, so every day I sit alone on the concrete with my earbuds in. I talk to my online friends and write my stories and am generally 100% antisocial for that whole time. Everyone else has their groups, but my friends lie so they won't have to hang out with me. They're fine when they are with me, but nobody ever reaches out. it hurts. 

I also don't have any handle on my sadness. I cry very easily, at small things. deep breaths do not help. The teacher got mad for no reason the other day during our test, and I almost burst into tears within a minute. I also got extremely upset upon thinking I'd failed a class, while the kids who were actually failing did not care. 

I've never even had a crush on anyone. only two people have ever liked me, and they were in 4th and 5th grade. I have never felt any attraction. My friends say it's weird because everyone likes and has dated/kissed someone by now, and I'm worried this means I'm gonna die alone or something. that scares me worse than anything. I don't understand why I'm still lonely but yet don't feel anything real like that. not even sure about my sexuality at this point but it may as well be null and void. 

We only have 2 or 3 days a week of in class school, on our off days I sit alone in my room, play video games or write/read stories. that's it.

One of my friends came over tonight and told me I needed help and that she was concerned about me. We had a long conversation and I did a lot of crying, it was emotionally exhausting, and my relationship with her has not been great for awhile.

966,"Long post but I’m desperate for help :(

So I’m friends with this girl we will refer to as (Girl) who used to be friends with my ex. I say this because it matters in a bit. This isn’t a case of me trying to get back at my ex by talking to her friend or anything. 

For context, (girl) is extremely stubborn, rude at times, and generally unpleasant to be around at times. But it’s just one of those things, and I’ve known her long enough to know that it’s just a facade, she’s very warm and affectionate when you get her alone and comfortable with you. even shy at times. Despite the rough edges, she’s very sweet and has an endearing quality about her. The kind of girl that wants to see you but won’t say it out loud, but let you make the first move.

Recently (Girl) and I have been hanging out a lot more and I’ve been going to her house quite a bit. We usually end up cuddling around in bed and kissing so it’s clearly not 100 percent platonic and she has admitted as much. But we’re just friends. I’m pretty sure she just thinks of me as a friend, but not “friendzoned” if that makes sense. Just harmless fun.

She tends to be a little bipolar generally, always reacting very emotionally strongly to things, but recently it’s been different. 

My ex and I dated for around 3 years, it was toxic, and ended fairly badly. (Girl) and my ex used to be good friends but now have a general dislike for eachother for about a year over some disagreements in their friendship 

Recently, (girl) saw me having a friendly conversation with my ex, nothing more, but it’s the first time we’ve had any kind of non negative contact in quite a while. (Girl) got extremely angry at me, ghosted me for around a week, unadded me on social media, and wouldn’t talk to me. It was out of thin air for me and only after talking to her friends did I find out it was because she saw me talking to my ex without it being an argument. 

Eventually she added me back on social media and even apologized with the words “I’m sorry” which is fairly out of character. Usually her way of apologizing is doing something to let you know she’s sorry without saying it, as again, she’s very stubborn. She admitted that when she sees me and my ex talking she is afraid I will choose my ex over her. She refuses to admit that she was jealous, but I suspect jealousy was the root.

We’ve been getting closer and closer, and recently she’s even been telling me she misses me and asking me to come over without me having to make the first move. A couple days ago, she went cold and distant again after stating that I was being annoying, and now won’t talk to me. She went from telling me she misses me and asking me to come over to seemingly wanting nothing to do with me over the course of about a day. 

The hot and cold with this girl is slowly driving me insane. I don’t know how she feels about me. I don’t know why she would do this on and off thing, and she is not the kind of person I can simply ask about it straight up. I miss her and want my friend back :( can someone attempt to take a stab at helping me understand the reason for her behavior?

Ive become friends with her now and I remembered that maybe a month or so ago I called her stupid. I didnt really mean unintelligent, more like a bit air-headed, oblivious. That doesnt really matter. I called her stupid and I feel horrible, especially since I know she isnt. Shes very intelligent and I really really like her and value her friendship, and I feel like I fucked it up by saying that. Im scared someone's going to tell her and she'll be hurt, and I just feel awful about it, so I want to tell her so that she can choose to either leave me or forgive me.

""First, I want to say that you're allowed to be angry and upset with me. I'm dissapointed in myself for this and any choicw you makw regarding our friendship is perfectly valid. 
Back when I didn't know you particularly well, back before I hadn't had ""true"" conversations with you, I called you stupid. I did not call you or think you were unintelligent, more so that you were oblivious to some ""obvious"" things like (name) liking you or you being hit on by several people. That includes the whole cafeteria thing where you thought you were being nice but it just came off as rude, and that time you called me an ""ego destroyer"" and then got kind of mad when I called you a coward for not tagging me back.

Im saying that I was referring to those things, not your actual intelligence. I dont think youre stupid and I like you a lot as a person, I always have, and I feel bad for ever saying that. Im genuinely very sorry. I just dont want you to think Im someone who Im not, aka someone whos never said or done immature and hurtful things. Im sorry. ""

I just feel like a bad person and a bad friend and I dont know what to do. Im thinking of just saying that to her tomorrow and letting her choose whether she ever wants to see me again.

972,"I really don’t like my parents and I don’t think that’s ever gonna change. I’m scared they gonna take my phone and break it like that narcissistic controlling manipulative parents. Which they are, which makes my life harder. My sister is out constantly with her bf and I’m at home doing school work, playing games or sleeping. And they are always in my back on stupid shit. My mom overreacted to everything and the type to make something more than it was. I can’t tell my family I hate them. cuz they will ask why but idk, I know why but they wouldn’t understand and it wouldn’t make sense to them but today I woke up from my nap. And I came straight down. I’m groggy and slow. 

My mom sees me and I know she’s gonna mess it ups somehow. So I’m walking in the kitchen, and she blocked me from getting in and went infront of me. I was too tired to understand what she was doing so I placed my hands on her and I’m telling you, I scooted her away, I didn’t push. I scooted her to the side so I can go in the kitchen. 

But she got mad ALMOST IMMEDIATELY and said “Oh. Okay then.” And I said w”what?” Confused but realization set in and I knew she was gonna take it out of porption and say I pushed her or something like that. She does this a lot, I would do something little but take it out so much. Like if I’m explaning something to her on how it works but she tries to fix it her way, but I know how it work I just need her help. I wouod sigh and she get angry cuz I sighed. The other day my sister found a centipede in her room and my mom got extremely angry for no reason. Like more than she should’ve gotten. And she thinks she’s all composed and controlled. It’s kinda scary that the way she thinks she’s actin is Normal...I know family’s are fucked up but mine isn’t normal. 

But anwyays she claims to my dad that I pushed her. 
When I did not. She was making herself the good guy. And I said I didn’t push her I scooted her cuz I didn’t know what she was doing while she stood right infrot of me. And personally I don’t like hugging my mother, it feels fake and I get disgusted. We just don’t click. 

Then I go upstairs and fall asleep again. My mom told my dad to call me so he didn’t. And my mom told him to call me again. He doemst listen to my mom, and I can tell he doemst like her cuz he sighs and rolls his eyes when she calls him on the phone. I saw him just staring and hesitating to answer the phone when she called him. He ignores her when she talks. And he put out his anger on me.  

But anyways he calls me like I’m in fucking trouble. And it angered me cuz he didn’t have to yell like that. 
 He could’ve came in my room, knocked on the door. Or called me. But he screamed my name in bloody murder. Then my mom did it too!! So it’s like crazy yelling. So I was getting out of bed and he did it again even louder and it scared me, so I wnet out my room and said “What!? What happened?” He said “Get your food” he said it in a rude way. Like how a kidnapper would tell their victim to eat their food. In a nasty rude way. Idk why he was speaking to me like that. If it’s cuz my mom lied about what I did then yes, he’s gonna believe his narssctic lying wife then me. 
So I asked why were they yelling like bloody murder, and my dad said “Just get your damn food” and my mom told me to be quite and cold down. I felt so shunned and pushed again a wall as a metaphor. So I asked again; I wanted to know why. They didn’t have to do that, and they are being rude to me. I asked why are they yelling and ignoring me. Again they sis ether same thing. And I said they didn’t have to act like that and I told them to calm down a little. And my dad got in my face, saying I don’t them them what to do. 

I know they are my parnats but they can be a little quieter when yelling my damn name and just listen to me for once. 
This is the real energy. The energy they give off when my sisters bf is here is absolutely fake and it annoys me. And it’s disgusting.

974,"I (23 f) met this guy (31m) through some mutual friends and he seems like a really nice guy. I'm friends with his sister now and she's super nice too. I admit to stalking this guy's social media and before I knew too much about him, I realized that he's divorced, which I don't have a problem with. After some more lurking, I came across a youtube video his ex wife posted in which she claims that he was abusive towards her. She claims that he was mentally, physically, and emotionally abusive. My experience with the guy has been positive but I cannot discount what someone else is claiming, because it could be true (why would anyone make that up right?). I am not at the point where I feel comfortable asking him about this, because there is nothing serious going on. Should I avoid him instead of becoming invested in someone like this? It's early on enough that I can move on without too much heartbreak.",02Nov2020,1
975,"I (21M) recently became a lot closer with an old friend of mine (21M), which is appreciated, but also, now it seems I am his only support structure/the only person he shares his feelings with. To be fair, the reverse is also true. 

Dude has a lot of issues that I won't get into here but they bother him constantly. He also only works part time and I'm a full time student taking 17 credit hours with two part-time jobs and trying to manage grad school applications somewhere in there. He wants to hang out pretty much constantly which I would be okay with, but I'm super busy. I already spend pretty much all of my free time with him and feel a bit like I'm neglecting my other friendships. Also as the December 1st deadline for grad school comes up, I have much less time than normal as I scramble to finish up all of my applications. I told him as much and he seems pretty understanding.

But, again, I'm pretty much his entire support structure, so I get constant updates about his mental health. I really want to be able to drop everything and help him when he needs it, but it's getting to the point that I'm just very overwhelmed and I'm butting up against some hard deadlines that I can't miss and I really don't have time for it. I do feel like such a shitty friend though.

Again, he is most of my support structure too, but I'm a bit more stoic than him. My issues are mainly depression and suicidal ideation, his are more along the lines of PTSD. I noticed that he tends to stress over my issues as well so I've ""gotten better"" on that front in hopes of reducing the stress on him so he won't have to rely on me as much, but it doesn't seem to be working that well. 

I'm frantically trying to cram for an exam tomorrow morning and he's having a mental breakdown. I'm not doing very well in this class (calculus) and I need it to graduate next semester so I really need to do well on this exam. Every fiber of my being just wants to grab my gun and end the whole ordeal right now but 1) he would be in a real fucked place without me, 2) it would really fuck him up if I died and 3) it would really, really fuck him up if I killed myself, so I suppose that's off the table. I just feel trapped right now. 

He asked me if he should stop telling me what's up with his mental health right now since I'm really busy and I'm not sure what to tell him. It feels shitty to say ""well, school is a bigger priority right now so yep, I'm going to need you to keep your issues to yourself."" But I'm also just not entirely sure I'm capable of supporting him right now.

I also can't deal with his current way of ""not bothering me about his issues"" which mainly involves texting me about how he's hungover since I wasn't available to talk last night so he got drunk. This is especially stressful for me because my now-ex girlfriend did the same thing to me before I broke up with her, except with self-harm instead of drinking.

I feel like I don't have enough time for the whole interpersonal relationships thing. I do want to support my friend but I'm running out of steam and I just feel nauseous all the time. Any advice on what to do or what to tell him on the whole issue of ""whether or not he should bother me about his issues"" would be greatly appreciated.",02Nov2020,1

Lately, I've been noticing that this fairly pretty girl who I met through a mutual friend has been straight up copying my Instagram stories as of lately. We only have 2 mutual followers. Some incidences:

1) I posted a photo of purple rice balls in a flower formation with a Chinese caption for the Mid-Autumn festival, after she views my story, the next morning she takes a photo of 2 bagels and adds things that make it look like a face. The way she cropped her photo made it look like a replica of my 'food art' idea but her 'whitewashed' version of it. The part that made it seem obvious was that she added something random in Russian (even though she has no Russian blood at all) 

2) I posted a photo of myself wearing a face mask, and after a while, she posts herself in the exact same angle and facial expression with the caption, ""Designer mask, thanks \*insert name of friend\*""

3) I posted a group photo with friends, and then a while later she posts her own, then adds the caption, ""I'm loud and I want power."" And the rest is about how she likes to one up other people.

980,"So I have a friend, we're all about 22 in Canada so weed is completely legal. She used to buy just off the street and thankfully she finally stopped, and started getting it from a dispensary. She claims it helps with anxiety and for pain, and he doctor recommends it, but can't get a prescription for it for some reason. She smokes constantly, at the least twice a day, usually three to four. She smokes before work, during work, after work. She smokes and drives constantly. She has what seems like withdrawal when she doesn't have weed which I know is rare. She even cries if she runs out and can't purchase anymore. She spends a ton of money on it, then subsequently food when she's high, and then complains about having no money all the time. If we hang out in between smoking she's great to hang around with, but other times she is spacey and doesn't pay attention or remember anything and it drives me crazy.

 Any time I suggest we hang out without smoking she gets pissed, insisting that because I don't smoke (I've tried it, it just makes my head hurt), but because of that I don't understand  it and am ""judging"" her. She compares it to me drinking to much pop, which maybe i'll have some root beer with dinner and I know I should drink more water but weed to pop? I don't really understand the comparison as drinking root beer wouldn't affect my driving. Honestly I'm at my wits end, I don't want to get in the car with her anymore, or hangout with her smoking constantly, but if I say anything she'll get pissed at me and I don't want to loose her friendship. We've been friends for nine years and I love her, I'm one of her bridesmaids. But i'm tired of walking on eggshells around her and having anything she interacts with smell like weed. 

I would be so grateful for any advice anyone could give me for dealing with this problem. Its even worse now because now my other friend is mad at her but doesn't want a fight and I keep having to acting like nothing is wrong.",02Nov2020,1
981,"My husband was just in a very bad car accident on Friday night. Thankfully, he walked away with just a bruised back. He’s back from the hospital as of Saturday morning. He is injured though and will be out of work for a few days. As will I to take care of him. He can’t really bend or move easily so I’ve had to do everything for him and help him around. Once the initial shock calmed down from the accident and we both acknowledged that he’s okay we started realizing how screwed we are now...

We’re both 23 and living in a state over from our parents. My mom has MS and we were going to move back to the area to be close to our family and so I could help take care of her. Our lease at our current apartment expires Nov 30th and at the beginning of last month, we signed an intent to vacate because we knew we’d be leaving. 

It was already hard enough to find a new place because we were stupid kids and although my credit is a lot better and is now considered good, his is awful and we have an eviction on our record from an event that was truly out of our hands. I call us stupid kids because we had no money in savings to pay the rent we were late on or any of our bills and got evicted/sent to collections for the bills. Also, right now landlords are not able to evict people in the area due to covid, so there are very little apartments even up for rent. We had 2 leads on apartments and one guy dropped us like a hot potato when he saw the eviction and the second one we were supposed to see Saturday but I canceled because my husband was in the hospital. Today, we were just told someone put a deposit and an application down on it, so it’s pretty much gone, according to the realtor. 

Now, we can’t afford first, last and security. We’ve had to spend money on things for my husbands back (meds, braces, creams etc. it all adds up quick), will have to soon pay a huge bill for the tow and storage of the car and just know the medical bill will be here shortly. 

On top of all this, we need a car. Make that 2. I drive a 99 Saturn and it just started having issues on Friday morning before his accident, with our second car, on Friday night. It’s about to die and it’s now our only vehicle. 

We’re sharing a vehicle that’s on its last legs, so all our money(only have about 2400 right now) is now needed for a vehicle or 2 instead of the apartment. 

And to just add to the stress, I might be pregnant. Not sure, but I’ve been very nauseous. I thought it was stress until I realized it’s been happening since I had a bad ovary pain about a week ago. The pain is gone but I still get nauseous in the morning and night. My period isn’t due until tomorrow but I usually spot and there’s been nothing. I’m genuinely afraid to take the test. I don’t think it’s likely since we’re usually careful but it’s still quite possible.

There’s also the additional pressure of the fact that our insurance will go up because he was in an accident so that’s less money in the budget for rent. He was in a double accident where he was driving and a car was spun out blocking a lane of the highway. This guy was sitting there with no lights or hazards on and the highway was pitch dark so my husband didn’t see him until his headlights hit his bumper. He swerved but clipped him just a bit and spun out. He sat there waiting for the police and an ambulance (he got pelleted with glass) with his hazards going. People where going around him just fine because they saw his blinking lights but then a car came up and hit him full speed. The guys didn’t even hit the brakes so it’s suspected he may have been under the influence. It crumpled my husbands car and injured his back. My husband is at 50/50 fault for the first accident because he clipped the bumper but the guy should have had lights on so he isn’t held fully responsible, and he is 0% at fault for the second accident. Because of the 50/50 though we’ll owe money and our insurance will go up. Side note: the only one injured and transported to the hospital was my husband. Everyone else was completely fine. My husband was drug/alcohol tested and it obviously came back negative but we haven’t heard if the other people were under the influence yet. 

So now, we just don’t know what to do. We’ll pretty much be homeless as of 11/30 and we may very well be without a car at all soon. We can afford to move into a place and start paying rent but the upfront costs are too much. I don’t feel right about borrowing money from anyone and neither does he. 

If anyone can see a way that we can go up from here, please let me know. Any suggestions are very much appreciated.",02Nov2020,1

985," 

Hello, throwaway for obvious reasons. Sorry for bad formatting, im on mobile and haven't really used reddit. 

To put things into picture or to even start somewhere, I am 14 years old, my mother is 50, and my dad is 73 or 74. (I'm too afraid to ask at this point) For starters, my mother has PTSD and other mental problems i believe, while my father has served in the military and most likely also has PSTD, and also has some physical health issues. My mom has left me with my father for 3 years between 4th-late 7th before as of some court issues that i dont know alot about, only that my father wanted her gone. My father also has full custody of me. They fight alot about things, which has been happening since i was a little kid. (mostly my dad screaming at my mom about having boyfriends or something even though they arent together whatsoever) Recently, since about January, it has gotten alot worse. Ever since one of my cats, peaches (fake name as i dont want family members finding this) died, to be exact. My father has always been an angry person, but when this happened, it just seemed to get worse. He blamed me for her death, (she died at less than a year due to a seizure) and yelled at me while i was breaking down and crying. I regret this now, but when my mom tried to comfort me i lashed out at her and locked myself in my room for the rest of the day. (Also, when another cat of mine, ""socks"" died when i was in 4th grade, he was also yelling at me the entire time on the way to the vet) in feburary, they were fighting again, and it was getting pretty bad, so i went to go see what was happening. My mom took me outside to get away from him, and he refused to let her or I back into the house, and was badgering us. Eventually, he charged at my mom and physically attacked her, and i tried to run in and stop it, and ended up getting socked in the jaw by him. Eventually he got tired and went to bed so I could get back into the house. The next day i went to the counselor (who wasnt there by the way so i had to talk to the resource officer) and he told me to call the cops, so I did. My dad got temporarily arrested, but it got settled out over the court or something. (I think my mom let the charges go or something I dont know the full details) After this, I stopped talking to him unless its for the bare essentials. (Doesnt stop him from talking to me though) He has also gotten taken away 2 more times over quarantine because he wouldn't stop screaming and yelling outside, and was acting like somebody was on the property when there wasn't. Because of all of these events, I dont like being here with him. I get nervous when seeing him. Hell, after even having to talk to him I sometimes cry in my room. I fear he's going to hurt her or me again. He also is very possessive towards her, and paranoid about her having boyfriends or any friends in general, even though she has none. When she left for those 2 years, he always said she'd come ""crawling back eventually"" even though he was the one that wanted her out in the first place, so I don't know why he said that. He got mad at her once because she didn't wanna have sex with him. Hes always trying to tell me how ""abusive"" she was, and how i deserved to be hit by him basically. His excuse always changes every time. ""You've been hitting me for years!"" A lie, not including the times i was having a temper tantrum when i was like, 3-6 or something. Normal child stuff. ""Children need to be punished!"" I was just trying to protect my mom, I don't see that one, and there are more but I dont remember. Hes also the only one that can drive, as my mother is on medical marijuana for her PSTD, and can't. She also doesn't have a job. Im nervous, because lately he's been acting like somethings gonna happen, or like he figured something out. I feel like he's gonna do something to my mom. Hes constantly going ""i finally put all the pieces together"" and something about her bringing guys to the house (again, she DOESNT. How would she even be able to do that??? She cant even drive??) And once, even something about an organization. (When i thought he was really good he told me once how he used to be in this organization thing, that I also suspect to be racist. He has also used the n slur agaisnt black people multiple times) I'm pretty sure he's off his rocker about that one, though, just like my mom bringing guys to the house. It sounds fake, I wish it was fake, but its not. In one of the ""episodes"" he was having, he also banged on my door with a screwdriver. It was terrifying, and now i always lock and close my door, no matter what im doing. I also have a knife incase he does anything. I dont know how to handle this. Do I go to the counselors about this? CPS? The police? I don't know what to do. I can't stand being in this house anymore. I constantly feel suicidal. I wpuld rather kill myself then have to deal with this, at this point, but I dont wanna hurt my mom any further. My brother also would be mad at me. (Hes 19, hasnt been in the house since early 7th. I dont talk to him but the last time i did he told me not to go to the counselors again) Should I run away? I dont know. Again, I'm only 14. What the hell can a 14 year old do? But i dont wanna end up killing myself, or stay here. My options are limited. Is it even abuse? I have atleast one meal a day, i have water, i have internet and elctricity. Its not like im being neglected or anything. Im constantly doubting myself on this. Sorry if the details seem a bit fuzzy, if anybody needs more clarification or information, just ask. Its a sortof spur of the moment writing, so its not been checked over, and things are all over the place. If i don't write this now, I dont think i ever will. Also, my mom doesn't seem to want to leave. I know when i mention it she just brushes it off, or says that she doesn't have enough money. Which is fair. She also hasn't hit him, and rarely starts the arguments.",02Nov2020,1
986,"Does this sound like a toxic work environment? I feel like it is, but I need a second opinion:

- Lack of clarification around rules, no one seems to know the exact protocol
- New workers are never asked for their opinion, and are basically told to only listen to older workers
- My age (23) is constantly brought up at work by others
- I wasn’t invited to a specific consultation team even though my older coworker of the same rank was
- Nit-picking on new employees if they don’t order the exact type of food they want for the employees
- Coworkers bashing each other behind their backs
- My coworker said the management “tries to get people to quit by making their lives miserable.”
- Very high turnover
- When I brought up racism at a work meeting, they told me that we need to keep social justice “out of this field” and I’m “projecting my values” in the organization

My coworkers told me “don’t take everything personally at this job.” However, I feel like all that I have experienced at this job is building up, and I’m miserable.

993,"So, this guy I’ve been talking to for about 5 months now has asked me to be exclusive and has told me all of his feelings for me blah blah, but the other day I had posted a photo in my snapchat story of me in an outfit that I really liked and I felt good in and then proceeded to answer his message after. He blew up on me. Completely freaked; asking his friends what they thought. Told me I was trying to get compliments from other guys. Said he felt he wasn’t enough for me. What would you guys say about this!? We’re not “dating” because he has past commitment issues (been cheated on) I’ve made it clear he is all I want and I am NOT a cheater in any way. 

He (23M) and I (18F)",02Nov2020,1
