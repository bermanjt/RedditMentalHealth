0,"I don’t know if I’m questioning or doubting my sexuality but all I know is that my thoughts are driving me crazy.

I don’t have anything against gay people.

I don’t know if I’m questing my sexuality, but I have this ocd thing where I’m constantly obsessing about it, and all this gets me is heart break and headache.


I never liked a girl in my life, I never thought about girls in any sexual way. 

I never dreamed about kissing girls or wanting sex with them.

So how do I care about it if it’s not true? 

It’s like I’m looking for things to make me sad rather then finding happiness and moving on.

Being gay isn’t a bad thing. But I know not I’m gay.

I literally fall In love with guys I never met on coffee shops, trains literally anywhere. And I start planning our weddings and having kids with that guy.


I literally every night ever since I can remember I would fantastic about falling in love with all types of guys in my head because in reality I’m too shy to ever do something about it.

I’m a Muslim girl, I never had sex or touched a guys dick.

And maybe that’s the reason where all this OCD started from.

Because I’m inexperienced with guys so i assume I must be gay.

I only kissed two guys in my entire 21 life line. Which I enjoyed. 

I never went on a. Date, I never went to a party, or smoked weed, or drank alcoholic or did anything bad.

So I’m starting to think that’s the reasons I’m letting my self go crazy because I think I’m not normal or whatever I don’t know.

Or it could be that I watch lesbian porn.

But I also watch straight and men on men porn too. 
It’s very hard to find a good straight porn where it’s not about the guys pleasure and it’s always quick and down to sucking the cock.

And I know gay porn do that but theres a lot of them that don’t do that girl or guy gay.

The thing is that I always look away when they are sucking each other’s vagina, I find that so gross to the point I feel sick.

I’m not trying to be rude or anything but I hate vaginas it’s gross in my opinion.

The lesbian porns know what girls like in order to have a good orgasm.

The feeling is that I’m not watching my self while watching the lesbian porn.

I don’t wish I was the girl when finishing in those videos too.

I don’t wish I was the one doing those things to the girl In those lesbian porns.

I guess I just want to know what’s wrong with me? Why can’t I just move on from it? 

This started what 3 years ago. And it got really bad to the point i was depressed and hated everything.

It felt like I was stuck somewhere alone and couldn’t figure a way out even though I knew the answers all along.

I know I’m straight, I don’t watch lesbian porn every time I only do it when there’s no good straight porn.

The straight good porns takes me literally hours to find a good one.

If your readin this I don’t mean anything rude or have anything f against gay people.

But I’m starting to realised I’m finding these “like thinking I’m gay “ reasons to be unhappy rather then to realise  I’m not that and I should find things to be happy.",24Dec2020,1
1,"I need genuine advice on how to wakeup early. Right now I work fulltime and I leave the house at 11:30 and don’t get home until  around 11. My gym is not open 24hrs because of covid and they close at 10 so I need to wakeup early enough to go to the gym, shower, and make food for work. The issue is that when I come home from work I am not mentally tired so it is hard for me to just go to sleep. Also in the mornings, I feel completely exhausted. I have so many alarms starting from 5am to 11 right before I leave for work and I snooze all of them until around 9:30//10am. Last week I set the same alarm on three different devices and put them on different areas of my bedroom and I just turned them off and went right back to sleep. Half the time I do not even realize I do this until I am fully awake hours later. There have been mornings where I get up and try to walk around to wakeup but I am just so tired that I end up passing out until almost time for me to leave for work. I haven’t considered coffee because when I wakeup the goal is to hit the gym to start my day. Any tips to help me out are greatly appreciated!",24Dec2020,1

I live on a lot of lands, so the truck is far from the house and they wouldn't hear it start. I really want to do this, I think it would be cool to have that memory, the day I snuck out with a girl.

4,"My brother has been jobless for 9+ months. He had a good job (I think it was a mix of coding and customer service/tech support). But he ended up getting laid off because there were problems with his job performance, making too many mistakes. The company gave him resources and a lot of time to look for another job, but by the looks of it he didn’t put too much effort into it.

We ended up bringing him back home to our parents’ house after about 5 months thinking that some oversight would help him get back on track. Before he moved back home he was pretty much playing video games and on YouTube all day in his apartment. Now that he’s at home my parents have had him on a schedule to job search and take an online class to learn a skill (SQL), but I don’t think he’s doing much of that either.

We don’t know what else to do. I’m working on studying for the LSAT full time and I don’t really want to micromanage him making sure he’s applied to jobs every day, made progress on his classes, etc. He is just stuck and seems solely interested in entertainment. He’ll gladly get into these in-depth and usually one-sided conversations where he shows off all his knowledge of different movies, video games, etc. and every time he does, I can’t help but judge him, he just sounds like a jobless loser who watches a lot of YouTube videos and does nothing else. When I ask him about progress on his job search or his class he says he’s not interested in talking about it because the answer is always going to be a flat “yes I made progress” so the conversation “bores” him.

My parents are going to pull the plug eventually, they’re giving him 2-3 months to find a job until he has to move out and pay for everything on his own with his savings. I’m worried that when that happens, he’ll just take up a low skilled job, find a shitty apartment, and just indefinitely prioritize gaming like he has been doing for most of the year. How can my parents and I help him get his shit together? He went to a really good school and I worry that the more time he spends jobless and not doing anything valuable (at least not as rigorously as he should be) the less employable he will be even with his degree. Personally if I was in his position I don’t even know how I would explain the 9+ month gap on his resume. 

He’s in his room playing some game with randos on discord like he does every night as I’m typing this right now. Help? How do I prevent my brother from becoming a useless man child?",24Dec2020,1

Hi sorry if this isn’t allowed but I wanted to know if what my sibling is doing to me is abuse or just siblings fighting.
So basically I’ll be doing nothing and they will walk up to me and hit me or smack my butt not really hard but it hurts sometimes. They will also sometimes walk past me and say fat ass and call me a hoe. 
But sometimes I’ll say something funny and they’ll grab my hair and pull it really hard to the point that it falls out sometimes or they’ll push me to the ground and start stomping on me pretty hard but they have only stomped on my head once when I accidentally closed a door on their head so usually they just stomp on my legs or my waist and arms.
5 minutes ago they were yelling at me cause I wanted to play on their console and saying all I do is want. So eventually they called me hoe and I called them one two cause they hurt my hand earlier and they then grabbed my head and started pulling my head up really hard making it hard to breathe when I smacked their face. They then took a step back and I thought it was ok but then they walked up to me, took off my glasses, and proceeded to put their hands together and hit my head directly in the middle two times with full force. They said I smacked their eye and my head felt really fuzzy for a second. 
I’m not totally the victim cause occasionally I’ll hit back but then they always have to hit me back again and say that since they are older that I can’t hit them and whenever I pretend to hit them they always say no don’t hit me it hurts so I find that quite hypocritical.
Anyway I can’t tell if I’m just overreacting or this is actual abuse so if anyone can help me and tell me it is greatly appreciated!",24Dec2020,1

This is a very long post, please bare with me.

I'm a senior in high school. Last year, this asshole classmate of mine (who was and currently is in the same grade as me) spread an embarrassing photo of me. I was teased for a couple of weeks before everyone moved on. The picture was of me looking at a girl's Instagram post of her senior photo in a classroom, with my eyes closed and mouth open. Basically it looked like I was jerking off. The girl obviously blocked me.

Anyway, this year, I got revenge by slandering him brutally online. I gave out his first and last name, and wrote about how he likes to make fun of people with Downs syndrome, and throw disabled people on wheelchairs down the stairs.

Before the retaliation, I asked him if it was him to took that picture of me. He said that he didn't do it and then told me that I was a cyber stalker and had a ""creepy obsession on the girl"". He told me that what I was doing in the classroom was weird, and a lot of other people who I talked to about that part said the same thing. A friend of mine who I told about this situation told me that he was gaslighting me because he was knowingly lying to me and that he was ""changing my sense of reality"".

Eventually, some time later he eventually gave up and admit that he did take that picture of me, after I impersonated him on social media, made awful posts, and sent it to about 5 people to try to get it to spread. I kept bothering him, by continually asking questions and insulting him, as well as slandering him online like I talked about earlier, and told everybody that he embarrassed me, made fun of me, and gaslighted me, effectively ruining his reputation.

After I ruined his reputation by telling the whole grade how much of a jerk he is, he argued that ""we were even before, and now we are not even"". And then threatened to either tell the dean or post that embarrassing picture of me, and that I ""had a choice"".

I told him to go ahead and post that picture, because it was only going to hurt him. After all, everyone else knows he is a jerk who likes to embarrass people, and therefore him posting that picture of me would only further cement my original point.

He is saying that he didn't gaslight me, that I was spreading false rumors about him, to stop playing victim, and that what I did was worse because I caused him ""permanent damage"", because ""once something gets on the internet, it never goes away"". I told him that he had nothing to worry about, because the posts were already deleted, as they actually were, but he is complaining that the Google Search Engine still saves the titles and contents of the posts, and that with the right keywords, it is possible for a college or employer to find those posts in the Google Search, even though the posts was already deleted in the website themselves.

I remembered in the past, him saying and doing other mean stuff to me. Let's just say that overall, he just isn't a very nice person to me and never really respected my feelings and property. And so I asked him about those, and he said that he didn't say/do that, even though I know he did. My friend was like ""Oh my god, that is gaslighting"".

For example, one time last year I was on my laptop, watching a video called ""How to get a girlfriend"". I minimized the video to look at colleges. The asshole came up to me, and in front of me, put his fingers on my keyboard and typed some keys in, maximized the video, laughed at me, and told some classmates in the same room. All of that happened in front of me, but for whatever weird reason I was never bothered by it, because I brushed it off as him just kidding or just joking or something.

Overall, he is arguing that what I did to him is worse than what he did to me, because what he did ""wasn't permanent, as everyone forgot about the picture within the few weeks"". But that I've caused him permanent damage because I ""posted crap about him on the internet, and that never goes away"". He said to me just an hour ago that he lied to me initially because ""look what happened, you know the truth and you have been bothering me for ALMOST A YEAR"".

About a year ago, I made a personal Reddit account, and there was a post on there about the crush and photo situation that I never remembered making. The asshole showed it to people in the same classroom as mine, and made fun of me, as well as showed it to his friends. I confronted the kid about that, and he kept insisting that he never hacked my account.

The other kid just reached out to me and told me that he saw some posts about him that I don't remember making, and that he is going to complain to the dean about me. He also said that he hopes that I get thrown in jail. This asshole made fun of me and picked on me and is making ME look like the bad guy in all of this. I am going to complain to the dean about him. Shit is gonna go down.

But I'm worried, is that true? I've heard stories about schools filing police reports, and how police can later track the IP address and bust people.

If it helps, both of us are 17, and this all happened 2 days ago on Monday. How long should I wait until I can safely conclude that his threats about telling the dean are nothing but bluff and scare tactics?

20,"Hello.
So, the thing is, I (18F) don’t know what’s normal and what isn’t in a friendship, since I don’t have a lot of friends, therefore, not a whole lot of experience in the friendship department.

I usually rant/vent here about my friend (all of my friends are 18 too) but I feel guilty for doing that. She’s overall a great friend. 

But I feel like things have changed between us the moment she started dating my ex-bully.

He used to call me all sorts of racial and homophobic slurs, and all my friends convinced him to talk to me and apologize. I was the one that ended up talking to him to make things right.

Then, he began saying all those things again, told me to fuck mysef, and blocked me. I asked my friend (the one that’s dating him rn) if she could tell him to unblock me so we could talk. Long story short, I told him to never talk to me again, and that we were going to be civil with one another for our friend’s sake.

But I feel like my friends don’t care about me as much as I care for them. Whenever I tell them that I feel insecure and that they would prefer my bully over me, I don’t get reassured. They just say “oh, don’t say that” but they don’t say things like “you guys are equal to us”

And, whenever I try to bring the situation (my friend dating my bully) my friend gets mad and stops talking to us for a few days, then comes back as if nothing happened.

Yesterday was when I really started to question if my friendship with her is healthy. She likes this fictional character from a book, and I started reading the book not so long after she did, and ended up liking him too.

We’re both bookworms, so we usually have crushes on fictional characters, and it’s not a big deal right? Since they’re just letters printed on a book.

Well, yesterday she began talking about the fictional character on our groupchat, and we started fangirling, I jokingly said he was mine and only mine (I put a bunch of emojis, that’s our way to point out that we’re not actually being serious)

She texted “I’m mad. Goodnight everyone.”

And I texted her saying it was a joke, and if it hurt her feelings, I was sorry.

She texted me back later apologizing, saying that she didn’t mean to hurt me. And that she cherished me as a friend. And I replied that I didn’t mean to hurt her, and that I cherished her too. She hasn’t replied to me, and it’s been 2 days. She’s online sometimes, but for a little while only.

 like with my unattractive female friends, they’re always saying how no one likes them and stuff. I think about how I can be nice and pretend to like them, only to use them or something idk what I’m trying to say

24,"i got my Kyleena IUD inserted in july of this year. since then, i’ve had continuous bacterial vaginosis that antibiotics can’t get rid of, pain during sex, pain when aroused, recurring UTIs, and inflammation. it’s causing me and my partner so much anxiety. i never know if i’ll be able to have sex, or if it’ll hurt or not. and when i think about that, i get all tense so it’s even worse when we try. the IUD was supposed to stop my periods and cramps (which were excruciating before) and it did until last month when i got my period and it hurt like a motherfucker. i went to the doctor and they prescribed me a birth control pill to take in addition to the IUD. it just doesn’t seem like anything is going to help at this point. i’ve already had the depo provera shot and it made me bleed for 10 months straight. the pills made me have 5 periods in the span of a month and a half. and now the IUD is fucking with everything too. at this point, i’m probably just gonna have to focus on pain management. they keep giving me 800mg ibuprofen when i need something stronger. i used to take hydrocodone when i was little for my periods because the pain was so bad.

god idk i’m just so discouraged. on top of that, i feel like i’m constantly disappointing my partner when i can’t have sex. i always try, but sometimes it just doesn’t work. i want my body to be normal.

anyways, if anyone has any IUD stories or personal advice that might influence my decision, it’d be greatly appreciated. idk what to do at this point. it seems like nothing will work",24Dec2020,1

The syllabus states I must source in APA format.

I did an in-text citation for a website in APA format, and my in-text citation looked like this: ""Disadvantages of a market economy include growing social and economic inequality... (Ollman, n.d.)""

My full citation was this: 

Oldman, B (n.d.). Market Economy: Advantages and Disadvantages. Retrieved December 20, 2020, from https://www.nyu.edu/projects/ollman/docs/china_speech2.php

Either I am completely misunderstanding what his feedback means, or he is saying I shouldn't have included a date in my citation because it's web access?

Is this true? Because I checked Purdue owl to make sure I was citing correctly before I turned the assignment in and I found another source at https://guides.libraries.psu.edu/apaquickguide/webpages showing web sources being dated.

28,"Don't know if its necessarily a hit and run, but I was driving on the highway during a  storm, very poor visible at times, and a semi truck went to cross the highway, so i slammed on my brakes, but was still going close to 60km a hour and the semi was taking up both of the lanes so I turned left into the ditch( a 3-4 drop from the road height) missing the semi by 5 feet and missing a telephone pole by even less. I get out of my suv(that I just bought the day prior) didn't see any damage, I was fine and then i see the semi floor it and take off. So I hop in my suv and chase after him. About 5 minutes later I catch up to him he pulls into the parking lot where he was headed. So I pull out my phone got his plate number, his company name, etc. Then he hops out and apologized saying he didn't see me and his tires skidded, offered to give me $50-100 to not report him. I refused, I'm more angry about the fact that he didn't stop to see if I was okay or needed help he was not going to turn around either, I was fine thank God but what if I hit that pole, what if I wasnt fine. I'm not sure if I should call and report him for just taking off or if I should just leave it be and count my blessings..

The event happened in a metter of minutes and the water was shut off but there was a lot of water. The couch was aired out and matress leaned against a heater with fans. It felt completely dry after 24 hours and it has continued to be aired out for another 72 hours. The building is built brand new this year and insurance is dealing with the damages.

Do my matress and couch need to be replaced? It was clean water that soaked them and being a new building, the floor and cieling seem pretty clean if that matters. Still no word if they are covered by insurance. Ive been staying at a friend's  air bnb in the meantime.

Unfortunately she isn’t a great communicator. We text good morning and good night every day but her texts have gotten shorter since the time she has been away. Not much texting during the day which is understandable with work and family but it just sucks. I sent her a letter for her birthday and she haven’t even opened it. Send a thoughtful text to her for our 3 month anniversary and got “♥️♥️” as a response. It just makes me nervous that she is losing feelings or something due to the distance.

33,"Coming out of College, Living in a LOCL area, deciding between quality of life now or later.

Hi, let me preface this with that I am aware my situation is very privileged, but also I worked hard to get to get the job I did, I just need help focusing in on how to use that hard work now that the goals are more open ended.

**Current Situation:**

Age: 22

Student Debt: $17,000

Credit card Debt: $0

Credit Score: 750

Salary(New Job Starting late Jan): $80,000

  \- To add, i currently do not have a job, I work part time (like once a week) at my family's business on which if anything goes south with my new job, I can absolutely fall back on as it does very well.

Cash: \~$3,000

Savings: None

**Expenses:**

\- Rent: $225/month

\- Utilities: $150/month

\- Food: $650

\- ""Partying"": $150

Now the situation I am currently in is interesting.  I just graduated college with a STEM degree and got a dream job at one of my dream companies.  The reason my rent is so low is because throughout college(and till today) I have lived at a house in which a high school friend purchased a couple years ago.  The house is in a decent area near my new jobs headquarters and living here for a few more years while I save up would normally be a no brainier.

However, I live with 4 roommates, all but one still have at least a year left of college.  Our house cleans up nice but for 6/7 days of the week it is the epitome of a frat house.  Dirty and nobody wants to clean except me.  Also while most of my roommates are my friends there is one that has a very real inverse effect on my quality of life and it makes me dread coming home most nights.

The way I see it currently (with what I want to do in life) I have a couple options:

\- Tough out my current situation for about a year until I have enough to invest in real estate (I really want to take on becoming a landlord and get into both apartment complexes and commercial real estate)

\- Move out to my own apartment and spend $800-$1,500 to live on my own now, vastly improving my mental and physical health (living with party animals encourages me to be a party animal sometimes)

\- Move home to my parents until I start my job, live rent free but with my family and have 0 social life. ( I Really dont like this option, my parents are great its just I'm single and in the prime of my life)

I dont expect you guys to tell me what to do or even how to figure it out completely, I have just been stressed out of my mind making this decision.

35,"I (20m) was raised in church and always taught to treat everyone with the utmost kindness. No matter how mad someone made me, I always said “what would Jesus do” and forgave them. When I was 17, I realized that god wasn’t real and ever since, I’ve been trying to work toward at least having a normal level of self respect. 

Fairly often, I’m reminded of situations where people literally had no regard for me at all. I’m reminded of times when “friends” took advantage of me. Some of those times, I was clueless because I was so desperate just to have friends. There’s one situation especially that makes me madder than hell to this day. 

In high school, we were having a party in my Spanish class, and the teacher sent these 2 guys to go get everyone cups of water (small class). I was handed a cup and took a sip out of it, but the guy started laughing. I found out immediately that he’d literally spit in my cup of water, and I noticed that there was spit in the cup. My best friend went with this guy to get these waters, and he didn’t say anything to the guy about spitting in my drink. It didn’t really hit me at first but when I got home, I realized how mad I was that he had so little regard for me to do something like that. I asked my best friend why he didn’t say anything, and he sort of just downplayed it. 

I’ve stayed friends with this best friend ever since high school, and he’s always been my closest friend and person I could tell everything. I only think about this situation every so often, but it still just makes me so angry and sad that my own best friend didn’t care enough to speak up. Honestly just thinking back on this situation is making me reconsider our friendship despite us being best friends for over 10 years. He’s a really quiet person that doesn’t like to rock the boat, so I can’t say it surprised me he didn’t say anything, but that’s not an excuse for him to excuse shitty behavior.

42,"*Apologies for any format issues, as I am on mobile, and weird structure for asking advice in general

For context, I am a highschooler and I had a Kermit plush with me that I would bring to school, not necessarily for any purpose but just to have some fun. I had a few classmates who would jokingly steal Kermit from me but would end up giving him back to me.

But of course as you can tell by the title, this time he didnt give it back. In fact he said to me, ""I stole it on accident,"" and somehow, he managed to steal it on the day right before the order to stay at home was put into place. And for one, I hadn't even realized he stole it in the first place.

Again as you may tell from the title, I have no idea how to get it back. One of the policies of the school is that they aren't responsible for any lost items, so that's an impossible option. This year I had my friend ask him (through an online class) he straight up shook his head as a no. I don't even have a clue what he has even done to Kermit, which sounds silly, but this plush was given to me as a secret santa gift among my group of friends and was one of the few material things I actually cared about.

One thing I do know is that he has the same teacher again this year who teaches the same subject but at a higher level. I could email him but I don't know what to say. My mom said that they have their student's parent's phone numbers that they could call, but I'm not sure if asking my old teacher to get his parent's phone number is against any policies.

I am simply clueless and lost. I feel like a horrible friend for losing this gift, and I really want it back. Any advice and ideas are 100% welcome and appreciated!!",24Dec2020,1
43,"Me and my partner have just separated from eachother because they weren't ready for many things and i respect them. It was a very soft breakup, but it still made me feel like crap.

46,"Recently, my best friend of six years, who is one of my closest friend and is someone I talk to every day, moved into a new apartment with another mutual friend of ours. I've been feeling kind of bummed recently at the fact they seem to not be making as much of an effort to talk to me as I am them, and while it definitely doesn't seem like they don't want to be friends, it does feel *different*. Just for reference as well, most of my friends live alone, or live with partners/spouses and I do feel a little like that's different.

I suppose as well I'm just upset that I feasibly can't live with my best friend (as we live a few hours apart and our jobs are very set in place) and on top of that, it feels as though during the times they're free and able to contact me, they don't really put in much effort? I'm not really mad at them, and I know they don't do it on purpose, but I don't really know how to bring it up either. I want them to be stress free and happy, but I just feel kind of down about it and trying to word, ""hey, i'm sure hanging out every day with X is cool but I haven't seen you in almost a year and we haven't really had many proper conversations since you moved"" without sounding like i'm insane seems really hard to me. I am aware part of this is probably just jealousy but, I sort of feel like as someone's best friend I should be afforded some time to speak to my friend without waiting hours between responses or having things i've said be ignored? Especially when our relationship has never been like that before. But I also don't want to accidentally jump down their throat if they're just...caught up in whatever it's like to live with your friend?

SO, basically, do you have any advice on what it's, first of all, like to live with someone and if to begin with there's a honeymoon period? And going off of that, how would it be best to broach the subject with my friend about the fact I feel kind of left out and upset they spend all their free time with someone else without sounding like I'm having a go?",24Dec2020,1

For context, in January we'll be at 10 months together, and we don't live together, can't see eachother due to living in the US in an area with a lot of folk getting covid. My partner has three cats,  or did, up until this one died. I can't remember how long they specifically had this cat, but she was one of their best friends. Especially with staying home so much I know it's hit hard.

  Outside of small conversations of sending cute videos or me checking in we haven't interacted much since it happened. At first they sent me a really upset message about it and gave me a heads up they're totally worried this will set back their mental health in a lot of ways, were worried they ruined my day with the news, and said how they totally get it if I wanted a break from them or to leave altogether even if they would appreciate any support. I made sure to reassure them I'm staying, it be silly not to for me, but I'm just worried for them. I live with my parents while attending college do I know I have the support, but they're alone right now. 

  I really don't think they'd appreciate a surprise visit and I'm not capable of it right now for various reasons including quarantine, but I do also feel really bad that this is so close to Christmas and how they'll remember our first Christmas together.

A few weeks ago me (f27) and my boyfriend (m25) visit my dad and his family (his wife and my younger sisters). My family is very outspoken and consist of many extroverts but my dad and boyfriend is introverted. Also, in my family, the enviroment is quite harsh. We tend to call each other retarded, stupid, cheap etc. To be honest i have been very sad about things said about my age and pressure about grandchildren. I am a very sensible person, tend to get sad easily which they know and I was bullied alot when young.

When we visited, everyrhing was as it used to but when one sister said that another was retarded, my boyfriend jokingly called her stupid. We didnt know then but she took it hard coming from him. Later, my Dads wife and I ended up in an argument were i many Times asked her for us to stop talking about the subject since we only argued but she could not let it go and my boyfriend told her to shut up.

When we got home, my dad called and were angry with my boyfriend for what he said. I thought it was unfair since we say things like that all the time and told him that i had been getting sad about that before. I have not told him before to ""keep the peace"".

Now everything is upside down. My sisters have told me that it was wrong of me to say this when the real problem was about my boyfriend being rude (he has apologized but by text since we have not met since) and that i was only using this as an excuse for him. My dad and I have talked and he told me everyone is sad and feeling bad for what has been said but no one has reached out to me since. My Dads wife is posting on social media like everything is normal. And our family chat has been dead quiet. I feel horrible and has been crying a lot (i am with my mom now)...

Have anyone had similar experiences? How do i move forward? 

I love my family but i dont want the enviroment to stay the same. I am part of the problem to, i tend to say things to my sisters to that i am not proud of and I want it to change. Also my boyfriend has since said that he does not feel comfortable to visit them for a while.

(dont know if it matters but things that has been said  that made me sad is ex.

We went on 2 dates and on the second we ended up being intimate.

There really was a decent connection between the two of us. After we were intimate, it felt like her replies from the texts we had were short and detached. However, at the end of the 2nd date we kissed goodbye and asked for a round 2 in bowling (we went bowling and for drinks for our 2nd date).

I became fairly busy with work and uni, in conjunction with the short messages, I stopped texting her and her to me.

Two months later, I still feel like seeing her. Our conversation were deep and really meaningful. The sex wasn't that great (thats on my behalf as I was out of the game for a while) and I was fairly insecure as a result from my poor performance.

56,"Hello everyone, i'm using a sideaccount for this post because i don't want any personal stuff mixed in with my normal account.

So, to start: i'm in the first year of my bachelors degree in computer science at a quite good university. At the start of the year we had all classes except for the excersise classes online. I had one week of attending uni in person and honestly, i liked it like that.

Anyways, not being there in person did cause me to not understand things as good as i did while i was there. My motivation stagnated a bit because most of the time i would just be sitting at home at my computer watching classes and doing maths all alone.

After a while they switched to everything online due to the corona situation and i really started to loose my motivation.

Now the semester has ended and i'm studying for the exams.


However, lately i have been thinking wether this is really what i want to be doing with my life. I am not sure wether this is because of how the situation is now or wether i didn't notice too much of it before because there was at least some contact to other students.

Then again when i think of what else i'd switch to i'm not exactly sure wether i want to do any of that either. Before this whole situation began i didn't know what to choose because there were many things that i liked but now everything seems kind of dull.

Also i don't want to throw away where i am at now. Getting into the university wasn't hard for me and wouldn't be to do again. I just don't want to loose all that time and maybe end up with the same or a worse problem and i would definitely be taking a risk.


I've heard from others how unmotivated they are at the moment and how they are not having fun (which for some has taken a toll on their grades and for me it definitely will too).

58,"I met a girl via Instagram and been seeing her everyday for almost a week now. There was kind of an instant connection between us, you know we have a lot in common and I make her laugh, she makes me laugh. Fucking hell I havent been able to go to sleep before 4-7 am the last 5 days, thinking about her. Yesterday she kissed me (first kiss btw) and I kinda think I'm falling in love with her. But heres the thing: she lives in a semi-abusive household, her dad beat her several times and her mom is overprotective about her going out and staying out late. She also has a history of cutting her arm...

So today we met again, I picked her and her friend up and we got along as usual. We visited a few friends and ended up at my besties house and hang out there for a while. She made some snarky remarks about guys and how shes not my girlfriend (which I know but didnt really need to hear). When we left to drop off her friend I felt kinda unsure about how she feels about me and her eventually beeing in a relationship. 

After dropping off her friend, being alone and such, we talked about stuff and how I felt, how she felt. These things were sorted out pretty quickly (she likes me a lot :)). But then all of a sudden she was kinda sad, emotionless face and all. We sat in my car and listend to sad music she kinda needed then.

When asking whats wrong, she didnt wanna talk about it. I tried to get her to talk to me for almost an hour, we cuddled, made her laugh a few times and then agreed, that she'd text me, when I'm home. Because she didnt know how to say it. First thing I did, arriving at home, was ask her about it...

She said, she doesnt know, what she wants right now and was a little overwhelmed with this situation. That might be because I'm the first guy, that doesnt just want to fuck her, but cares about her. There are lots of guys, that want her (including friends of mine) because of her looks.

Well then she said, that she did something stupid. What followed, was a picture of a 5cm long cut on her arm and a second wider one right below. I really wanted to scream at that moment. I dont want her getting hurt, especially not by herself...

I know ask you guys, how to help her, because I never had a girlfriend and never really dealt with this issue first hand. 

I dont wanna lose her...sorry for the long text, but its a matter of heart for me. (German btw sorry for mistakes)",24Dec2020,1

61,"Hi everybody, I hope all of you are doing well and staying safe!  I hope you all have a Happy Holidays!  First off, I posted something very similar to this earlier today, so I apologize if you are seeing a repeat post.

&amp;#x200B;

\*\*TL;DR:\*\* \*A former swim coach of mine (Early 20s F) and I (18M) got along extremely well since we first met, but I'm not sure if it's okay for us to be together because of our age gap.  Should I try asking her out, or is this a bad idea?\*

&amp;#x200B;

I (18M) have recently been considering asking someone out, but I've been wondering if the age gap is too much, and if she is showing interest in the first place.  I don't know her exact age other than she is in her early 20s.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was 15, I joined a swim team where she was the assistant coach.  The funniest thing about the two of us is that we are essentially polar opposites.  I'm religiously agonist while she is Protestant Christian, I'm a fierce political leftist progressive while she is a politically conservative person, I'm Asian American and she is Caucasian, I tend to be very quiet and shy while she is headstrong and assertive, etc.  Despite this, we got along very well since we first met, and we even found it fun to talk about our oppositeness.  We actually would talk about politics quite often and have a lot of fun hearing each other's views.

&amp;#x200B;

Over the time period I stayed on the swim team, she started to show some ""signs"" in a way.  I feel bad calling it ""signs,"" since I know that there is no way I can know unless I am them, or we talk about it since everybody is different, and I apologize about having to use that term, but for example, even though she generally acted like a military woman who was very strict while training us at practice, she would act very differently when talking to me specifically.  In addition, there was this one time during practice where she asked one of my swim teammates to pick the best looking guy on the team.  When the swimmer pointed at me, she licked her lips and said, ""Ooh, you made the right choice there,"" winking at me.  I also noticed that it appeared like she would watch me while I did dryland exercises and sometimes look at my butt.  One other time, we were doing dryland exercises outside, and she had to go somewhere to get something the coach wanted.  She sat in the driver's seat, watched us, and then tried to signal me by pointing at the shotgun seat in the car while I was watching before she left.  There was also a time we had to go on a trip, around 5 hours, to go to a swim meet, and even though she could have sat in the front of the bus with the other coach, she chose to come all the way to the back of the bus to sit next to me.  We had this really amazing conversation, and she was blushing and stuttering often while we talked and even touched my shoulders a few times.

&amp;#x200B;

The best memory we shared, however, was when I got sick during practice, and when I wouldn't come out, she found me and tried to help me.  She was so sweet, even though I was a huge mess.  I was so embarrassed, and she just kept helping me and promising me that it will be okay, and I was really grateful that she helped me out.

&amp;#x200B;

After around a year at the team, my parents ended up switching to me another team.  The last time we saw each other, she gave me a huge hug and told me she hopes I don't forget about her.  I found her on Snapchat just a few weeks ago, and we really rekindled and started to connect again.  Now that I'm 18 years old, I was wondering if it would be fine for me to make a move since she's no longer my coach, and she told me that she is single.  What do you all think?  My biggest concern is the age gap.  I don't mind the age gap, but I know that she might, and I was just wondering if you all thought there could be a moral dilemma because of it.

69,"I went to go look at an apartment that's been empty for months and there was a package on the step that had been there for quite some time getting rained on. I looked inside and it turned out to be an unopened iPhone 12 Pro Max from AT&amp;T. It came with a return label so it is most likely an upgrade. It's post marked the begining of this month so it seems likely that the owner is not coming for it. The bill had the correct address, so presumably the owner moved away and forgot to change it with AT&amp;T.

Since it's been several weeks and they haven't come for it, they have probably already reported it missing right? If they accidentally had AT&amp;T send it to the wrong address would AT&amp;T eat the loss and send them another? We don't have any way to contact the owner other than calling AT&amp;T.

70,"So for context I (22F) have multiple disabilities, one of them being a variety of eye conditions. I had a cataract as a baby which left one of my corneas cloudy looking and I have two different coloured eyes. Then at 14 I had glaucoma which meant I got a transplant in the same eye due to eye pressures.

I’ve always been self conscious about my appearance and at my worst I feel like the ugliest person I know. I was bullied in high school for my appearance and knew I was the unattractive one out of my siblings.

So earlier today I was at the opticians and they mentioned the option for cosmetic surgery, since I’m now an adult. They can make my cloudy eye look clear and make my eyes symmetrical. I could even get the both the same colour if I wanted to. Of course he was just mentioning it and I didn’t have to make a decision, but it’s interesting to think about.

On the one hand I like the idea of looking “less disabled” in a way (couldn’t word that better) and I feel like looking more normal will improve my quality of life. It could improve my self confidence and make me love myself more. But on the other hand getting it done could be seen as me listening to those negative thoughts and letting everyone who bullied me win. I want to make sure if I do this, I’m doing it to improve my life and not because I think I look disgusting.

So I am in a bit of a weird situation for xmas. I live with 2 other  house-mates, we all know each other for ages and lived together for  years, we're all good friends. I decided to spend xmas here so I don't  risk my family getting the disease. My house-mates have decided to spend  xmas day together at another house with a few other friends - 

The other friends are also my friends too - we are also good friends and  we are all in the same friendship circle / group. And when I said Im  staying here, they said they want a small christmas and can only have a  few people 

(Covid is not an issue 2 house are allowed to meet and Im no any extra  covid risk (I work from home, stay inside, dont have health problems  etc.) - so me being there would not change any risk)

So I dont know what to feel about it. One hand I do feel a bit left out,  like they have forgotten me or dont want me there. But also I know  planning xmas stuff is difficult and having another person might make  things more stressful for them. 

And it is their xmas and they do not have to invite me if they dont want  to, they have their own reasons. But for me it feels like im being left  on my own for xmas while my friends go and spend the day without me.  And whatever the reasons, my thoughts are always that they dont want me  there, they dont really like me...

So thats my point / question, am I being selfish in just thinking of me  and and being upset / frustrated over it - not thinking of their own  reasons/issues and thinking like I'm 'entitled' to be invited?  What  would you do to help with those thoughts or make the situation better?

83,"
I am 19 years old and I am struggling with a lot of stress, anxiety, and depression right now because I don’t have any idea what I should do. I escaped from my parents’ home four months ago and went to live with my boyfriend in Mexico. The reason why I did such a crazy thing was because I was so mentally and emotionally exhausted of the living situation at home with my parents. I am a U.S citizen, but my parents are both immigrants and my mom immigrated my dad just two years ago. Even though I was born in the U.S, I was raised by my parents in Mexico well into my teenage years. Life has been really hard for all of us ever since we moved in to the U.S. I forgot to mention earlier I have a 14 year old brother who suffers from behavioral and mental health problems. My dad is a construction worker and paints houses too. He always has work, but making a good living in the USA has proven extremely difficult for us.  We live in a extremely small one-bedroom apartment and it is super hard to concentrate on my college classes as everybody is always screaming and fighting. My dad has anger issues and yells at everybody over the most ridiculous things all the time. He verbally abuses my mom and me. My brother is like the mini version of him so they are always clashing against each other. I was so depressed and tired of it all my grades significantly dropped and I began considering suicide. I wanted to get out of home so I began looking for a job so I could earn and save money to move out at some point, but I haven’t had any luck finding one. I was and still am extremely jealous my friends get to have beautiful bedrooms for themselves while I sleep on the floor with my little brother because there isn’t even space for another bed!. After applying for like a 100 jobs and not getting any response after months of doing so, I had an emotional meltdown and I decided to call my ex-boyfriend and asked him for help. I told him everything  about how the pandemic and being stuck at home with my family all day has made next to impossible for me to keep up good grades at school and he immediately told me I could move in with him. I asked him for help because my friends stopped talking to me when school shut down and I didn’t know what to do. So my ex boyfriend is now my boyfriend again because living with him just made me realized I never stopped having feelings for him. He is very helpful and caring towards me, but I just can’t forget he was the one who broke up with me after he decided he wanted to be with his ex-girlfriend. The only reason why I reached out to him was because he basically had been begging me to give him a second chance and trying really hard to became a part of my life again. I know I am the second option because he realized his ex did not love him back and realized how much I loved him do and still do. So while he makes me happy and cares extremely about me and my goals, I feel he wouldn’t be with me if his ex wouldn’t turn him down and it just makes me so depressed. Sometimes, I consider going back home to my parents but every time I remember the daily screams, the fights, and abuse, I know my grades will drop and the suicidal thoughts come back again. I feel so worthless right now by being with someone who only sees me as a second option and scared I may never be able to accomplish my goals and be happy in life because I am poor.

Last week I was up late working in the kitchen. My wife had gone upstairs almost four hours earlier. Our house is old and you can hear when people are moving around upstairs, but it had been silent since she went up so I figured she was asleep. At around 2am I finally stopped working and headed upstairs. I went to the bathroom to wash up. It was dark in the bathroom.  When I walked in, something rushed out of the dark screaming at me like an animal. Needless to say I was terrified, and I kind of crumpled to the floor and cowered. Then the light came on, and my wife was standing there laughing. She said ""I got you so bad."" I asked what the fuck she was doing. She said she'd been waiting in there to scare me and that the look on my face made it all worth it. I asked how long she'd been waiting and she said since she came upstairs... I think I kind of scoffed and shrugged. She had never played a prank on me, and I had never played a prank on her, so the whole thing felt odd. Only later, once I was in bed and she was sleeping beside me, did the implication of what she'd said register with me. She'd been waiting to scare me since she went upstairs. FOUR HOURS AGO. 

For four hours my wife was standing alone in the dark bathroom in silence. Waiting to scare me. I haven't been able to shake the heebie-jeebies I get when I think about this. Since then she hasn't done anything like this, but I'm worried the damage is done. Every time she leaves a room now I find myself wondering where in the house she is. I'm afraid to go to the bathroom. I afraid to enter any dark room in the house. I caught myself today looking at my wife while we were eating lunch and feeling like I was looking at a stranger. My heart-rate has been elevated. My skin is crawling. I haven't slept through the night since it happened.

I tried to bring up to her how I was feeling but she laughed it off and said it was just a stupid prank. But why would she do this? Has anyone else ever heard of someone doing something like this? I can't get the image of my wife standing in the bathroom in the dark... for FOUR HOURS. I feel like I don't even know who she is. Am I overreacting? And if so, what can I do calm down?",24Dec2020,1
90,"I just recieved an ""apology"" text from my friends, it didn't include the actual word sorry but managed to have ""I know last night wasnt ideal but i have no idea what happened with you that you got so mad"" and ""we are just upset you felt that way about us"" OKAY THANKS FOR DISREGARDING MY FEELINGS haha. I don't know where to go from here or what to say. I dont even want to talk to them but I will have to see them regularly. I know they will gang up on me as they have done it in the past.

I am a 15 year old male, and like most i am a dumbass I have two bio brothers, 5,and 4, and two foster siblings 1 and 3. My mom is a taecher and my dad is a reporter.
My dad has an ipad he hasn’t used for two years. Last night out of boredom I charged it and was on it at night since my phone shuts off at ten. Im scrolling through instagram and snapchat, and getting all the usual notifications. I get a notification and click on it, but it turns out it was from my dads email account. At 1:30 in the morning.
The email is a response, “I will try tp find time to send you some”, responding to this message sent by my dad “ Those are some nice tan lines. Maybe when you get home I can see them with my tounge, maybe even taste them. In the meantime what do I have to do to get some more videos of you?”
The email address has no relation to my mother, is not my mothers. I looked up her adress and saw no other emails, leaving me to believe that all other discourse had been deleted.
TL;DR I used my dads ipad at night and found emails sent to another woman about licking tan lines. The woman is not my mother. WHAT do I do? Sorry for formatting, on mobile",24Dec2020,1

96,"Hello I’m new here, and this is my story. I’m 20 and I never had anything with guys (I never even kissed a guy). This summer i worked for two months surrounded with guys and after I returned into my town I started going into this bar where my friend ( let’s call her C) was working. I was free so sometimes I spent her shift sitting there and talking with everyone (its a small bar where everybody knows each other). So there was one guy that I started to like. I wanted to have something with him so after a few days my friend and I went with them in apartment ans we had a lot of fun drinking and talking. He has a sister and they are very protective for each other. And after a couple of weeks we had sex and I can’t believe could do it after so many years of nothing. I noticed C likes him and she started to make anything so that we don’t hang out together. It was one night stand with him and i started to feel embarrassed to tell my friends that we never saw each other again so I tell them we still hang out sometimes. I didn’t want to tell his sister that we slept so I told C not to tell anyone about that because her and I were friends. After I told C about him and I, she told very hurtful things to me and we didn’t speak for months. We started to talk again and I suggested that her, his sister and I hang out one day but that never happened and i noticed that C doesn’t want me and his sister to see each other, because she told her about him and I, I guess. Now, 4 months from then I still can’t stop thinking about that night with him and whole summer cuz it was perfect. I started feeling empty and I can’t cry even I know that situation like this would make me cry normally. I don’t regret that we slept, but I regret telling C about what happens. Do you have any advice how to let go of that event and should I stop talking with C (she really hurted me and we know each other for 17 years now).",24Dec2020,1
97,"So something happened today that made me realise that maybe my worries about suicide are not normal. My cousin came over and was telling me how his brother confessed to being in debt with several companies and had been drinking more frequently. Alarm bells started ringing immediately and my first thoughts were that my cousin was showing warning signs for wanting to commit suicide. I gave my younger cousin advice but I haven't been able to shake the feeling of worry since. And then I mentioned it to my sister and said I was worried but she sort of brushed it off and acted like I was overreacting. 

It has made me think and I've realised I quite frequently worry about people close to me killing themselves. An example: My 17 year old sister got into trouble a few days ago because she got an eyebrow piercing even though my mum said she had to wait. My mum said she had to take it out and she went in the bathroom and locked the door and wasn't responding for maybe just over a minute. I started pounding on the door and was even thinking of breaking it down as I immediately thought she maybe had killed herself because she was so upset. But rationally, why would she kill herself over an eyebrow piercing. Another example is that my boyfriend once called me to say he'd gotten into a fight with his dad and was really upset. Then when I messaged him he didn't respond. After an hour I felt super panicky and immediately got thoughts that maybe he'd killed himself. He then messaged to say he'd had a nap. 

Is this normal? Why do I immediately think of suicide? It's affecting me because I get very anxious. The only thing I can think of is that my mum tried to commit suicide when she was pregnant with me because she was in an abusive marriage. I learnt about this when I was quite young and remember worrying that I'd come home and find her dead. I'd sometimes pretend to be ill so I could stay off school and make sure she didn't kill herself. But this was years and years ago when I was a child so I'm not sure if it is linked. 

Any advice?",24Dec2020,1

99,"The last few months my mom has gotten into Christ heavy and by heavy I mean heavy. There’s been times while talking to her that she sees any religion negative even as a picture of Native American art. She’ll go and say that these picture hold a lot of negativity and that you’re opening yourself up to bad things by looking at a picture. She’s even criticized yoga and once while my sister was looking up she told her don’t do that you’e opening yourself up to evil by looking up. I come from a religious family but I feel like this is extreme and somewhat delusional. I’ve tried talking to my mom about mental health but she doesn’t believe in mental health disorders but rather god gives people these experiences. Everything is practically about god I can’t even bring up a problem without her saying ask god for help. My siblings Christmas was practically ruined because she told them Santa Clause doesn’t exist and that it’s about god. I understand Santa ain’t real but my siblings are absolutely devastated by her saying this after her making him seem real all these years. My siblings got taken out of school and my mom says she’s going to homeschool them and is practically living in a fantasy world that itll work perfect but she can’t do it and has 4 kids. It worries me, she did have a bad meth addiction for a bit so I feel like this has messed up with her brain in ways.

101,"I (21F) live at home with my parents and my brother (19M). My brother had spilled fish tank gravel in the hall and my dad got mad and started trying to clean it. I told him the way he was trying to clean it wouldn't work because the gravel was wet, he got mad. He told me to go away and before I could react  or even move he grabbed me by the upper arm and shoved me into the wall. Apparently I was still in the way because then he shoved me a second time through the kitchen doorway. Both shoves were hard and he gripped my arm very tightly. For reference my dad is a big guy (6'4"" and strong), I am 5'10"" but thin and without much muscle, I know if I tried to fight back or anything I would lose in about 1 second. I don't know what to do.

He has always been prone to getting mad &amp; yelling but has never physically taken out his anger on me, or on my other family members as far as I know. I don't think anyone in my family will be any help because my brother witnessed it and didn't say anything, and there's almost no chance my mother would stick up for me or side with me over my dad.

102,"So basically one of my best friends got a girlfriend a few months ago and they fuck all the time, I don't have a problem with that at all but it seems like they are more comfortable doing stuff like that around me then anyone else. well a few nights ago I was hanging out with them and a bunch of my other friends, smoking, playing games shit like that. Well I asked if I could spend the night at their house because I didn't want to risk going home and getting pulled over or some shit. they were chill with that so towards the end of the night all of our other friends left so it was just me, my friend and his gf. well they start screwing around in front of me. its not the first time so i was chill with it they've done basically everything besides straight up fucking in front of me. well eventually they decided to go in the other room and y'know, take it to the next level. but this time they invited me to watch. I didn't but i did tell them maybe another time. they were even saying I could masterbate while watching them. now the thing is I'm a full on virgin and I've had literally no sexual interaction with another person face to face. I mean I've sent nudes over the phone and shit but idk. I've definitely always wanted to be a part of that kind of kinky world but idk. at this point it seems like they really want me to because they've brought it up multiple times. I just have no idea what to expect from the situation or the result of it. like i trust them and all of that but idk I'm just worried because my last relationship was god awful and almost ruined a good thing between me and one of my best friends and I don't want that to happen again. they have assured me that that wont happen but i feel like that's easy to say until its over. when I was trading nudes I wasn't uncomfortable i was more excited and restless.

103,"I (35 F) am being stalked and harassed by my next door neighbors and I’m not sure if the straightforward answer is to file a report.

My house faces NE and my neighbors to the SE are causing me to feel paranoid in my own home. I’m not even positive how many people live in the house next to me because there are always cars in and out and at least 6 different people I’ve seen around the outside of the house.

When I first moved in about 3 years ago, I would say hello in passing to an older man (possibly early 60’s) who was outside always smoking at a side door that faces my house and a younger man (early 40’s) who was sometimes working in the driveway. 

The younger man tried to make a pass at me about 6 months after I moved in while I was unloading groceries in my driveway and I politely made it known that I was not interested. He must of not taken me seriously, because he would sometimes just show up knocking on my side door to ask me some random question to try and find a reason to invite himself in (I NEVER let him in my house). Finally I just stopped answering my door and he finally stopped coming around. Another neighbor informed me that he ended up back in jail for repeat DUI offenses and we haven’t seen him around in a while.

About a year later the older man decided he’d try his luck and started leaving notes on my car and even a bottle wine one time that my father found when he came over for dinner. Obviously he was not pleased about that and marched right over there and told him to leave me alone from now on.

That seemed to have solved the problem up until about 2 weeks ago. I got home late from dinner at my family’s and as I pulled into my drive way I could see a bird of paradise flower on my side doorstep. There was a note wrapped around it that said “To a beautiful girl like you” and I instantly recognized the handwriting from the previous notes. Here we go again. It was late so I took a picture of the flower and note and then threw it away. Didn’t have the energy to make a scene about it and there is no way in hell I feel comfortable going over there alone.

I woke up the next morning and started working (I’m currently working from home due to COVID). At around noon I popped out to my car to grab a coat I had left in the backseat, and as I walked out my door I noticed there was a single red rose under my windshield wiper. Now I’m annoyed, so I went and talked to my neighbors on the NW side and they said they couldn’t see him easily enough from where they sit. I’m good friends with these guys and they offered to keep a look out. One guy even said he’d walk over and talk to them with me. I declined because I just didn’t feel ready to escalate it yet...until the next day when once again there was another rose on my car. This one he left a note “Yull like to be my gerlfrind” his name, and left and email address for my reply.

Weird and totally inappropriate. I had a male friend accompany me over to have a chat. A middle aged woman answered the door and I calmly explained the situation. I had a good idea that no one else in the house knew he was leaving stuff at my door since it was happening at weird hours. She apologized profusely and told me that he isn’t right in the head (which is not at all comforting to hear) and then said they would talk to him.

I thought maybe now I had gotten through this time and he might leave me alone. Nope. Today as I’m doing the dishes, I happen to glance out my window on the side door. There he was standing at the side of his house, facing my house, with his dick fully out of his pants, taking a piss in the middle of the day, and staring right at my window.

I am running out of options here. I’m sort of afraid to get the police involved if “He isn’t right in the head”. I’m single and I live alone with a small child.

How can I solve this without it becoming dangerous? I am really scared to get the police involved. I’m afraid he’d do something to retaliate.",24Dec2020,1
104,"Background: Ex and I split in college because I was a shitty boyfriend.  We hadn't really talked much since, with the exception of me drunkenly apologizing for everything and then a couple short conversations. Without further ado, as the title says, I received a call from my ex today.  I was enjoying some drinks with some friends at home and my phone rang with an unknown number.  I picked it up expecting the call to be from a bot but she said ""Is this (name)...?""  I was really confused so I said yes.  She proceeds to tell me who she is and then tells me the dog we had adopted together passed away today (while crying).  
I was beyond shook and needed to process everything but I asked if everything was okay and said if she needed anything I could try to help.  After hanging up I realized that I might have come across as uncaring?  I sent a text saying it was a lot but that I was glad he lived a happy life.  I then told her that I was sorry but didn't know what to say.  

She said she was sorry for springing it up on me and that she was in shock.

I reiterated that I was glad the dog lived a happy life and told her once again if she needed anything, she could reach out.

 If not, how would you have handled it?  
Do you think I should try to talk to her more?

108,"I'm going to try and make this story short and sweet but I doubt it will be anything but.

My baby sister got engaged Nov '19 and set a date for the wedding  for Feb '21. We live in separate states - me in NYC and her in the south. So our experiences this year have been a bit different to say the least. When the pandemic hit, she has convinced herself that Covid-19 would be long gone by now (right).

Meanwhile, since March, I have accumulated copious amounts of anxiety but somehow have maintained some resemblance of strength to support my baby sister as her MOH.

She originally planned for her Bachelorette to be in Vegas, Oct '20 but changed her wishes for it to be on NYE somewhere in the mountains with the 10 of us. 

At the end of Summer, I booked a spacious cabin rental and in September, I warned the girls that covid would be a real thing in December. I communicated that there would be no trips planned to bars, restaurants, etc. and to help everyone with cost, I am catering the entire trip - cooking meals and batching cocktails. No one seemed to have any issues.

Everything was going smoothly until covid cases started to rise. Early November, I spoke with my sister and she agreed that testing should be required to officially come on this trip. I sent out an email with the request and 7/10 bridesmaids agreed. Three were scarily concerned about the costs and testing positive and wanted to know if they would receive a refund. This was their first and only reactions - giving me HUGE anxiety. Why are you so worried about testing positive??? Not to mentioned, money and my lack of it. Who has the money to just give out refunds for bad decisions?

These are grown (still employed w/ insurance) women. I felt like I was talking to children as I calmly explained that their insurance should cover it and that if they stay within their immediate households, around the holidays, that testing positive shouldn't be a concern. Additionally, I informed them that if they did test positive that they will not receive refunds and that they should consider the trip as a wedding gift.

This reasoning went over well, they apologized (sort of) and I was told that they would be avoiding family/friends over the holidays. Oh! Except one girl also went on to tell my sister that she was ""totally cool with getting tested but doesn't feel comfortable sharing her medical records""...wha?!?

Needless to say, a simple request like this one should have been taking in stride with little fuss. As a result, I have become paranoid again. Testing only covers a certain amount of time with a few days leading up to the Bachelorette left up to chance.

Fast-forward to this week, my paranoia is at an all time high. The same girl who didn't want to share physical test results was exposed while attending a friend of the family's holiday party and has decided it is best not to come.

While her decision is one I agree with, I cannot stop stressing about what the other girls may or may not be doing. The state we are in and the state the cabin is located are two of the fasts growing rates of infections in the South.

These are my sister's friends. I know a few well but not enough to rationalize the fears away. One girl's entire immediate family (including her) was infected with the virus around Thanksgiving.

So here we are, days away from Christmas and a week away from the bachelorette. My sister and her fiancée arrive tomorrow to spend the holiday with myself and our parents - they have kept to themselves and have tested negative.

My sister believes in science, she wears a mask, she avoids gatherings but as the rates rise she doesn't seem concerned. Meanwhile, I feel like I'm crumbling on the inside, slowly. Maybe I'm being irrational and just need to keep breathing. Everything will be fine, right?

I've even asked to spend 4-5 days at my sister's home afterwards to avoid risking infecting my parents. Without a beat she says yes but without anymore discussion.

I'm going back and forth in my mind about what to do, what to say. I reached out the the rental early this month to inquire if we could reschedule due to an act of God: travel restrictions, shutdowns, etc. Though, I feel if I reached out again and just said we we're wary of going on that the renter would still allow us to reschedule.

My sister is one who shuts down (crying, running off, extreme attitude, etc.) at the smallest sign of conflict which isn't helping with my decision making. She's already been vocal about how she hasn't had any fun planning this wedding. A real head scratcher as she has decided to go through with a wedding during a global pandemic.

My bf and friends tell me I have a choice, that I don't have to go but I don't feel that way. Like I said, I'm catering the trip. Who's going to be living in the kitchen/bar if not I?

My parents? Well, they don't know what to say. They just listen to me vent, ramble and just stare at me. ""I dunno"" is the common response.

The personal crowd sourcing I've done tell me to talk to her sooner rather than later but I am extremely worries about ruining the holiday and the trip. That I may just be overthinking this entire thing. They're all going to be tested. They are all going to be responsible. On the other hand, we're doing the one thing proven to spread the virus...

111,"Every Xmas there’s some sort of drama or issue. Always because of my brother and his OCD and autism. Thsi year was great. He didn’t speak to my dad for a year and today he wanted to see him. He hugged him (which never happened even when he did speak to him) and he talked to him a lot without arguing. We visiting my gran and it was great. No drama. Nothing went wrong. It was so fucking peaceful.

We got home and it was nice again. Peaceful again. But now, I’m the middle of the night my brothers compulsions are getting bad. My mum is exhausted and isn’t helping him right which makes it worse and now he’s crying and she’s fighting back the tears. All I can, as usual, is sit and listen and wait for it to end. Idk when it will end. It can last anything from 20 minutes to 4 hours or more. 

I thought this was the one. After weeks of no huge fights and after such a great day I thought that maybe this Xmas would be great. Ironic Ik because of covid but we were happy as a family and I loved it. I didn’t care about the rest of the world I just cared about that moment when we were happy and I never wanted it to end. But it did. And now that it’s bad tonight chances are tomorrow will be worse since it’s Xmas eve. And then Xmas day will not be any easier. 

I wish I didn’t exist. I hate seeing my family suffer and hurt eachother. I hate being hurt by it too. I finally stopped having nightmares of the constant fights. Was having less panic attacks anytime I heard muffled voices because I assumed it was my brother screaming but now I’m afraid it’ll all come back again. I don’t want it to come back. I didn’t sleep right for weeks because of the fights and nightmares. It’s unbearable. 

And on top of that I have to deal with stress from being behind on school essays, the fact that I probably won’t get to uni due to grades and also the stress with my own health issues. Every now and then I can get random bursts of pain that require me to go straight to the ER incase I need surgery.

112,"So my brother has been dating a girl for over a year now and I've only talked to her a few times. I'm super super shy and they both know that so when she comes over I usually hide out in my room.

The few times I did interact with her were just brief hellos. I don't really speak much the few times I've had dinner with her and my brother and just look down at my plate/phone.

I'm thinking of sending a Christmas card to her along with a gift I bought for her and writing a brief note in the card along the lines of something like:

""Hey, I know we haven't interacted much but I just want to thank you for being a wonderful person and for making my brother really happy. You're always so kind to our parents, and I've noticed the way you easily make him laugh and how the mention of your name always brightens up his face. I hope you have an amazing Christmas and hopefully we can get to know each other more :)

Happy holidays! 

-my name""

I'm 19 and my brother and his gf are both 23. I feel like this might be awkward/cringe or overkill and I'm not sure if I should scrap it and just go with a stereotypical Christmas card. I haven't talked to her much even though they've been dating for over a year and I don't mean to be rude, I just have really bad social anxiety. I haven't even interacted much with his friends that he has known since high school. Either way I hope she knows that her presence is appreciated and that I don't hate her or try to ignore her everytime she comes over lol.

My so and I have been together almost 3 years, super happy, lived together for 2.5. He’s 26 and I’m 22. He bought a house the week we met. I’ve spent the last few years in school and getting settled into a career—finally secured my dream job a few weeks ago.

We both want new cars before we get married, just as a preference. Please don’t tell me you think this is a bad idea.....I hear it often.

I’m having a hard time. Even though we have a plan and I like the plan and we’re sticking to it, it’s hard to see all of your friends get engaged, pregnant, and married right around Christmas. I’m feeling jealousy and kind of blue, and it’s really messing up my Christmas spirit this year.

This year I’ve really tried to reach out and try to make new relationships with people but it’s just like every time I do they disappoint... and I realize they’re replaceable. So I’m worried that maybe I’ve either developed a habit of pushing people away at this point, or people are just really shite, oh man maybe both?

I’ve had two relationships this year, and can’t tell if it’s me, or I’ve just put up a wall... the first relationship was definitely questionable but this one has been great but I’m still not feeling it, there’s no connection there... I think? Unless I have my walls up still, because of previous experiences.

I guess how do you tell if you have walls up? Also how do you work through them with someone who meets all of your ideals but that you yourself can’t be into them? He’s perfect when it comes to the same goals, laid back, good sex(definitely sexually attracted to him), and want the same things in life. 

Although I’m getting warnings in my head like ooo this could be sketchy, there’s something wrong here...he’s shown a few warning signs that my ex’s have had in the beginning but somehow he just quickly covers them up, and I wonder if I’m just imagining them because of those walls.

He seems to get a tad bit self conscious when it comes to other guys talking to me on social media but he seems to be slowly getting accustomed to it. (I do have a lot of guy friends, so I could see why he maybe worried if he has had bad experiences in the past, but I’ve never known his exes to cheat) he’s never asked me to quit talking to them, however has said he “feels bad about himself that day”

He talks about his exes a lot.

He seems to throw a bit of a pity party if we can’t hang out like “oh my day was so good until I realized you had to stay late for work” I can’t tell if that’s like sweet or not. Idk.

He also seems to always joke around saying “oh you’re gonna buy me that?” I’m like no. I have a handicapped mother, and my own bills to pay. I may make quite a bit more than him, but my bills/helping out my mom are also a factor and to be honest paying rent for two puts me in the same position as him, I’ve tried explaining but not sure if he understands that or not. (Don’t get me wrong I do get him gifts, or will buy us dinner, I try to do 50/50 as much as I can) 

It’s weird I’ve never been able to not read someone, and this guy is just confusing me.

118,"Title pretty much says it all. This semester would have been my very last one to get my bachelor's and I won't get it because I can't pass the one fucking math class I need to take. I can't even test into the math class I need to take. I got in on a fluke because of COVID and was STOKED because the thing I struggle most with is the exams.

I was doing \*SO\* good on the assignments. Averaging 80-90% (because we had to score that high, or we failed the assignment) but \*could not fucking pass the exams.\* And, of course, not passing the 3 exams meant zero possibility of passing the class. I spent \*eighteen (18) hours\* on one of them and \*still failed.\* So it's not like I'm not putting in the effort here. 

I had such a bad emotional breakdown I had to beg the professor to withdraw me because I started had an emotional breakdown over the fucking class and had to start taking medication again. It was literally medically recommended I drop this stupid \*COLLEGE ALGEBRA\* class. 

I get accommodations for a longer test time, but that's all the school will give me. \*EIGHTEEN FUCKING HOURS GUYS! ON ONE EXAM!\*  I didn't stop to eat, drink, go to the bathroom, nothing. I sat on my bed (online class) and did every single math thing I know how to do to try to come up with an answer that looked right. And still only got a 37%.

I'm on my 4th year of college, and my 13th year of school in total (missed a few years due to ""home school"", but graduated high school in like 2ish years) and Math has never not been an issue for me. 

Don't tell me: ""talk to the professor"", ""study extra hours"", ""get a tutor"", ""it's all just memorization"", etc because \*I have done all of that in the past 13 years, I promise.\* It doesn't help. It just doesn't. I graduated top 10% of my class and couldn't even get the scholarship because I couldn't place high enough on the fucking \*placement\* exam. It caused me so much stress I went into premature labor \*twice.\*

I'm ready to give up. I would have had my bachelor degree this semester if I could have passed this class. I cannot commit it to memory. I've even gone so far as to start seeing a neurologist in case I have something wrong with my brain.",24Dec2020,1
119,"There are a million things that led my life to be how it is so I'll do my best to summarize.

1. my mom was not ready to be a parent. It wasn't her fault she is how she is but it's still the truth. It's my job to make her not sad and make sure she doesn't get mad and to help her not feel insecure and take all the mean things she says and her aggression with a smile and comfort her because if I don't, I don't know what will happen and I don't want to know.
2. That led me to overcompensate by talking. It kept and keeps her distracted. Because if I'm talking she's not thinking and she's not sad or mad and then she won't say or do things that make me sad. I don't want to talk. I have nothing I want to say. If it was an option I would never talk. That's why I love being alone because I don't have to.
3. That overcompensation led to a number of other problems that kinda ruined my life. 
4. I've only ever been able to be myself a couple of times when I was away from family and it was amazing. 
5. My mom and dad have problems and for years my dad has been trying to find a way to move away. He says we'll leave and go somewhere soon. He's been saying that for three years.
6. There are other things but I don't want to talk about them because they make me sad so I'll leave that summary as it is.

120,So I (M15) spent the night at one of my family members friends houses and there was not enough room for me to sleep on an extra bed or couch by myself so I ended up sleeping in the bed with her friend. Now her friend is a man and is at least 30. Here’s what happened to me. I woke up in the middle of the night to him touching my penis and I don’t want to confront him because I wasn’t  sure whether I was dreaming or if he was actually touching me. The friend does not seem like the type of person to do this because they have known me since I was a baby and should have no reason to try and sexually assault me if they’ve known me for this long and I am also older and can fight back for myself. I’m not sure what to do because I’m not sure if I was dreaming about the sensation of being touched down there but it felt pretty real. Also I could not see anything because it was pitch black.

121,"I'm going to start by saying, I am not the person to ask when it comes to the world wars, so if i say something stupid (which is probably this whole fucking post), then correct me. 

My friend idolizes Nazis and i don't know why. How do i know this? Well, he hangs a big ass swastika in his room, he hates Jewish people (he flat out told me this), he says that Nazi speeches are beautiful, and when he was drunk (i think) he explained how he thinks that in his past life he was a German soldier, and he died fighting soviets or some shit. 

I'm genuinely confused for why he takes the Nazis side. Its completely fine to have an interest in Nazis and Germany during that time, but when you say shit like ""i hate Jews"" unironically, it becomes concerning. Hes also Mexican if that's important.

I'm just wondering why would someone have those kind of beliefs? Should i distance myself from him? Feel free to enlighten me on this subject.",24Dec2020,1

123,"Hey everyone. I (19m), have been talking to a classmate of mine (19f) for about 3 weeks or so. I hate to admit it, but I've been pretty lonely and out of touch of my emotions for a fair while, so when an attractive girl from one of my college classes demonstrated interest and messaged me, I was naturally pretty curious. Over the last 3 weeks, her and I have grown pretty close- I love her sense of humor, she's intelligent, very good-looking, knows how to make me laugh, but is also in touch with serious issues I also find important. All in all, things have been going pretty well and we clearly both want to have a relationship with each other, once we're both back to school after winter break is over. We occasionally have more serious conversations which lead me to think that she's actually looking for a relationship with me, so I don't really want to pass up on this with her. 

We were talking like usual earlier today, when the subject matter turned a little more risqué, and we started talking about our sexual pasts. Now, please don't turn this into a debate of toxic masculinity or not- I absolutely support a woman's decision to participate in sexual activity, and it's her body, her choice. She told me that she had an experienced sexual past, and, that also being the case for me, I showed compassion and we talked a little more about that.

Here, in my opinion, things took a turn for the worse. She mentioned that she had been invited to an orgy next year, and for me, that seemed a little out of line. The participants of said activity were apparently her several closest friends from her home state. I asked what her sexuality was, since it never came up before, and she told me she was straight. So, this means that every single person in said orgy would most likely be male, and there would be many of them.

At that point, I grew a little queasy. The idea of a woman doing something like this, I have no problem with- like I said, her body, her choice. But for me, I just can't be comfortable with that. I already have strong feelings for this girl, and I'm absolutely interested in having a romantic relationship with her, especially because I need the emotional stability and affection it would bring. That's been missing for me for a while. The idea of other many other men having sex with her at the same time, with me most likely not being present, repulses me. I still like her, but I have no clue what to do. She seemed to be really interested in the idea, and when I asked her if she planned on participating, she said it would most likely happen.

What should I do? I don't know if I want to cut her off, because things have been going good, but what she wants to do goes against all my morals and I would feel as though that special bond between us had been violated if she went through with this.",24Dec2020,1

126,"Today I finally got my Bachelors degree in History delivered to me. I went to show my mother and while she was happy that her son attained an education she said something like “you could have gotten a masters degree too but you chose not to” this struck such a nerve because I see the struggles that many young people face nowadays getting out of college and not being able to find a job while being thousands of dollars in debt. I’m blessed to have a family with money that was able to pay for my education but sadly my history degree is worthless and I am unable to get a job. When I applied to college I chose to major in something that I loved something that I was good at and has a passion in but sadly like many other grads who didn’t go down the path of engineering , law , medicine or science I’m stuck not being able to do anything in my field of study. Taking all this into consideration i chose to become a police officer and will be applying for the academy sometime around next year. It may not be in any way related to my studies but it’s a damn good career with plenty of perks and benefits and since I am educated they give a pay bonus for individuals that have completed higher education. Going back to what my mother said I felt it was a real low blow to me . What am I supposed to do ? Waste more of my time writing papers , taking tests and being barley conscious at those god awful boring lectures just to get another piece of paper with my name on it which again won’t guarantee me any kind of job. I’m so sick of her saying that I think it’s more for her to show off to others that her son has a masters and that he’s so smart. I found my calling in life and doing my damn hardest to get hired 👮🏻‍♂️.

127,"I’ve lived with the same group of girls for two years now. We’re seniors in college and all four of us are in the same major. We’ve become very very close and in the apartment we lived in last year, there was never any drama to speak of. However, this year has felt different. We were all separated during the first few months of quarantine, but moved into a new place together in August. From the beginning something was off. We haven’t been spending as much time together, we’ve had more minor conflicts involving housekeeping, general roommate etiquette, etc. But apparently one of my roommates, arguably the one that I am closest with (let’s call her K), has been upset with me since October. It’s a really long story, so I won’t get into ALL of it here (if you need more details, I can make an update) but basically, everyone that I’ve talked to has agreed that I’m not in the wrong and that she’s being childish. To be honest, her lack of emotional maturity has become a lot more evident the longer we’ve been friends, and it’s really coming to a head in this situation. She grew up rich and completely babied by her parents, and as a result, she has a difficult time handling the cruel truths of the world (in this case, the truth is that she is not always entitled to an apology just because she’s upset). The real kicker is that she hasn’t said a single word to me that would insinuate that she’s pissed. She’s been acting like everything is completely fine. The only reason I know is because one of my other roommates (we’ll call her B) told me. According to her, K is so upset with me that she wants to end our friendship and break our lease to move in with her (toxic and unbearably clingy) girlfriend. If she’s this upset, why won’t she bring it up with me? Just knowing about this whole situation has made me super mad also, but I know that if we are to resolve this issue, we have to talk about it. According to B, I need to be the one to initiate the conversation, since K clearly has no intention of doing it herself, but I’m not the one with the issue? I’m just trying to figure out the best way to go about starting this conversation without giving her an easy way out of talking about what’s bothering her and confronting her problems. I want us to work things out and I don’t want to put her on the spot or make her too nervous to talk to me, but if I don’t approach her, she’s going to continue to stew about something that is so beyond petty, not to mention, completely out of my control (again, I can provide details about the situation if needed).

133,"Ive been doing it since birth, first it was my whole family but then my dad passed so it was just me and her sharing a bed, i was 5. My brother shared a room with my grandma and got his own floor mattress at about 12/13. 

I have an anxiety disorder so up till 13 i couldnt fall sleep by myself. But it got better after that. Ive had my own blanket since before puberty, i hit it in mid 13. I never had a privacy issue because my mom was rarely in the room.

We are fully clothed, underwear and outerwear. She occasionally changes her shirt or pants infront of me, turning the other way. But one piece of clothing is always on, like if she is changing her pants, her shirt is on vice versa. And always undergarments.

Its not particualrly weird as its almost the same as a bikini at the beach plus i never look wtf. I never change infront of her though. We are always in the room at seperate times so i have time for all my businesses. We also have seperate closets.

So it was never a privacy issue cause it was almost like my room, cause she was rarely there exept at bed time. In which the only problem is that she knows if i am on my phone and not sleeping. Nothing ever sexual, i am mostly sexually attracted to men actually.

This year i realised that it is weird so i made an excuse to get a floor mattress. Its not as comfortable but it is fine i guess. I live in a 3 bedroom house and the third bedroom is a study/storage room. There is barely space for a bed and there isnt any air conditioning, i live in a hot country.

Should i make more of a change? Its awkward to bring up me wanting to share a room with my brother cause it makes it seem like im having sexual feelings which i dont. We might be moving next year so fingers crossed. But should i make more of an effort to share with my brother if i am fine sharing with my mom as i have all the privacy i could baseline need?",24Dec2020,1
134,"Sorry I'm gonna swear because I feel angry, sad and very scared.

Most of these quotes are going to be inaccurate because this happened hours ago.

So I play roblox, it's one of my favorite games to play if not the only game I play. My friend shows me a game called ""Clear Skies Over Milwaukee"". She wants to show me this game to let me know what kind of hate she gets for being a furry. We play the game and after a lot of  hate, this person shows up. Their roleplay name said ""MJ"" or whatever. They first say ""I'm going to hang myself."" after a few minutes of silence they fucking say this and THANK GOD most of it was tagged, ""i want to 48ck u ## ####### ####"".

They private chatted me ""idc"" followed by ""let me 48ck that ti### #####"" and I know what they meant even with those tags and- idek what to say to that. I first thought of this as ""is this a fucking joke?"" But after I just realized what happened I felt like I was gonna burst out crying, but I had to suck it up and go back to class. After school I tried not to think about it but when I got to my room I had a fucking breakdown. I wanted to tell someone so badly but I was scared, scared somehow- that disgusting creep was going to find out that I told someone and that he would do bad things to me. So I'm hesitating.

I lost a bit of weight recently and she drunkenly told me she was worried about me and that I should be eating at least 4 meals a day.

Part of me thinks she cares but then looking back on the way she worded it made me feel like she’s not genuine. 

She also said once, when I asked her to take a photo with me, that I’ll make her look big bc I’m so skinny and she refused for a sec but then ended up taking it anyway but still.

I'm very handy, and not trying to toot my own horn, pretty intuitive. I can understand and/or figure out how to fix almost anything. The few times I thought otherwise have pretty much led to me not trying anymore. Now the new attention I think I might be getting has been going on for a few weeks, but Monday (40f will call E) told me she didn't mind a guy with a little extra weight as it made her look better naked. And proceeded to tell me she was very confident naked. Also later that day (35-40f will call J) comes back in with my boss (not hers) from smoking and makes a joke that he's old and needs help taking care of the ladies (he makes these jokes all the time and the women love it, flies in the face of my HR training but whatever) anyway J tells me it's ok right now as neither woman can get pregnant. (Other woman is not E) So am I crazy or are they flirting with me. Also I find smoking to be a super hard turn off and both smoke so I find it hard to be interested. However I know I'm ugly and the women actually interested in me are super far apart, so I'm torn on what I should do. I don't want to be alone anymore, but I'm also very aware I'm a one woman man. I will love one with everything I have, and if I lose her I will give up on living. When I was younger I knew this as well and passed up the only other time I know for sure a woman was interested in me because thought I would have other chances. Now I'm afraid to try.

I know she’s already asked 3 other girls from college to be bridesmaids and her sister will be MOH. We have been friends since middle school (10 years) and we’re very close until she went to college and began to distance herself. She would still see me if she was in town but she’s never been good at managing her friend groups (I.e college friends and hometown friends). So I think she might just exclude me because of that. 

It would be disappointing if she didn’t ask me because we would go on trips together, to concerts, she would come to me when she was having family issues and I was always there. I guess once she found more important people I wasn’t needed anymore. I know she’s probably closer with her college friends just because she made me an obligation friend.

And I feel guilty because I'm not even showing with action. My mother is literally too nice, I can't even comprehend how and why she loved us so much. We're from developing country where it's almost impossible to not hit your children and my mom didn't beat us as growing up. She would do anything to feed us, she would come home from work and without even sitting down try to do something for whoever is home so we could eat. I have to tell her not to make me anything multiple times to stop her because I started feeling guilty a while ago. If she just hears me talking about certain food with my siblings she would buy it without even asking us.

She has lot's of back problems from working too hard and she started working when she was so yooung that she didn't even go to school and now I try to take care of everything that has to do with bills, and helping her with papers but other than that I'm useless. Even if she is sick she doesn't care, with all her back pains and other injuries she got from working too young she doesn't care and still does top much and it's all fpr us. 

I know most mothers love their children but even back home when we lived in places where fathers bring the money while mothers take care of children my friends used to tell me they wish their mother cared as much. I was young and never thought about anything back then. 

There are so much things that make me more guilty and sad, so much struggle she went through that it hurts me. And I started to care now when I'm probably going to move out in less than 2 years. 

Anyway My question is what should, an 18 years old male, that has been too lazy and dumb to care for his mother do before it's too late.

169,"Backstory: 
I (21F) dated a guy (21) at the beginning of college, and broke things off after a bit over a year. It was a serious relationship despite everyone pointing out how toxic, manipulative, and controlling he was from the beginning. I didn’t want to lose contact, so we talked occasionally to keep up with each other. He constantly pushed my boundaries during this, and one night he flipped out on me and went batshit crazy, so I told him to never contact me again or I’d call the police. The rest of the semester was a mess of stalking and harassment, breaking into my room and leaving messages, contacting my friends and family, etc. I spoke to the school, and they said I could definitely get a restraining order, but I didn’t want anything on his record and frankly I didn’t have the time or emotional energy to go through all of that during the semester. I’ve kept screenshots and photos as evidence though.

I for some dumb reason gave him another chance after he finally left me alone for a bit and my fear of him started going away. I ended things after a couple months, which was two summers ago. Last fall he assaulted me (which I have no evidence of) and the next morning, he showed up at the house I was sitting, rang the doorbell over and over, and sent me photos of him sitting outside the house. Queue more stalking and harassment, until my current boyfriend told him to fuck off. Even though he hasn’t contacted me for awhile, I still get flashbacks and nightmares, and I still get anxious and paranoid. I really wish I would’ve gotten that restraining order so I could have some peace of mind.

Current shit: 
Tonight on the way to work I didn’t have signal, so I could only listen to my downloaded songs on Spotify, which I found out are only from one of his playlists (I don’t associate many of the songs with him, so it didn’t bother me much). Same thing on the way back 5 hours later, but he changed his Spotify name to what his contact name was in my phone when we were dating, and changed the playlist name to: if u help me finish my “end credits” playlist I’ll ignore your usage of my Spotify playlist(s). The caption is: it’s set to collab btw.

Idk what playlist he’s talking about. But clearly he has been consistently checking what I listen to if he caught it less than 5hr afterwards, meaning he’s still stalking me and hasn’t moved on from that lowlife type shit. I’m tempted to do what he says because it sounds like he’s threatening to harass me again and I seriously don’t have the emotional energy to go through that again. Or maybe I should ignore it and remove the playlist so it doesn’t happen again? But he’ll see that and then know I saw his message and am ignoring him, and ignoring him in the past has set him off. Or maybe I should get a restraining order? But the last bit of stalking evidence I have is over a year old and I feel like it’d be hard to get it now because of that. I just feel trapped again, and I’m honestly seriously afraid of him.",24Dec2020,1

There’s a few reasons why.
1. I just don’t feel the same way for them as I used to. We don’t talk as much and I don’t feel really excited by being around them anymore.
2. I think they like women. I’m a man. They’ve told me they like women more than men. They also get anxious when they’re only around me, not anyone else. They’re way more comfortable around women. Also, when they’re on the phone with me at their friends house they kinda treat me like shit.
3. This is the reason I feel the most guilty for. They identify as non-binary/man. Please trust me when I say there’s nothing wrong with that!! I’d be friends with anyone no matter who they are. Dating them makes me feel uncomfortable because I’m heterosexual.

Long post on mobile and it’s A LOT so the timeline may be messed up but I’ll try to make it make sense. 

My (19F) father and biological mother (B) got divorced when I was 3 ish. They were both addicted to meth and I later found out that my dad got my mother on it. There was an ongoing custody battle between him and my B’s parents who just wanted to keep me in their lives. There was lots of lying and manipulation about them being terrible people by my dad to me and I was young so I basically believed what I was told but I always loved them and pretended I didn’t because it upset my dad. I’m pretty sure there was equal lying on their part too. I was just stuck in the middle. During this time My dad dated another woman (L) who helped fight the battle and didn’t know he was on drugs and at the time my bio mother was hooked on heroin. L was great and became a mother figure once I stopped seeing B and that whole family. I was forced to decide who I wanted to be around and was basically told by my dad and L that I didn’t love them because I wanted to see my mother and family. So I told them I didn’t want to see them anymore. I was in 3rd grade at this time. Fast forward to 5th grade, my dad and L are breaking up. She read my diary and things became nasty surrounding me and the last time I saw her she refused to hug me and embarrassed me in front of her mom who I loved very much by accusing me of lying to her about going on a vacation when my dad told me to lie to her about it. That was the last time I saw her mother and she died a year later. I still miss her and it upsets me that the last time I saw her was under those circumstances. 

A couple months later during the summer before 6th grade my dad starts dating another woman (S). She is amazing and they quickly move in together and get married my 7th grade year. We move to another town in 8th grade. Things were amazing and normal and she was my new mother figure and I didn’t see L at all. Then the summer before my sophomore year of high school my dad starts using meth again and cheats on S. He threatens her and is full blown in addiction. She moves out and a week after she moves out when we were staying with her parents I go back to the house to see my dad when he comes home from a “work trip”. He calls me before he gets home and asks me if I’d like to meet his new girlfriend K. 

Some backstory: we had gone on a family vacation the beginning of august everything seemingly fine, the day we get back my dad says they might get divorced, a day later goes on “work trip”, a couple days later me and S stay with her parents, then he comes back a few days before I start school with his K. 

SO I meet her, am very confused, there is now weird people around a lot. My dad let an older friend of his who just got out of prison live on our property and he was just weird and sketchy. A couple months later S informs me my dad is using drugs and that that is why all of this has happened. (There’s A LOT more details but it’s a lot of fucking stuff) in October when K is living with him and her son who is 14 moves in. (She has 4 kids with 3 different men and doesn’t have legal custody of any of them, she would also constantly tell me about her and my fathers sex life and stories of her when she was a prostitute). Beginning of November I move out and in with S. She was very supportive and created a safe home for me to finish high school and I lived with her the rest of high school. K’s son who lived with her and my dad got taken away by DHS because he was left alone in the house for 2 weeks with no food. Shit was constantly crazy. I would stay with my dad sometimes until the end of junior year when it got too much. I would find broken meth pipes and needles and empty baggies. I once saw a container of meth on the counter and asked him if he was gonna take it and he blamed it on K. The next morning I searched for it and found it empty on the floor and he was gone. He once got aggressive with S which caused me to break down in front of them. 

He never did a good job of apologizing and still doesn’t. I’m in college now but am taking next semester off because all of this and not dealing with it has caught up with me. He is now seemingly clean. Also my junior year of high school I started seeing B and family AND L that read my diary. So all of my mother figures were in my life again. B has been clean for about 7 months now and I can finally see my half brother. 

So things are alright. I have a kind of boyfriend who I love but we avoid labels because they cause pressure. (We were together but broke up because we both have mental health and childhood issues but are basically back together now, not important though) I also have a good full time job and am looking to move to Colorado next summer if I can get the courage to tell my family. 

Now though I struggle with whether I want to see my dad and his family because of how they enabled and defended him to me. And now S is talking to him again and kind of telling me to heal faster. She also isn’t very supportive of what I want to do with my life and I’m just so tired of living for everyone else. As a kid I lived to make sure the ones around me and my parents knew that I loved them and did everything to make them happy. I’m so tired of it. But I’m so afraid of hurting people and them leaving. Especially S. I love her so much and she’s done so much for me and it’s paralyzing that I feel like I can’t do what I want to do. My dad and her talk now and I worry that he will manipulate her against me or convince her that I need to be told to talk to him again. 

The confusing thing is, I miss my dad. I always thought he was a great dad until I got older and I love him so much. But he’s caused me so much pain and his apologies always boil down to him telling me to stop living in the past. I’m so tired of everyone and I’m tired of my whole life having been insane. I just want to move to Colorado and start a new life with new people and away from the state that has contained so much pain for me. It’s just that S doesn’t support that and thinks I’m just running away. 

I don’t even know what I need advice on honestly. Maybe I just needed to rant. Or to feel listened to. I’m sorry this is so long. Thank you if you’ve made it to this point.",24Dec2020,1

I've always loved christmas, is one of my favourites times of the year, but at the same time one of the most sad too :(

The thing is that I could never celebrate it with my whole family (grandmas, grandads, uncles, etc) because my mom and dad's family never got along very well (and i dont really think they will), we've always have to travelled if we wanted to celebrate with all the family too, because they dont live in the same city as us, and everytime we travelled my mom celebrated with my sister at her family's house, same with dad and me, we celebrated with my dad's family, this year we cant travel due to covid, so we r gonna stay here in home, my mom and dad are not in the best situation of their relationship, but at least they r making all their effort to have the best christmas possible, like decorating the house or buying some presents to all, etc, and i really appreciate that!

182,"So its been 2 1/2 days and my kitten has been throwing up aggressively, the vomit started out clear and then changed to pink after the 1st day, then clear that evening and the next day, and today her vomit is pink again. She vomits almost every 30mins-1hr. 

She is about 7 months old, just a kitten with no known health conditions. She has not been introduced to a new environment or anything which would have caused her any stress. No new pet has been introduced and her food has not been changed. 

She hasn’t eaten anything the last day but she has been drinking, though very little. Which is incredibly worrisome. :( 

I have taken her to 3 vets already. One took an x-ray and saw nothing, the others suggested doing several other tests (blood test, surgery investigation, another x-ray) all of which are hundreds of dollars and which we decided not to go with when they were offered. 

I just don’t know what to do for her now, the only thing is running all those tests, and besides the cost, most places are closed due to the holidays. Anyone with advise or possible reasons for why my baby is throwing up so much, please please reply.",24Dec2020,1

I’m a 20 something year old college basketball retiree working a warehouse job trying to get my money up. I live with my girlfriend that has a pretty cool job involving weed. She’s pretty cool for the most part, but she is crazy. Crazy.

She once called the married man her mom was having an affair with and said “stop fucking my mother you have a wife” and even threatened to tell said wife.

Crazy

She once put an entire thing of nair into a cheating ex girlfriend of her father’s, which the girlfriend then used.

C was angry that R had taken their rant out of context and made them look bad. C's SO, T, had been given screen-shots of these rants. Apparently, C had dissed T's lack of response/ not being there for them when they needed it. T, however, by all accounts, was there quite often for C. R made a huge deal out of everything, but C was more silent about it. R ended up blocking C, sending an extremely hateful goodbye message. And by extremely hateful, I mean it. They carelessly referenced C's past traumas and hurled out some really vile insults. C accused R of turning T and another friend against them. I believed it. They made it look like R made T break up with them. T briefly referenced that they broke up with C because T knew that C ""loved someone else"". C seemed extremely devastated that T broke up with them, so i didn't take what T said seriously. C has been really nice to my friend group and I, so I was really cemented on my stance, at first. However, C confirmed what T had said (that C was in love with somebody else), and even started flirting with them. This left a bad taste in my mouth.

I had to be air-evac’d to a city for treatment and had to go through treatment and tests for a few months, and in November I finally got the settlement. In the settlement letter, it stated that my insurance would be reimbursed for what they had to pay at the time, and the majority of the settlement went to paying them off while the rest was given to me. Today (Dec. 23rd), I got a subrogation letter from equian asking for me to contact them. I’m confused as to why I got this, considering in the settlement letter, it clearly stated that my medical insurance was to be reimbursed completely, and that all medical bills were received which is why I was able to get the letter in the first place. 

I’ve got two questions. First, is it normal to receive a subrogation letter, and second, am I liable for anything if in the letter, it stated that my insurance was to be completely reimbursed?

Therefore, I've recently decided to take action and I've identified three resources to guide my journey, the first of which is reaching out to a psychologist to help better understand my particular situation. Hopefully this will help diagnose and weed out the specific causes of my anxiety and provide a professional treatment for my case: a sort of targeted approach. However, as someone who loves to learn, I don't want to simply be ""treated and cured"", I want to be a part of my own growth; so, the other two resources I've set for myself are:

1. Reading one book per month about psychology/mental health from a scientific perspective. ( more comprehensive, but less applicable)  

2. Listening to one psychology or wellness podcast per week from a lifestyle perspective. (less comprehensive, more applicable)

She started putting boundaries between us, like less showing affection through words and actions.

While it may sound lovely, it’s concerning to me, as I discovered he has a prior history of trying to engage young men in sexual contact with him. I happen to fall in the young male category and for that reason created an anonymous profile to post here. 

With the pandemic situation going on, I have been seeking a new job and have been avoiding going into the office after my discovery of bossman’s past (took a min to find out - he uses an alias). Been working from home and haven’t seen the man since June. I make it abundantly clear that I am not interested in anything other than work and do my best to keep the work environment professional. 

But this years display of christmas gifts was absolutely insane. I mean waaaaaay over the top. It was six trips back and forth from the car to get all the stuff in the house. It must have taken him several hours to wrap all of this stuff, and god knows how long to pick out and purchase it.

I am somewhat of a minimalist and will be donating 99% of this, and also just don’t want to  look at it to be reminded of this man’s probable ulterior motives. I feel anxious and a bit threatened by this seemingly predatory behavior that goes along with his prior narrative as a sex offender, and I don’t quite know what to do, as I’d prefer to not bring up giant elephant in the room being the fact that I know he has a criminal history. How would you handle this if you were in this situation?

TL;DR: Boss is a sex offender and is trying to court me with excessive amounts of gifts and makes me feel uncomfortable. Don’t wanna bring up the fact that I found out who he really is and struggling to find a new gig. What do now ?",24Dec2020,1
222,"So I'm 15 (F). After I got out of the mental hospital for suicidal ideation/depression and CPTSD, my mother took all the money out of my bank account. She told me CPS suggested it, and that I could earn it back by cleaning my room and doing all my laundry. I told her it felt like she was punishing me for being depressed, and she basically deflected, telling me CPS wanted it, and so did I...?

So I did that. I cleaned and rearranged my entire room and bathroom in 2 days, as well as finishing and folding/hanging up all my laundry. I'm also on antidepressants and just don't feel good LMAO. I've sent her a text asking about it, which she has been ignoring for the past week. I then sent a message in our family group chat, and neither of my parents have responded.

Basically, my mother was advised to stay away from me since she triggers my PTSD (and so does my step-dad), but she's completely avoiding me. Neither of my parents like me, and it's so obvious they're just tolerating me. Neither of them seem to care I'm struggling with mental illness. They're both still in denial that they've abused me, as well.

What do I do? I seriously don't want to confront them in person. My mother low-key has a victim mentality, and she's stressed because of work, and my step-dad is extremely condescending. Just having to interact with them triggers me.

I honestly want to ignore them and tell them, ""I see no reason for communication when neither of you are willing to answer a simple question. I did what you wanted, yet my share of the deal goes unfulfilled."" But I know, it's their house, their money, etc. etc. I'm just so sick of their bullshit.",24Dec2020,1

225,"Heyy! This is a pretty long story, but at the bottom there’s the questions im hoping someone can help me answer. My friends are great and supportive ppl but they suck at giving advice so yeah-

Things have been pretty- interesting lately and im sorta hoping for some advice. For some backstory, lets just say we have: me, J (him), N (a close friend of mine).

Basically im 14m and since im gay, it’s kinda hard to find people in my area (also not to mention the fact that there is not one datable guy that ik irl). I talked to my really close friend N about it (N is bi and i came out to her so yeah) and i suggested that N looked on r/LGBTeensgonemild bc idk why not. So after about a day, N comes back to me w this one guy (J, 14m) and she shows me a couple of photos of him. Btw, he’s like REALLY HOT ASLFKJDSLKF. Anyway so I had N reach out to him and then she gave him my insta and gave me his insta. Oh btw before someone comes after me we were able to verify that we were both yk, kids. We basically verified the fact that we were both real and whatever- so that was nice (and safe alskdfj).

Anyway so I added him and we started talking a bit. Tbh, it was a bit slow at first although he was really nice (AND REALLY HOT) so it progressively got better. Also there is a time difference of 3 hours for each of us, so yeah. We kept talking more, and it was honestly super easy to talk to him. We added eachother on insta around like 4pm (in my time zone), so by the time it was 8pm for me he had to go.

So the next day we started texting more, and we mostly just spilt tea and whatever (just told each other ab whatever interesting thing was going on, yk). We still hadn’t gone on ft or anything but i started to get feelings for him.

Anyway on the third day (it was really more like night, just bc that was the best time for us to talk w time zones and everything) I decided to add him to a ft that i was on w one of my other close friends (T). Btw T is irrelevant in this story, but you get the point. So we added him and it was- bland? I mean it was sorta awkward, mostly bc T is kinda antisocial (oh also T is bi as well so she was cool w it). 

Anyway she ended up leaving after 10 mins and we were able to ft along, and OMG LSDKFJDSJLFK IT WAS AMAZING. We connected super easily, and things were going so great it was honestly amazing. We just talked for HOURS and it was (again) super easy to talk to him. The difference this time was that we were actually like- talking. It was so incredible i honestly cant describe it. Anyway i literally fell for a guy after talking to him for 3 days. By the end of the ft that night, it went from talking or whatever to literally sending hearts, saying ily, and calling eachother names and stuff-

So the fourth day, we had hopped on ft earlier in the day (11am for me, 2pm for him) and we talked ab a bunch of different stuff. Idk i mean i could go on and list the stuff we talked ab but regardless every conversation i had w him was just so meaningful. At about 2pm i left to go do a socially distanced meetup with my friends (it was actually social distanced w masks, we take heavier precautions then most other ppl we know). Anyway they showed up an hour late but he ft’d me anyway while i was waiting.

Afterwards we sorta intermittently texted until i got back home. I also took a few photos and was feeling confidant-ish so i posted them to this second acc i have (its like a spam, except i dont spam on it but rather post actual posts bc im not out and idk id rather only post for like the 5 friends i have). So i posted it and he goes all out w hyping me up. It was so nice alsdkfjasdlfjk he was sending all these really meaningful things and idk it meant a lot. Then I saw and he posted AN APPRECIATION POST FOR ME ON HIS SECOND SLDKFJSDLFJK. It was so incredible i cant- anyway so that was really great and i was feeling amazing ab it all. 

I took a shower and had dinner, then i came back to ft him and it was just as amazing as the third night. We ended up doing homework together and it was so so special, and idk we talked more it was just amazing. 

Then the next day came and i had gone out to meet w my friends again. Keep in mind, we hadn’t ever established a “formal” relationship, but it was def past the talking stage. After we got off (it was like 2am for him) i went to go brush my teeth but then he hopped back on ft. In a summarized version, he let me know that he was having some anxiety ab the whole thing and he wanted to take it more slowly. I listened and let him know that it was totally okay, and that i wanted to respect his boundaries completely. I really tried to be considerate and everything because i really do care. Anyway i let him know that it would be okay and i promised to make sure i wouldnt overstep it. 

(Mental health isnt a joke btw and if ur ever struggling please call 1-877-726-4727 bc they offer help)

Anyway the next day I woke up and had school to do (fun, ik). So he texted me about halfway through my schoolwork and just clarified about it. He told me that he was a bit anxious with titles (aka things like baby, cutie, etc) but he told me he’d probably get over it by that night. I was happy, but also wanted to make sure i respected his mental health and whatnot. I let him know that we would take as long as he needed until he felt comfortable. I really tried to stress the fact that i wanted to make sure he felt comfortable with it. He let me know that i was helping with it, so i was at least glad to see that my efforts to be respectful with it were actually working (i take it really seriously).

Later that day I was busy, so I wasnt able to ft until later, although he messaged me every 20 mins or so asking if i was available (its the little things tbh). Anyway we hopped on ft and-

Well heres where things really happen. We get on the call and he just sorta has like a panic attack and starts crying and everything bc his anxiety was getting to him. He let me know that it was getting worse, and that it was just difficult for him. It gets to the point where he’d rather text me bc he was just having a hard time talking and stuff. So i put the main one down below but yeah:

“i mean it’s just like i don’t wanna break ur heart and tell u we could never rly be in a relationship but i think that’s the truth. but just more like rly rly close friends. Yk?”

I let him know that i didnt really fully understand, so he just let me know that he was having all this anxiety about being in a relationship and all. The thing was that he let me know that he thought i was cute, and that he wanted to be in a relationship with me, but he was just having a hard time with his anxiety and everything and he just didnt know for sure. He also let me knew that he felt so bad about it and everything its just that he was going through a lot. I was there and i was supportive. I didnt push anything and i respected his boundaries in full. Anyway the next day he texted me again:  
“idk i just feel like i’m scared that u think we are gonna date in the future bc idk if it will happen :/ like its not you. Its just that this happens”

I just asked him if us being together in the future would be an option and he responded with:

“i honestly don’t know cuz imma probably not gonna look for a relationship rn. i think what i need to do is focus on myself, my mental health and stuff. im so sorry”

I let him know that it was okay and that i wanted to make sure he was okay and that it was better for him to be comfortable with everything.

He then let me know, “we can be friends i just don’t wanna be super close and talk 24/7”

That was really hard for me to take in, just becuase i really really was into him and idk it was just so crushing. Anyway our interactions have been much more short and spaced out (obv) but the thing was that he was also sorta sending mixed signals. He kept archiving and unarchiving that one appreciation post he made for me, and some of the texts he sent me were kinda flirty. Tbh idk. At this point, I wanna be with him so badly and i just cant describe it. I would use the word euphoric but idk the tv show is the only thing associated w it at this point.

Now:  
1- Is there a way to cure his anxiety? Can we? And if so, how?

2- will i be able to be in a relationship w him? Or is it already over :/

3- idk someone pls give advice bc ive really fallen for him and ill spend however long it takes and do whatever it takes to be with him.

Also sorry if this is really long alsdkfjas i tried my best to make it short.",24Dec2020,1

So uhh I'm no stranger to sneaky links, like someone would always pick me up or Uber me to their house at like 11 (ikk it's trashy but whatever). Like I don't got a license and umm yea I'm also not allowed to get a card to get an Uber either so 😃 I usually rely on the other person to get me places is the point. But this time they don't got a license either, and he said he'd just take the car but idkk like if we're gonna be honest I'm really not believing this dude and either way it would be much easier to take my titis car (I'm staying with her for a while and her driveways not even close to any rooms so it would be easy ig) but idk like yea I drive around a lot but I always got someone there so I'm just nervous to go by myself and on top of that I'm a TERRIBLE driver like it passes for driving standards here but 💀 I'm still nervous idk what to really do and ik the obvious answer is ""don't risk it"" but idk I'm usually not past this kind of stuff lol so I'm just kinda nervous to do that shit myself.

230,"At a crossroads

Hello! 

I’m a 22 year old living in the Midwest. I’m a police officer in a large metropolitan area as well as in the Army Reserves. Ever since I turned 18, I have worked full time and done nothing else. Now, I am being medically discharged from the Army for a shoulder injury and have been frustrated with my job. I have always wanted to go to college, and on a whim applied to one of the large schools here. I was surprised to be accepted, but then realized I would have to move down to where the school is located and quit my job. 

On one hand, I feel like I shouldn’t go. I’ve been told by everyone that’s important to me in my life that I have a great career ahead of me, that I shouldn’t give that up, and I should try to go to school later if I really wanted to. I make good money and have decent benefits. I could have a pension at 41. 

On the other hand, I really want to go to school. I think it’s smart to have a degree in something that’s not law enforcement, and with my shoulder injury, I feel like I’m going to get myself hurt one day. When that happens and I’m out of a job, I don’t want to have nothing. This also sounds silly, but I also want to have the “college experience” as well. I want to join clubs, meet people, and actually have friends. I have been working since I was 18 and haven’t gotten to “let loose” and have fun if that makes sense. 

I’m so torn and stressed out about making this decision. Everyone is telling me going to college is a bad idea, and my sister said it would be creepy being 22 hanging out with freshmen and such. I feel like no matter which choice I make, I’m going to regret it later. I don’t want to hinge my decision on what they say, but I’m also afraid they have more insight since they’re older than me. I feel like an outsider’s perspective would be very refreshing. I appreciate any advice given. Thank you.",24Dec2020,1

- when she broke up with her on and off boyfriend of a few months she begged my boyfriend to come home and he had to and left me alone when i was having a bad day (she’s 22)
- my dog just had surgery so i’m home a lot to take care of him and for the first time i go to his house and when he asks his family if it’s okay to spend a little time with me and my dog she’s like “well i planned this out” mind you it was a board game and we’d been playing for two hours. i was having a tough time that night because of my dog and being super stressed 
- even though i’m moving and this is the first year my parents are divorced and it’s holiday time she fails to consider how i feel and focuses on just wanting my boyfriend home all the time 
- she complains about my boyfriend spending his money 
- she complains about me spending my money 
- she’s super about social distancing and only going out when required but begs my boyfriend to go get her food all the time and shit and make him pay for it

236,"I’m 19 M and my friend is 19 F. I’ve been smoking weed everyday since I was a sophomore in high school and am just recently starting taking a break for the first time in years and I’m really enjoying being sober.  I just had my first semester of college, and sobriety was something I frequently considered and told myself I needed to start practicing, but I frequently found myself unable to because of my old habits, but also because of being around my friends and their friend group. Specifically, the friend I’d really like to let go. Lets call her D.

D has major substance abuse issues. She can’t do menial tasks without smoking weed first, she got addicted to adderal and then got a prescription for a high mg dosage and vomits every morning when she takes it. She also drinks constantly, smokes cigarettes like they’re full of oxygen, and in general is kind of a cocktail of various substances at any given time.  She has also done painkillers (as have I, but nowhere near to the same extent) until she could barely walk. It makes me uncomfortable because whenever I hangout with her or her friends, all they want to do is smoke and drink, which I don’t want to. It’s taken some alone time to figure out that I want to stay sober for a little bit, and she and her friends don’t respect it. They’ve told me they feel sorry for me. 

She also has been extremely irresponsible during covid. After getting sent home from university for being in regular contact with a student who tested positive, she broke her quarantine to meet up with her ex boyfriend, who had covid. She then, actually got covid from him, and has been texting me non stop to hang out with her since the day her quarantine ended. I don’t want to hang out with her, and frankly I don’t even want to talk to her.

But, even though I don’t want to talk to her, she still incessantly calls me, texts me, DMs me on instagram, snapchats me, and texts me on messenger. All within 5 minutes of each other.  The thing is that she’s always been like this, but I had less of an excuse to ignore her when we lived minutes away from each other on our college campus. Now we’re both at home (we’re from the same hometown, known each other for almost a decade), and she still won’t leave me alone. I need alone time, and I also finally have a break from her and she won’t let me take it!  I NEED SPACE. AND SHE WONT GIVE IT TO ME. 

She’s also done various little things over the years that have really made me and some other friends of hers not like her. She constantly interrupts people, she very curtly recaps significant events in other people lives so they can’t get right back to talking about her (Ex: when she explained the suicide of my best friend’s mother in the succinct sentence “Her mom killed herself.  Anyways...”), and other generally rude things. Personally, she frustrated me because I’ve shown her various tv shows or movies that I like, and she’s made them integral parts of her personality (she also did this with one of our mutual friend’s religion, which she knows nothing about but swears that she practices it and acts as if she is an authority on the faith).

D has gone through many friends and friend groups in her life but she refuses to let me go. I am trying so hard to not speak to her, or hang out with her, because she is draining, toxic, and frankly I just don’t like her.  Whenever I don’t answer the phone she says “ur lame answer ur phone”.  When I told her for the 40th time this week that I couldn’t hang out she said “Ok I’ll check tomorrow”. Please. How do I get her to leave me alone. She is severely depressed (has attempted suicide in the past year) and I don’t want her to be upset but she is such a toxic person.

Then when the damage is already done and it’s too late to fix or try to amend for the hurt I caused is when I sit back and reflect and realize how badly I’ve fucked up and just want to fix it all but by then it’s much too late. But I don’t make the effort to fix myself or change or improve. 


And I keep fucking the same things up repeatedly time after time. And I know exactly what I do yet I go and do it again and again. I genuinely apologize for my wrong doings, I feel so much remorse and regret, and I’m aware of the damage and hurt and stress I cause this particular person yet I continue to do things that they’ve told me to stop and not do and others have told me to stop and not to do and know I must change and I *want* to change but I... just don’t. I’m comfortable and complacent. I’m terrified of who I’ve become, or rather who I’ve let myself become. I feel as if I’m stranger observing myself just go through the motions - but all the motions are just *wrong.*


I had a LDR partner (24F) that I really loved and cared about so much but I did horrible things to her (cheated, emotionally manipulated her without realizing I was doing so, behaved selfishly many times like by doing things that neglect to consider how my actions would impact our relationship down the line and her emotional well-being and her faith and trust in me) and ever since the break up in October I’ve been slowly morphing into a worse and worse person and someone I don’t even recognize as myself anymore. Its at the point where I’ve become scared of myself and what I’m capable of (repeatedly doing things and saying things that hurt the feelings of others, being a person who severely lacks self-awareness, not making any serious effort to change and improve myself, etc.) and I fear for the people around me bevause I don’t want to hurt anyone ever again like how I’ve done to my ex partner repeatedly, someone who I still care about so much yet have inflicted so much damage to. Especially tonight. They had previously told me to not ever mention the relationship we had, in particular details of it, on particular subreddits (and Reddit in general) because they’re a private person, Reddit isn’t the place to overly openly write details about the relationship, and for other reasons. Ultimately a plain and simple request of “hey, please respect my wishes and boundaries.” And what did I do today? stepped right over those boundaries she explicitly laid out for me again by writing a comment containing what she doesn’t want  shared. When I wrote it: I saw nothing wrong with it (pretty generalized, all in a positive light) and she notified me that it was inappropriate and once again disrespecting her and her demands of me. I was stubborn and fought with her through the Reddit chat  to defend myself. With each of her replies i realized more oh “fuck I’ve gone and done the same thing once again. I haven’t learned my lesson at all since the last time I’ve done this.” 


Then I became a horrible nasty person and started to say things with the intent of hurting her feelings. All things I don’t even believe in or think are true. dug down into our shared history to throw whatever I can at her out of sheer anger. And I regret it so much. I didn’t mean any of it. At all. It was all just to get back at her when there was NOTHING to get back at her for. I’ve never behaved in such a vile way.... saying things to purposely hurt somebody. Getting joy the more and more I could hurt her. Just wanting to get back at her. She’s never done me wrong. Then I sat back and went holy fuck what did I just do. How could I let myself treat her like this. Why the fuck did I treat her like this. Where did this come from? 


And now the damage is done.... I’ve made someone who I still hold so much care about greatly and whom I genuinely want them to live a peaceful, good life feel like shit earlier today on purpose by saying things I knew would hurt them, yet I didn’t genuinely believe in what I was saying. Nothing on this earth can excuse the vile shit I said. I’ve upset them so much and I feel so bad for what I’ve said and I want to take it all back but obviously that’s impossible and I’ve hurt them once again, so deeply.

I have a history of treating people not nicely (being snappy with my responses, dismissive of them, being rude, making jokes that weren’t nice/at the expense of others/in a rude manner) and I need and want to stop this behaviour before I delve deeper into it. I can’t live like this anymore. I don’t want to live like this anymore. I’ve done so much damage, especially to my ex, and I’m scared that I can do it again to someone else. I recognize that I’m really immature and think without speaking and a long list of other shitty traits yet it seems like I only have self-awareness AFTER I’ve fucked  up",24Dec2020,1
244," So 2 weeks after being dumped (my gf of 2 years dumped me for no reason at all suddenly)  I gathered the couraged to ask her why she did it. She said I didn't give her enough attention (i gave her all my attention) . So being a gentlemen I apologized ( even tho it's not my fault) but then I found out she was already seeing someone else.  I asked her when did this started and she said 2 weeks ago . Then I realised she dumped me to be with another guy. I got so sad and cried a lot.  She felt sorry for me and she gave me 3 favours/wishes so that I can feel better . 

I still love her even tho she did all that and Im thinking about getting back with her. I know im a loser so any advice from you guys will be good.  Im still new to reddit and i don't know if i can ask this here. Thanks",24Dec2020,1
245,"I’m 22m, the youngest of 4, and this has been going on for a while now.

None of us live at home anymore and I always get so excited to see everyone, but no one is excited to see me. 
My siblings are all very successful and attractive people and I’ve always been the outcast a bit, but it’s gotten so much worse lately.

Sometimes they like me around and think I’m funny, etc, but sometimes if I say a word I get called annoying and asked to go away, or just ignored for the whole night. 

I’ll admit that sometimes I talk too much to them, but I’m very careful about only talking a little. I live alone so sometimes I go weeks without talking to anyone, so I understand I can be too much sometimes. I try to hold back, but when I do they also get upset with me and say I need to contribute to the conversation, or my mom gets upset and thinks I hate her.

I have some very severe depression that they don’t know about, and these comments bring me so close to the brink of suicide, but they don’t understand that.  I mean I’ve been home for 5 hours and I’m already crying alone lol.

247,"First post on the platform, sorry for the lengthy post but thought the context would help :)

Recently, on certain late afternoons and early evenings, my family and I began noticing several instances where some unfamiliar vehicle would be poking around and about, sometimes parking outside of our left neighbours with their headlights on and pointed towards our house. Several times now my father would return home from work to find the car parked outside, of which would drive away soon after. This had led us to believe that the car might be trying to keep tab on our family schedule. Now, we live in a rather secluded, kind of wealthy neighbourhood which would certainly provide some kind of motive if they were indeed up to no good. Although I can't say that similar situations have happened in the past around the neighbourhood, I do know that one of our neighbours did get his wallet stolen earlier in the year when he left his car unlocked outside at night (we live in a rather safe country, or so we thought we did).

My own experience with the cars occurred last week when I was out walking my dog in the late afternoon, early evening. No one was home then so the house was dark whereas all of our neighbours had lights on. I was on my way back when I noticed this white SUV backing out of the driveway of a house a couple houses down and driving in the opposite direction of the neighbourhood exit. (For context our neighbourhood is unusual as its just one large loop with one exit and two roundabout streets, the car was driving in the direction of the longer way out.) I thought nothing at it at first until I got closer towards my home and noticed that the car came back after having driven past my house. I kept my attention on the car as I went inside and noticed that the car went through a nearby roundabout street and had parked near the exit, with a relatively good view of my home. I kept the SUV in mind and told my father around an hour later when he came home. He then claimed that he saw a car parked beside our neighbours, but he didn't catch the build due to the blaring headlights. When we looked outside to check the car was gone. My mother had apparently saw a car (unsure about the build) parked outside our neighbours a couple nights earlier too.

We kind of forgot about it until just last night, my father was heading up the driveway when he noticed a vehicle parked in the same spot outside our neighbours as last time, lights on. This time he remembered and drove back out to check. It was a van this time, and definitely not the same car I saw last week. He parked behind the van and took note of its license plate number. The van started moving and tried to park at the roundabout exit, but my father kept on it, so it slowly drove out of the loop and left.

We are unsure about the intentions of said vehicle but given the circumstances, it's hard to think of other reasons why. Our right neighbour is planning to rent their house out but that doesn't explain why the car was parked outside of our left neighbour. Knowing my immediate neighbours, we don't think its a drug/undercover cop thing either (could be a possibly if the elderly wanted something to do after retirement). We might be overthinking but the whole reactive thing is really getting on our nerves. So please, any advice on what to do in this situation would certainly help a lot. We've really hoping to dislodge the threat before something bad happens to the family, and just as 2020 is going away too! Thanks.",24Dec2020,1

250,"Hello,

I am in need of some guidance. I have a 3 month old child and soon-to-be 3 year old. Both of whom I absolutely adore and are the center of my world.

I am married to a man who doesn’t respect me and who doesn’t love me. Previous to baby #2’s birth he would also say things that were emotionally abusive although that has gotten better and does that less now. We have tried marriage counseling on and off but never really stuck with it. At times it was helpful and at times it wasn’t helpful at all.

I think he’s a wonderful father to our children but a really terrible husband. When we argue he has a tendency to belittle and verbally demean.

Here’s my question: I am considering a divorce but can’t imagine a world of split custody with either of my children. I need to see them daily. They are my oxygen. Also my littest one is still breastfeeding and I want what is best for her. I want her to remain breastfeeding until she is at least 1 year old - although I know fed is best and there is no issue at all if a mama needs to formula feed, it’s just my strong personal desire to continue to breastfeed her.  I really love the bond with her during breastfeeding and I think a mother’s role in a child’s life is especially important during the newborn phase. 

I can’t live without my kids and the thought of split custody hurts my heart to even think about.

I am also worried that the separation from my kids will make me depressed and ultimately LESS happy than just staying in an unhappy marriage.

I could leave an unhappy marriage and still end up unhappy because I get less time with my kids. I’m really worried about ending up unhappy if I leave too.

He knows this situation isn’t working and I’ve talked to him before. Things got better in the last year but he still undermines and demeans me when he’s upset. Also I don’t feel loved, he will say “love you” to the kids but leaves me out of his declarations of love. I have little faith things will improve to the point that I need.

I am also not sure what will be the best for the kids long term. Part of my thinks a divorce is better because kids need their parents to be happy and want peace in their life. Part of me thinks they will be happier and healthier if I just wait one year (until the little one is at least not breastfeeding as much anymore). 

Should I:
A. Separate from my husband knowing that it will be better for me in the long term and that will be better for my kids in the long term but it will be ridiculously painful now.
B: Stay in the marriage at least until baby #2 is eating solids. Stick with it for just another year or so then get a separation if things are still not good.
C: Stay in the marriage but just create my own life within it and not listen to him when he is in a Mood.

Thank you for your help!

Sincerely,
Mama who wants to stay with her kids",24Dec2020,1
251,"So ever since I was a kid I’ve always had these odd “habits” that I always do. One, for example, is I can’t go to sleep at night without making sure that any objects on the counter are pushed back so they don’t fall such as a water bottle because I believe that if a water bottle of left on the counter it could get knocked down, causing someone to slip and die. Another one is when setting an alarm for work I turn my phone to silent mode but I have to repeatedly flick the switch back and forth until it feels right, and this happens multiple times a night. Finally, a third “habit” is for awhile I used to lock my bedroom door, unlock it, open and then close the door, and repeat it multiple times (luckily I grew out of this habit but I do find myself doing it occasionally when I go to the bathroom). I’m not trying to self diagnose because I know I should see a doctor if I think it’s a problem but I’ve realized after doing research that these are called checking behaviors which is common in individuals with ocd",24Dec2020,1

253," 

So long story short me and this kid don't get along, we went to high school together. So this guy Sebastion created a fake face book account under Luis santos (now deleted) and messaged my father claiming I sell heroin and Xanax.

The reason he did this is he claims I'm talking shit about him. I haven't spoke to this kid in months, reason being is how many drugs he takes and honestly just never feeling comfortable around him. He always takes advantage of every situation he can, I can tell he's prideful in being a scam artist. well we were in a party on Xbox with all our friends and I said ""this is why I don't chill with you"" because he started to just say hurtful things claiming someone else was talking shit about me. Well he freaked out and lost his shit, began insulting me saying I'm nothing to him and I'm a a boy compared to him, he's a man. he then blew up my Instagram, phone number, Xbox messenger and basically gave me a Ddos attack by sending so many insults and claims of me being jealous of him. Well then i tell him I'm sorry but I apologize if I hurt his feelings and that I'm gonna have to block him, he then goes and says I'm gonna make your life horrible, your parents are gonna know how much of a drug addict you are.

That's when my dad pulls me in and says hey I got a message on facebook, check it out. it claimed to be a trainer from our home town, and that i have been selling drugs to his son and many other kids in town. my father knew it was nonsense right away so it wasn't a big deal for us. but it made me furious this dumbass went through the effort and claims I'm jealous of him and Idk how to begin to describe this guys delusions, I think he's on lots of Xanax and is jumping into the deep end at the moment.

Sorry for the long message. I'm not sure if this kid is gonna act further or if he's forgetting about it. He seems kinda crazy right now. Should I call the police or just let it go?",24Dec2020,1

256,"I used to be in a friend group and we all were close until I decided to make decisions that were different than theirs. I chose to work for two years to support my sick dad while they all went to school. We all stayed in touch, I constantly texted and called but sometimes non of them would respond and sometimes only one or two would respond. 
Fast forward I’m also in school and occasionally we all would meet up but with conflicting schedules only some of us could hang out at different occasions while others couldn’t. This seemed fine but slowly some of the girls in this group of friends would only make plans with one another and not invite others and okay this seemed fine too but then things got awful. 

One of the girls in this group (let’s call her P) would act close to me but in my absence to the other girls in the group she would always pass comments on how the four of them are so close and whenever these four would spend time together they wouldn’t ask me to join and would always post about it online (ALL 4 of them) but whenever I spend time with them they would never post and would bring up their hangouts. P would always tell the other girls that she feels closest to them and the 4 of them are so close and connected. Another girl in the group (let’s call her M), M ended up telling me how P passes these sorts of comments &amp; she told me of all the times P has said these things and other things about me. 

I decided to let those comments pass and I tried connecting with P as a fresh start but I noticed whenever I tried connecting with her she seemed annoyed so I stopped reaching out. I noticed whenever I asked to spend time she would say she’s busy but then she would have a side plan with our other friends. I ignored this too but slowly it became very hurtful so I decided to talk to them about it and share my feelings. 3/4 said that they understand and are sorry for how I feel and we talked, bonded and laughed it off. When I called P (turns out another girl in the group texted her and told her how I’m calling everyone and talking to them about my feelings), and P started playing victim saying how she feels left out because she’s a too nursing student and an intern at our school and she gets left out of hangouts (she never does, we always invite her and when she do she says she’s a busy student who’s working or she says she’s stressed), regardless I apologized to her for any pain I may have intentionally or unintentionally caused her but she started acting as if I had offended her. I apologized and our call ended. Fast forward they all still would hang and make plans and M told me how P is saying I make her feel left out (at this point they’ve hung out without me so idk how she’s saying this because they don’t even talk to me) and M basically talks badly about P saying she’s toxic and rude but M still hangs out with P and goes onto Facebook to call her, her best friend and post photos with her but when she talks to me she speaks bad about P. 

I don’t know what to do honestly because I tried giving them all space, I tried being an adult and addressing the issue, I tried apologizing for anything I may or may not have done to harm anyone’s feelings, I tried fresh starting and making plans but they still reject me and now M who I thought was the sincerest friend to me is making me question everuthing because on one hand she encourages me to end my friendship with P and the others and herself she speaks bad about them but yet hangs out with them ?

257,"tw : trauma (not mentioned what actually happened, but i’m sure it can be inferred and better safe than sorry) 

so 2 years ago a pretty traumatic event happened. i had been repressing it until recently i’ve started to deal with it. with that i’ve been cutting people out of my life and making it clear that i am moving on from it and trying to process it all. 

when the event happened, my best friend at the time was there. i texted her asking for help, telling her i was scared, and begging her to stay in the room with me. she texted me back, making some joke about the situation and she left the room. 

after the event, i drove her home. i was clearly having a panic attack and freaking out and she just didn’t seem to care. she literally was talking about it all so casually, making jokes about it. 

we never discussed this. we grew apart as friends sort of because of other things and sort of because the way i changed after the event. 

the point is, she could’ve stopped it. she could’ve helped me. and she didn’t. and of course i’m still upset and i plan to handle my feelings about it, but i just really want to know why she did what she did. 

i think i might feel better and might be able to process this trauma better if i speak to her. 

but i also know this trauma is my own and it’s my responsibility to get through it, not hers. 

im not sure what to do, if i should ask her why she didn’t help me, if i should just leave it alone, or something else

258,"Background: i(F22) grew up in a VERY Christian town. It was ingrained in our heads that being gay was wrong and thoughts\actions that weren't hetero weren't ok. It was basically a beleif everyone held, even kids. And I was that way too, until I met my gay best friend and he helped me start thinking for myself. 

And then, it happened. I met a girl that I instantly fell in love with. She was quirky and beautiful with a wonderful peraonality and a great sense of humor who seemed to like me, despite my looks (I was never the best looking and a little overweight) and I was smitten from day one, but every time I tried to tell her, I got that feeling that stemmed from growing up in our town: This is wrong.

Now, I live in Indiana with my BF and shes married and lives in Alaska. I see her on FB all the time and she's happy and enjoying life with her husband (in the army and deployed right now) and it hurts to see that.

265,"Hi!

This past week I (22f) had a very bad mental break that resulted in me being put in the psych ward for a couple days. It was the result of built up pressure from  a lot of things and I’m okay now. 

I was sexually assaulted about three times by a partner earlier this year and lately I have felt upset about it. As background, he ignored my obvious discomfort and attempts to avoid sex until I gave in. I have a lot of issues saying no flat out, but I’m not good at hiding my discomfort. However, I have been feeling gross lately as I feel I was not clear enough. 

After my stay, I decided to start focusing on me very heavily and stop worrying about making others uncomfortable. By that I mean, I’m not putting up with anything like that anymore because I don’t want to risk offending someone else or disappointing them. 

At this point in my life, I don’t have a lot of close friends. I have people I stay in touch with, but I’m really okay with being alone a good amount of the time. Not that I want to avoid contact, just that right now I’m not in a head space where I need constant contact with anyone. 

My closest friend, lets call B, is a good friend. However, in recent months I’ve felt myself distancing myself for certain reasons. To begin, I have lupus and have been very strict about only hanging out with her because I trust her. I came over one day and 30 minutes into our visit her mom told B to tell me that she (the mom) was exposed to COVID and was waiting on test results. She KNOWINGLY invited me into her home although I have discussed my lupus in detail with her. This really, really pissed me off as my entire house is at great risk. I’m passive aggressive though and let it go. 

About a month ago, I was over again and her and her mom forced me to dance with them. Again, I was trying to deny it, like multiple times saying things like “I can’t dance” or “I’ll just watch”. They ignored my wishes and her mom asked why I wasn’t dancing and made me uncomfortable. The entire deal made me very uncomfortable and agitated honestly. Especially as I was starting to feel the affects of my sexual assault. 

Once again, B ignored my obvious signs of discomfort as she wanted a tattoo. I said yes, but I was hesitant. So this is partially, if not fully, my fault. She kept pushing it and I finally went with her. I tried to change the subject, I eventually said “sure” unenthusiastically though. I was really high at the time and right as we went to leave I expressed that I was very, very stoned. She continued to drive. We get there, obviously the shop only allowed one person. So she sits in the car looking for another shop while I’m completely silent. It was a very pushed situation I felt like and, again, it made me uncomfortable. 

I did say yes in the last situation, but again, I do believe my discomfort and unwillingness was obvious. After leaving the psych facility yesterday I began to think about how she treats me and does not listen to my wishes or needs. I am at the point where I sort of want nothing to do with her but I feel I may be jumping the gun. However, things shifted dramatically after she exposed me to a person waiting on covid results. I can easily die from this, and so can my family members. I’m still pissed about it in all honesty. 

Am I overreacting? Should I remain friends with her and move past it?",24Dec2020,1
266,"Hey so I'm going to preface this by saying this post is full of first world problems, I understand that I'm very lucky to be where I am. Not sure if this is the norm for this sub so sorry if that was pointless.

For some context; I'm 16, my only expenses are gas, a gym membership, and web hosting for a domain I own. I own my own car outright and I have about $9k saved up right now, $10.8k if you count my investment account. I finished high school in June. I plan on becoming a real estate agent when I'm of age.

Anyways, I started my first job at Walmart \~85 days ago as a SCO host. Not going to lie it's been pretty easy, other than the lack of respect from most members of management it's been smooth sailing. \*But\*, I've found it very difficult to maintain balance. I'm the type of person who always worries too much about everything, and that means if I have any work scheduled for the day (it could be a 4 hour shift 12 hours from now) I can't stop thinking about it. Any slights made towards me (even unintentional ones) stay on my mind for ages. Though I'm getting better, I'm a socially awkward person so any fumbles on my end radically decrease my confidence until I forget about them. I don't know how to put it other way than simply, I'm exhausted. I don't even work that much (35 hours this week and next week, but usually it's only \~30) and that just makes me feel worse about it.

The way I see it I have 3 options, 1, quit right now and don't look back, 2, wait (up to) 2 weeks for the HR lady to be back from COVID leave to change my availability and another 3 weeks for it to take effect, or 3, find a way to make work less of a burden.  


I think I would've quit already if I didn't have a crippling fear of wasting my life. I feel as though anytime I'm bored from then on would be doubly painful knowing that I'm missing out. Also, I feel like shit just for making this post because what does that say about my work ethic? 3 months in and I'm already flaking?

Regardless, do any of you have thoughts on my current situation? I would be happy to provide any additional information.",24Dec2020,1

Here’s where it gets weird. That nephew of mine is talking to my two year old daughter like a hentai movie. Saying, “OHHHH UWU ONICHAN. SIMPAI.” Moaning at my daughter is definitely frowned upon and teaching her to do so will get you hit. Because of the awkward first impression of just meeting him, I didn’t say anything.

That’s when his dad spoke up and turned the friendly filter off and changed to “I’m gunna whoop your ass to next year” dad. He sent the son to our spare room and told him to go to bed. The son completely fought every step of the way, and laughed it off like it was some joke. 

What do I do to not completely ruin every thread of a relationship as this kids uncle? Should I play it off like I know he’s joking and just stupid? Should I get serious and threaten him too? 

I’m super uncomfortable with him staying at my house for a week now. My wife and I are keeping a close eye on him and our daughter. Is it really that prolific in society to be a weeb and love anime now adays? I figured at 16 I was way more respectful in front of my elders and around children. When someone told me to stop, I did. 

What it gunna take to get him to knock this shit off? I hope his dad doesn’t have to hit him and ruin Xmas for everyone lol. Then again.. maybe he needs it.",24Dec2020,1

269,"TL;DR: I've fantasized about being in a relationship for a long time and now that I have a permanent job I don't care about any type of relationship at all. Is this normal?

I've been working temp jobs for years and I finally gained a permanent job that pays enough so I can move out the bad place I'm in. When I was working temps having a boyfriend would be something I constantly fantasized about but now I don't desire it anymore and a large part of my mind feels ""empty."" I think the whole idea of having a boyfriend was mainly a subconscious desire to get away from where I am. Even if I did get a boyfriend the goal wasn't just to bum around his house, I'd still find work or back to school or something. Now, it's like ""why bother?"" All of my relationships were LDR's where the only option to be with the person was literally to do all the work and nearly all of the guys were the one to break up with me. My expectations were as reasonable as I could think of. I didn't go after guys out of my league and I just wanted a kind guy with a good sense of humor but no dice. Besides that asmr videos and otome phone apps seem more satisfying so those probably play a role as well.

It's not just romantic relationships by the way. I don't have any friends and I don't think I care enough to try to make any anymore. I'm 25 and I spent over a decade trying to make buddies (not just with men) and it just seems like a fool's errand. I'm of average appearance, sometimes have good days when I look above average, don't act badly to others and try to be helpful when I can but no one notices and not a lot of people care as much about being social anymore.

I like my co-workers enough so I guess I'll be fine just seeing them on a video call on occasion or whenever the pandemic's over and everyone can return to the office. I have two older sisters and a niece that at least seem to care about my best interests and I appreciate that they do but with all the social stuff and family nonsense I've dealt with I think I'd be okay if no one cared about me since I've done everything by myself and can have a good time by myself.

I've spent years trying to improve my financial situation so a lot of stuff I like has fallen by the wayside. I have tons of books, games and shows I haven't even gotten to and a couple of other hobbies I want to get into. If my life ends up being nothing but work, hobbies, using the internet, adult duties and occasionally going out to places I want to go to that's fine with me.

The only issue is the large and empty space in the back of my mind from a desire that isn't there anymore and the nagging feeling something is missing. I'm just wondering if it's normal or to be expected.",24Dec2020,1

271,(the friend in question said that a couple years have passed since this happened) A friend told me that when he was 17 he masturbated to a girl that was also 17 when there were both in the same room while the girl was sleeping because he couldn't go to the bathroom to relieve himself and it just wouldn't go away.

272,"I noticed my social media addiction about 1.5 years ago. It was mostly mindless scrolling on facebook, but now that I've deleted the app, it's mindless scrolling on reddit. How do people control their social media usage? I want to enjoy life again, and I want to give my partner my full attention when he starts a conversation. 

I am a huge introvert. Socializing with people makes me feel very drained, but scrolling on reddit for a few hours seems to help me recharge myself. Although I wouldn't really call it recharging, since most the time I sit on reddit for up to 5 hours after work and ignore my SO. I would really like to have meaningful interactions with the world again, but deleting reddit seems so hard right now.

I deleted facebook mainly because it was boring me, and I didn't find a use for it anymore. I'm not sure if I'll feel the same about reddit. It's so calming to ignore people and just read stories all day. Like how is that any different than hearing stories from my SO? 

I think my depression plays a huge part in my social media addiction as well. I've tried a therapist once, but I gave up after one session. This was years ago, so I'd definitely be willing to try again, but when you're working 40 hours a week, it's hard to make the time to do that. On my days off all I want to do is scroll and ignore the ""real"" world. I've ignored doctor appointments in the past just because I couldn't be bothered to get out of bed to make a difference for myself. 

Ideally I'd like to learn how to balance social media in a healthy way. I don't see myself redownloading facebook, but I would like to keep reddit. How can I control my usage without falling back into my old ways? 

If it matters, I work in retail, which is why I feel so drained after work everyday. Being an introvert who works in retail is exhausting. But I do love my job, so I'd like to learn how to better myself while also being able to recharge my social battery enough to give my partner what he deserves. He has ADHD, so sometimes it's hard to feel like I'm getting alone time.

275,"Seeking advice of those 21+. 

Although career wise and intellectually I’ve progressed a great deal, and emotionally am more resilient to adversity or change, I feel like I’ve killed off a very important part of me. 

I was a young guy full of love, life, vision, passion, and drive. persistent for what I wanted. However 2 things happened together around 17 and I have never been the same.

1. I started talking to this girl almost everyday, and would have expressed my love to her, but my society would not accept something of the sort and it would be looked down upon *extremely* and that would cause my family pain and eventually would fall apart. I knew it, contemplated eloping with her, and recognized the foolishness of following my heart at such a young age, and it’s honestly one of the best decisions I made. However how I coped with it was destructive. First off, I got I new number and gave the girl a cold shoulder at school too to create distance between us. As I extinguished my feelings, my body began to lust for her and I turned to watching porn with women that looked like the girl my heart raced at the thought of. Self reflection made me break away from watching porn with similar women, but the general porn habit stayed. 

2. I was in the top .5% of my high school class, had great activities alongside, and envisioned a future full of meaningful impact. However shortly after the issue expressed above, college admissions came around and I was not in the right state of mind: thinking only short term, and let others make decisions for me such as my major and career route. I know this career is a great, respectable, stable one and one that matches my capabilities and character traits such as empathy, leadership, and compassion. However, I feel that my lack of say in the initial decision will always make me feel alienated from my sovereignty as an individual. 

If observed on a first impression, no one will see the inner conflict, numbness, and absence of life that resides within me. Even a part of my mind tries to convince itself that life is beautiful, but the more dominant thoughts at the end of the day tell me that I had so much potential at 17, and I voluntarily let others control my path and sacrificed my self-expression and happiness forever. 

The loss of these two has made me cut my social contacts and friendships as I tried to move forward and hopefully make new connections but I ended up half way, losing many old friends and failing to make new ones, as my ego stood in the way. 

Now I am seeking advice on how I can fix myself, regain my ability for self-expression, develop a healthy relationship with my past, and grow into the potential I have. 

Thank you so much for reading, I sincerely appreciate it and am looking forward to your response. 

Thank you.",24Dec2020,1

284,"So, this is going to get complicated, but first of all I want you to please read the full post before judging me if you judge me, and also please know that I do not dislike littles/people who have age regression due to trauma, or anything of the sort. Also, for context, we're both teens.  


So, about 3 or 4 hours ago I entered a new relationship with someone I liked. We know each older decently well, or so I thought. For context, I have depression and anxiety. Anyways, before I entered the relationship, I already knew they also had depression. I was fine with that and I've tried to make them feel better as well as I can. This can be a little stressful on it's own, but I can handle that.  


About an hour ago, they told me the truth that they have age regression from trauma and basically, they began baby talking. They started crying, asking me not to leave them, apologizing, saying I will leave them, and they asked me something disturbing multiple times, which is them asking to be able to end their life. I of course attempted to make them feel better, while the situation made me feel very stressed.   


They then went on to say the reason I would leave them is because they (like to) wear diapers. Which admittedly did make me somewhat more stressed. I did my best to calm them and they went to sleep, and now I'm asking for advice because I'm having second thoughts about this relationship. Here are my reasons why;  


1. I feel upset that they waited until after we were in a relationship to tell me about this very important thing.
2. I have depression and anxiety and I feel like I can't handle my own mental health AND their mental health as well as the age regression. 2b. I'm a teenager and I have no idea how age regression and littles work, nor how I should treat them or how I should have a relationship with them. I just don't know.  

3. I really don't think I can be what they deserve/need.

285," My father and I (20F) haven't gotten along and have been pretty much estranged since I was about 16, when I came out as a trans woman, we are basically polar opposites on the political scale, he's heavily religious I am not, I'm very progressive thinking he is very traditional. Since I came out he was not very supportive, even though I was allowed to still live at home I was always reminded how it was a sin, etc which always hurt my mental health, also I was always belittled for my interests, opinions, and aspirations, always misgendered, and he basically wanted nothing to do with me other than try to convert me back to however he used to view me (a soft-spoken and never argumentative Christian boy). he would start arguments over nothing just to tear me down and would get in my face and tell me I wouldn't amount to anything, and all that I do and believe in is unimportant. all of this basically accumulated to me attempting suicide when I was 17. and since then I have always blamed myself for my father and me having a strained relationship, so I would always forgive him full-heartedly to only be back at being belittled a few months later. However, this verbal abuse still continues 4 years later. once I was 18 I moved in with my grandmother who was super supportive just like the rest of my family. I moved in with her because I needed to value my mental health and have a bit of distance from my father, it also helped benefit her as she lived alone and should could have used the extra help and companion. I had limited contact with my dad but I would remain civil and would still go to all family holidays whether he attended or not. many times he didn't however this was a usual thing for him as he has always been iffy about family holidays since I was little, usually cause my parents would fight or he just had some vendetta against holidays, I really don't know. i would still cook food for him on his birthday and spend an hour with him which was always him belittling me or trying to talk religion into me (an atheist) i would always stand there and take it, but once I moved out I would try to fight back respectfully, which of course he would turn into a reason to not want me to visit as somehow I was being disrespectful of him. so now after a long time of putting up with at the age of 20 I have basically cut contact with him blocked him on my phone and will basically just be civil, but I don't really want to be around him I usually get an anxiety attack when I am in the same room with him alone, and I feel like I can't breathe and I always have to tiptoe around him. Earlier this year my grandmother passed away, I still live in her house and pay the rent etc. and my partner moved in with me which has been great for not being in the house completely alone after he passing. but the thanksgiving after her passing my family got together at her/ my current residence, and my father was invited but didn't come due to my parents fighting. now It is Christmas and things have gotten worse so I essentially don't want to invite him. I don't want to hurt him in anyway, but this is my first Christmas with my partner, and it is being hosted at my grandmother's house where I still live but will be moving in a few months, so I don't really feel comfortable with having him in my safe space. I assumed my mother knew this since she knows I have cut contact with him, but the other day she asked me if she could increase her invite to the both of them. I thought about it and said ""no"" due to the reasons I mentioned above. she then came over today and explained how family was extremely important to my grandmother, and that she would want us to spend it all together. I felt so badly for my mother, I didn't want to ruin her Christmas especially since its the first one after losing my grandmother. but I talked it over with my partner later tonight and we agreed that maybe since I have always put the idea of ""family first and me last"" throughout the last 4 years, by going to family events that my father was attending even though I always felt like I couldn't breathe and couldn't be as talkative, and by being civil and there for him even when he was never there for me, that I could take this one and value my mental health for once. so I told my mother ""no"" again. She understood, but I still feel bad. Like maybe I should just put up for it for another year and just suck it up, I don't know but any comments would be so very appreciated, thank you and sorry for the long story there's a lot of history.",24Dec2020,1

288,"Hi 

I will start from the beginning, I live on the 3rd floor apartment of a building that has a terrible building door and when I moved in last year I was warned by a neighbor that there had been a buglary few years ago.

About two months ago, I was in bed with my partner and we heard our apartment door being knocked, not expecting anyone so didn't want to answer the door and the door unfortunately doesn't have a spy hole to look through. Then with continuous knocks there was a sharp noise and someone entered our flat, my partner scared them off by getting up, and the guy who tried to get in was walking down the stairs to flee and just saying ""your apartment door was open"" which it was not. 

Of course first buglary ever in my life and it shook me to the core, I called our landlord to have change the locks and everything, Googling about buglaries didn't help my initial paranoia. 

Nevertheless, few weeks passes and we double lock the door now just in case. I get the bus to work and I'm usually someone who wakes up late, and leaves late so getting to work is always a rush. However one day I felt as though I was having deja vu of seeing this one guy getting onto the bus after me, and leaves the bus stop as the same as me when I go to work, once I realised this again the next following day he was there again, I work in a restaurant so I'm on a rota so it isn't consistently the same hour or days I work.

Because I had noticed him on the second day and looked at him he must have realised and so I didn't see him, that was until a week later. I received a letter at work with my name on it, and an image of him made of 101010 numbers and a note that said ""just want to talk"". My general manager suggested I'd go to the police, but I'm not the type to ""be a trouble"" if that makes sense.

Since then I didn't hear or see from him at all, this was until last night at 3am there was a tapping on my door, blood rushing I got up grabbed a knife ready for it, my partner saw a green laser pointed at our window and he looked outside and saw the man that I described to him look at our window and he walked away. I opened the apartment door and no one, outside our apartment door we have lights that trigger with sensor and I triggered it when I opened the door meaning no one was outside our door.

Am I going mad? I have opened an investigation case with police online, waiting to receive a call, in the meantime should I be worried, can't shake this out of my head...",24Dec2020,1

Okay so basically this past week I have noticed weird shit in my back yard, for context I love in a 2 story house and the window in my room gives me a perfect view of my back yard. I often look out in my backyard if I can’t sleep at early times in the morning as there is nothing else to do but this week I swear I have seen movement outside near my old broke down treehouse. At first I thought it might be a raccoon or my neighbour’s cat but it’s definitely something larger I thought I was just tired so when I checked the next morning there was a blanket that I have never seen in my life out there which I thought was strange but maybe it was always there and I’m just crazy lol. Back to it last night I heard someone open one of the doors in my back yard now there is a glass door before an actual door but since we never use those doors there really old and creeky however sturdy enough to the point where you would have to open it to actually budge it and I heard that exact noise followed up by what seemed to be frantic running and tapping I’m not getting much sleep and it’s really early in the moring here so I’m not willing to go out and take some pictures but for any doubters when it gets brighter out I will go out and show you the door and the tree house.

295,"Hey friends. Just got a new job as a salesman for a lighting manufacturer. I've tried using several social / B2B platforms to look for business leads. But I feel like I've just been missing something, as nothing has helped me land a deal. Hell, I don't even get to talk to or enter the negotiation stage with many business leaders/ purchasers. 

I just wish there were some kind of discord channel where every importer/exporter is in there discussing business. (Sounds unrealistic I know) Or like World of Warcraft where you could just shout out to everyone that you are selling item X and those who are interested would come to you. 

My company only deals with bulk orders, big customers. So maybe it's meant to be hard? Would be nice if someone who's experienced in this field could give me some advice.",24Dec2020,1
296,"So my neighbor (who is also a long-term friend) moved in earlier in the year. The tenant before him had left a couch behind because they weren't able to get it out of the apartment. My friend at the time had little to no furniture so he said it was fine , but a few months later he was able to get some better couches and decided to get rid of the one that had been left behind. The apartment manager heard them having trouble trying to move it out and said it was alright for them to toss it over the balcony. He was able to get it out and moved it to the side of the road , it has been sitting out there for a couple weeks now. 
The past couple days the manager has been nagging him about it saying he needs to get ride of it. He had plans to take it to the dump but turns out our city dump will not take your old couches if you live in an apartment building. The other option would be to hire a junk removal company to come pick it up , but we do not think it is his responsibility to pay for the couch to be removed as it had been left there when he moved in and he had only accepted it because he was told they couldn't remove it. Who would be responsible for it at this point? His wallet is already pretty tight right now , he is not willing to pay a removal fee. At this point I see the couch as property of the apartment building , he was only able to relieve it of the obnoxious hunk of junk left behind for someone else to deal with. We'd love to hear an outsiders take on the situation.

TL;DR 
Apartment managers are trying to push the burden of junk removal onto neighbor , when the junk was left in the place when he moved in. Who is responsible?",24Dec2020,1
297,"Long story short, I had to move around the presents I originally bought a couple times and I left them at one house, which I’m not at right now because I’m in a different location (I split my time between two properties). I’m frantically looking for the bag containing the presents at my current location and I asked someone at the other location to try to find the bag tomorrow morning, but in the event the bag cannot be found what would be the best option for a replacement present? I’m thinking about ripping the first couple pages from my (very, very new) Moleskin notebook and gifting that because I got a notebook as one of the presents, the other present was a Patagonia vest and there’s no way I can find anything similar in the short amount of time I’ll have free tomorrow. Would a gift card work? I can probably get to a CVS/pharmacy store and a grocery store pretty easily tomorrow. There’s a craft store in town I *might* be able to stop by tomorrow, but I’m not great at sewing or anything like that (the person I bought the patagonia vest for likes to craft).

It’s getting out of hand and worsening with no end, and my friend doesn’t know what to do. This is especially worrying for my friend who is the eldest child and has to likely shoulder the burden of the mother emotionally and financially. In fact, his mother has made him go for courses with her online even though he is extremely busy as a university student.

300,"Okay, so this is going to be a lot to unpack here but i’ll try to keep this as short as I possibly can. I (30f) met a woman online (26f) in late 2018 who was, in many ways, too good to be true. I fell head over heels like an idiot immediately, getting into an online relationship a few months later with this individual ( yes, I know. stupid. ) and something always felt a bit off, but I could never quite pin point what exactly. 

To make matters more difficult I live in a household that’s not accepting of homosexuality, so I kept this relationship a secret from my family for a year and 8 months give or take, which made this entire situation a tense hellhole, especially when my mother found out last January. Harsh words were shared between my mother and then girlfriend via email ( this’ll be important later on ) and I had to swear i’d never speak to her again if I wanted to live under their roof. I have a disability which renders me useless in the job and independent department so of course I agreed, but still spoke to my ex girlfriend in secret. Big fuck up, by the way. 

Fast forward to August after I’ve noticed several more red flags with this girl and I confront her. Not once. not twice... but EIGHT times asking if she’s a catfish. She finally admits to it, and while I was crushed I agreed to remain friends to see where things would go. 

[narrator voice] it did not go well.

After months of betrayal, manic behavior, verbal abuse ( from both sides. i’ll admit i got a little toxic and mean when i found out she was a catfish ) i finally decided... no, begged for us to cut contact with each other to retain my sanity. She didn’t like this too much, and she especially didn’t like the fact I told a few people she is in fact, a catfish. 

Anyway, i deleted my twitter, and basically disappeared from anywhere she could find me. I’ve stopped drinking, am exercising and am genuinely enjoying my life without her toxicity and lies. It’s been great... until tonight. 

Tonight she decided she wanted to have the last word, but not with me.. with my MOTHER of all people. She proceeded to send my mother an email detailing how I talked to her behind my mothers back, detailed abuse in the home ( which was true and I needed to vent ) and went on this fake ass spiel about how she’s a “christian” now and has opened her eyes to my devious ways, and she’d hate to hold this secret in that i’ve been hiding from my family this past year. That’s not all though. Nope, she couldn’t stop there. She had to share screencaps... of me... and my nudes for my MOTHER to see.

Luckily we’ve got a linked email account and I caught it before my mother could. I’m still shaking, and I’m wondering if this could be illegal?? to share nudes with someone’s mother? and I also wanna know if it would be a good idea to reach out to this person to try to make peace or remain absolutely silent? I’m scared, upset and all sorts of negative emotions right now. I hope all of this makes sense. I’m at a loss as to what to do other than keep an eye on my mothers email, because I don’t know if she’ll send something else in the future.",24Dec2020,1
301,"So there’s this girl at a restaurant that I’ve gone for the past 4 years since she started working and since then every time she would be super friendly to me and sometimes make small talk and sometimes she would be say stuff that happened like a long time ago bringing up random stuff,I would sometimes see her at a grocery store cause she worked there during the beginning of the pandemic and every time I would go to that store she would basically follow me wherever I went pretending to restock shelves and go to the same cashier that I’m at the same time and she still works at the restaurant.Also every time that I would go into the restaurant with lady friends she would treat them bad and be rude but when I’m in there alone shes all friendly and stares sometimes while I wait.

306," 

&gt;My father and I (20F) haven't gotten along and have been pretty much estranged since I was about 16, when I came out as a trans woman, we are basically polar opposites on the political scale, he's heavily religious I am not, I'm very progressive thinking he is very traditional. Since I came out he was not very supportive, even though I was allowed to still live at home I was always reminded how it was a sin, etc which always hurt my mental health, also I was always belittled for my interests, opinions, and aspirations, always misgendered, and he basically wanted nothing to do with me other than try to convert me back to however he used to view me (a soft-spoken and never argumentative Christian boy).  
&gt;  
&gt;he would start arguments over nothing just to tear me down and would get in my face and tell me I wouldn't amount to anything, and all that I do and believe in is unimportant. all of this basically accumulated to me struggling with my mental health. however now I am in a much better place and have a great support system. and since then I have always blamed myself for my father and me having a strained relationship, so I would always forgive him full-heartedly to only be back at being belittled a few months later. However, this verbal abuse still continues 4 years later. once I was 18 I moved in with my grandmother who was super supportive just like the rest of my family. I moved in with her because I needed to value my mental health and have a bit of distance from my father, it also helped benefit her as she lived alone and should could have used the extra help and companion.  
&gt;  
&gt;I had limited contact with my dad but I would remain civil and would still go to all family holidays whether he attended or not. many times he didn't however this was a usual thing for him as he has always been iffy about family holidays since I was little, usually cause my parents would fight or he just had some vendetta against holidays, I really don't know. i would still cook food for him on his birthday and spend an hour with him which was always him belittling me or trying to talk religion into me (an atheist) i would always stand there and take it, but once I moved out I would try to fight back respectfully, which of course he would turn into a reason to not want me to visit as somehow I was being disrespectful of him.  
&gt;  
&gt;so now after a long time of putting up with at the age of 20 I have basically cut contact with him blocked him on my phone and will basically just be civil, but I don't really want to be around him I usually get an anxiety attack when I am in the same room with him alone, and I feel like I can't breathe and I always have to tiptoe around him.  
&gt;  
&gt;Earlier this year my grandmother passed away, I still live in her house and pay the rent etc. and my partner moved in with me which has been great for not being in the house completely alone after he passing. but the thanksgiving after her passing my family got together at her/ my current residence, and my father was invited but didn't come due to my parents fighting. now It is Christmas and things have gotten worse so I essentially don't want to invite him. I don't want to hurt him in anyway, but this is my first Christmas with my partner, and it is being hosted at my grandmother's house where I still live but will be moving in a few months, so I don't really feel comfortable with having him in my safe space.  
&gt;  
&gt;I assumed my mother knew this since she knows I have cut contact with him, but the other day she asked me if she could increase her invite to the both of them. I thought about it and said ""no"" due to the reasons I mentioned above. she then came over today and explained how family was extremely important to my grandmother, and that she would want us to spend it all together. I felt so badly for my mother, I didn't want to ruin her Christmas especially since its the first one after losing my grandmother. but I talked it over with my partner later tonight and we agreed that maybe since I have always put the idea of ""family first and me last"" throughout the last 4 years, by going to family events that my father was attending even though I always felt like I couldn't breathe and couldn't be as talkative, and by being civil and there for him even when he was never there for me, that I could take this one and value my mental health for once.  
&gt;  
&gt;so I told my mother ""no"" again. She understood, but I still feel bad. Like maybe I should just put up for it for another year and just suck it up, I don't know but any comments would be so very appreciated, thank you and sorry for the long story there's a lot of history.",24Dec2020,1

But then I moved to the western midwest (Nebraska). There’s just something about it that I love. The people are super nice (Midwestern hospitality is loads better than southern hospitality), food is better, the weather is a little unpredictable, but I love the snow and even the wind to a point. 

My problem is that here in Nebraska, people look down on southern accents, think that I’m stupid, racist, and that everyone sleeps with their cousin. I’m starting to culturally identify with the Midwest to the point that I don’t use my accent. I took two weeks and learned and practiced how people say things here. When I go back south to see family, everyone wants me to be a good ole southern boy again, but I really hated living in the south. It was toxic for my mental health and I’ll never live there again.

309,"I only get spots on my dick after having sex with my gf. It's only when I use these new condoms maybe. My old condoms didn't do this.


Wtf bruh, help. Just buy new condoms right, or is it something else. They go away in about a day. Well now in a day, the first time it scared me half to death, it lasted 3. Now they just disappear later.

It seems to scale exponentially with how long I wear the condom. So like sometimes it's like a 2 minute sesh and sometimes it like 8-10 minutes and the 8 minute one was the 3 day spots. 

I was thinking of running a test where I wear the condom for like an hour see what happens. See if it's truly the condom, since I'm basically guessing.

It could also be that my gf got uti around that same time and we had just a teeny tiny bit of unprotected sex. Just like 5 strokes. So can that be it? 

Also, can you guys answer a separate question. 

So I was eating her out that same day she later got the uti and I had drank a kombucha so she think that's what gave it to her. Possible or nah? Since it does have bacteria technically and her nether regions are the finest warmest there are I'm sure that bacteria made it a fine home. 

New protocol is mouth wash beforehand, if I had kombucha.

If i'm in the army, I'm anxious and have panic attacks daily. 
If i'm not in the army, I have panic attacks about going to the army, so I can't even enjoy my free time.
I'm an anxious person in nature, I've been diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression since I was 12, so this whole ""having a panic attack in the bathroom and then going back to normal"" shenanigan is not a new thing to me. However, this time it's really bad. I feel worthless, and ugly, and stupid, and i'm in an overall bad mental state since my first day in the army (it's been almost a year now, can't believe I survived that long).
But overall I feel stuck. Because Its difficult to leave the army because of my financial situation. The army gives me so much depression and anxiety, but it also gives me pretty cool benefits in the long run, like paying for my university, paying me a monthly salary (a very VERY low salary, but in this day and age its really hard to find a job, especially in israel), and a couple of thousand dollars after I finish my two years in the army.
I tried to make things easier for myself, I really did. I went to the psychiatrist and he gave me more days at home, which is a blessing and i don't take that for granted at all because most soliders don't have that, but I feel that that's not enough for me.
I feel like i'm in my breaking point. I can't function, I can't eat, I can't sleep, and I feel so so much self hatred. But I don't have the money to pay for university on my own, and I don't have a good relationship with my parents, so they can't support me in any way shape or form.
I do have the option to get out the army... but I'm scared to do so because that means that I have to make it on my own. I love working with computers, and i'm very good at it, so i thought about finding a job in help desk and leaving the military, And I will still get some money from the army if I leave, enough to pay one year of university, But it will be much more money if I stay for another year.

Even though my family took safety measures I contracted COVID last month in school, because we had to go there again. I felt awful and it was probably the worst I have ever felt in my life.

I don't pay rent/board, instead I babysit my siblings (8 &amp; 9) and clean the house because my dad works full time + never does housework, and there's too much for my mum to do alone.

The babysitting is only 'theoretically' 6 hours a week when school's on, two every afternoon mon wed + fri, but because I don't yet have my license and the lack of public transport in my area it means I essentially have to be home all day to look after them, and cant go on any overnight trips except for the weekend. 

All in all I probably spend about an hour or two cleaning the kitchen/living/bathroom areas everyday (90% not my mess), and have to stay home mon + wed + fri + essentially be on call if my mum gets an extra shift. Is it wrong to want some monetary compensation for this, if I'm already getting rent/board in exchange? 

I'm a full time uni student and my parents earn too much for me to get any governmental support even if I moved out, and living in the countryside without a license makes getting a job for those few free days/hours tricky. (I can get my Ps in early feb)

backstory: i'm agender (and use they/them pronouns) and i came out about 4 years ago. i changed my name as well. it took until THIS summer for my mom to stop guilt tripping me about my name, though to her credit, she did start using my new name after some adjustment. she's starting to work on using the correct pronouns. my dad, however, never uses my correct pronouns. he uses my new name, but that's it. my mom and i are closer than my dad and i and she tells me that he goes to her and complains about me. he complains about my name change, about me being non-binary, how i can't drive yet, i don't have a full time job (i'm disabled and have a part time job), and i didn't finish high school etc. he doesn't like me because i have depression and anxiety and he thinks i should just get over it.

there's a million other reasons for my dislike for him (drug abuse, occasional physical abuse, gaslighting, constantly being shut down, being punished for speaking my mind/disagreeing with him, being dragged across the country growing up because he couldn't keep a job, living in poverty, etc)

and yet throughout ALL of that i still feel guilty wanting someone else to walk me down the aisle. because i know he's going to guilt me for it. i know he's going to be upset which makes no sense because he doesn't even LIKE me. he doesn't like my personality or who i've grown into. he's stuck in the past and on who i was as a child and refuses to accept that i've changed as an adult. and most of those changes are because of him!! but he would never admit fault or accept responsibility. and yet he would still be mad and upset if i chose someone else. 

i don't want to compromise my feelings and wants on my big day but i don't want to start drama especially if i'll never hear the end of it.

Now, I have random crap, like old electronics that don't work (NES, Atari 2600, some old tube TV), mugs from my recently passed away great grandma and ones from themeparks I've been to, worthless glass soda bottles (handful old most new),  models of classic cars, sorta old soda cans (pre-2010), 2 rc cars, model electric trains, and just funny dumb stuff I found while traveling. All of this stuff is clearly junk and yet I hold onto them.

My mom calls me from her room and I answer by saying “hmm” in a sleepy tone due to me almost being seconds away from falling asleep . She then calls me disrespectful because she said I said “uh-huh”. Over the phone I tell my mother that I wasn’t being disrespectful to her I then go into her room and her and my father say they both heard me say “uh-huh” and don’t believe me when I say I didn’t say that out my mouth. I give up and go into my room after awhile I decide to go into the kitchen and then I hear my mom from the laundry room say “ I feel like punching him in the mouth”. This time I decide to confront her and say why are you saying this over you thinking I said uh-huh and  why would you want to punch your son in the mouth about it I was clearly upset about her saying this. She then snaps on me and we end up in the kitchen, she starts pushing me into a corner so I try to restrain her, she calls my father  and he sees me trying to restrain her, he then gets mad and starts grabbing me and starts throwing me into things in the kitchens. This time I decided to defend myself because my dad is very unpredictable.anyways, so I pushed him and knocked him into the floor he then pushes me into the couch and punches me in the face and then I punch him back because I’m legit protecting myself. My brother then comes out and splits it up. They kick me out the house and take away almost everything including the car that was registered in my name and turned my phone off.

So fast forward a few months and I learn from her yesterday that she still talks to him regularly even after she told me she stoped talking to him and got rid of him cuz he was really fucking weird and posting all over reddit about how he made her cum and how he became obsessed with her but yeah it turns out she was hiding and even lying about the fact that she was still talking to him so I flipped out on her and told her I wanted him gone cuz im not having him in our life after what happen and she refused and told me he is just a friend and thats it ya know exactly what she told me last time and then she cheated and she tells me im just being manipulative and trying to control her and be toxic so I am wondering am I an asshole in this situation or am I justified",24Dec2020,1
334,"For the record, I am now 19 years old and have been out of high school for about a year now and haven't had a genuine conversation with him since about 8th grade. We were both 12 years old and I texted him. I asked him to the dance that weekend and told him I had liked him for a while. He didn't feel the same way and rejected me, which hurt my feelings and maybe even my ego, but I let go of it pretty quickly.

The school we went to had about 70 people per grade in it, and no matter how hard I tried I still had to seem in at least one class or in passing in the hall. Plus every girl our age liked him a lot so he would come up in conversations occasionally, often they'd ask me what I thought of him and I'd answer that he was ""cute but an asshole"". Year after year he'd send mass texts to all the girls asking for nudes and stuff like that, every girl except for me (which again didn't hurt or bother me, except maybe my fragile ego).

Then came prom, and he was having a party at his house and I was invited by one of my friends to come to it. Which is usually how the parties around there worked. But that night as I was texting her and asking for the address she ignored me and when I brought it up later she said ""he didn't want me to come"". I asked why and she said that he told everyone at the party that I was ""obsessed with him"".

I had just won prom queen and despite having a pretty great night this really upset me, not only was he making me look like a desperate freak, but my friends just listened to him say it cause they wanted the d***.

He STILL tells people I am obsessed with him despite having not talked to him since high school. What should I do about this in the future?",24Dec2020,1

337,"my entire life i've always been a bit of a fickle, light sleeper but in the past 7 or 8 months it's gotten really really bad. It's hard for me to sleep and stay asleep, I tend to wake up 5 or 6 times a night and it can take me anywhere from 10-15 minutes to fall back asleep, or sometimes i am fully awake at 4am and can't get back to sleep.

I work really hard at my school work and it's very important to me so i've been taking various sleep aids, benadryl and melatonin pills/gummies for months because i just don't have the time to worry about it and they were a simple solution. 

it's gotten to the point to where if i don't take anything, i won't sleep. 

and it's gotten to the point where i think i built up a tolerence to sleeping medications so i have to take around 3x the normal dose to get intended effects. i also pretty heavily rely on caffiene pills and energy drinks throughout the day to keep me functioning.

honestly i didn't really even notice how terrible my sleeping habits were until this week. i knew they weren't good but they are actually shit. i worry that prolonged over use of sleeping meds may damage my liver or cause long term effects, but i'm not sure what i can really do.

it's very hard to cut down on screen time because of my classes being virtual and i tend to need to study late at night. i feel like it's also worth mentioning that i have a pretty terrible diet too. i live off of energy drinks and maybe get one solid meal in and a couple snacks a day. i try to eat better but it's hard sometimes, you know? i'm also not very active, i used to be but since the virus its's hard to be motivated and go outside when it's like this. plus school is pretty much suffocating me so by the tome i could work out, i'm exhausted.

should i see a doctor for this? could they even help me?

I don’t feel this way when I think of my mother or father or siblings holding him it’s only when I think of my sister in law.  Mainly because she continues to make comments about how much she’s going to hold him and how she’s going to be more attached to him then her other nephew because she’ll be here all the time and that she’ll be kissing his toes all the time ect ect.  I should mention that I live under the same roof as her and her husband and although they’ve been looking for a house since March this year, the market is brutal so no luck yet maybe I’ll luck out and they’ll find something soon but by her comments she’s made it doesn’t seem that way :/ and I just want her out so we(bf) can have our space finally.  

I don’t want to cause conflict considering me and SILs relationship is pretty screwed up as it is and we BOTH can get mean when our buttons are pushed by each other.  We both could care less for each other but obviously living under the same roof and her being my SIL we have to at least try and keep things civil and overall it’s just easier for everyone when there’s less tension.

342,"There is a person in my social circle that is well integrated, goes along with everyone, sets up group initiatives, we have the same interests, and is generally liked...And I have come to dislike them.

The worst point of our relationship came after a discussion where I think they didn't behave fairly towards a couple of friends (And I still think they didn't but I let it slide for the good of the group) and I confronted them about it.

Maybe I came off too strong, especially because the ""offended"" parts actually sided with them and admitted some faults on their part, but I didn't want them to get off the hook that easily. I felt even betrayed by my friends because I was livid and I wanted them to be livid, *anyone* to be livid at this person. It didn't happen. I am the only one who has a problem with them and this thought is troubling me.  I don't want to bring up this issue again because I know I'd get stonewalled.  


I hate how they managed to grow past that argument and last night, when we had a meetup, they were as chummy as nothing happened between them while I had to hide I was literally seething with rage. In fact, I was downright uncomfortable with my friend being there, but I didn't say anything.

I hate that I have to share my time with my actual friends. Especially since he's on every social occasion.

Part of me just wants them away and wants things the way they were before. Yet, another part of me knows that this is irrational. Someone suggested I just take a break from these people, but not only I care enough for them, but I also have this delusion (Or not) that if I did that they would ""win"" and I don't want to let that happen. 

Yet, I want things to get better. There was a time I got along with this person. If I managed to go back to that I don't know if I'd be happy, but I want to try.  I know that they don't deserve this much vitriol, but that's who I am.

Part of me wants to forgive them.

Summary: I (25F) met my ex when we were 17. We were together for 5 years, during which he manipulated, gaslit, controlled, guilted, pressured, dismissed, and overall mentally abused me. Depending on how inclusive your definition is, it could be said he sexually abusive as well.
My family tried warning me early on, but, being a stubborn teen in my first relationship, I defended everything he did.

I only managed to get out because I met someone else who treated me with basic respect and dignity. This was two years ago. The first year and a half, I completely erased my abuser and those memories from my mind. Now they're coming back - and it's driving me insane.

I'm in therapy, but other concerns have overshadowed any discussion or progress on this topic (I'm actively battling suicidal plans). A couple months ago, I tried reaching out after no contact to retrieve the precious ashes of our deceased kitten that I'm still mourning. Of course, despit reserved and polite messages, he never responded.

I have *a lot* of repressed anger towards him. I fantasize of physically hurting him. It's difficult not to refer to him in unsavory terms. I want to confront him and force him to acknowledge the trauma he's caused. There's a lot of unhealthy thoughts going on and I'm really struggling to keep them at bay.

So I’m 22 now and that bully stuff is from 10 years ago.
He was cruel to me,popular dude so at some point almost the entire school went with it. It was so bad that I had to change schools.

The reason why he bullied me is super embarrassing too, he saw me picking my nose and well....yeah.
Until this day I cringe so hard that I have to stim when I think about it.
I saw him the last time roughly 2 years ago, I was sitting on a bus, he and some friends got on it and sat behind me. I couldn’t stay on that bus for a minute, I got such a bad anxiety attack that I had to leave the bus. I think he didn’t even realized I was on the bus.

So, I’m on tinder and out of the sudden his face popped up. I swear to the gods I almost flipped my phone against the wall. My heart was racing and I almost swiped left but then I thought “calm tf down, you don’t have to be afraid of a picture” cause it’s my new thing, facing fears upfront and try to overcome it.
So I was looking at his profile and calmed down after some time. I read his info and swiped...right. Don’t ask me why I don’t know. We had a match. He probably couldn’t recognise me cause I had a huge glow up and I’m using my nickname there. I thought “okay,good to know”
And then he started messaging me and I just went with it. By now we’re texting daily on Instagram and I’m actually excited when I get a message from him, we share 10/10 the same interests, like the same music and even want to do similar Jobs in the future. We wanted to meet a couple of days ago (don’t worry, with masks and outside) but something came up and now we want to do that after Christmas.

Now, like a complete idiot, I looked this up after I had argued the wrong point. Turns out trimming the nails is a pretty healthy habit for both you and your cat if done correctly without hurting it. And my brother didn't even trust himself with doing it and took his cat to the vet to get it done properly.

So I feel pretty shitty about it but I can't swallow my pride and admit that I was wrong, specially after insisting so furiously on my wrongful point. Do I tell my brother that I was wrong and face the never ending consequences (sibling rivalry is pretty intense in our household), or say nothing and hope he will eventually forget about it?

365,"Im having some difficulty with the people who live above me; since they moved in they have started moving around their furniture really late at night/ early morning, and if its not furniture its slamming and dropping things to the ground really aggressively to the point where the walls will shake. 

I have tried talking with them, only for them to ignore me the moment i mention the noise. 
So instead i have been submitting noise complaints to the buildings staff, but the people above me have been ignoring them as well. 
The complaints are going to the property management as well, but so far nothing has been done, and the lack of sleep ive been able to get is starting to affect me more and more. 
This has been a ongoing problem for 2 months now, with no signs of improvement.

366,"I'm on the verge of 25, I have a semi stable job and decent savings. 

I was going to move this year but covid happened. My girlfriend has made it explicitly clear she has no interest in moving together for at least some more months, but I'm not sure I can keep living like this. I have little privacy in this house and my parents, who think they are the chosen ones and constantly put themselves in covids way, are trying to kill me (via covid).

Living with my partner was the excuse I needed to move out but right now I don't know how to rationalize it. I could ride it out until July when I get my new work contract which might put me in a new city but I'll also be absolutely miserable for the next 6 months, or I could move out now to my current city on a six month lease, take a smaller income, but have the freedom of my own place.

367,"Hello,
Lately I’ve been finding it very hard to be motivated, generally, to wash the dishes it takes 10 minutes but I’d rather just think about it in bed for 3 days, and to clean my space takes about an hour but I’ll just watch the chaos build up till I am lying in a pile of trash on a dirty mattress, I love to practice and learn guitar and always feel fulfilled after but lately I haven’t touched the guitar in months, I love to paint and create and express myself through my art yet I can’t pick up a paint brush even though my easel has an unfinished painting of mine I see everyday that taunts me; I feel like people have an idea of me as a productive/creative person and I enjoy being that person and doing the things I love but I can’t bring myself to do it these days? But how strange of a feeling to be more comfortable lying in bed doing absolutely nothing and having all the time in the world to do the things that bring me joy but rather just falling into a habit of ignoring them and continuing with the habits that make me depressed..

 Instead of being bitter he's still managed to speak so highly of her which caused me to post here as I'm not used to a man being dumped and not speaking ill of their ex partner so I thought he was still carrying a torch for her even when he told me he wasn't.
He's always managed to stay strong and this is the first time I have heard him sound completely dejected. Does anyone have any ideas to how I should approach this situation as losing him is something that I can't have happen and I want to salvage this without pushing him.

My parents both agreed that our **new neighbours** were the ones to blame cause *""They hate Christmas""* like some sort of bad Grinch motive but I wanted to believe they didn't. I looked up some other advice about similar situations and it seemed that it could be the work of a bird or something since we have lots of them around \[we live in Australia\] but just this evening **we found more broken**. 

I'm starting to get mad cause these were 10 bucks each and we bought like seven of them and someone keeps trashing them on **our property**. I'm more mad that if it was our neighbours that they haven't bothered to complain to us and instead think that breaking our stuff is a better way of handling their one sided conflict. **What do we do??**

376,"When I was little my mom and dad will always be in arguments they would always fight. My mom would always tell me my dad cheated on her and  my dad always said that my mom cheated on him first. My dad has gotten in trouble by the cops multiple times and has been to jail about 4 times. 

I saw things I shouldn’t saw as a kid. There where times where me and brother would sleep with my parents and they would have sex when we were sleeping and there was times where I would wake up and wonder what was going on. 

After my mom finally broken up with my dad she would tell me all these bad things about my dad and when I would go visit my dad in California he would also tell me bad things about my mom. 

When I got to the age about 10 or 11 I asked my mom about what I saw and heard when I caught them having sex. She seemed very embarrassed and about and she just told me that she knows she was wrong about it and it was a mistake about it. 

When I turned 12 my mom got a new boyfriend and he was a drug dealer. He would smoke weed in front of me and my brother. We always had to get new houses and cars. He was always mean to us but when he didn’t smoke he would be nice to us rarely. He was very overprotective of my mom there was times where he was be so mad if he caught her talking to another guy or if she had any friends girls or boys he would be angry. 

There was this one time where my mom and her boyfriend would always always and I mean always get into arguments about him seeing my mom with another guy and me and my brother where just watching them yell at each other until he punched my mom in the face and he busted her lip open. 

When my moms boyfriend got caught with the cops for having a loaded gun in the car and 50 gram of weed and for also a wanted criminal for a while he got served for 6 years. My mom didn’t want to wait for him and broke up with him and she knew she was giving us a wrong example so she decidedly leave the guy and get a new house. She had to go to work she would only get payed a little. My dad has to pay at least 500$ for me and my brother to have stuff for school and new clothes and shoes. 

My dad didn’t want to send 500$ Bc he knew that my mom would beg him to send me and brother 500$ my mom didn’t have a choice but to beg him so that we can have it stuff and if she didn’t have enough money to pay the rent she would have to use the money my dad sent. 

I noticed that my dad liked seeing my mom suffer but I don’t think he realized that me and my brother were also suffering. We barely had food to eat and shoes to wear we always had to wear black clothes so people wouldn’t tell we weared the same clothes to school. 

My mom always been a nice mom and she been there for me and my brother. She just kept on getting the wrong guy. My dad has always been nice for me and my brother when we would go visit him but he isn’t always there. He would call us and text us but then he would text or call us anymore and when we try to text or call him he won’t answer. 

If he does call or text it’s always about my mom cheating on him or her doing bad stuff and it’s the same with my mom. They can never talk to each other on the war to plan if we can go see my dad Bc they are always arguing about the past. 

My mom would say one thing about my dad and my dad would say one thing about my mom but idk how to believe. I started believing my mom and took her side but this whole time I was on my dad side Bc I’ve felt bad for the way he is. I always defended him. I always got mad at my mom for saying bad stuff about him and when I would hear my dad say bad stuff about my mom I wouldn’t care I would laugh. I was scared about my dad. I was scared that he would completely leave me and my brother life. 

My mom would say that my dad would say to my mom that I wasn’t his real daughter or that I was a mistake. I never believed my mom after my dad called me and asked me if I was talking to guys and in reality I did but I would lie to him and say no Bc I always got scared when my dad would get mad. He said I better had not Bc he doesn’t want his daughter to be a hoe. I felt so sad and I still took his side. 

Me and my mom started getting into arguments about my dad. Why I always took his side and not her side. I never told her why Bc I felt like she would never want me to be her daughter again. 

I’m 14 years old now and I still go through this.
My dad hasn’t text me since before Thanksgiving until Dec.24th he only said hi. And the I don’t love him anymore. 

I feel so bad about everything. I feel like im such a disappointment to my mom and dad. I’ve tried talking about my feelings when I get the confidence but they never listen. They don’t let me speak it always about their past. 

I always having anxiety when im talking to people i feel like I’ma end up like my parents or ima say something wrong. I tend to bite my nails or my lip until they bleed. 

My brother is 12 years old he knows what’s going on but my parents don’t tell him anything about the past. They says it’s only me Bc I’m older.

377,"I got kicked out of school during my 12th year, which was earlier this year.

378,"Hello, if (19) have a relationship with a m (18). We are together for over a year and love each other very much and planning a future together.

 I am currently living in my parent’s flat, alone and miss some human presence here.
I can’t live with my parents because we don’t have a good relationship and it’s a service for both of us to be separated and i’m studying in another town. And i really wish to live with my boyfriend, at least try it. I can have some other roommate but i don’t want to lose my only privacy with my bf there. 

He lives in the dormitory in the same town and visits me often. He really wants to live with me too but doesn’t know how to bring it up properly to his parents. He has a communication problem and he is raised to never say something personal to them, he even can’t stand up for himself or me properly. I understand that his nature is like this and it can’t be resolved quickly. He sometimes brings it up but because his parents are against that, his mum always thinks up some objection and he doesn’t know what to say or how to “fight” back. 

He admits that he is afraid and he’s very sorry about that (last time he cried because of that) and promised to figure something out and try harder.   BUT he got permission to live with me after he will graduate from high school (he graduates in a year and a half). 

But there is some other problem too. My sister has a flat too and my father wants to sell both of them and buy another one which is bigger and better for us but we would have to live together. I don’t like the idea of living with my sister (except having a bigger place) but i can’t oppose my father because it’s his flats and i’m grateful to have it at all. 

My boyfriend knows about this idea but he still isn’t encouraged after. When i move in with my sister, i lost all sleepovers and privacy with him and after he graduates, he will no longer be able to live with me (for a long long time until we earn some money which will be hard because we are both going to hard university and we won't have that much time). 

It’s hard for me to understand that his fear is bigger than to have this because i have the opposite nature. But for him, his nature is really like that (he sometimes rather don’t buy food for himself than to have social contact with people). He was on therapy for a short tíme because of me but it was pointless because he couldn’t talk to him and didn’t open properly. 

I am very exhausted from this and it lasts for months already, it’s causing a relationship problems to us but i don’t want to break up. What should i (he) do? (sorry for bad English)

TL;DR - My adult boyfriend wants to live with me but doesn’t know how to bring it up to parents because he is afraid to communicate with them, do i have a right to be disappointed in him?

379,"I was based for years, for most of my life. I was controlled, insulted, yelled at, degraded and I got the shit beat out of me for years, for most of my life, and these days I still have to put up with my family calling me to ask if I finally ""forgave"" my abuser, if I ""got over it"" and if I'm spending a happy christmas with my abuser.

I'm having a mental breakdown right now while crying and I have a date with a friend in one hour. How is it possible that my family tells me these things?

The more I try to explain the abuse, the more they tell me that it happened years ago and I should ""get over it"" to have mental peace. No, I have mental peace and a good life until I have relatives and family friends to ask me explicitly about this shit. 

And they're the one who try to make me feel like I'm in the wrong for acting like this and telling them to stop everytime they bring my abuser.

I'm tired. I'm in the middle of a mental breakdown. But I know I'm right because if I wasn't I wouldn't be dying inside everytime I've had to see my abuser and fake that everything is right.

I just want to tell all of them to fuck off, but I need to be patient and wait for a couple of months until I financially can.

How is it possible that my OWN family tell me these things? How is it possible that they tell me on my face ""if your husband hits you that's bad but if your parents do it it's different and you must forgive them"".

Sometimes I wish it was rape and not physical abuse because rape is the only thing they seem to take seriously. At least they took my uncle molesting me seriously. 

But they make me feel like I'm crazy for asking them to stop trying to make me have a relationship with my abusers.

Fucking hell how do I calm down? I'm gonna see a friend and she's a good person but I can't tell him anything of this because she seems to be the type that also believes you should put up with your family even if they beat you.

In the summer I had received a temporary restraining order thrown against me for texting about my kid's health and education, which I managed to fend off pro se while going through an inpatient psych care (two years of parental alienation), and of course losing my 4 year job in the process.

I chose to have a kid because I wanted to nurture hope of the future. My ex chose me to have a kid, because I was more gullible than the previous two spouses.

390,"So when I was a kid, and even to this day but I have been in therapy now to learn to control it far more, I have had very bad anger outbursts. As a kid, I would throw tantrums almost every day/night until I was about 12 years old. I am not sure why, but I was just an extremely emotional child(today, I feel that the same thing results in me having panic attacks). But anyway, I would sometimes during my rages scare my sisters.

I also think I was very narcissistic, almost psychopathic, and generally uncaring as a child. I, for example, can remember chasing her around, terrorizing her just for fun. I can remember sharing beds with her at a hotel, and just cruelly hitting her or kicking her under the sheets. I had no reasoning behind it other than I, for no good reason, would feel angry at her(as I recall) and would feel the need to lash out. I had no morals really stopping me from doing it at that age. I think about this feeling and how it really is evil, feeling a sadistic instinct toward your own sister...

At around 13 or so I started to realize what  dick I was being and started to develop some level of morals, I started being much nicer to my sister, but the damage was already done at this point and she was scared of me. She would always avoid me, and despite the fact that I had turned into a much calmer person(who would certainly never physically harm her), she would never really forgive me. I have apologized directly to her for how I acted, and her stance is basically still that I am just fucked in the head permanently.

It obviously fucks with me, as this is (1) not a normal relationship to have with your sister and (2) it makes me feel very guilty/inadequate as a person. Maybe she is right, and all the good relationships I have now are fake, and the angry monster inside me that used to, with no real remorse, attack my sister is still there.

Basically, I am looking for (1) reassurance that I'm not totally evil despite what I did as a child being very bad, and (2) advice on how to mend the relationship with my sister. FWIW, I have another sister(who is only 14) and she likes me. She remembers me having tantrums and stuff, but doesn't hold it against me now--likely because I never physically harmed her. Has anyone else gone through anything similar? Especially women, did you ever have a brother who was cruel to you and then later changed and you forgave him?

I know that Reddit insists that ""it's okay to be a virgin till your late 30s, there's someone for everyone hehe :)"", but let's face it - it fucks with your head in a way you can't imagine if you're not in that predicament. Seeing my friends with girlfriends, numerous one night stands, FWB type situation and just generally having casual sex and connections with women while I'm constantly alone kills me. Even guys who I served in the army with and are absolute pieces of shit, tell my how they fuck and abuse girls they met after a short convo in tinder and all I want to do is kick my own teeth down my throat for never even getting past the third date. All the bitterness and resentment I've gathered made me rotten to the core. My mood is a pendulum that swings between apathy and anger. 
I read all the fucking advice on everything fucking self improvement subreddit. 
I improved my body to the point people ask ME for fitness advice. I quit porn, I quit social media. I have hobbies, I can entertain myself for years with all the projects I have written down for myself, I have friends, I'm funny, I dress well, I'm 6'1 and the funniest thing is, the more I improve, the angrier I get.
I've went on dates but it always falls through because they suddenly still have feelings for their ex, or they're busy with schoolwork or whatnot. Or they decide to stop talking to me for a month after a really good date because it 'made them feel things' and they need time to think. I have to jump through burning hoops just to get some fucking companionship.
Anyway at this point I've fallen into the ""fox and sour grapes"" trap, I reek of bitterness and resentment and I don't even bother because frankly, I kind of hate women now. I just think about girls I know getting fucked to make me angry enough to go to lift weights or run, or write another angry disgusting song with angry disgusting lyrics or go and snap at my mom for no apparent reason, or try and improve myself just so I don't go insane from the resentment and self hatred.
I went to two therapists for over 10 meetings with each and it felt like a total waste of money. My barber who's a flat earther gave me more profound guidance than these two dweebs. My psychiatrist just gave me antidepressants that I'm still trying to taper off without the hellish withdrawals.

It was not really a big deal then, we got along but I was happy to leave

Then March 2020 came and just as we were going in lockdown, I escaped a violent relationship

I went back to my parents because no way I was going to live alone and not even see another human or go out for months.

They helped me so much and have been there for me so much I bonded with them like never before. Honestly before I loved them but found them annoying, and I really bonded with them like I would with friends because there was no more authority 

I’m going to leave to start a new job that’s like an hour away.. And I feel sad and I’m going to miss them and I don’t know how to not feel like that.

I was okay once that was said but I still had a feeling that something wasn’t right, so I decided to talk to her about it and I broke down and cried, I told her how I was feeling and petrified but didn’t know why I was feeling like that. And she cuddled me told me she loved me and everything will be okay. One morning I decided fuck it I needed to check her phone, which is the last thing I wanted to do cause I’m not that kind of guy, hated having to do it, anyway I managed to recover most of there chat on Snapchat and oh my god I felt sick to my stomach, she told him she still found him attractive and still wanted to have sex with him, there was pictures and videos, so when the time was right later that day I gave her the option to come clean, she lied again, then I told her that I’d seen everything and at first to me she seemed more concerned that I’d seen them than she she was guilty, then I got the im really sorry it won’t happen again I’ll delete my Snapchat which she has for now she loves me, doesn’t want to lose me, I feel like she’s cheated on me in a way and broken me and changing me into someone I would never want to become which is jealous and controlling and checking her phone while she’s asleep I hate it but it’s really hurt me, I never thought she’d do something like this, I’ve never been in this situation and I don’t know how to deal with it.

Back story I've been with my girl friend for over a year now I'm 23 she's 25 with a daughter (2) who is not mine. I work full time and she works part time. I got diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma but have recently beat it (yay!)
We've had a pretty shakey relationship so far but it's been getting better thankfully I work I come home I spend time with her and her daughter then I go to sleep, I've been gaming for the majority of my life but I haven't gamed since I starting seeing her.

The Story: I was lying in bed the other night with my girlfriend and I told her I was going to start playing Wow again and meet up with my old buds for an hour a day, a couple days later she had a go at me saying that I prioritize the game over her even though I only started playing for an hour each day literally an hour max. She started spinning shit saying I could be spending that time with her and her daughter but I choose to play these games I should've well outgrown by now I tried talking to her saying I'm entitled too have a hobby and what not but she didn't have a bar of it and pretty much said if I continued too game she would dump me. My mind's going really crazy about this situation I'm angry but I'm more hurt than anything I tried explaining I've met Life long friends on WoW but she thinks it's just a game for kids and I should grow up I absolutely have no idea what to do I love her and her daughter so much it would break me if I left them both. 

I need help on what action I should take from here on out o dont want to act out of anger and leave her then end up regretting it.

I'm a pretty diligent student, I never took a day off during the past three months and I always tried my best not to stay behind.

407,"Hi. So I could use some advice on how to proceed here.
 A few months ago I was hanging out with someone who rented a room in a share house. I accidentally spilled a cup of tea on the carpet, whoops! Try to clean it up straight away with some warm soapy water. 
Mostly goes away but there's still a noticeable mark there. Over the next few days try a few different remedies to get rid of the strain... Call in a professional cleaner to have a crack at it.  
There's still a mark. Have had a few different cleaners take a crack at it now.
Now, my friend's moved out but the homeowners are saying they're going to probably replace all the carpet in the room, to get rid of the strain, and that could cost between a few hundred and a thousand or so, and would I pay for that?

I want to do right by these people, because yeah it was my stuffup, and want to stay on their good side... But I honestly feel like replacing the carpet is a little extreme and that if it was me, well ...life's too short and it's cool if my carpet has a little tea stain here and there.

What would you do? Just pay for whatever they want to do with the room? Thoughts?",24Dec2020,1
408,"So my family (me, husband, two kids) has lived in the upstairs apartment of a duplex for three years now. In June, we got new neighbors downstairs. A younger couple with some babies and a teenager. From the very beginning, they missed trash night two weeks in a row. The morning of trash day I knocked on their door to let them know it was trash day (maybe they just didn't know that when everyone around them puts out trash, they should too.) No one answered. I texted my landlord a picture of their overflowing trash that was right next to my front door (their back door), she told me that she let my neighbor know, and asked me to take it out for them that time. Whatever, fine. But it continuously has happened again and again since then, they miss a week, and then they start putting trash in MY trashcan. When there was one week that I didn't have room in my can because of their trash, I lost it. I put their trash on their front porch with a note asking them to please take responsibility for their own trash and to stop using our can when they don't have any room in theirs, it's been two weeks since then and their trashcan is not only overflowing right now, there are Little Caesars pizza boxes that were blown into the next neighbors yard, and there now a hole in one of their trash bags from an animal and trash is EVERYWHERE.

The first thing I can think of, is that I worry due to some her past. We’re both 16, she’s had cat calling, she works in a bar where she receives sexual comments (she enjoys being there, has nice co-workers etc, just the customers), and has had a sexual history of giving without receiving (guys that I can only think saw she was vulnerable and wanted someone to look after her). 
By no means do I blame any of the comments on her. No matter what she wears, she’ll still get them, the blame is completely on the men that have taken those actions. I find it upsetting that I can’t be there to say something, and that she lets most of the comments slip at the bar as to not make ‘commotion’.
I can’t stand the idea of someone else staring at her, eyeing up any part of her, because I know the common place of a lot of sad men or boys being fucking disgusting. 
I also worry when she’s out drunk, she’ll be with a few mates and I completely trust her, but I can never trust people walking by - I’m so paranoid of something happening and I don’t know how to control it, she said she likes a lot of protectiveness, but this is different, and it honestly makes me feel miserable.",24Dec2020,1

416,"So, I (30F) have been good friends with my buddy Trevor (26M) for almost 7yrs, starting from early college days.


We are both Americans working abroad in Asia (almost 3yrs now) at the moment. I'm from Chicago, he's from West Virginia.


We both work for the same company but in two different divisions in two different buildings, so we rarely bump into each other. We both equally make the effort to have dinners together and catch-up. 


He has no problems making new friends, whereas I'm the polar opposite. 


He's a lovable dork that attracts all bugs to the porch light and I'm the wet cotton blanket air-drying in a dark room. 


He has a tight circle of office buddies in his division he frequently hangouts with every weekend. My division is more uptight, and everyone keeps to themselves, not the types to mix personal and professional life. So I have no work buddies on my end.


It's hard for me to make new friends these days due to burns from previous long-term friendships in my past that carved out trust and reliability I once had for others. Additionally, I've always naturally been a difficult person to be ""read"" by others.


Since the start of working abroad, I've been very open and vulnerable explaining to Trevor how I suffer from loneliness and isolation. How I miss my friends, family, and support circles back home. Wishing how I can make new friends, have hangouts, do barhopping, or just straight up drinking all night and hate-yourself-next-morning hangovers with the crew.


He frequently tells me stories about the fun activities he experienced with his office friends. Pretty much everything I've missed and longed for. In the past I've been open and explained to him that I know that hes not being deliberate but It does make me envious as well as depressed. As much as I am happy for him, I prefer not to hear any of it. This happened about a year ago.


Note, Trevor was raised in a strict Southern Christian household, where he has never experienced drinking parties, going to bars, making friends outside of church etc... So he's living his best life in Asia at the moment and I'm here for it and support it.


So last night, we have our occasional dinners to catch up with one another. However, for 1 out of the 3hrs he kept talking about how excited he was for the Christmas party with his fellow office mates and all the stuff they were all going to do that night. (He honestly does suffer from a selective memory)


He's a great friend to me, compassionate and supportive yet sensitive and easily feels bad for hurting someone's feelings.


He invited me to spend time with him for a few hours on Christmas day before he leaves for the party. I do want to say something about how I feel about this whole situation but Im afraid to.


Christmas is his favorite holiday but due to the pandemic, this is the first Christmas away from his family back at home. I don't want to dampen his mood or excitement with his office friends tomorrow night.


So, after reading this ass long post, does anyone have any advice how I can ""clearly"" communicate my feelings without hurting my friend's feelings?

417,"Right now Im a socially awkward 28 year old male who is quarantined and watching sailor moon.

In my past, in my younger 20s I had relationships and a social life but I found that I really didnt like who I was back then, and I didnt like the people I was surrounded by.

I quit doing drugs and drinking and now Im just boring. I only have one real friendship which is a bit strained at the moment.

I just want to do fun things. Really get into someone and love them. I am not the kind of guy girls go for though. Not anymore. I have a very intense anxiety disorder and can't hold a conversation without coming off as rude on accident. I have bad skin and I'm hairy like a wolf.

My 20s are almost over and it's been years since I have been with anyone. About 5 years now. I can't imagine anyone being interested in me when there are so many handsome men around. I'm not a real man, I'm not tall, I'm not serious. I'm extremely goofy, like cute things, anime. I'm like a kid basically and I dont actually want to grow up.

418,"I'm going to be completely honest about what I've done and i am well aware how horrible it was. I'm only asking for advice.

I'm half black half white, I've never felt comfortable as identifying with either race, so I just don't. Ever since 8th/9th grade, I've become racist towards my own race. 

It started off with me people pleasing. I would go along with jokes and let my white friends say the N-word. To this day I still feel no emotional connection to the n word, and I will never understand how it affects people.

I didn't feel any genuine malice towards my own race at that time. However in 9th grade, I met this good-looking guy (white.). We became pretty much best friends.
One day he sent me a meme. He warned me that it was incredibly racist before hand but I let him send it because I wanted to prove to him that I could take it. My heart sank when I saw it. I knew it was a joke but my heart hurt so much. I wasn't expecting it to be so horrible. 

It's been 3 years since then, and I've become numb to those kind of things. If I saw that meme again, i don't think I could laugh genuinely, but I also wouldn't care. 

At the same time of those few years, I was finally realising my dad was a horrible person and a horrible father. I had looked up to him and felt strong empathy towards black fathers before figuring this out. Once I realised, my attraction towards black men just stopped. (Note: I don't feel anything negative towards black women, seriously.) Also my dad is also internally racist, and always makes comments about ""black people do this"" and ""black people do that"". He doesn't support BLM. And my mom is white and says stuff like that too and thinks it's funny to say the n-word (she knows it bothers us, but she lacks self control) Although she does support BLM.

Sophomore year and beggining of Junior year (just last school year), I would make people say the n word. Or atleast attempt to, and some people would do it. Everytime I would get someone to say it, my heart would sink. Why the hell would I do that? And what if I made them think it's okay or made them feel like shit for having said it? I know it was horrible.

During the black lives matter rioting, my opinions changed a lot. I agree with the rioting. If you look at history it is the best way to get things done and it's been working. And it made me think of all the things I've ever said, felt, and done. I've always been left leaning but I think this made me more confident in my beliefs.

I want to finally shake myself from internal racism but I don't know how to do that. I don't say the n word anymore as I don't feel like I have the right to. I also feel like I don't have the right to identify as black. I'm not white passing but I do have pale skin and usually people can't tell what race I am so I'll never truly have the black black experience. I feel guilty doing anything that's a part of black culture, like braids, hairstyles, even listening to black music. I don't feel like I have a right to get rid of my internal racism, but I know logically, I do.",24Dec2020,1

I was groomed online by an individual 4 years older than me, between the ages of 12-16. I won't get into the details of the psychological abuse and control, all I'll say is that he received hundreds if not thousands of images of child pornography. I once counted from January 1st, how much I was asked to send over the year and I stopped counting in March when I reached over 400.

I deleted all traces of his presence from my life. The gifts, but also the online chats. I don't have any evidence to come forward with anywhere. I was wondering if police could retrieve deleted facebook chats, and whether its at all worth making a fuss if he's in Australia anyway. I have no idea how I'd go about it. Should I stop wasting my time and just focus on therapy?

We hadn't spoken in years. We broke up because he logged into my Vent account and saw I had smoked weed which he didn't allow. He blocked me, and then contacted me on Instagram every few months, then years, and recently I hadn't heard from him in 2 years maybe. Until the other day where he pops up on my messenger with a happy birthday message. It said he found my account from my mobile number. I have changed my number over 4 times since he knew me. It kind of just solidified my paranoia that everything I put online is monitored by him, and that every interaction and notification is him behind a fake account.

At the start (2012/2013), he was diagnosed with OCD, and I was basically his only friend at school. We would walk around during the small class breaks and shared a lot of interests.

The things that showed up were mild--he would often ask if I'd been imitating him, even when I didn't speak, and once heard his bullies yelling from outside our building. We were on the 14th floor and no one was in front of it.

Then around 2014 he started getting a bit more aggressive, picking fights with my mom and dad--until they divorced in the same year.

After the divorce, he started becoming worse and worse towards me specifically--If I had to guess, it's because my mom was too much of an authority figure for him to consistently pick on, and my younger sister was too quiet, shy and in her own world.

From 2014-2016, it was a lot of him yelling at me for minor things like whose turn it was on the XBOX or the fact that he ate some of the snacks that were actually mine.

In 2016 he was very overweight, and played as a Defensive End in my local football team. For those of you who don't know, those are the players who do the most tackling and brute strength. I hit puberty late, so I was about half his size.

And so, he started getting \*physically\* aggressive. He'd grab me by the shirt like a schoolyard bully, or just by the neck, and threaten many times to hit me.

Later in 2016, we had a fight over a charger before a festival was about to happen. He punched me right next to my eye and I was sent sprawling to the ground. When my mom came out of the shower, she told him he wouldn't go to the festival--I remember him yelling at me and blaming me for all of it while I was still on the floor. From that point on I started treating him as a ghost--Like he was really dead to me. Not talking to him, refusing to listen to anything he said.

It worked for a good while. The rest of 2016 was pretty good in terms of not suffering as much as I did the past couple years.

Then come 2017, my brother is set to move to my dad's house in a nearby city for college. He wouldn't go until March because he turned 18 in February.

That is, until in January, we had another fight over an XBOX controller--in which he spat in my face and hit me when I tried to record audio of him yelling at my mom (which I started doing in case we needed proof for a court case or something.)

My mom kicked him out of the house and sent him towards my grandmother's.

2018 and 2019 were spent working through panic attacks, nightmares and general anxiety--I've never wanted to self-diagnose with PTSD, and still won't, but wouldn't be surprised if that was the cause.

Come 2020, my brother's life is in turmoil. He quit his job for a different one \*before\* he actually got it, and when rejected, was basically a NEET for a while. But he still managed to spend 7000 reais (my currency) on food and cigarettes--I only spend around 1300 a month on food, so he would have to spend a LOT to get that far.

My dad is basically done with him as well after all of this. He's been working non-stop trying to cover for that money my brother spent.

And finally, here are the unhealthy thoughts, the point of this thread:

I just have this feeling that someday my brother's life being in complete disarray will make him snap really badly and go back to the people he's felt hurt the most by. If that were to happen, he would surely come after me specifically, because he absolutely hated the way I ignored him for half a year while he was still in the house--and still ignore him to this day while he isn't.

I don't know what to do about these thoughts swirling in my head that he'll come to my apartment and do something terrible to me again.

428,"Hi, so I ran into an issue the other day. I noticed I get depressed from seeing people on social media happy with friends and family. For me, I have no problem with people being successful, but I get depressed when I see people with friends and family. I have problems with my family and friends myself so it makes things very difficult. To a degree I have some support, but I am missing the kind of relationship with friends and family I see others have. I only have a very small circle of people but I feel like I am missing something from having a mother and father figures in my life even as an adult. The situation from both of them tends to leave me in a bad position, and all my old friends abandoned or betrayed me one way or another. I am unsure of how to handle these emotions. I don't wanna get depressed when I see people happy with friends and family all the time, but I can't deal with not having those same close relationships myself. What do I do?",24Dec2020,1

430,"Using a throwaway because I don't want this connected to my main account. 

I used to be very close to one of my friends and we would talk and hang out pretty regularly before the pandemic, but when it went into full swing we stopped meeting in person for health reasons and we talked more and more infrequently until it stopped altogether for a few months. With news of the  vaccine however we've reconnected and have discussed meeting again. 

Where I'm torn is that in August I had a mental health crises and had to be hospitalized because of it. I'm doing better now, went through therapy and I now do virtual group meetings, and I received a large amount of support from my friends and family excluding one person. I'm not trying to hold a grudge, but I do feel pain that  during a crucial point in my life I didn't receive any support from someone who I considered to be a close friend for a very long time. I feel like the attempt has also fundamentally changed me as a person, so I don't even know if we're compatible as people anymore. 

I also acknowledge that I have no idea what they have had going on during the pandemic, and that its very possible that they A: Had no idea that I was hospitalized, B: Had their own things going on, or both of those options. We were also close and a part of me wants to be close again. I just don't have an idea on how to even approach the topic.  

I've been torn on this for a week now, and I really don't know what the appropriate response to this would even be. Would it be worth it to attempt to reconnect or would it be better if I just let it fizzle out and move on?",24Dec2020,1

Hello good people of Reddit! I’m 17 years old and so is my friend who’s now turning 18(on January 21). She is nerdy, likes watching tv shows, enjoy movies and laying around at her house. She likes reading sometimes. Also loves driving around listening to music. She loves physics and math and biology and also is a fan of puns and dad jokes! She likes Harry Potter and pretty much anything marvel. She doesn’t wear makeup like once in a blue moon she’ll put on mascara. Where I live you can drink and gamble and everything when you’re 18 btw. She doesn’t drink and doesn’t plan to I believe. She is the best person I know! She has blue eyes and dark hair and she is like not short and not tall. I just gave you a bunch of info about her and I hope you could help me make her birthday the best it can be! My budget is like  120$ max!

2 days ago I got a coffe at my local coffee shop (I'm quite close with the staff and have been trying to support them ever since the pandemic happened). A friend of mine with a few of his friends came by and we talked for about 30 minutes.

Later that day he informed us that he'd met up with a friend of his who tested positive.

Today he, too got tested but the result was negative. However, he was told that the results would be more reliable on Saturday.(?)

I was supposed to spend today with my parents and my 70yo grandma who's moved to this city 2 years ago - she doesn't really have anybody here except for us, especially not anyone to spend Christmas with.

438,"(18M) Okay, so I should start off by saying that I've always struggled with depression and anxiety issues and have always had a hard time dealing with and understanding my own emotions no matter how rational or irrational they are, and recently I'm really struggling with self-hatred and finding happiness within myself and have always found myself attaching it to other people and I don't know how to change it. I haven't had many friends in my life and my friendships have never been the best or the healthiest and it's usually because of me.

One of my friends (19F) I've known for about a year and a couple of months now. I felt interested in them (as a person) since we met as I felt we had similar interests and like a lot of the same films and are both interested in art and music. Since I met them I always seemed to be attached to them and always found myself in a position where I could be easily hurt without them realising. For example, this time last year they told me they couldn't hang out for a while because of studying and although I never made this clear because I felt I was being unreasonable I felt very rejected by it. We became closer (over the internet) when the pandemic started and after all our exams were cancelled. It was around this time that I felt like I had an unhealthy friendship with them. I always found that I wanted their approval and would always listen to music or watch films they mentioned to try to get them to like me and if I ever felt like I had a bad interaction with them would get very depressed and feel like shit for a couple of days afterwards. 

Although she's always very nice to me whenever I get a text from her now I get incredibly anxious and nowadays I never text her because I feel so anxious and get this sinking feeling. I don't really know why but I think it's because I've attached too much of my worth to what she thinks of me. I feel like I am not very honest with her about myself because I'm worried about what she will think about the things I spend my time doing. Sometimes, if I mention a book I'm reading or something and she says she's seen it or read it I often feel unable to read it without thinking about what goes through her head when she does. And if she says she doesn't like it I don't seem to enjoy it anymore. I feel like I should mention that this could all just be a byproduct of my own depression because I find it hard to enjoy anything sometimes and maybe it's no surprise that I can't be happy or have a normal friendship. 

It was a few months ago that I became attracted to her. I feel very bad about this because I feel like I am invading her privacy in a way. Although I've never said anything to her (and I feel she only sees our friendship as a purely platonic one) I often think about her when masturbating even though I think it's bad and don't want to. In conversations we've had in the past where sex has come up I've found myself very interested in what she thinks about it and find myself thinking about it long after the conversation has ended. If I'm watching a film that she has seen that has sex references in I can never enjoy the film without wondering what went through her head when she watched it and often I don't enjoy it and want to stop thinking about it. I feel like this makes me a bad person and/or slightly perverted and I really want to stop it. 

I don't feel like I want to be in a relationship with her because I feel like I wouldn't be very good in a relationship but I feel very sexually attracted to her and sometimes want to be in relationship with her for that reason even though I feel it isn't a good idea to be in a relationship with someone who I am so anxious around and sometimes dishonest about myself to. I also feel like I'm ruining any chance I have at having a normal friendship because I sometimes feels like she values our friendship but I sometimes feel like I wished I'd never met her because of how attracted I've become to her and wish that I could see her as just a friend and not attach so much of my self worth to her. 

I know that this is all my problem and it's in my head but I don't know how to adjust my attitudes towards other people and could really use some advice.",24Dec2020,1

444,"I (19F) am a college student. J (18F) is my best friend. 4 years ago, she confessed she had a crush on me.

I've been dating the same person (20M) for 5 years. I love him. Despite this, in the 10th grade, when I was 15, I had a crush on J too. I told her that even though I felt for her, a relationship wouldn't work. We came to the conclusion that we're just happy to have eachother in our lives in any way possible. Ultimately, I chose my bf. That was 4 years ago.

Then we got accepted into the same college &amp; decided to room together. It was a turbulent semester. She had a short temper. I often let myself get treated badly to keep the peace.

4 months ago, we talked abt feelings again. I was honest - I told her I didn't like her romantically anymore &amp; that a relationship wouldn't work anyway. She didn't believe me. She admitted that she's obsessed w me (her words not mine). She's made lots of new friends, but says that my company is special &amp; she craves my attention. She says she's finding it hard to move on bc when she meets a new person she thinks, ""they're not you."" 

This worries me/fills me w guilt. I tell her that's not healthy &amp; that I'd be happy to introduce her to new people. She laughs, says ok. It ends there. 

2 months after that, my bf &amp; I decide to try being single for a bit. Didn't enjoy it. Went through a manic episode. Two days after I became single (J didn't know yet), I got high with a classmate and we ended up making out. As I was hanging in the guy's dorm, J knocks on the door to gift me an energy drink. I answered the door, got the drink, thanked her. After she left, I realized I was covered in obvious hickeys. So I texted her, feeling obligated to explain the whole situation w my bf, so that she doesn't think I'm cheating. It was very casual. She says ""Oh cool. Have fun!"" 

An hour later, J bangs on the door again - hard. I open. She DRAGS me out. I've never seen her so pissed. She screams abt how she tries so hard to make me happy &amp; how she can't believe I ""sucked the dick of the 1st white dude I saw."" She demands to know why I didn't tell her abt my bf. I told her it happened two days ago, that I was still processing. Then she demands to know that if I was single, why hadn't I kissed her. She yells abt how she's hurt, how she's been having a breakdown for the last hour. I'm at a loss. She gets angry at my silence. I explain that if I kissed her, she'd get even MORE confused &amp; stuck on me. I want her to move on! Also, I didn't WANT to kiss her! In the end, she stormed off. Overall an embarrassing/demeaning experience.

She didn't come back to the dorm for days afterwards. 2 weeks later, my bf &amp; I realized that dating is what makes us happiest, so we got back together. Me &amp; the dude I made out with are good friends now. J &amp; I are fine now too. She apologized for lashing out/being manic.

But I still haven't stopped thinking abt it. It's driving me crazy. Was I in the wrong in this? 

More clarification: I didn't know she still felt that way about me, since the whole ""I have a crush on you"" thing happened 4 years ago, and after that, we mutually agreed to just stay best friends. I had no idea she still felt so deeply. The good news is that after what happened, she's been going to counseling and it's been getting better. Besides her, I have one other roommate (it's a 3 person dorm), and we're all  working together to buy an apartment &amp; move out. She's chilled way the fuck out after what happened because she realized she was way out of line, but I always worry that somehow it was my fault because I lead her on. 

I think she realized that she needed some distance  to sort out her feelings, so she hangs out and sleeps over with the new friends she's made a lot. She's a really social person so she knows basically everyone in the building by now. It's been really zen since then.

As for my boyfriend, he really isn't a fan of her for obvious reasons, but he understands she's my best friend and that I don't want to lose her, which is why I tolerate so much. Her brash/outgoing personality is good for me, just in moderation. I'm going to see how this next semester works out before making any big decisions.

This started freaking me out, and for the longest time I wanted to tell her to stop talking about such topics as they're sensitive to me, and I felt super unhappy talking to her ( for. Context I'm suffering from depression, and I'm 2 months self harm free )

He only plays the games he wants to and will only play when he wins.

This is my (18F) first reddit post. So I have been with my boyfriend (19M) for almost two years, and he is the love of my life. He is my biggest support, and we work very well together. We've gotten past the honeymoon stage, and we've dealt with some hard times, and at the end of the day my gut tells me he's the one. We don't live together right now, but I lived with him for a few months during college and it was the happiest I've been compared to living at home with my family.

Obviously college this year has been completely different than expected. All of my courses were online for my first semester as a freshman, and they are going to be online again for next semester. The way this pandemic is going, I have no idea if we'll ever go back to in person classes. However, I am doing very well with my courses and I also really enjoy the school I picked. 

Then there's my family. My parents are divorced. So on the one hand there's my dad and stepmother who I am completely ready to move away from. I don't really feel at home with them, they are pretty controlling, and honestly they are another story altogether. On the other hand there's my mom and three brothers, who I love and would miss if I moved away, but at the same time I don't enjoy spending time at their house for very long. They live in a small apartment and I have to sleep on the couch, so I can't really live there full time. 

So my boyfriend currently lives with his family, but they are all struggling financially and have a better opportunity in a different, far away, warmer state. And they plan to move in the next few months. And I am allowed to go with them. 

But I don't know if I should go or not. My gut tells me I should, for these reasons:
1. I have always wanted to get out of here to a warmer state with better weather, and this is the perfect opportunity to finally do it. I feel like if I don't take the chance now I never will.
2. I want to finally stand up to my family and tell them that it's time for me to move on and be honest with them about how I feel. I know they wouldn't support me going, but maybe it's time for me to make my own decisions. 
3. Being with my boyfriend and is family is the happiest environment that I've ever been in. 
4. I can't imagine being away from my boyfriend if I didn't move with him. Neither of us want to do long distance, and we have talked for hours about this. We see a future together, and he is willing to get a job in the new state to help support me at college because my parents probably aren't going to if I move. We really love each other and are connected, and I feel like I shouldn't let that go.
But of course there's a lot of reasons I feel like I maybe shouldn't move with him.
1. College. If online semesters don't continue, I would have to transfer schools and I don't know if that's the best idea or not. 
2. Family. I love my mom and my brothers and my little brothers especially would be upset if I'm not around anymore. 
3. Money. I am not doing well financially, obviously, being a college student and only working a part time job over breaks. I would have to rely on the support of my boyfriend for a while, and I don't know if I should put that strain on him. 
4. What if it's the wrong decision and I'm just being naive? I know that I am still young and have my whole life ahead of me, but I just can't shake the feeling that I'm right about this and my boyfriend is the one. 

And just to be clear my boyfriend is not putting pressure on me to go with him. But neither of us want to be that far apart. So, what should I do? Should I stay or should I go? I am open to all advice.",24Dec2020,1
459,"Lately I have noticed that it is very difficult for me to have full conversations or befriend other teens. I do have a small group of friends but due to personal reasons I can't see or talk to them that much anymore. I am starting to feel very lonely and it is getting into me. 

Whenever I try to hang out with new people I just end up being an extra that is walking behind them and listening to the conversations they are having without me silently. And even when I am in the conversation I can't help but not care about the subject they are talking about and it is very hard to relate to them. I try to talk with them but it always ends up as a small talk that will end with them going back to their phones or distracted by somebody else. 

The weird thing is it is not as hard when it comes to talking with adults. I have a lot of fun talking with adults because they are always interested in the subjects I bring up and we end up having a nice conversation with real human connection. But I can't go out with adults and play Minecraft with them can I? 

I am starting to feel like an invisible freak because it is hard to fit in with others who are my age. It feels like the only way for anybody to like me is if I change myself",24Dec2020,1
460,"TL;DR - I like him and want to tell him, but I shouldn’t and won’t date him because I’m overcoming codependency, treating depression, and learning to focus on my career and traveling goals; and he’s a [street dude](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Street%20Nigga). I’m losing so much sleep over this, it’s ridiculous.

——

I’d be perfectly fine with keeping my feelings to myself if all of you say I should, but given that I’m thoroughly confused and feeling ridiculous, I’m unable to make a decision on whether or not I should tell him while keeping the boundaries established. 

I’ve already made it clear that I’m not pursuing relationships, and we’ve been building a friendship before we even had feelings for each other, but it’s killing me knowing that I like him now. The sad part is he’s said a few times that “someone like me wouldn’t like someone like him anyway,” all because I’m “out of his league.”

But I do like him, and it’s not even a “if you really did like him then dating shouldn’t be a problem” kind of situation. 

I’ve had serious codependency issues in the past few “relationships” I’ve been in. I’m also learning to manage my depression and focus on my Faith, because that’s been the main factor that keeps me grounded. Because I was codependent, I would forget to take care of myself and neglect my hobbies just to satisfy my narcissistic, possessive, or insecure partners. Later down the line, I would realize this, feel guilty, and leave. Now I just want to focus on being “selfish” and not date at all, and if I had a change of heart at some point, I would prefer dating someone who shares my same Faith. This is just the bare basics of why I shouldn’t date anyone right now.

And why I shouldn’t date him specifically: he smokes and drinks a lot, he doesn’t have any concrete goals, and he’s really caught up in the streets. He’s talked about getting out, but he’s just too caught up. On my end, I’ve always been sober, I plan on going back to school soon, and I want to travel often. So, honestly, dating him is out of the question regardless. Before, codependent me would have been like, “What travel plans and school? Let me try to save him!” But I no longer feel that urge. I do care about him and wish he changed, but only he can do that for himself, and I can only support him on the sidelines.

I just don’t want to send mixed signals, I don’t want him to feel like he’s unlovable or unlikable, I don’t want to pretend with him, I don’t want to lead him on, and I just want to be honest.

I care about him immensely, and he genuinely seems like someone who’s “ride or die” even if I told him this, I just really don’t know if I should because I feel like that’s just too selfish.

What should I do? Thank you for reading this long post 😓",24Dec2020,1
461,"Hi there, this is my first ever post on reddit so yeah...anyways, I've always been pretty close to my dad and mom, but this one moment changed that forever. My phone had died so I asked to use his phone. He gave it to me so I went back to whatever I was doing, but on his phone. So my fingers accidentally clicked out of the app and I didn't wanna go back and sign in again. So I just went to history like I do all the time to go back to the app like I never clicked out, but then I saw this app that changes your phone number. I recognize it because I used it when I had to talk to people over the phone that I didn't want knowing my actual number, so if they're weird I can just delete the number. Me being nosy, I clicked it and he was talking to another women. She even said his legal name. He was calling her beautiful and stuff...I couldn't believe it. Once my phone charged up, I took a picture of it with my phone. The next day I showed my mom. She definitely cried that night and was obviously hurt for the next few days...they've been married for 18 years...we confronted him and he acted dumb. A few weeks after that my mom says how she's not going to leave him. I was so baffled...how? How could you not? But anyways, a few weeks after that my dad revealed how he had depression and how he has been taking pills for it for the last 6 months. That made me feel awful and now I'm wondering maybe he did it to make himself feel better? I don't know...
But my question is, it seems like everyone forgives my dad, should I as well?

465,"So I recently installed Grindr because I was looking for sex but also for fun conversations with people. 

There was this one trans chick that caught my attention. She was really hot and her profile seemed self assured and confident. I contacted her and we chatted before I thought that she ghosted me. Later that night she came in contact with me and we talked about seks and how she wanted to dominate me. 

I needed to send some more pictures of myself (stupid I know but I was thinking with my dick) and she gave me her WhatsApp number. She asked me to make a video grabbing my ass and I did. she wanted to call but I hung up. A good tactic if you ask me from her. 

Than we talked some more and she asked me to suck of an object. I did that to. Both videos didn’t have my face in it. She then asked me if I wanted to see something from her, I gave her a request and she said that she will be back soon.

Then the fun begins she sends me a long message which she clearly has send to other people you only need to change the name. But the message was with treats and how she was going to ruin my life. And that I needed to pay money to let it go (which I am never going to do) I took screenshots of everything and blocked her. I haven’t heard from her since

She also send me screenshots of videos she made with me that she wanted to put on YouTube (with a fucking bandicam watermark lol) with all my contact information in it. Wish is fucking retardet because YouTube will delete that really fast and people aren’t going to which hunt me because i like trans chicks lol.

And she found my facebook probably by reverse image searching one of the pictures. She wanted to make a page and she wanted to add all my friend and show them the things I did. This is less stupid but my family is going to report that shit.

They honestly only put targets on there head if they move on with these things. I doubt that they have an vpn so I am not scared that they will do these things.

466,"Apparently, looking this up its not that uncommon but I woke up to a text for a facebook security code. Tried to access my account from my phone. Everything changed. Logged onto my computer. Changed.

Tried the 'forgot password' thing but it's now linking to a new email. Tried 'another way' which then links to a new phone number. Back and forth, back and forth. Whoever designed this 'verification method' is a real idiot.

I logged onto my original email and lo and behold I had both, ""You've changed the email of your account"" &amp; ""You've changed the password of your account"". I've followed these through and was able to put my original email, &amp; of course changed the password to that too (I considered completely changing the attached email but decided to keep the same email, just in case, I didn't want to put another email on the hacker's radar).

I was shown through my more recent activity (friend requests, comments, posts, etc) to verify my things and delete things that weren't.. All good except the hacker's email was still attached. Ok, I'll just completely remove it once I log in.

469,"So this is more of a WIBTA post with needed advice. I cannot post on AITA because of their silly rules. 

Basically I’m (25F) severely disabled, and because of my disabilities I’m on very, very, strong medications for pain relief daily (they’re liquid not tablets) and have been most of my life. So I got with this guy a few years ago (he’s now firmly an ex for a few years now) and obviously at first things were great blah blah blah. 

Anyway, I started to realise my meds were going down fast and I mean FAST! One bottle of 250ml is meant to last 11 days and I get two bottles per pharmacy pick up. A bottle would be empty after seven days at most. It escalated and it got to the point of where I was ordering my scripts early because I was running out early. I started to wonder if I was addicted and didn’t realise which was strange to me because I know I’m physically dependent on these drugs but I’m not mentally dependent. There’s a massive difference between mental and physical dependency being that if you’re mentally dependent then you want it even when you don’t need it but that’s not me and never has been.

Anyway, I confided in him and he said I must be addicted and taking more than I realised. So I said I’d start a diary log to keep track of my use. When I did my diary I was starting to have leftovers at the end of each bottle which was strange? So we agreed I’d stop the diary as there’s clearly no problem and maybe I just had a block of time in escalated pain. But it started again with drugs going missing. My doctors started investigating me and accusing me of being a junkie (their words) and I was constantly in this state of feeling like I was going insane. My doctors were withholding scripts, I was going into physical withdrawals. I was being treated like scum of the earth by medical practitioners. 

I’d be out and apparently the dogs (all Shih tzu size) had knocked my meds and smashed the bottle off of a unit that’s two foot tall? Makes no sense. 

He then later on had a “suicide attempt”. Now I put that like that because I came home to refill my mini bottle that I take out with me because it was empty and it was meant to be an unopened bottle. Three quarters of it was gone. So I grilled him and grilled him over it until he eventually admitted that he’d tried to kill himself with it and his plan was to drift off in his sleep and I’d find him in the morning. This made me so mentally ill, I was too afraid to go anywhere or do anything for fear that I’d come back and find him dead, because why wouldn’t I believe him? I couldn’t sleep. I was always checking his breathing whilst he was asleep. It. Was. Hell.

But as sense started to kick in months later, I realised that the amount he took vs his body weight - there’s no way on this earth he’d have survived taking that much and if he had, he’d have had his head in the toilet vomiting because that’s what happens when it gets built up in your system, you violently vomit. There’s no way I wouldn’t notice that. 

As it turns out he had took a very large swig of it, enough to notice. So he emptied some elsewhere and saved it as his own private stash. There’s no way with how mentally addicted he was he’d pour it down the sink like he initially claimed upon later confrontation.

Everytime id speak to him he’d gaslight me in every way possible for about two years this was going on. It was probably two of the worst years of my life. I was convinced I was going crazy and that I was this addict who couldn’t control herself. I thought I was an addict that couldn’t even remember taking the high doses. I really felt like I was going insane.

So I started a diary again and didn’t tell him - I started the diary after the “suicide attempt” secretly because something in me didn’t sit right about it in my gut. After a few weeks I’d managed to establish he was definitely addicted to and stealing my meds. Out of a 250ml bottle he’d be stealing *at least* 150ml.

You have to understand how hard this was hitting my life and my mental health, I was in so much pain and couldn’t leave my bed because I had no meds. 
I couldn’t attend uni, I couldn’t leave my bedroom, some days I couldn’t even walk to the bathroom to pee.   I was isolated.   

 I realised he’d also been trying isolate me too, physically restraining me so I couldn’t leave the bedroom (when I was well enough), running and barging me out of the way when I wanted a glass of water so I couldn’t leave the bedroom. This is because he’d always leave my meds downstairs and he’d offer to go get them at any physical cost, my meds always seemed to be in another room and I was never allowed to go get them myself, he always insisted. At first he seemed helpful and caring but after a while it was all clicking together. He was going through my phone when I was asleep, he tried to ban my best friend from coming to see me. He tried to convince me and sabotage my starting university. We’d go to festivals and I’d wake up in nerve pain - so to add context there’s points on my spine that if any pressure at all is applied then I’m in agony, my nerves are all exposed under the skin - I’d wake up like someone had been pressing on them so he’d ruin my festivals so that we didn’t leave the tent, so that I’d fall asleep or pass out from pain and then he’d have free access to my meds-. 

So all of this was clicking into place and all I needed now was proof because he’d gaslighted me so badly I still wasn’t sure if I was going crazy or not. 

I set up a camera and didn’t catch anything mainly because I’m a technophobe and didn’t switch it on properly and the second time I forgot to record, until one day I went upstairs and heard the click of the child-cap on the bottle. I hadn’t said I needed a dose.

I ran downstairs. 

I kissed him. I yanked his head down and forced a snog and I tasted my meds. 

I didn’t say anything but he knew.

So I set my plan into motion of getting him out of my house and breaking up with him. I went to the doctors with my proof - the diary and they believed me, FINALLY! We broke up shortly after.

Anyway, fast forward to now, I’ve recently found out he’s gone for a job as a support worker/ carer for the vulnerable and sick. I’m freaking out and I’d never want anyone else to go through what he put me through, the mental and physical torture. 

So what I’m asking is, WIBTA if I reported him? Would I be TA for potentially causing him to lose his job? 
Part of me feels like I NEED to do this but part of me feels guilty.

I’m male, 19 gonna be 20 in 4 months. I’ve never had any sexual or romantic experiences whatsoever. Never tried, never been in a position to try, apart from when I had a cute girl show interest in me back in junior year of HS and more or less ask me out but i fucked that up by ignoring her (which was scummy of me and I still regret it, but thats water under the bridge).

Truthfully, its because during HS, i was in a rough place and was trying to get my depression in order. And for the past few years after graduating, i just haven’t really cared, been focused on work and hobbies. But I’m starting to care again, and I’d like to try it out. 

I know how unattractive it is though, for an adult man to be not only a virgin, but also completely inexperienced when it comes to dating. Saying its because I didn’t really care until now doesn’t sound much better either, because “what teenage male doesn’t care about girls”?  It’s abnormal. 

I’m not a very good bullshitter, so if I lied about it, the facade would more than likely crumble quickly.

477,"TLDR: My parents are being very toxic with me and trying to shift the blame from themselves. 

I (21 F) and I am living with my parents. I will be posting this in another sub reddit as well, because I really need advive. English is not my first language, so please understand. For context, we do not live in USA. Our culture is more of a community based where children stay with parents until the very end. It is a norm. Neither do we have opportunities, such as part time jobs, for younger people. It gets even harder for females. 

I am just so exhausted. I have been through some traumatic things, and they have severely affected me. I have been diagnosed with clinical depression and post traumatic stress disorder. In this chaos, the only person I trust is my boyfriend and my one friend. They have been super supportive to me in everything. However, initially I had not been open with my parents but eventually with the help of my friends I was able to tell them. I started therapy and my parents were very supportive. In our culture, the families kind of decide the marriages for their children, and for this I was very clear to my parents about my boyfriend and that I wanted to marry him. My parents approved of him since they did know him. However, things started to fall apart. My parents started to lie to me, to my friend and my boyfriend. They painted a different picture in front of me, and a completely different picture in front of my boyfriend, to the point he started to think for a moment that I was being wrong to my parents. 

My breaking point came recently. I had planned a surprise birthday party for my boyfriend and I wanted to sort out some issues that we were having. I was having a difficult time contacting him because my parents would make me switch off my phone, and my mom made me sleep with her because she wanted to keep check whether I was okay or not. This was only stressing me out further, but I didn't know what to do. Eventually, after the entire plan was set my parents refused to let me go. Saying that you need to keep your grace and respect and cannot run off to a guy's house. I lost my mind. I genuinely lost my mind. I locked myself in my room because I just wanted to be alone. my parents kept insisting that I come outside, I refused because I really wanted some time alone. They eventually broke down my door and started to hit me. I broke my phone before they could come in because I knew they would take it and they dragged me down to their room. My face was bruised, my body had bruises. I kept getting nightmares all night. For the next two days, i refused to eat or drink anything. I was tired and I was upset. They didn't even acknowledge they were doing anything wrong. They wanted to take me to another city, which I refused as well. I also found out that they were in contact with my psychiatrist and he agreed on giving me medicines that would get me to sleep all day. 

I took the help of my sister to contact my friends, but my father wouldn't let them meet me. Eventually they tried to stop me or hit me again, but my sisters intervened and pushed them away. I started to cry that I will not stay with them anymore. They stopped and called my friends back and I went to stay with my friend. I stayed at her place for three days, at this point my boyfriend's family asked for my proposal and tried to calm down the situation. My parents sounded upset and eventually apologized, and I came back yesterday, with my boyfriend's family dropping me off. However, today I woke up to a bad gut feeling. I still don't have a phone. I will get a new one tomorrow, but I knew something wasn't right. I managed to talk to my boyfriend which resulted in me finding out that my parents were doing it again. They were again making it look like that they were doing everything for me, but this time even including my boyfriend's parents, and making them feel bad and trying to be superior. Basically trying to insult them in subtle ways. Now this is again pissing me off, because I am starting to feel the same mental pressure and I am starting to get sick again.

I really want to run away. I really do because from what I can tell my parents are just pretending to stuff for me, and they just want to push everything in the direction they want, but in a way that they remain innocent in my eyes. I don't know what to do. I really want to run away and maybe get married with my boyfriend, I don't know. I am just so stressed out.",24Dec2020,1
478,"I really need some impartial advice from a 3rd party

Essentially my family are low key fanatics and strongly believe the pandemic is a sign of the 2nd coming and we need to flee to the country.

With the pandemic I have been frequently in contact with my friends who live in England about how things are going over there and they all agree that they are coping fine and it's really just the stress of the situation that is the worst which I think I can handle and have said with my mental health the way it is that I should come back home.

I'll set my phone down somewhere and can't remember where.

I try so hard to remember things. I can't have my entire life be writing notes and setting reminders for every little thing. Is there a way to better my memory? Or is this maybe a sign of something bigger I should see a doctor for?",24Dec2020,1
480,"So I recently became a home owner with a small house but huge land, more than 2 acres. It’s beautiful and has green grass and beautiful trees. We only have one neighbor right next to our property. They have four kids, have joint custody, have 3 dogs some cats and fish. At first we were all nice and stuff. But their dogs kept pooping on our side. We have told them sooo many times to keep their dogs on a leash whenever they take them out too poop. We even told them we don’t mind them pooping in our yard, we just want them to pick it up. They haven’t done it after they agreed to do so. The woman one day got so tired of the dogs being in the house she built an outside kennel type cafe for the dogs. The house is almost 900 square feet, it’s not a big house, it’s very small and with that many beings living in one small space makes me question so many things. She kept the dogs out in the cold and they howled and barked all night. Im not sure if this was some sort of animal abuse. We also agreed with the neighbors we would put/fix the fence that separated our properties. The man was all talk no action. So, naturally, we put the fence up ourselves. However we are still considering putting up a gate where our driveway begins just so the dogs don’t come in. Before we put the fence up the dogs would run between the space where the fence is now up. But now that that only space open is the driveway they come running through there. I am considering putting a passive aggressive post it note saying “please keep your dogs on your property” or “please pick up your dogs poop” I have chucked some poop with a shovel from our yard to theirs but there is only so much I can do. Please help, I want to put a passive aggressive note that makes them understand. Or if you have any better or other advice please do tell. Thank you in advance 🤠",24Dec2020,1
481,"About 3 months ago I (F18) started dating a girl (22) (we are pretty much official). We see each other about twice a week, despite living 1,5 hours by train from each other.

From the beginning, it has bothered me that she does not reply to texts quickly. It can sometimes take up to 8 hours before I get a text back (we do text every day though). I never explicitly told her how much it bothered me, but she is somewhat aware of it. She explained to me that due to her ADHD, she finds it hard to concentrate on things and that is why she first needs to find time to properly text people back. She assured me that she *is* in love with me and very invested in me and that I do not have to worry about it one bit. Even though I can think rationally and I know that the feelings are mutual, I cannot stop overthinking when she does not respond to me quickly. All-day long, even when she is responding, I cannot stop worrying that she will leave me. I constantly need to check if she is online on WhatsApp or check if she posted anything on social media. I know this is stupid and I feel embarrassed because of it, but I just have the constant urge to check. I start to overanalyze every text she sends me and wonder if there is a 'hidden message' in it that indicates she doesn't like me anymore. Even when she wrote a love poem about me and when we talk about our future together, I cannot stop overthinking about the fact that maybe she loses feelings. I feel really insecure all the time because of this and I am also afraid that she will find someone that she likes better. I just want to enjoy this relationship and stop worrying about these things, because the severe anxiety I am experiencing is honestly making me feel depressed. Any advice?",24Dec2020,1
482,"Context; I (25m) used to go to the same school as her when I was around 8 years old. We were in the same class for close to 4 years and I had the biggest crush on her then. My sister and I later changed schools and finally moved to Canada for close to a decade.

Fast forward to now, due to covid, I had to leave Canada cause I had immigration issues and moved back to my home town in India. Last week while I was randomly scrolling through instagram, I noticed a post about how her cousin got married last year and when I saw her picture all my feelings for her came rushing back and I honestly felt like I was 8 again.

After some research I found out she lives 5 mins away from where I live. Honestly, I doubt she even remembers cause I was the fat, awkward kid in class but I couldn't believe I still felt the same way after all the years apart. 

Should I try to connect with her? She barely has any social media so at this point I'm left with literally going to her house and knocking on her door (safely of course) or would she think me a creep for still feeling this after so many years?

Any advice would help at this point.",24Dec2020,1

488,"During this semester I made a friend through class. We had two classes together and we’d help each other like every week. Eventually we hung out for the first time and I brought him over to my friends house so we could all talk and smoke. After everyone else left it was just me and him in the living room. I just kept talking because I didn’t want there to be awkward silence but I started to see this “look” in his eyes. Then I said we should get going and I dropped him off, it was a good night overall though. 
The next time we hang out (which was also the last) he tried to kiss me. I had to tell him I had a boyfriend and I didn’t want  to be messy. He apologized and didn’t realize I had one. After that things kinda changed. I also want to add we never did anything together and I honestly just wanted to be friends with him.

495,"I have a lot of self respect. I respect my time and time I give. Which in return I give the up most respect to others, the time they share with me and the politeness and gestures they share. I'm 23.

One thing I do is I respect peoples time, I don't be rude to them, I welcome them when I see them, I give them a big moment to be heard and in group settings make them feel valued to be in part of that circle and make them feel included.. 

What ends up happening, the person acts like it's first formalities and begins to drop this respect, give it to certain people and stop giving it to me, and up becoming rude and think they can walk over me.

What ends up happening is, I take away the respect, I don't speak to em directly as much. If they don't respect me why should I respect them back?  

Problem is I take the respect back silently, I stopped doing it without saying... my question is

Should I be more direct when i take away my respect for them? Like ""you're not listening to what im saying so I'm not gonna say nothing to you at all until you do listen"" but I come off as rude?

Or should I pull the respect away silently, but that doesn't feel like the message was brought across and they may say "" Oh you don't do it so why should I?"" When I only took it back cus they did it first.

499,"So to make a long story short my boyfriend’s friends got engaged 3 years ago and were due to get married in October this year. My boyfriend was a groomsman and was totally excited until this year when COVID hit.

My boyfriend has health problems and was waiting on a surgery date for a fistulotomy. So naturally he stayed home all the time during COVID and minimised his contacts to basically just me and his parents. As the wedding drew closer and cases were rising again, he didn’t feel comfortable going to the wedding anymore.  He was genuinely worried about some circumstances around the wedding like no masks and family members on both sides that likely have been careless during the pandemic. The groom also wanted a gathering of all the groomsmen in a house the night before the wedding, when household gatherings were banned. They were fine with my boyfriend not going to that, and when he finally decided to tell the groom he just couldn’t take the risk with the wedding, he said that at this stage it was no problem and not to worry about it. My boyfriend sent a text on the day of the wedding to wish him good luck, and the groom replied 2 days later to explain that he hadn’t a chance to reply immediately but thanked him.

Thing is, my boyfriend hasn’t heard from him since and thinks his friend is mad at him, but won’t reach out because he “doesn’t care”. He feels that if his friend and his wife are mad at them for not going to their wedding during a global pandemic, then that’s on them. Which I agree with. But we can’t assume how either party feels but he is waiting for them to reach out.

Today, Christmas Eve, he visited one of his friends to exchange presents and was told that the groom left a gift for him there. It was a groomsman gift with his name engraved on a hip flask and the date of the wedding. But no Christmas presents left, and no attempt to reach out. The kicker is, the friend that he left it to lives in the apartment block literally across from us.

He isn’t saying much about it and doesn’t know what to do. I’m really not sure whether this is some kind of fucked up passive aggression to remind him of the wedding he bailed on, or whether it’s an olive branch. They got married 2 months ago and even then, we only went into lockdown the start of December so he had plenty of time to reach out to meet up.

My boyfriend has no idea how to approach this. Any advice?",24Dec2020,1

It was a big square table i was on the corner with ppl to my right and the other guy to my left was the other end far


 and the first task was ‘say hello and talk to the person next to you’ and I did talk to the person right of me (the guy left of me was on the other end of the big desk and He was talking to the person to his left the whole time so what could I do?) I talked To multiple people openly and real made an effort and looked to my left twice to the guy far left of me to say hello but as I said he was talking to the girl on his opppsite side the whole time.

503,"Everything I’m finding online about this is only for rejecting a general wedding invitation. This is a question I’m posting on behalf of my boyfriend who doesn’t have Reddit. 

A friend who he is not that close with invited him to be a groomsman. However, my boyfriend feels that his loose friendship with the groom hasn’t been much of a real friendship since he began dating his current fiancée, because she doesn’t allow the groom to do anything without her. My boyfriend has not hung out with the groom without his fiancée present in 7 years. Actually, we only see them about once per year and neither of us really enjoy their company when they’re together. The groom when he’s not with his fiancée acts like a different person and is very nice. My boyfriend wishes he could rekindle a different type of friendship with the groom in the future, but the fiancée is very controlling and they both turn each other into toxic people. In fact, they often exhibit unhealthy behavior towards us, guilt-trip us and pressure us if we say no to something, fight and insult each other in front of us, don’t respect differing opinions/boundaries, and drive incredibly unsafe and aggressive with us in the car. 

Basically, my boyfriend would be ruining his friendship with the groom if he says no to being a groomsman. Not that it’s a close friendship anymore, but he is having a hard time grappling with saying goodbye to an old friend versus supporting an unhealthy relationship and being forced into a wedding party with people who he hates being around (their friends are also not great people) and who don’t respect his boundaries. (My boyfriend doesn’t drink much/at all, but this couple always ignores him and buys him shots and pressures him to get drunk, which would probably be most of the experience of being in the wedding party). 

Should he say goodbye? Should he speak up about what his needs are if they continue being friends? Should he accept the role as a groomsman but enforce strict boundaries on his responsibilities and expectations (which ultimately would cause drama from the couple)?",24Dec2020,1

507,"Hi everyone- a little backstory, my mother is a severely anxious person. Her anxiety mostly manifests itself in her control and manipulation over other people, especially me and my siblings. I am an 18F and have two older brothers, so although my brothers were deeply affected by her flawed parenting, I always received the worst of it because I am her only daughter and she projects quite a bit onto me. I'm currently a freshman in college, and last year, when I was a senior in high school, I tried to start gaining more freedom. However, if I didn't do absurd things like come home by 5:00 pm on a weekend she would throw a terrifying fit and call me abusive and a horrible daughter, etc. Essentially I had $4,000 in my bank account at the beginning of senior year, and she drained it all out because according to her, I was just going to use all of it to buy drugs. I was 17 at the time and there was really nothing I could do. My brothers each had a similar amount in their accounts because we all worked at the same summer camp, and, unlike me, she let them keep it. When I turned 18, I started really pushing to get the money back. We are a pretty wealthy family, and she has absolutely no use for the money. I do, though, considering that my parents don't buy me clothes or food. I've been living at various friends' houses since the beginning of winter break because I'm not allowed at my parents' house, and I am so sick of needing everyone to pay for my shit all the time. I tried to set up a new bank account without her as a joint owner, but when the debit card got mailed to the house, she took it immediately and has been withholding it from me. I can't activate or use the account. I don't even have $25 to set up a new bank account. My dad is absolutely useless and so are my brothers- they think I am disobedient and dramatic. Does anyone have any advice on either how to get the money back? As in, is she doing anything truly illegal that I could point out to her? Can I still use the new bank account I made without the debit card? Or, is there any way to make money (even the tiniest amounts) without needing a bank account? Feel free to suggest anything, and I mean ANYTHING. The situation isn't all that severe, like I have food, clothes, and a place to stay, I just NEED to break free of their financial control over me so that I can start saving up for the future. I'm scared that it's going to be this way forever. Also, I don't think my campus is going to open up for second semester, so getting a job through school isn't really an option.",24Dec2020,1
508,"Hi! This is a throwaway because people might know it’s me.
So this is incredibly embarrassing and weird but I need some advice and dont know what else to do. 
My mother has always been very touchy-feely. She’s like that with a lot of people- shoulder touches, ruffling hair, that kind of stuff.
I (16f) don’t like to be touched. I never have, even when I was little. Sure, I’ll give you a hug if we’re friends. But lingering touches or touches when I’m not expecting it make me very uncomfortable. I’m not sure why, and to be honest it makes me sort of sad. But that’s a different issue. 
My mother has never understood this. Since I was young she will touch me almost constantly. Rubbing my back. Stroking my hair. Squeezing my knee. I would always pull away and have a physical reaction, but if I made it too obvious she would get upset and ask what the issue was and why I didn’t love her. I learned to just put up with it, even though I hated it.
My dad gets it. He just gives me a hug on special occasions (which I’m fine with) and that’s it.
Maybe it’s my imagination but it’s been getting worse. I’ll be sitting down and my mother will just come up and put her arm around me, breathing down my neck or rubbing my back. If I squirm away she gets upset. She also constantly makes comments about my body- about my butt, my legs, my beasts. She’ll grab my butt while I’m standing doing something for no reason, thinking it’s funny.
The other day she came up to me and grabbed my breasts and said “wow, these are getting big!” 
I recoiled, feeling embarrassed and uncomfortable. She just laughed and said “well, they are!” 
I knew she was just trying to be funny or playful but when I told my friend she looked freaked out.
Yesterday, I was chopping vegetables, and had headphones on. All of a sudden she wrapped her arms around me from behind, slid her hands under my shirt and kissed my neck. It was fucking gross. I know I shouldn’t say that but it made me feel sick. I jumped out of my skin and was upset. She laughed and said sorry for scaring me, I asked her to please not do that again. She started to get offended so I excused myself and went to my room. All of a sudden I found myself in tears. I curled up in a ball feeling like shit for reacting so dramatically to something. I didn’t understand why I was so upset. 
My mother loves me and is just trying to show that love. But it makes me feel... I don’t know. Sick. Weird. Upset. I flinch whenever she comes near me and wish I had a lock on my bedroom door so she would stop just barging in. She has issue with privacy. 
Anyway, I know this sounds very silly, and I know she’s just being harmlessly affectionate, but it makes me really uncomfortable. I’m scared that if I talk to her about it she’ll get upset again, and I feel super guilty because I know the whole touching thing is my issue, not hers. Does anyone have any advice of how I should approach this? Is there anything I could say or do to help her understand? Thank you",24Dec2020,1
509,"Hey all, yet another dumb rant here.

As I've talked about a lot on this account I went to school for music because I loved it and in my condition I didn't think I would live to see myself graduate. Well, I graduated. Didn't even have any time to try to make anything happen because I graduated straight into the middle of this fucked up Corona world.

So I got a job working in a local computer repair shop. The pay was awful, but I was relatively happy. Why they fired me is a long story but it was basically because I had to have surgery.

I couldn't get through a day of work without crying so I quit and went back to mooching off my parents, trying to get something either back in a shop or doing some field service type thing.

And now I have this job at a shop chain, I mostly work on phones now, but the occasional computer still comes in. It's fine I guess, but again,  I'm back to shit pay. 10$ an hour while I'm onboarding, and then only up to 13$ an hour once I become independent. But I'm stuck in onboarding hell because I can't remember any of the directions they give me. So there are multiple failures every day where I fuck up on something I've been told how to do many times, and I just forget to do what they told me. I can't remember anything. Working with phones required a lot of precision like looking for really small cracks in the glass and stuff, and I always miss it. They tell me, always look over the phone very carefully, and I do, but then I either miss a crack or forget to write it down in the notes. Oh also because I'm \*still onboarding\* I don't even work for 40 hours. They usually have me between 25 and 30. It's been 3 weeks.

Constantly having ""Wow, I'm a total dumbass"" moments really makes me feel so depressed. I feel like I'm never going to actually finish onboarding because I can't fucking remember anything. Then I get home and my girlfriend tells me I forgot to do X, Y, and Z. I'm always late because I can't remember to take the same meds that I've taken for years and years before I leave the house so I have to go back. I can't remember to lock the door when I leave even though I have to do it every day. I always forget at least one thing when I go to work, it just rotates between being my keys, my belt, my water bottle, my lunch, etc. I always misplace at least one thing every day which makes me chronically late even though I get up early enough.

And I'm so sick of this rat race of making so little that I have to beg my parents for rent money, and having to skip paying my half of the groceries because I have 4$ in my account. I have no hope of ever making any more money because my degree is in music. I would be a great violin teacher, but the coronavirus is still happening, so it's definitely not the time to start with that. Every job requires a ""degree in a technicial field"" plus 3 years of experience.

What do I even do here? Do I go back to school? The only thing I know about careers is that I'm good at music, and I'm good at fixing computers. I would love to just work in a computer repair shop like I've been doing, if only it actually paid any money. I fucking hated help desk so what happens if I do go back to school for IT, or get my certs, and then get some sysadmin type thing and hate that too?

I looked into fixing medical equipment, and there's not a single job posting for that on indeed, plus I would have to go back to school. I looked into becoming an A&amp;P, but that costs 45k that I don't have.

I'm just sick of feeling like an overgrown 16 year old working at a movie theater for money to buy video games, while my girlfriend is actually gainfully employed. My sister is 4 years younger than I am and is renting a house, working as a tattoo artist which she loves, while I sit here mooching off people because I have no prospects and even if I did I'm too chronically amnesiac to actually perform well.

Anyway the TL;DR is: I have a music degree that's going nowhere and I'm sick of working for basically nothing. And I have such severe memory problems that I am seriously considering whether I'm mentally disabled. What do I do?",24Dec2020,1
510,"Not sure where to post this tbh so if anyone knows a better subreddit lemme know pls. 

My friend (for the second time this month) has been scammed. She saw an ad for some DM boots being on sale, clicked the link and bought the. She sent that link to my other friend and she did the same. Hours pass and the other friend said she thinks that sites a scam due to the reviews on it and it’s not the official DM website. The reviews all said they received cheap plastic glasses instead of the boots they ordered. 

I’m wondering if, because this site has their bank details should they both call their bank and freeze their accounts and get a new card? One friend had already started doing this but my friend who got scammed first hasn’t. She still thinks the site is real and she’s now mad at me for basically yelling at her to go and tell her mum to freeze her card.",24Dec2020,1

I stopped people from being able to send me asks or messages in hopes that the hate would stop but the person just reblogs my work so they still find ways to send hate.

516,"I'm failing in school. I think I may have adhd/add. I'm not sure, I need to see a doctor to be diagnosed properly. I can't visit therapist or psychiatrist at the moment or any time soon, however I'm gonna see one in 2+ weeks. I have 4 days until my semester ends, so I need to study and pass all of exams, assignments and tasks that were given

I'm 16 year old girl, I study in high school. I have anxiety and panic attacks, I was diagnosed with it. My anxiety got worse during quarantine. I'm anxious about many things. I worry about my future, myself, health, money and sometimes I'm anxious and afraid for no reason. I have bad health anxiety because I'm often sick. I often have fever, I'm always very tired, fatigued, dizzy, naseous. My head and stomach hurts all the time. I'm always in pain and feel sick. My symptoms bother me a lot and doctors aren't being able to diagnose anything that could cause all of my symptoms. They did many tests and I saw almost all specialists. I have hypothyroidism which may cause fatigue but I don't think it is the cause for other symptoms. Most of the doctors I met told me that probably it's my mental issues that are causing me pain and physical discomfort

I'm extremely disorganized and messy. My room and life is a mess. I always loose my stuff, I always forget things. I forget the tasks and assignments that are given. Even when I know I have an assignment, it's extremely difficult for me to force myself and make myself start and do the task. During lessons I can't focus at all, it's very difficult for me to pay attention at lesson. I always end up just sitting and not paying attention or getting distracted by doing other stuff. So all of the semester, I almost missed all of the classes. I didn't do homework, I ended up forgetting about it or procrastinating. When exams came, I wrote them really badly. During exam I couldn't get my thoughts and ideas together and write the exam. On the lessons like math, physics where you solve problem, I couldn't solve them, I didn't know how to solve them. On the lessons like languages, history, literature, where you usually write essays, I can't get my thoughts together and focus on writing. It takes me so much time until I actually start thinking about essay and it takes so long to come up with idea. Then it takes me a long time to think about how I will write it. I have only 30 minutes to write 250 word essay. Obviously I can't finish essay on time. Sometimes I even end up not starting the essay

Now, I have 15 exams that I missed or failed and about 10 tasks to do. I'm failing. Today school principle invited my parents to school. All of the teachers told how badly I'm doing and that I'm a terrible student. They told my parents. I'm lazy, irresponsible and that they never met a student who was lazy and disorganized as me. I'm extremely embarrassed and guilty, because I disappointed my parents. an 2 years I got expelled from my previous school for that reason.

I think I may have ADD/ADHD. It doesn't feel normal, it feels like more than laziness. I tried many study and productivity hacks, nothing works. I have zero willpower or self control. I can't make myself do anything and when I try to do something I fail.

I'm anxious and disappointed at myself. I feel like I'm a failure. I don't have any friends, interests, hobbies and I'm failing school. I'm worried if I'm going to be the same in the future. I don't know how I will study in uni, how I will work, I can't even study in school!

At the moment I have tons of exams to write, tasks to do, topics to study and I have only 4 days. What advice would you give for studying? What advice would you give me in general to improve my mental health?",24Dec2020,1
517,"This will be a little long but it’s a lot to vent about. I found my birth mom a year or so ago and blah blah blah, it was great, etc. Then feeling emerged, sadness , angry, etc. Anyways, we’re kinda close , we talk on the phone every day now and tell each other a lot of personal stuff. I kinda consider her a friend in a way. Anyways, things were good a few months ago, we talked a lot, argued very little , and my feelings regarding the adoption aspect were kinda minimal and content ... today, I saw her son post his birthday pictures and she told me she was going to gather with all her family (it’s long distance in another country so i’ve never even met them) and it’s a sensitive subject to me because she never told them about me before she had me and when she did tell them a year ago, they acted interested in me for maybe 2 months then stopped completely. it broke my heart because all i wanted was a connection with these people and ever since , i try to forget. anyways, when she told me this, i felt so left out and with her son’s birthday, i kept imagining her keeping him when she came home from the hospital and with me , only staying with me for a minute or so. She told me to call her at 8 am in her time and I did but she didn’t answer so I said “i’m very upset pls call when u can”. Anyways, we ended up calling and  i was crying so much (not unusual for us because she cries w me all the time). Anyways, she started begging me to leave the phone call because her “eyes hurt” and because “she doesn’t know what to say”. I was so hurt and ended up going off on her an hour later, explaining how i would have been there for her , etc. and she just proceeded to tell me to sleep and calm down and that I need to stop blaming her for my feelings... i wasn’t really blaming her, just wanting her to be there, I even said “i just want your presence here” because when she’s with me, my thoughts about the situation are so distracted ... anyways, I called after the fight and said that she’s right , we talk often and I shouldn’t have gone off on her about how the relationship isn’t working because it’s online and that she’s not usually there for me.... so in reality , she thinks things are fine but for me, I’m so hurt and feel so empty and suicidal and left out and like worthless all over again and I feel crazy for spamming her and I feel like she hates me... and she kept saying that talking to me on the phone is different than real life and she isn’t able to talk for long... this broke my heart because it reminded me that it’s online and I feel like she doesn’t take it seriously because of that... what do I do?

He got very very nervous, because he feels that the accident is meaningless to everyone that plays a role in the trial.

 and the first task was ‘say hello and talk to the person next to you’ and I did talk to the person right of me (the guy left of me was on the other end of the big desk and He was talking to the person to his left the whole time so what could I do?) I talked To multiple people openly and real made an effort and looked to my left twice to the guy far left of me to say hello but as I said he was talking to the girl on his opppsite side the whole time.

529," Greetings, folks…

I am a 16M student in a third world country. I’m currently preparing for an international science olympiad. I really want to leave the country and study in the U.S./Europe/Japan mainly because I don’t feel like I belong here (i.e. I absolutely despise the atmosphere). Winning the international science olympiad is not a guarantee that I will get a scholarship in a foreign country, but it will increase my chances immensely. I know that winning this olympiad is my only ticket out of here (even if it's not guaranteed, this is my best chance), however I’m facing other people who I think are brilliant at what they do. I have around 2-3 months to prepare and I have met my competition. They are really good. I know if I study harder I might stand a chance, but I constantly feel down by just imagining how my life would turn out if I don’t qualify to represent my country in this international science olympiad.

My country has this system where if I don’t pass this year, then I can’t try the exam again next year and I am dead terrified of not being able to get out of here just because I failed the qualifying exam. I’m feeling the pressure to win as it is my only way out of here and to - what I think it is - a better life.

I tried studying super hard and hyping myself up, motivating myself in the mirror, but there are moments when I feel down and when I do, my brain completely stops working and I will dwell on these negative thoughts for hours. What if I fail the qualifying tests and my only ticket out of here is gone?",24Dec2020,1

I was hesitating to apply those parts with lotion, but I was like f—- it, so I smothered his entire back with lotion including the dried up blood. 

Fast forward to two days after I applied lotion on my dad’s back. I woke up in the morning and felt itchiness on my upper back. I looked in the mirror and and faced my back towards the mirror. My upper back was filled with blotches that looked like mini rashes. It wasn’t incredibly itchy, but moderately itchy. And as I’m typing this, I can steel feel the itch.

Please keep in mind that I RARELY have rashes on my back. It’s winter, but the back of my skin is always smooth and not cracked. But coincidentally, the rashes appeared two days after I touched my dad’s back with my hands to apply the lotion. 

I’m insanely paranoid about contracting HIV. I’ve done numerous amounts of research about the symptoms of HIV. And one of the symptoms I believe I have are the itchy rashes on my upper back. Also, I might’ve contracted the HIV through touching dried up blood from my father. That’s what I think.

536,"I’m (27/F) struggling with setting boundaries with my boss (61/F). 

I’ve been in my current role for about 10 months and it’s been thus far going great. I have a lot of responsibilities and handle them all efficiently, I’ve received positive remarks from coworkers, and I have great working relationships with everyone. I don’t feel my boss has any reason to distrust me, and she’s made it very clear she likes me, yet this is the one relationship I’m struggling with.

The reason I’m writing this is because she called me this morning, despite it being my day off and Christmas Eve, and it really upset me. She also contacted me yesterday (PTO day of mine as well) to hear how my evening with a friend went the night prior. Note, she’s been on vacation all week but I’ve heard from others on my team that she’s been calling them multiple times a day, every day. A few weeks ago she asked me to come over to a get together after work at her place (it felt like peer pressure) and I said yes primarily because I felt awkward about having politely declined each previous request to hangout. It was a fun evening but in hindsight I’m worried that may have wrecked the boundaries I’m trying to set because she’s insisting we hangout next week as well (she’ll still be on vacation and I’ll be covering her work).

I have an open heart and tend to see the best in people, and I feel like these are relatively innocent things she’s doing, but part of me feels she doesn’t understand boundaries, or mine at least, and that I need to work on setting them firmly with her. Part of me feels really guilty I didn’t pick up her call this morning, but I’m with my family and trying to enjoy the holidays. I’ve never had a boss like this before in my life, and I understand there are unspoken politics about relationships at work so I’m weary to do anything that would sabotage myself (like not picking up her call on my day off).

my sister is 10, she got a smartphone a year ago ; i never touched my sister’s phone with or without her consent,  i always trusted her and always explained her that she shouldn’t talk with older people or with simply strangers on internet; a few days ago my brother’s girlfriend and my brother came to our house to spend Christmas ; an unknown person called her and when my brother’s girlfriend wanted to see who it was she ran, deleted the messages and blocked the number, i wasn’t present when the whole thing happened so i didn’t thought much of it; my brother’s girlfriend said that my sister keeps hiding the phone from her and because i never cared about it i just simply said that it mustn’t be something important ; my sister and our cousin left and me and my brother’s girlfriend went through her phone because she was worried ; we saw lots of messages between her and her best friend, they were both using horrible language, talking about kissing boys and so many more ; then i went on her Instagram and a new conversation showed up and this guy called her “ babe “ , the rest of the messages were deleted ; i logged into both her instagram accounts without letting her know and my brother’s girlfriend told me not to tell her anything and to wait a few days ; I’m disappointed and mad because I thought i was a good sister, trying to give her personal space and let her have social media but i don’t know how to tell her that this isn’t ok, any advice?",24Dec2020,1
538,"Hello strangers from the internet, it is me, yet another stranger from the internet, asking for your help,

I am born to a family of a mother and father and three sons, the first two were born 11 and 9 years before, the family was happy then, but after I was born things turned into hell, dont get me wrong, I love everyone in my family, I look up to each one of them in a different way, but now, I only look up to my brothers.

By the time I turned 7, both of my brothers were away in different universities, one of them went to China, and the other went to the USA, it was at this point I lost 2 of my most beloved people in the world, my mother and father have been through a lot of fights, but without my elder siblings, i was ""too young to understand the world"" and my opinion didn't matter to them, since I turned 9 they never spoke to each other, I was always the owl that delivered messages from one to another.

Eventhough the fighting continued, it was bearable, but after the Corona pandemic and lockdown, things got a little too tense, whenever my father did something, it was always to announce my mother, and whenever my mom did something, it was always to get back at him, it got to the point where my parents have favourites among my brothers, where my mother ridiculed bro1 and praised bro2 and father ridiculed brow and praised bro1.

It is starting to divide up the family, last week was exam week, so I stayed at my room for the whole week, eventhough I spent it studying and not playing, i can swear to you i have never been happier, now I am sure for everyone's happiness I should influence them to have a divorce, so what is your guys' opinions, should I or should I not, and what possible future problems I am going to run into and how to fix it?",24Dec2020,1
539,So my dad bought my brothers and me a JBL charge 4 for each of us for Christmas. But to be honest I hate listening to music on speakers. I would like to tell him that I don't need it but I don't want to hurt his feelings either. How do I tell him properly?,24Dec2020,1
540,"I have terrible memories of the holidays. My dad was a drug addict and every Christmas all I ever heard was screaming and fighting and then no dinner because everyone was miserable. 

And this year I’m willing to participate in the holiday activities. I felt like everything would be fine this year, everybody has been getting along and my dad is clean and In my life again. 

But my spoiled sister ruined the holidays again. She got mad at my mom because my sisters cat peed on the floor and she kept insisting that it was my moms cat (We’ve had that cat for ten years and she has NEVER misbehaved like that. NEVER). 

My mom kept trying to diffuse the situation but my sister just kept screaming and trying to keep it going. So now it’s really tense and my sister keeps snapping at everyone. They’re making me just want to hide in my room instead of participating if all she’s going to do is whine and complain and pick fights. 

How can I maybe help get rid of the tension and want to celebrate again? I really want to enjoy the holidays for once and this is really making it hard.",24Dec2020,1
541,"I can't stop using my earphones and it's starting to take a toll on my hearing. I listen to music at many points in the day, and inbetween that, I listen to podcasts and YouTube videos. I do it while I study,  to relax, and also in lessons since I have online classes now.

For some reason, I feel really embarrassed listening to music out loud (I live in an apartment with my parent, and I don't want either him or the neighbours to hear), and get very self conscious about it to the point where I'd rather not have any background noise at all.. but without it I feel unhappy.

543,"So i have a friend who’s been battling with mental health issues for so long. We’ve constantly tried to get help and I’ve called multiple helplines for her. 

And for the longest time she’s been saying how she doesn’t want help anymore, that all she wants is to die.

Multiple times she’s told me that she feels like today would be her last day, those days I’ve somehow talked her out of it.

She’s now telling me that everyday she’s in constant pain and that it gets worse and worse.

I don’t know what to do, I’ve tried absolutely everything I can think of but all she wants is to die. She says the only reason why she’s still alive is because she doesn’t want me to grieve her death. So now she’s begging me to let her take her own life.

A part of me feels so selfish to not let her do so, but if I do say yes then I’ll be responsible for her death.

In my mind it feels like I have a friend who’s on life support and just wants me to pull the plug because of how much they’re suffering but out of my own selfishness I won’t let them.

544,"I'm a second year biomedical student (U.K.)and I submitted some coursework at the end of November. During the submission I was suffering from intense anxiety, as we were back in lockdown and I hadn't seen my family in two months. Coursework and tests in general give me intense anxiety, panic attacks insomnia the whole lot. I am working with my doctor to get a diagnosis, but since I haven't got a proper diagnosis I can't get help from my uni's mental healths service. 

Now back to the coursework, because of my stress I hadn't slept or eaten in 3 days, and I just submitted it, I didn't wait for my plagiarism report because it was taking hours to load. Looking at the plagiarism report my uni have given me I mixed up my citations and I didn't paraphrase properly which meant it was plagiarism. When I went to the formal discussion meeting they told me my anxiety was not a special circumstance (usually needs to be a death or something) it was an extenuating circumstance which I should have reported at the time. I didn't know I could have done this as I thought you had submit one at least 7 day prior and I was literally having a mental breakdown where I felt the only thing that would help would be to submit my paper. They have capped my grade for that module at 40%, the coursework will be awarded  0%. I have filed an appeal. I don't really know what to do. How will this affect my future? Will this be on my HEAR? Will this affect me when I'm applying for masters and jobs?

545,"Especially video games recently, it feels like I dont enjoy doing anything anymore. the only thing I really find fun is hanging out with my friends or my girlfriend, and when I do enjoy games its only because im playing with them. 

I cant seem to play a game for much longer than a few hours at a time before I just lose interest and it starts to feel more like a chore than fun or stress relief. in games like skyrim or the Witcher I just find myself zoning out and following the quest markers until I realize im bored and just close my computer. I scroll through steam and my wishlist but I never feel too interested in anything

its not just games though, most things I used to enjoy, drawing, making music, going to the park, it all kinda feels like there's no reason for me to do any of it any more, or like I dont really enjoy doing stuff, I just do things out of habit.

maybe I need to find a new hobby but idk what I would enjoy. there isn't a lot I can go out and do atm due to certain recent world events preventing me from going out too often, but when I try stuff online like learning digital art or trying to learn programming, I get a good ways in and just kind of lose any drive to continue

is this a problem with me? should I just push myself to do things more, or should I keep trying to find new stuff? I feel like a hamster in a wheel, just trying as hard as I can to do something new but always finding myself in the same place in the end.",24Dec2020,1

I am currently studying at a world top 10 uni for a cs degree. On paper, I understand that this makes me a good kid (tm), but honestly I’m starting to feel pretty down. I’m incredibly grateful for the opportunity to study this degree, I love it, and I cannot imagine myself doing anything else, but honestly I’m pretty scared that I’ve spent my youth (16 -21) overworking, and neglecting the experiences that make life beautiful. I’m 21 and I’ve never been in a relationship or anything of the sort, and honestly feel like I could die tomorrow and nobody would care. I’ve become quite conscious of the fact I’m getting older, and feel increasingly depressed at the fact my life is just going by, and I’m not making any sort of memories I’m fond of. In the past few years, I’ve gained a pile of weight, become quite unmotivated, and my mind is always finding something for me to be anxious about. I understand how unstructured the above text is, and it might seem stupid to some of you, but honestly I’ve been wanting to write this for a while. I just feel like a really negligible human being, and one undeserving of any sort of love. For the first time in my life I don’t feel like I have any milestones to look forward to, and I’m quite scared to be completely truthful, scared that I’ll never have the opportunity to really experience anything amazing again. I understand that the first part of my post does come across as a bit of a humble brag, but I swear that’s not what I intended, I just wanted to specify that I’m not in a rut in the traditional sense, and I am certainly unbelievably grateful for that, which makes writing this post feel a bit shitty, but I guess it’s a feeling I cannot shake.",24Dec2020,1

Anyways this issue has caused me to hurt people and also distance myself from socialising because I'm scared that boundaries will be crossed or confrontational conversations will have to happen(which they do) and I'll shut down and ghost them again.

He found out though one of his co workers they do not ever give raises. This caused my husband to freak out and was trying to find evidence through his employee handbook, website etc. about their raise policy but did not find one. He assumes now he may never get raises. He’s been on the fence about his job now due to no raises. He’s upset he may have to find another job but I told him to stay if he loves the job. He’s been fighting with me about this and it’s just always a losing battle with his jobs, money etc. I’ve been trying to just stay away from any topics about money, buying a house etc. because it just always ends in a fight and crying.

552,"I have had depression for a long time and every year it gets worse than the year before, but since COVID started and I had to work from home and not leave the house, my mental health improved a lot. However, I developed severe social anxiety starting last year. I fear being judged and get very self conscious around others and distance myself from people but now I feel like it increased extremely. My heart races, my mouth dries, I lose color and I find a hard time talking. And what makes me feel so low is knowing there is nothing I can do about it.

That's because growing up (before depression), I lost some of my social skills and spent majority of my teen years trying to get them back but I couldn't so I just accepted. So, I think this time around with actual social anxiety and depression, I stand no chance.

I think a lot of the time that since I cannot function on this earth like an actual human being, I am better off dead. It will end the suffering and anxiety. Mentally, I think a lot about no going on for long. I know it's the weak way out and I don't know if I will ever do it, but it's a very frequent thought.

I tried therapy before one time but it was a bad experience, so I lost hope in that as well. I also know I'm on my own, even if I had loved ones around me just because when I actually look around, I don't really have anyone that will be there for me or even tries to listen and/or understand. I also refuse to discuss my suicidal thoughts cause I don't want to sound like a cry baby.

555,"I met someone on Hinge and we hit it off well. We had a few dinners, watched the sunset together and had many long and deep talks. In total, we met 5 times. He even told me that after 2 dates, “you know”, which I guess that translates to “you know you like someone”. 

I know he likes me and even remembers and recalls the things I’ve told him before. We have good chemistry, but what you’ll read below doesn’t make me so sure. 

He’s now back in his hometown which is far from me, but he doesn’t contact me much. We FaceTime but barely. When we would text, he would go days without messaging me and if he does, it would be every 3 hours. 

The first week he arrived back home, he didn’t communicate with me. I kinda let it slide because I thought he was spending time with his parents and doing school work. 

However, when we FaceTimed, I learned that he didn’t do any school work at all. He just watches tv and walks in the city (breaking the 2 week mandatory quarantine). So there was no reason for him to not message me. 

Here are the three instances:

- First, he didn’t message me for 3 days until I did. 

- Second, he didn’t message me for a whole week. His excuse was finishing up his finals. 

- Lastly, I added him on another app, which he strongly encouraged me to download, since he’s not a “great texter” and he still does this. 

On the app, we had started a regular conversation and I asked him if he was gonna watch the Christmas star. **this is after he finished his finals**

He read it and didn’t reply for 2 days, so I just deleted the app. 

He’s said on different occasions that he misses me a lot and we planned a trip for a few days when he’d come back. 

I normally don’t care and no longer suprised by how fucked up people are anymore, but leaving a conversation for 2 days straight and not replying is on some 2021 new level type shit.

557,"this is a long post, so if you dont want to read it thats fine

all the signs in my life indicate that I should be extremely confident and not depressed:

I am 6'2, attractive (I know I am through other people in the past, but this is completely independent to how I feel), come from a nice family that is wealthy, am white, pretty smart, pretty fit if I am not in a period of depression where I can't work out.

I know that these things do not equal confidence, and that depression can happen to anyone, but I am just being honest, I irrationally feel like I objectively shouldn't have mental issues. I don't want to bring  up my issues to anyone in real life, and even if I did, there is nobody I'd feel comfortable talking to about them, so I am posting on the internet. I am going to give some background on myself and how I feel to paint a clearer picture.

I am 20, male, and in college.

I am pretty good in social settings and with avoiding awkward interactions, so new people who I meet essentially think I have no problems, even in some of the most down moments of my life. For example, before coronavirus I was on my college campus and there was a point (one of multiple) where I did not talk to a single person outside of my classes for 3 months. No friends, and no idea on how I could help myself. I sat in my dorm and basically was immobilized by depression and just was indulged in unhealthy habits. After these months, one day I finally got the will to go to the cafeteria and decided I would try to talk to someone. I got my lunch and saw a girl sitting alone, who I didn't know but  I knew of her because we would always exchange glances since our class schedules made us cross paths often. Anyway it took me awhile to build up the courage in my head but after thinking about the months of depression I go and sit with her and strike up a conversation (not out of a want for anything romantic, just for human interaction). The conversation goes so smoothly and  I feel like I am almost zoned out while we are talking, but I am really good at keeping it going. Meanwhile on the inside I feel like a fraud and a dumbass. If my feelings could talk during that interaction they'd say: ""what are you doing dumbass? there is no point to this conversation, you're just pretending you have a life anyway, after this you are going straight back to your dorm to feel depressed."" And thats exactly what happened. 

I guess my point in bringing that up is that I feel like ""How can I even begin to approach having meaningful relationships when I can't even authentically do the things most people do when first meeting?"" I feel like there is a wall between me and everyone I talk to. Stints of depression like the previously described one have been happening to me since high school, and can last anywhere from a couple months to a year. So yes, a significant amount of time ages 16-20 of my life I have been depressed. I am not officially diagnosed, but I think self-diagnosing, while I know its bad, in this case is pretty appropriate, because of how obvious its been. My lowest was probably my first year of college, I stopped literally all forms of self-care and even basic hygiene.

If I had to attribute my extreme lack of self-confidence and depression to something, I would probably attribute it to my k-12 experience. In middle school, I clearly remember not being invited to a single person's house or gathering outside of school, with the exception of one halloween event with a lot of people in 8th grade. I had surface level friends who I sometimes sat at the lunch table with, so I wouldn't have to sit at a lunch table alone. I'd cry myself to sleep  a lot in middle school. In high school during 10th and 11th grade I made 1 or 2 good friends, who valued me, but my life was a pretty small part of their friendships compared to their other friends, which I obviously don't knock them for, but as a result I didn't have a group really, and still wasn't invited much to things and wasn't able to live as I saw others living. 12th grade I got a good friend, and another friend, who I figured out was using me to get me to set them up with the good friend, which I did, and felt like a fool for not seeing through it, and after that I just felt disconnected from both of them. 

I don't know if I did a good job explaining things, but the reason I am making this post is because I am going back to college campus next semester, and I so badly want things to be different. I want a girlfriend that I can be affectionate and cuddle with, that human connection is what I want most, and I want a few friends that actually care about me. I've never had a girlfriend before. Not an incel or anything, I've had opportunity in the past. But yeah, I just don't know where to start. I've been with my family since the virus, which has actually been good for me. But I am going to go back to school soon, **how do I make sure I don't just end up staying in my room and become even more severely depressed?**  How can I start??? How am i supposed to start from here? any connections i managed to make before covid in the last semester before we shut down surely by now have turned into nothing, since its been almost a year. I almost feel like I am going back into what is surely not a good situation, I won't be able to handle another stint of depression. At least with my family these past 10 months of covid, I still have had depression, but I live in a small town with nothing to do and am in quarantine, so it felt much different like there was a strong reason and excuse for how I've been. If I go back and just melt into depression again and dont get these connections, I already know I am going to be in a situation far lower than I've ever been before, but I dont know HOW to help myself. Most of my classes are even still online even though im going back, I mean the campus is open but what am i supposed to do to get started on building relationships. Please if you have any advice tell me. Sorry that this is disorganized, I know i did a shit job explaining myself, if you need answers to questions to help me, ill answer them.",24Dec2020,1

562,"I’m only 21 but already I have a pretty short temper which goes off at the stupidest things. I just woke up, wanted to check the news and my phone kept crashing and turning off so I got frustrated.

I try the breathing exercises my therapist gives me but it’s hard to ignore the impulse to hit myself. It makes me feel instantly better for whatever reason.

This has been going on for a couple years and although I don’t care much about myself, I do care about my family and how they would react if they found out. They’ve already seen some of the bruises on my temples but I don’t need them dealing with a brain damaged daughter on top of everything else but I don’t know how to stop myself.

I don’t know what to do anymore or if I should even care, I’ve probably done too much damage already to be fixed.

564,"So I moved back home two years ago and live with my two adult siblings &amp; parents.  I am at home most of the time unless I go into work 1-2 times a week when I am usually the only person there.  I know that people have varying degrees of what is considered “safe” and “cautious.”  I have had struggles managing my anxiety and may have become a borderline hypochondriac, so I think it would be helpful to have different perspectives on my situation (but please... just no thanks if you think COVID is a hoax or anything like that).

My brother and sister are generally not home.  When they are not working, they are hanging out with their SO.  They frequently spend the night with them as well.  But the fact is their SOs don’t live alone and I believe my sister visits her best friend often, who also lives with a big family and the adults are at least also venturing out to work.  My brother even caught strep throat from his girlfriend a couple months ago.  My sister took a whole secret vacation a month ago; although she tested negative afterwards.  For me, this warrants enough concern to essentially avoid being around them when they are at home.  I tried opening a conversation about my concerns (especially about our parents!) and occasionally reminding my family that this pandemic is not getting any better rn; that we should all consider whenever we are constantly around people how this might turn out in a worst case scenario.  Instead, they now are more tight-lipped and are extremely vague about their whereabouts; they probably don’t want to feel like anyone is hawking them about what they are doing and who they around... okay then...

In my mind, being around them without a mask or keeping a fair distance is just about the same as doing the same with a stranger or a coworker, anyone! So I am actually not too excited about tomorrow.  We celebrate Christmas, open gifts together, and will have family dinner.  My mother in particular is extremely sentimental and i know she would be disappointed if I say I will just opt out of dinner.  I was thinking at least just sitting there with a mask on and taking my plate to my room afterwards.

I am actually surprised that my parents have not been more firm with my siblings about their socializing but I think for them, it is a mixture of not wanting to dampen their independence since we are all “grown” and that my siblings seemingly have not much changed how they are moving... as they are mostly not at home.

I actually wonder if anyone else has experienced anything like this in their households and how do you react?  Do you just try to accept the risk because this is your family after all?  I recognize there is a fine line between carefulness and paranoia.  I fear that raising these points to my parents might get them to actually also consider/change how we celebrate tomorrow.  Maybe this may cause (more) tension with my siblings...

TLDR: my brother and sister are rarely home, usually at their SOs’ households where their own families also live, not wanting to participate in Christmas festivities at home tomorrow, concerning potential COVID spread risk for both me and my parents especially",24Dec2020,1
565,"so yesterday i went to this pizza place called Mod Pizza that's like a ""Subway-style"" where they prepare the pizza in front of you.

As I was waiting in line I saw two college kids sitting down at a table with their masks off and one was eating a dessert with two drinks on the table.

Signs throughout said no dine-in due to covid so I asked the employee about this, he turned around and asked his manager and she rudely said ""they're not eating pizza"", and I politely told her that they were still eating, she just mindlessly repeated herself and seemed like a rude lady..

Her job was to take the pizza after toppings are all set and put it in the oven...

So I ordered my three pizzas, and when it same time for this rude lady to put the pizza in the oven, it took way like 5 seconds for her to put the pizza in...

You use your hands to do this (with gloves), and she like held it for a few seconds before taking it off the tray... my other two pizzas, this did not happen.

I then saw her place other pizzas from other customers and she just put them in without a hitch...

I hope she didn't like poison my pizza or something.

When I got home I noticed one pizza had the end of it bent upwards which was that rude lady's doing...

what could that have been for?",24Dec2020,1
567,"I'm 18, male, got broken up with about 6 months ago, that relationship made me close myself socially due to jealousy problems, thinking I did the right thing by closing myself, now the girl has dumped me and is on her way to rekindle things with her ex, and I'm left here, first month was a total wreck, but I got a summer job, second month I totally got a grip on my social life, met tons of people (I'm not socially awkward, and generally have it easy with conversation) and even hooked up with some girls.



 As soon as the summer job was over, I took it easy for a month or two, and started going out with the people close to me, about 2 months ago quarantine hit my country and I've been stuck inside, I still feel bad sometimes when I think about my past relationship, I'm stuck at home, lost contact with most of my friends, and the rest that I've not lost contact with are mostly living in lifestyles that I don't like, (i.e not wanting to go out/work out simply because they're bored and would much prefer playing video games by themselves) I see all the time on Instagram people travelling around my city with their friends and I just feel so left out, this whole thing has destroyed me and I effectively have noone to talk to about this, since my 3 friends wouldn't understand, and my female friend who could understand me, I don't want to show my hopelessness to, call it dumb but since summer I got a huge boost in confidence and I want to keep that for myself, even if I'm not feeling it some times, fake it till you make it. 





The only thing I have going for me is going for a run every 2-3 days  with one friend as a substitute for working out (all the weights are on one of my friend's house and he has stopped coming) and that's it, it's Christmas tomorrow, I hope you're all having nice holidays btw, and I feel like I don't have a single person that I look forward talking to, my ex could send me a message, but even if she did, I don't want to talk to her after the choices she has made.

568,"apologies if the title comes across as this being a total no brainer, but the situation is a bit weird. quick infodump, my dads faced chronic health issues all his life, and ive seen him in and out of hospitals many times, so this isnt a total shock. right now though it seems its all caught up to him. since last weeks hes been intubated since he cant breath on his own, hes been unresponsive to words, and yesterday we found out that basically he has incredibly slim chances of getting any better than he is right now. 

my parents have been in the midst of a divorce this past year, so i only got to see him every other weekend if his health permitted. the last time i saw him in person was when i spent thanksgiving break with him, and it was a nice time. i talked on the phone a few times since then. 

where im at now is my moms told me i have the option of facetiming him in the hospital since i cant go in person because of covid. if i could go in person i wouldnt even have to ask. but in person vs digital just feels so distinctly different, especially considering his state. if i could be there and hold his hand and talk to him and truly be in his presence it would be different, but i just wonder since hes unresponsive what facetiming him would even be like. and hes still intubated, and from what ive heard he doesnt look good at all.

i just dont know what to do. i dont want to be kicking myself for not seeing him one last time, but i wonder if talking to him unmoving unresponsive over a screen will really be any closure either. at least right now my last memories of seeing him are good. im not really asking for any to make the choice for me but any input would be appreciated i guess, thanks",24Dec2020,1

My brother and I went back and forth with my dad on planning something for today to exchange gifts at his house. They both visited with my aunt just this past weekend who travels a lot and is very reckless with covid even now. My step dad is diabetic and my brother and I don't want to put our mom and him at risk or ourselves. My dad agreed to wear his mask in the house reluctantly but got no word on my stepmom.

We have been talking every night via voice messages the past like 5 days and he was saying how lucky he is and how pretty I am, how he has been really lonely the past 20 years etc. 


So today I wake up and see that the messages are all gone on telegram and he blocked me on discord. I don't understand why, I proved my age to him and we were planning on meeting for sex, so I wasn't too extreme about beint exclusive or anything. But he was saying how he loved me and wanted to be with me and I told him that I love him. I am so co fused and have this irrational bad feeling in my stomach.

575,"I've been seeing lots of posts like this but most are by women about their female best friends. Fundamentally the solution is the same, but how should I deal with this?

My closest friend has been on and off with his ex for about 3 years now. They've broken up 4 times, and it's been 6 months since they last broke up (their longest ""break""). She incredibly toxic and drives him mad, pisses him off, and also is emotionally abusive. She has issues that were being dealt with by a therapist but she stopped seeing her. She constantly involves every close friend (on her side, and my friends side) in all of their problems, including me. I generally try to help as much as I can and give good advice to both when they seek it, but both seem to throw it out the window. The emotional strain that their relationship caused me worsened my anxiety and I had to be put on medication to deal with some of my issues. I've been much better and off medication since they broke up.

Last week, my friend and I ran into her in public. We spoke for about a minute and that was it. She ended up texting him and they met up the next day. Despite all of the issues and stress that she causes him, seeing her for the first time in 6 months made him reminisce and miss the good times he had with her, regardless of the bad times. I've just found out that they are now talking again and slowly seeing each other. Normally, the solution would be easy: just stay out of it and it will be fine.

Except I know these two very well. It won't stay between them. The moment there's stress, he becomes an unresponsive, cold, and stubborn person, all whilst confused and seeking advice on what to do. She will message me, basically looking for me to be her ""therapist"" and help her get through their issue because I know my friend best and I've had to deal with some difficult things myself in the past. I've done it before but I can't do it anymore. I've told him I don't want to be involved, but I can't when it happens right there in front of my face.

At the end of the day, I love my friend. We've been best buddies for 10 years now and it's a lifetime friendship. We see each other many times per week and will even have the opportunity to work together full-time in February. I don't want to have to push him away, but I also don't want to have to deal with the issues that come with his relationship. I would tell him to go talk to another friend, but the only other friend that he's very close with feels very similar to me, just tired of this repetitive shit. I've tried convincing him that it's not a good idea, but that quickly led to us arguing. Talking to his girl is also a plan for disaster. How would you react?",24Dec2020,1

I'm seeing my friends in 4 days from now, would it be ""weird"" to ask them to feel the top of my head and see if that is normal? 

My parents won't check bc it was my dad who was the one who attacked me (he has anger issues/bipolar and refuses medicene and takes it out on everyone). I tried going to the doctor the morning after it happened but they refused to see me bc my parents weren't there with me... I just never got another chance to go yet.

577,"Ok. First of all thankyou to anyone willing to commit to read this and help me because I know this will be an extensive process... if you don't want to read it you probably won't have the advice I can use thanks for stopping by.

So there is this guy named J. J was one of my dads best buds growing up. I didn't know much about him but for what few stories I've heard about them, they were the ""shenanigan palls"". Young dumb and having fun guys you know? So point is he has a huge impact on my dads life and he looks up to J. 

25 years ago or so J was arrested for doing some extremely shady shit. J is Very. Very. Very smart. It had to do with the housing crisis and using credit fraud. He understands buisness, paperwork, and how to swindle. It comes across as his life long talent, but as most criminals he got caught! But here is the problem he got out and now he is very very close with my dad!

(Here is how I've became involved. This part I'm not really looking for advise on atm but will in the future. I belive the domino effect will solve this part)-&gt;

So my dad gets this 'info' from J daily. Its fucking Q Anon... it has not impacted our family much for my dad isn't the type to go out and say his opinions if that makes sense? But he is full fleged on board that Trump is gonna drain the swamp and its the beginning of a new America. Shit he still thinks TODAY Dec 24th that Trump is gonna win this election. The God damn videos have spinning wheels with lights on them in the background! God damn brainwashing! Ok I ranted. Point is my dad thinks he is getting nectars gold of information from J.

 (Let me remind you the guy who spent 2 decades proooooobably a skin head smh..)

So J is back in buisness! He is working with a creator on a nitrogen containment device and he is looking for investors! It hasn't hit the market yet and wants my dad to invest. Of course he does so here is were my advice is needed. 

IM NOT LOOKING FOR LEGAL ADVICE JUST WHAT STEPS I NEED TO TAKE TO CATCH THIS FUCKER!

So my dad signed an LLC which is joined by 1 other 'investor'. The purpose of this is because the 'Stock Investment' is minimal 5k. So together they paid 2.5 each using this LLC to then invest in said company!
FUCKING FISHY.

 -The LLC is legit under my state I've looked up the company number but what else can I do to find errors/flaws? Call the lawyer who made it? Or would he tell J if he is in on the rouse? 
J HAS CONNECTIONS I wouldn't doubt it if he has a ton of people/network to help him in this endeavor.

-So the company he is 'investing in' seems incredibly fishy. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to post links but for anyone who has a clue about website development if they could help me understand how legit it might be?(if I could post the website) But its got a shotty webstore. Obviously stock photos for everything. Very generic style if that makes sense? How do I find flaws in this buisness?

-I have a feeling J is not involved with this buisness but might be using this 'LLC' to bid on risky stocks in hope for a turnover. I'm going to try to contact this buisness to see if J is affiliated with it (not on my phone number of course)

-I have an opportunity to get closer to J. When I met him (recently and only 1 time.. also when he came to get that money from my dad for the investment) we talked about creating an infomercial for the product he is pushing. I plan to take this SLOW. I know he has my dad under his finger for when my mom mentions the sketchyness of his actions he sides with J! D:

-what information should I push for from J so I can get closer to unveiling this shit? I really do need help.

This feels like a fucking detective episode on TV but sadly its real life.. and I'm no Marty Bird. I need help trying to show this guys true colors but I need to be tactful on how I show my dad because I know if it isn't perfect it could backfire! I'm looking to get a whole perfolio of information before I show my dad so I can squash the cocroach of lies all the way to the Q SHIT he send my dad.

If I need to look elsewhere for help I'd appreciate help with that as well but to be honest if I find someone willing to commit to this and crack this case I'll be your friend for life. &lt;3

(hell i got promoted he flat out said if someone else applied for the job they would get it) 

So now we have an Employee that bitches and complains about litterally everything... He needs help at the counter? Texts the boss or screams at the boss he needs help and it falls on me to save the day since I was in the warehouse at one point. I don't help right away its ""my fault"" Hell he is the guy that asked for vacation days and got declined cause someone else already had them. So he no showed for 3 days. but never got fired cause who knows why. even after telling us that he would no show anyways. 

We also have an employee that lies through his teeth and commits to the lies.. Even when caught will still lie. He is a nice guy just super annoying/Lazy/bad at the job in general. 

We have the old school Vet, That essentially goes power hungry when the boss isn't here..But might not be a bad thing cause she will hand out punishment or try to anyways... Essentially her way or the highway..

586,"So, I chose a bit of an attention grabbing title, but I do hope you will stay.

So, first I need to explain why I am not a normal person.

I grew up in a home surrounded by fields with nobody around for miles. Other human life was hours away. We had no car, and my parents were disabled, so we had no way to get to places with other people. Because of this, I was homeschooled, and never had any friends.

I'm going to have to summarize this part quite quickly as saying everything in full would take forever.

At age 5, lasting until I was 9, I was molested by a relative who would often visit. At age 9 to 14, I was groomed on the internet.

Besides the grooming, I did make friends online. Because of this, my real social skills became rather inadequate, and my online social skills increased.

I also took an interest in writing, which heightened my vocabulary and speaking etiquette.

I also grew up in a very liberal/left home. I'm bisexual, and am very openly supportive of the LGBTQ+ community as a whole.

I also love video games and anime.


So what happens when you put those things together? You get the current me, who is now 16.

A non gender identifying bisexual who hates to be touched due to trauma. A person who has no speaking skills but when they do speak they come off as pretentious. A person who loves videos games and barely understands human emotion or reaction.
(I'm sorry if I explained that badly)

And that's the tip of the iceberg. There's so much about myself that I can't write down or explain. It's like my upbringing has made me wired different.

But anyway, let's get to the point. I started college this year.

I always knew I was different to most people because of my experiences, but I never knew it was this bad. People talk completely different to me, they don't give off noticeable social ques, I can barely read them, they are openly homophobic- there's so much I don't understand and can't comprehend about normal people.

I hate it. I want to adjust myself so that I can actually make friends, but I can't read anyone. I have no idea how to behave.

To make things worse, I'm afraid I've developed strong feelings for a boy in one of my classes. I feel so strongly about him that it makes my heart ache. I've never had a crush before, I don't know what I'm supposed to be feeling or what I should do.

I have explained all of this poorly, I'm sorry. I'm quite emotional right now.

So to summarize, I need any advice I can get on how to act, and speak, and behave. And what to expect from these new types of people.

Please, anything. I'm so clueless.",24Dec2020,1
587," 

So on sunday my great-grandmother died of COVID19, I told no one about it at the time.

One day later I told my friend I wasn't feeling well and needed to talk. He was working at the time so I told him I'd speak to him later.

I expected him to text me after he was home, he didn't. 5 hours later I decid to text him again. We talked about the situation a while later. The convo lasted like half an hour or so, at the end he told me I could count on him. All very well except for the fact that one he pretty much ignored me and would probably fully ignore me if I didn't double text him and that two (by chance what annoys me the most) he never texted me since then (2 days) like a minor ""how are you?"" would suffice but not even that, I'm not sure if he's expecting ME to text him for the third time.

She always wants money but I wanted to put some thought into her gift this year so I got her something that I felt she would like &amp; be useful to her as well. She then said I could’ve just gave her money because that’s what she wanted. She owes me about $225 but I  haven’t even mentioned and she hasn’t either. She got me a $40 electric blanket in the beginning of the year and told me it was my Christmas gift, (which I loved and use it almost every night) When it comes to gifts my dad has always given me better quality gifts than my mom most years. He bought me the newest MacBook for my bday &amp; more things and my mom took me to dinner although I would never bring that up or try to compare or bring that up to her. 

She is right about us not spending much time together but I told her I’d try to spend more time with her just a couple of days ago. It just made me feel bad that she constantly compares our relationship to me &amp; my dads. She says she does more for me &amp; took care of me all my life so she doesn’t understand why I “treat him better.” 

The point is that just ruined my Christmas mood, I already don’t have a big family so it’s usually just me her &amp; my dad on holidays. Is the way she feels justified? Am I selfish or inconsiderate to her feelings for buying my dad a more expensive gift? Should I return it and give her money like she wanted or should I just let things be how they are...",24Dec2020,1

608,"I am a cystic fibrosis (CF) patient, I live in England now but grew up in a small community On the Isle of Man(IoM). The drugs we take are very expensive and very rare. They costs the average CF patient about £18k a month (covered by the NHS).
I am a remote working engineer and have decided to spend the winter months on the IoM with my family; and have thusly requested my monthly drugs to be delivered by Lloyds clinical homecare (usual handlers) to deliver to my IoM address. 
This is where it gets confusing... 
my sister also suffers from CF and lives permanently on the Isle of Man and also has her drugs delivered by Lloyds Clinical home care.
apart from my sister I know only 1 other CF patient on the IoM. But we do not speak and are only associates.

I was expecting a drug delivery this week. (To my temporary IoM address)
BUT: I received a message from this one other CF patient on the IoM (first message in 7 years) saying “I have just received this package” - a box of drugs (expensive drugs) with my sisters name on it - crossed through with pen (presumably by Lloyds pharmacy) and corrected to my name. But, With MY temporary address on the box. 
Despite this confusion in name, the address on the box is correctly my temporary address.
However despite the correct address (and pen corrected name) my expensive drugs were delivered to an apparent stranger..
Although maybe randomly.. maybe not; also a CF patient. 

Only because of our small community was I able to find out about this incorrect delivery.. it’s Christmas Eve at time of writing no service will answer my call.. but the long and short of it is; 
-I have not received my life saving drugs 
-a “stranger” has received them
-the box has my sisters name on it but is pen corrected to mine
-the “stranger” is also missing her drugs

I’m assuming the fault here is on two parties; Lloyds Clinical homecare and the local courriers that deliver drugs. 

Firstly for mislabelling a very expensive box of drugs and pen correcting it to my name (formerly my sisters)

And secondly the couriers for delivering a box of very expensive drugs to a stranger despite the address on the box being mine?

611,"Hi! So my whole family has been at my house for the past three weeks for Christmas. Today I was watching one of those videos on Instagram of a racist yelling racial slurs at a Muslim. I unconsciously muttered to myself “thats so racist” and then literally out of nowhere my neice jumps from behind me and says “what does racist mean?” 

It was such a sudden and loaded question I didn’t even know where to begin but then her mother (my sister) coincidentally called my neice to go to bed before i could answer. When neice was getting ready to go sleep she said “will you tell me tomorrow please?” and ofc me being a softy to my neice said i would.

When she settled to sleep I pulled my sister to the side and told her what happened. She was also suprised but said that the earlier neice is aware the better but at the same time neither of us know how to begin explaining racism to a 8 year old? 

I mean theres so many layers to the topic I can’t think of a simple enough way for a 8 year old to understand racism but also not undermime the seriousness and importance of the issue. We definitely want her to learn but I just need advice on how to say it? 8 year olds is a impressionable age and I don’t want to mess up",24Dec2020,1

616,"So basically im 19 almost 20, still live with my parents and for the past 4 years since the passing of a close family member and some mental abuse from my other family members caused me to develop an anxiety disorder, asocial disorder and period depression with suicidal intentions. I self medicated myself from age 15 with weed, it really really helped. 


however since it is illegal i got it from people who offered me other drugs too, and so i got into speed, molly, psychedelics, xans, anything i could got my hands on. 

I was eventually caught tweaked out of my mind on a coctail of drugs and got sent to a theraphist, who somewhat helped mosty by forbidding me to do any substance at all.

I claimed that weed helped me get my anxiety together and made me the person i want to be but he claimed its an awful thing because it is illegal and i can get arrested, and that he knew a person that has died from weed. which i know is not possible.

Now i am forced to take benzos i get off street to treat my anxiety depression and insomnia, which is fucking up my brain. I honestly just wish to be able to smoke weed, the reason i got into harder drugs in the first place was because weed smells and i live with my parents. 

What the fuck do i do? weed is incredibly theraphutic for me and im forbidden from smoking it ever again and am fucking my brain up by pills just to feel sane.

628,"(18M) Okay, so I should start off by saying that I've always struggled with depression and anxiety issues and have always had a hard time dealing with and understanding my own emotions no matter how rational or irrational they are, and recently I'm really struggling with self-hatred and finding happiness within myself and have always found myself attaching it to other people and I don't know how to change it. I haven't had many friends in my life and my friendships have never been the best or the healthiest and it's usually because of me.

One of my friends (19F) I've known for about a year and a couple of months now. I felt interested in them (as a person) since we met as I felt we had similar interests and like a lot of the same films and are both interested in art and music. Since I met them I always seemed to be attached to them and always found myself in a position where I could be easily hurt without them realising. For example, this time last year they told me they couldn't hang out for a while because of studying and although I never made this clear because I felt I was being unreasonable I felt very rejected by it. We became closer (over the internet) when the pandemic started and after all our exams were cancelled. It was around this time that I felt like I had an unhealthy friendship with them. I always found that I wanted their approval and would always listen to music or watch films they mentioned to try to get them to like me and if I ever felt like I had a bad interaction with them would get very depressed and feel like shit for a couple of days afterwards.

Although she's always very nice to me whenever I get a text from her now I get incredibly anxious and nowadays I never text her because I feel so anxious and get this sinking feeling. I don't really know why but I think it's because I've attached too much of my worth to what she thinks of me. I feel like I am not very honest with her about myself because I'm worried about what she will think about the things I spend my time doing. Sometimes, if I mention a book I'm reading or something and she says she's seen it or read it I often feel unable to read it without thinking about what goes through her head when she does. And if she says she doesn't like it I don't seem to enjoy it anymore. I feel like I should mention that this could all just be a byproduct of my own depression because I find it hard to enjoy anything sometimes and maybe it's no surprise that I can't be happy or have a normal friendship. Sometimes if I go onto a group chat that she's in and she's sent some messages sometimes I start to feel depressed because she isn't talking to me and I'm not her first choice which I know is stupid because I sometimes don't even want her to talk to me because of how anxious I get.

It was a few months ago that I became attracted to her. I feel very bad about this because I feel like I am invading her privacy in a way. Although I've never said anything to her (and I feel she only sees our friendship as a purely platonic one) I often think about her when masturbating even though I think it's bad and don't want to. In conversations we've had in the past where sex has come up I've found myself very interested in what she thinks about it and find myself thinking about it long after the conversation has ended. If I'm watching a film that she has seen that has sex references in I can never enjoy the film without wondering what went through her head when she watched it and often I don't enjoy it and want to stop thinking about it. I feel like this makes me a bad person and/or slightly perverted and I really want to stop it.

I don't feel like I want to be in a relationship with her because I feel like I wouldn't be very good in a relationship but I feel very sexually attracted to her and sometimes want to be in relationship with her for that reason even though I feel it isn't a good idea to be in a relationship with someone who I am so anxious around and sometimes dishonest about myself to. I also feel like I'm ruining any chance I have at having a normal friendship because I sometimes feels like she values our friendship but I sometimes feel like I wished I'd never met her because of how attracted I've become to her and wish that I could see her as just a friend and not attach so much of my self worth to her.

I know that this is all my problem and it's in my head but I don't know how to adjust my attitudes towards other people and could really use some advice.",24Dec2020,1

632,"Trying to start a YouTube channel. I feel like absolute trash compared to everyone in this community. Major imposter syndrome possibly?

I’m thinking about starting a YouTube channel. It will be for a tips and tricks guide channel for a popular video game.

I’ve been at a roadblock for a while. I’ve seen other people in this games competitive scenes Twitter and I see that they post SAT scores where they place Top 1 percent in the nation. I feel like dog shit compared to them and I feel like a fraud.

Another instance is when I criticized someone for something they did and they just sent me a bunch of medals they earned at another game. LAN tournaments too. I feel like I’ll never amount to anything if that’s the type of people that i come acrossed.

I then look at other people doing the same tho g I do. They have way better hardware. Have a huge following. They are buddy buddy with developers and I feel like it’s so fucking unfair and that I’m just an unknown piece of shit.

Ever since I started playing this game I’ve tried my best and got pretty good. I tried to go competitive but I didn’t really get far. I was limited in my hardware and was passed up by a lot of teams because I wasn’t known and they thought I hacked because I was new and doing well. I just got tossed aside.

Persons of the story: my wife - SO (27), wife's manager - Dave (30). On to the story.

My SO started working at this chain restaurant 2 months ago w Last night she had a Christmas party with her colleagues after work. She called me at 9pm updating me that they just finished dinner and heading back to Dave's apartment for drinks and hang. We have this thing where every now and then when either of us are going out we'll call and text each other about how the night is going. 

Now by 9:30pm she texted me saying her 3 other colleagues (Dave's gf included) had gone out to get more alcohol and she stayed back with Dave because she was tired after a drink (SO and I are very light drinkers, we get tired after 1-2 drinks) and didn't wanna walk.

Abit of back story, she started working at this restaurant 2 months ago and had a good working relationship with most staff there, and Dave as they have banters and joke all the time. We thought well of Dave as he help guide SO to do her job well since she started and they work well together. Dave's girlfriend also works and live with him and was also at the party.

To the harrassment, after everyone left to get drinks, Dave being drunk started to joke around, patting SO's head and at the same time grabbed her breast! She pushed Dave away and said: ""No Dave! What are you doing?!"". He got really awkward and scratch his head. SO at this point got really uncomfortable and excused herself saying she had to call her mom. This is when she called me to pick her up crying but not telling me why. At this point she turned around and Dave disappeared into his room.

I arrived 10 minutes later to find her at the sidewalk waiting. On the ride home she told me the details.

It really made me mad thinking about it because of a few reasons:
1. He knows my SO is married, even met me and served my mom at this restaurant 
2. Dave lives and works with his gf and my SO, yet he had the audacity to do this!
3. I trusted the guy, thinking he was good for helping my SO to do well at her first waitress job.

Now I texted him 2 hours ago at 5am: ""Dave this is EatALargeDuck, SO's husband. Call me in the morning we need a talk.""
I plan to meet him at a coffee shop giving him a piece of my mind. I'm not an aggressive person but I'd like to be firm about this. How should I approach it?

Thanks all in advance.",24Dec2020,1
635,"Hey everyone.
At the moment I have a girlfriend, but I think I want to break up.
My love feelings for her are just disappearing.
But the thing is, I've promised her I would stay with her forever, marry her, and have her kids.
She's has depression, and she told me already a bunch of time that if I would leave her, she couldn't even imagine living anymore.

I now haven't seen her in 1 month and a half because of a problem that happened between my girlfriend, my parents, and me.
So my parents won't allow me to go until she found help for her problems.

I just don't know how to leave her. I can't tell her in real life for 2 reasons:

1) I'm not allowed to see her because she lives at the other side of the county

2) I'll probably be traumatised by how she'll react.

I've heard from multiple people that it's a dick move to text her, but for me it's the only option.
What do I say to her guys? I really need your advice.",24Dec2020,1

Hello dear people!

My problem is a friend I've known for almost 8 years now.
We actually always get along well most of the time but for the past year or so (or a little more) it seems to me like he mistakes my kindness for weakness. I've noticed that every now and then, big or small, he asks for favors. Which I grant him as best I can. Of course I don't let him talk me into every nonsense but most of the time it's just little things. The thing is, he hardly appreciates it, hardly shows gratitude.
He is also a great manipulator. Twists things so that they play to him and when you call him on it he kind of talks his way out of it. Or at least he tries to. I've grown to dislike the time it takes to have a discussion, so I rarely if ever go into it, as well as other friends. We saw it as a thing we could deal with. But it became more and more and more unnecessary, so that he also unironically started to insult us, better said me. As it was the case today.
After eating and unwrapping the presents, I wanted to meet with said friend on a joint. There were as so usual problems with the meeting and somehow it has once again come to an éclat on the phone. From his side. It was a small thing, as so often. You must know that he has low battery and was just out, so we made up a time plus meeting place. I unfortunately missed the bus so I said to him please meet me at another meeting place about the same walking distance from where we were. He said that I should just walk down the right side of the street, although he meant the left, which I had to clarify, again highlighting his indifference and ignorance. So I told him not to say right when he meant left, to which he again tried to talk himself out of it, so I hung up. Still wonder how he finds the time when he says he only has one percent battery. Anyway, he called again and said in an angry tone, what I thought of just hang up, I ""freak"". 
I then explained that I understood and hung up and went back.
I have long suspected that it is (obviously) a toxic friendship, however, I must say that there are some good sides and it can be quite funny from time to time and his friendship is somehow connected to other friendships (if that makes sense).
What do you guys suggest I do?
Thank you for your time and in advance!

637,"Hello, I’ve come to internet strangers for some advice. 

I (24F) moved out a month early from my rented place because of my bad roommate (25F).

Some things that led to me leaving: always being late on rent, never scooping her cat’s litter box, never FEEDING/WATERING her cat, never cleaning up after herself (leaving dishes for weeks at a time), but most of all moving her boyfriend (24M) in without asking me and both of them being extremely loud and keeping me up at night even after repeated requests for them to be quiet.

This went on for months before I had enough and bought a house to leave. We finally closed and I moved out as soon as I could.

I still pay my half of rent cause that was our agreement.

Here is where I need advice:

I just went to the apartment to pick up the last of my things and her cat had NO FOOD. NO WATER. Idk how long it’s been that way. As soon as I put food and water down for the cat, she ran right to it and starting drinking and chowing down. The litter box looked like it had been scooped a couple days ago. 

What do I do? I already knew there was a good chance she wouldn’t take care of this cat but she assured me she would remember to start feeding it and watering it. The last time I was there she had even bought it new toys and scratching posts (since I took what I had bought for my cat). 

Her cat is also a long haired cat and her fur was super matted and gross. 

As an animal lover, I feel so guilty leaving this cat with her when it’s clearly being neglected. What do I do? I’m afraid to steal the cat for fear she will press charges.",24Dec2020,1
638,"As I am writing this, my father just returned after being away for a few months (he opened a shop with some woman 3 hours away from our home and has an apartment there) and got into a heated fight with my intoxicated mother, which caused her to leave with her boyfriend to his house. (They are divorced, kind of.) Leaving my 9 YEAR OLD brother confused and sad, before Christmas of all days.

This is not even the worst thing to happen. Both of them messed up big time this year and it is getting worse. There is a lot of things to be said but it's waay too long for a post.

Tonight I felt like it was the final straw. I feel mentally ill, I cant seem to stop shaking-- I feel the urge to just let loose and cry, but for some reason I just.. cant. I feel empty, like I am a robot who can't process emotion, and sadly I am stuck in this house until Feb or March.

I would just like to get some advice on how to survive this, until I can leave? How to cope? If I continue like this, this ongoing trouble will kill me.

So I’ve been working for said company for almost 6 months now and my coworkers are GREAT my boss is GREAT however....I just received an offer to work for a brokerage that would allow me to make unlimited income. Renewal commission. Health insurance. 401k. All things my current job doesn’t offer. I would be working remote since the company is based out of state.

I for sure dont want to force him into to do stuff he thinks is boring, but imo sometimes doing boring stuff together its just for the time to be together..

Currently we just watch an episode and he is done with being around me after that. I want more but i can tell he gets bored when we arenwatching. We used to play a game together but he thinks its boring now and all other games i suggest he refuse to play.

Although I do love spending time with her she keeps making plans with me and on the day of she will cancel. This is stressful for me because no matter how much I try not to get excited, there’s a part of me that does. It’s a let down when she tells me she has forgotten that she needs to go to her husbands grandmothers house or she needs to get groceries or she needs to clean. She just had a baby last week and I’ve been helping her a lot. She has ptsd that was controlled but since the birth, she’s been having panic attacks again. I’ve taken off work the last couple of days to help her and yesterday she asked me to come over today. I bought fresh bread to take and a ramune soda which is special for us. This morning I got ready and was excited with everything ready to go. I called and again she cancelled. She said that her husband would watch the baby and she was going to sleep.

645,"I (28M) cheated on my gf (27F) of 3 years with her best friend (27F). 

It happened last weekend when we hosted a covid-friendly Christmas sweater party. She was my beer pong partner and after a few tequila shots and several beers she got pretty tipsy. The more we started winning, the more ""handsy"" she was getting. I would lie by saying I didn't like the attention because she is an attractive girl but I knew I had to remain cool and tell her to calm down a bit. 

When things began quieting down, my girlfriend asked me to drive her home as she had quiet a bit to drink. Others took our couches and spare room to stay the night. I get to her apartment and she asks me to walk her inside because she's worried. At this point I try to tell her she'll be fine but she wouldn't let up (it was like talking to a wall). 

We get there and she asks me if I could keep a secret and progresses to compliment my looks and starts taking off her clothes. I knew it wasn't the right thing but i just got rock hard. We had quick unprotected sex and I came home right afterward. I am for certain I came inside her. It's been a week and I haven't heard anything from her until today, where my gf asked me to drop off her Xmas gift.

646,"I’m not pregnant or will be anytime soon.  It has taken me a while to finish my undergrad, but I am almost there you guys! In a year and half I should be finished. I am working on my engineering degree and on track to be employed with the company I am interning once I graduate. 

I still live at home. My bf is still working on finding a job after a year long unemployment and figuring out what career he wants. I don’t see us realistically moving in together until a year or so after I graduate in order to have some money saved up which puts me at 28/29. I really love what I do and the company I work for. I really feel like I’m making a difference in the world working there. 

I feel like as a woman I have societal pressures when it comes to having a child soon. I’m nearing my 30s. I really do want a child but I feel like it will be a while until I am ready. I would like to save up for wedding and save up for a child too before I have one. In my opinion, I’d be in my mid or late 30s when I’m done with that. 

My dilemma is that if I do have a child, I would love to be a SAHM for the first few years of my child’s life. But at the same time I don’t want to give up my job. At least for my company, I’ve never heard of part-time engineers. My bf didn’t attend college nor does he plan to. His line of work is decent but I will be bringing more money. We’ve discussed it and he says we should do daycare. I don’t want that but he says he wouldn’t be able to support us with just his salary. 

I don’t know why I’m thinking so far into the future for a timeline that might not go exactly as planned. I feel like it’s not fair bringing a child into this world if we both end up struggling. But it has always been a goal of mine to experience motherhood and my child’s first few years. We had an unplanned pregnancy when we were younger and I miscarried. We promised to each other to not put ourselves in that position until we are financial stable. 

Am I way too much of an over-thinker? Like if I realistically want to have a child and enjoy being a SAHM, do I have to suck it up and accept that I will lose my career and have to live a simpler life or would I have to give up being a SAHM?",24Dec2020,1

651,"I work at a psych hospital. I have my doctorate in psychology. There is a nurse who several people have warned me about being disrespectful to females. He has been difficult to work with but I have been trying to have a good rapport. However, when it comes to submitting incidents, he always has something to say. I’m not sure what exactly because he talks in circles and when I ask direct questions such as “are you saying I shouldn’t report it?” He says no. One time I reported homicidal ideation and he said “you hold onto things” when I walked into his office and I had no idea what he was referencing until I asked. 

Since then, I have mostly submitted incident reports on suicidal ideation with plan. Almost every time he has approached me with his voice raised, calling me dude (which I wouldn’t mind if he called the male providers this and he also told me he was going to keep calling me by my first name when I explained my title). I also had someone who I don’t supervise but they report to me with updates call me very upset saying he yelled at them when they submitted a report. 

Most recently, I had to submit an incident report so I notified the nurse on duty and she told me “we don’t submit incident reports on that.” I kept explaining that we do and I especially have to as I have been directed to do so in my department. It came down to they were afraid of getting pushback so I said let’s go to his office together so he knows it’s me. (If I forgot to add, he’s one of the supervising nurses). 

this was probably one of his worse rants. He told me “I guarantee dr. Johnson (name changed) didn’t submit a report when this happened.” I explained that I’m not dr. Johnson and that my supervisor directed me to do so. I explained I got feedback after conversation with him just to make sure because I took his feedback seriously. It finally ended when I said I just have to submit it I’m not trying to make your job more difficult and I thought it ended on a good note. Except when I was typing the report he came in and made a rude comment about what information I should have told the nurse (which I did so I’m guessing they just forgot or I’m mistaken but either way I explained to him the second I mentioned reporting it they said we can’t do that). 

The next morning I decided to look through prior incident reports on this patient from before I was assigned to the ward. Not only were there several from dr. Johnson, but from his nurses and staff sent to him for review (meaning he was definitely aware of it). I’m not sure if he was purposely lying to get me to do something different but after months of being yelled at and talked down to for upwards of an hour at a time, I decided to print them out to show him in hopes this would end. 

I presented it as nicely as I could, I didn’t just hand them to him I said I don’t expect you to read all of these I just wanted to show you this has been done so please help me understand your line of thought. I’m not trying to make your job difficult and I want you to see that dr Johnson was doing the same as well as the rest of the staff. He sighed and started his reply with dude and I said in a soft gentle tone “please, (name), please don’t call me dude.” And he grabbed the papers and stormed out, purposefully slamming the door hard. 

I called my supervisor and she said I didn’t do anything unprofessional and to not worry about it because that’s how he is and I have to do the right thing. Later the director of my department called me and said he pulled her aside and told her what happened saying I was “adversarial.” She didn’t tell me her opinion just asked for my perspective. I explained my intent and admitted I am frustrated of being disrespected and not being able to do my job if an hour of my time is taken up every time I have to do a report. And in front of other staff it makes it look like I’m incompetent and thus hits affected how they respond to me as well (which is extremely important in this kind of setting). 

I gently reminded her how I’ve told her these issues before, I said “idk who’s going to talk to him about how he interacts with female staff...” I wanted to ask why she never went to his supervisor but now she’s asking me about this. I didn’t want to sound confrontational because I’m sure she has good intentions but it did make me feel like I need to tolerate his behavior even when he’s yelling at me and if I even try to respectfully stand up for myself I’m at risk of getting in trouble. She confirmed that he is wrong and I need to continue to report it. She did say that he called her dude as well and I reminded her that I’ve never heard him call a male provider “dude” before, and if he was respectful overall I would let it go. It’s just how he uses it. She said she told him I have a right to not want to be called dude, but also told me she doesn’t think he meant harm by it. Which is odd because the first time I told her, she replied, “he called you dude?” In a shocking tone. 

So, was I wrong for printing the papers? I now see how it can come off, but for months he has been giving me a hard time when I submit the reports and it was a new statement that they never did it before so I thought showing him would shut it down. Also, am I going to look bad to my department head now? This whole situation is stressful and I don’t know what else to do since she’s already aware and hasn’t done anything. Maybe she knows nothing will be done; I’ve been told that he’s been moved around wards a lot for how he treats women and we had a nurse who recently quit and said it was because of him. She was crying every day. It’s just mind blowing to me because, at risk of sounding narcissistic, I’m supposed to be the expert on suicide risk in this situation. I’ve never had interactions like this with supervising nurses before. You’re supposed to be able to go to them with any concerns and it’s always so difficult with him.",24Dec2020,1

She didn't talk with me, or interact (but claim for some random reason that bringing me home is invasion of her privacy at home) since she hate me and our relationship and try to make everyone against me like i was some kind of demon or smh and this kind of emotional manipulation make her little sister (17) head against me as well.

She favours my brothers over me and constantly calls me lazy and a ""parasite"" despite the fact that I listen to her every command, meanwhile they don't have any chores. She also embarrasses me in front of family members, family friends and teachers, either making up stories about me or putting words in my mouth. She's made it 100% clear that she hates me and tells me all the time that she can't wait until I move out. Even right now, she was talking to my dad about me, how she wonders if I'll ever get married, since I'm so despicable, and how I'll never get a decent job. All while laughing and saying ""Yes Zofia! We're talking about you!"" She was also refusing to pose with me for a picture, saying ""I can't move any closer. This is too close for me."" in a disgusted tone when my dad asked her to move next to me in order to fit in the frame. She always comments on my appearance, calling me fat, despite me having a BMI of 21 and herself being overweight. She's kicked me out multiple times. Last time she kicked me out was because I missed the bus, 3 weeks ago. Literally kicking me in the lower back and throwing pens at me and finally slamming the door. She's threatened to call my school and tell them I'm dropping out, and to send embarrassing pictures of myself to the school. 


And I don't know why this is. I've played close attention to my behaviour for years and I haven't noticed anything which might have upset her/is upsetting her. I listen to her every word, I have above average grades, I don't drink, smoke or take drugs and I definitely don't have any friends she doesn't approve of. I just don't understand where this hatred is coming from.


I have nowhere to go, we're immigrants and our family lives in our home country. Our closest family members are a 14 hour drive away from us, and I have absolutely zero money. 


I just feel there's no way out. Any advice/explanation of her behaviour would be greatly appreciated.


Thanks.",24Dec2020,1
664,"omg i (f, 17) feel so so stupid. so i liked this girl who’s also bi. i wasn’t interested in her to begin with but we started working together and got closer. then she seemed to be interested ig?? she would get super close to me and touch me a lot. i then started liking her because of that and because i love her personality. 
i didn’t realize i added her on snapchat but i did apparently so we started talking there a bunch. then i started hinting that i’m bi so she’d get the message. pretty sure she did and now she’s ignoring me. then she joined my private story and i’d post stuff that interested both her and myself. she’d swipe up a bunch but recently just stopped. it all just started going downhill after i asked her to hang out. i don’t really like her anymore but i don’t want it to be awkward at work. what should i do?",24Dec2020,1

667,"To clarify before getting into the post, i’m not asking if it’s a good idea to get revenge or not. I’m instead asking for the best ways to get back on some of the scummiest lowest level people on this earth. Someone I once knew as a friend sexually assaulted a close friend of mine a while back and caused a huge divide in the circle. Thus separating those of good intentions and righteous moral compasses and those who have no empathy or regard for anyone. The three people who have split apart from the circle (rightfully so) are as follows: a sexual assaulter, a narcissist that without a shadow of a doubt could be diagnosed with a personality disorder and has aided the sexual assaulter since day one, and another supporter. These people have caused so much pain for the victim ever since the incident and rightfully deserve some sort of revenge. While they are blocked on everything they all remain in a snapchat group chat of what used to be a friend group. Most of those in this group chat are completely unaware of the entire scenario. I would like to leave this group chat along with another friend that is on the right side of this situation. Before leaving though I would like to leave behind a string of messages consisting of text, images, videos to truly piss off and inform the group chat of what has happened. I would like some advice as to how the best way to go about this would be. I would also enjoy advice relating to what should be said and how it should be said. Advice surrounding spamming phone numbers or emails would also be helpful. Any help at all is greatly appreciated.

But a few days ago she called my mom and said I was absolutely not allowed over for Christmas until I had a pullup on at all times and it needed to be visible..
My mom was already kind of freaking out because she was scared she would have to pay for the couch, so I seriously had to leave the house today in nothing but a T-shirt and a pullup so she’d calm down.

677,"I personally don't like Facebook, but some of my family and friends strongly prefer to use Facebook messenger to contact me. Despite exchanging numbers and emails and telling them that I prefer to not use Facebook, these people still contact me through Facebook messenger. How could I get them to contact me via text or email instead?

(I've thought about deleting my Facebook messenger account, but there are a couple of things I need to use messenger for.)

I've also been working with 2 other volunteers on a nonprofit project. (The project only consists of us 3 volunteers and is not affiliated with any organization.) We've been exchanging messages over the last couple of months via a Facebook messenger group chat.

Facebook messenger group chat is an inefficient form of communication. It can take a long time to scroll up to previous messages (especially when each page takes a few seconds to load). Also, the desktop interface lost its search functionality during the latest interface redesign (you can search for contacts but not search the content of messages).

I listed the weaknesses of Facebook to the leader (of our group of 3). I also explained how another platform like Slack would be better suited to our needs. However, she ignored my concerns. Is there a way to convince her to move our 3-person chat to another platform?

In general, how should I convince people to not use Facebook to contact me?

I understand that people are familiar with Facebook and don't want to learn a different platform (regardless of how much Facebook sucks or how much better the other platform is). What advice would you have for getting people to try new things?

I find that I often have trouble convincing people when discussing things. Any general advice for convincing people to change their minds?",24Dec2020,1
678,"TL;DR - my brother doesn't speak to me even when we're forced to interact and I want to avoid that stress over Christmas without hurting my families feelings.

Ok so ill try to keep it short. I (30 M) have been living far away from my parents for about 4 years, and until this year, haven't seen them in about 5 years. So I lost my job and housing due to the pandemic and had to move back home. So I now get to spend my first Christmas with my family in almost half a decade.

My brother (35 M) hasn't spoken to me since the last time I was in town 5 years ago. He's a marine vet and a cop, and I'm a leftist. Like oil and water but we kept it civil because we were family. However after a couple drinks he decided to confront me about my leftist views and I kept is civil with ""I dont understand why we can't hold people accountable for killing unarmed innocent people"". Well that set him right off and he decided to come at me with a screwdriver saying things like ""im unarmed!"" ""What would you do"". So I was stepping back and creating space telling him to relax and speak to me while he's doing this, and my mom had to intervene and take the screwdriver away from him.

About 2 days later he deleted me off Facebook and I messaged him APOLOGIZING TO HIM FOR COMING AT ME WITH A SCREWDRIVER. He's never spoken to me since.

So now I'm living at my parents, we had Thanksgiving dinner together despite the pandemic. I was in my room watching TV when he came over and all my family was laughing and drinkin (I dont drink at all anymore so I don't like just sitting around drinkin) and when I came down for dinner, he didn't even say hello to me. You could've cut the tension with a knife. We had the whole thanksgiving dinner and he couldn't even acknowledge my existence. My mom waited until the next day to tell me he wants nothing to do with me. Then why even invite me down, just let me eat my dinner in my room lol.

Anyway, I thought my parents were going to his house for a Christmas exchange and I could just stay at home. Nope, apparently he's coming over here and I just cannot deal with it. There's no reason for me to be here and I'm just going to ruin Christmas for everyone else by making it uncomfortable.

So how do I explain without hurting my parents feelings that I would much rather do ANYTHING but be at home during Christmas? And where should I go in the middle of a pandemic. I don't have friends in this town anymore so ill most likely just go watch Netflix in my car.",24Dec2020,1

680," I'm 13, turning 14 next year, and next year I will start high school. I'm still not discipline, I can't bring myself to achieve my goals. A few days ago I had a tennis tournament 4 hours away in another town and I lost both of my matches. In the beginning of the second match I was messing around a little and I wasn't that focused, it wasn't until my parents left the tennis courts because they were angry that I pulled myself together and focused, but it was already too late. I eventually lost in a tiebreak and driving back home, I was full with regret. I don't know what came over me, and this wasn't the first time it had happened. A girl I had beaten before eventually won the consolation group and all I could feel was regret, it could have been me if I had focused from the start. Today, I told my mom that I wanted to pay for all the lessons and tournaments for next week. I'm hopefully thinking that by using my own money (that I was saving for college), I will begin to focus and become more discipline, and by this I will hopefully begin to learn how to become more serious and ""wake up"". I don't have much time left to fool around. I have to somehow find a way before high school to get myself together and be motivated to do things I don't like to necessarily do.

682,"Hi, thanks for reading.   


I have a hard choice to make within two weeks, really within less than a week but I can stall for more time if I need to.  First, some background on me.    
I'm an incredibly anxious person, and this anxiety mainly revolves around social interaction.  I am terrified of meeting new people, as the idea fills my head with hundreds if not thousands of scenarios where I make an idiot of myself, say something embarrassing, pull a weird expression, make the situation awkward, be perceived as ugly, &amp; in general offend people with my presence.  These thoughts come without provocation and I've never been able to do anything to stop them.  They have kept me from going to parties, making new friends, having fun experiences, ect.  They've kept me in the corner, always out of sight, always shying away from being anything close to the center of anyone's attention for fear of looking like an awkward, embarrassing dumbass.  I know that objectively, I'm at least a semi-attractive person, and in the few instances where I've made a friend online or through sheer forced interaction like in a workplace I get along well with them- but I am powerless to stop the fear.  It rules me, and I'm so tired of it ruling me, but it does.    
Recently this track record of making no connections has led me to an all time low point, the girlfriend I'd managed by a miracle has moved away to pursue higher education and without her in my life I've realized I have literally nobody to call friend, acquaintance, anything.  
Underneath all the fear I've drowned in since before I can remember, I *have* always wanted &amp; dreamed of having friends.  Life for me has usually been a viscous cycle of being alone, plucking up the courage to face my fears and meet people, getting close to doing so, &amp; then being completely overwhelmed by a maelstrom of anxious self-hate that drags me back into isolation.  I have tried seeking psychological help, but I don't have any kind of insurance &amp; can't afford the anti-anxiety medications I've been recommended.   
Guh.  So, now you have a picture of me.  Obviously I would love advice on how to deal with my condition, if it can even be called a condition.  But the life choice I'm coming up on is a simple one that keeps me up at night.  Currently, I'm in an apartment by myself, going to school online.  I see nobody but my cat (bless her) and there are no opportunities for me to try and meet people as my innermost parts desire.  I had applied to move into a student cooperative this spring, specifically in January (around the 7th), and I was accepted.  It's a place where 100 students live &amp; contribute to the house, doing dishes, cleaning, doing maintenance, ect.  I lived there for a span a few years ago, right after I'd moved out of my family home &amp; several states away, but timid 18 y/o me was a total ghost and I made no friends, went to no parties, participated in nothing but the labor that was required of me.  I regret all those opportunities that I didn't take, and a big part of me wanted to give it another try so I can finally face down this beast inside me, slay it, and make some real friends.    
But, well...  Here we are, the 24th of December, and I'm having cold feet.  Glacially cold.  A big part of me is thinking that I'm just not built for social interaction, that I should stay on my own, because if I move in, try, and fail again it's going to crush me into dust.  I know that there are people who are just loners, and maybe that's me?  Maybe I'm trying to force myself into having friends because I think that's what people are supposed to do.  I want to move in and make friends, but I don't want to either move in and waste my time or embarrass myself.  Maybe I... well, uh, you can see the struggle that's going on in my head.  These thoughts fly around at a million miles a minute, and I've realized I need some external input.   


I realize there's a lot going on here, any input would be so greatly appreciated.

683,"I (21F) work at a company like Ups for over a year now and I had an altercation with a co-worker yesterday.
Back story: I worked for my company for a year and applied for safety committee. ( safety committee are people who make sure employees are following safety rules)( I don’t get paid more) I spoke to Hr/ Team lead a bunch of times in meetings and reported it and they simply don’t care. There’s this lady I’ll call (Macy) who I have issues with, started drama yet again yesterday ( other times isn’t relevant to the story) and I asked her if she can please wear her safety gear properly the first time she did it , second time with attitude, third time she became hostile and aggressive and started to swear at me. I told my team lead before going to my HR that she was going crazy. I  never cursed at her nor did I saying anything to her in a negative way. ( not my best moment but all I said was wtf ? She cursed at me, wtf is she cursing at me?) before making my way to HR. I explained to my HR about the situation and she said she’ll speak to her a few minutes later she called me in saying the (Macy) said she didn’t appreciate the way I spoke to her( I said please?) so I don’t know why she said that and that I called her ( excuse me for saying this: a a dirty black germ) when I never said anything about her color . All I mentioned was stated above I applied for safety committee and I was asked by my team lead and Hr to tell employees to follow safety guidelines and to please wear her gear properly. So after that discussion Hr said to just ignore her and if anything happens again to report it. Onto today where I think I’m the asshole : she told me she wanted to demote me because of yesterday events and because “ people felt uncomfortable “ they never cared if I got cursed at nor did they care if people made me uncomfortable but that’s a different story and if things escalated again I can be terminated.
So I came home and reported my local center for not following safety guidelines and making me feel uncomfortable and feel threatened about losing my Job. I have videos and pictures as proof and I may speak to a lawyer if needed.

    My aunt recently died 2 months ago and this is the first Christmas that the family will be without her. My 18 year old cousin will be spending Christmas without his mother. I want to be there for my family but I am stuck watching over this elderly woman who is mean to me for Christmas.

In addition, I am about to transfer to this school that is quite expensive, but would be very beneficial to my career. Very supportive teachers for student-athletes (I'm taking 4 APs), school teaches students how to be good citizens rather than just get the work done, etc. We already signed a contract to go to the school.

I'm missing 1+ weeks of school at a time because of sports and I'm not allowed to make up some things I missed in some classes (hence, making me suffer later during the year because I have to get close to full marks on other assignments and exams).

But right now, I was doing physics extracurriculars instead of going to practice. Remember tonight is Christmas Eve, and I am quite tired of working my butt off and I am ""taking a break"" by doing physics homework. Sometimes, I threaten her that I won't go to practice and she'll tell me not to threaten her. So I don't threaten her and then I go to my sports practice. And then she'll threaten me if it doesn't she thinks I'm not putting in effort by saying she will withdraw from the school (remember we already had a contract) if I don't do what she says.

My stepdad (53) and my mum (43) got married just over a year ago, in a small wedding, no honey moon, when they had good financial income. However, this quickly changed, a few months later my stepdad lost his job, over a very small mistake, which we are going to court over. He’d been working for the company for over 10 years, so was devastated, luckily we have a good case, so at least that’s something. 

My mum (43) works 2 days a week, as she has to look after my brother with autism (11) the rest of the week. She also works part time at a cattery, when they have enough cats in, due to the lockdown she’s not been working, meaning our income has decreased massively.

I’ve sent home what I can, but unfortunately I also have bills to pay, as I provide solely for myself, working part time and using my student loan. Currently, I’ve sent home nearly £250. My other siblings, brother (16), step-sister (15) and step brother (13, with severe autism) are unable to provide any financial help. So it’s left down to me, my stepdad also pays child support for his children, as well as money towards his kids house mortgage, so they have a stable home. 

My mums taken a 3 month break on our houses mortgage, but unfortunately this has now ended.

I can’t get a larger loan, and my biological dad pays a small amount of child support for my brothers, so we can’t ask him for more help. We have no other family who we can ask for help.

Just to preface we are not close at all, but I feel like everyone is watching her act illogically and nobody is saying anything. She is bipolar, but I'm not sure if she is on meds. Anyway, this past summer she was living in an apartment with her 4 year old son. Flash forward to now she bought a house with a guy she has known for like 5 months and they are having a baby, and they got a puppy. She is constantly bashing her ex boyfriend(father of her child) about being a horrible person. The thing is, she barely knew her ex and slowly realized he was a POS. I feel like she is making the same mistakes again, possibly by going through a manic episode? I don't know that much about mania. Anyway, her dad (my moms boyfriend) did say to her ""Don't you think this is a little fast?"" and she cut him off and trash talked him on FB. She is actually constantly trash talking family on Facebook one day, then the next day her dad is the best dad in the world in a long Facebook post.

Really, I'm more concerned for her son. He already calls her new baby daddy ""daddy"", only my mom and her bf have met him one time. Stepsister will post about him, her new house and the baby all day on Facebook and it's just startling because men keep coming and going in her sons life... like something is off. It may come off like I am being pessimistic and unable to be happy for her.... but it's like....everyone feels the same way but we don't know how to approach her because she will cut everyone off, especially if we all do at the same time. Her son is so sweet who knows what will happen when they break up.

so does anybody have advice on how to help him? i don’t think it’s severe enough for him to even consider going to therapy and i don’t feel it’s my place to tell him to. maybe there’s just something i can do to show my support or make him think more rationally when he finds yet a new disease he thinks he has?

We became pretty close online friends due to us both liking the same artists and struggled with similar problems. They just became an adult this year, while I’m a few years younger. The majority consists of younger adolescents (13-14 year olds), I’ve even seen 10-11 year olds on there doing roleplay...

714,"Hi. I'm Eleanor.

I live in a group home (which I feel like wasn't a choice for me), and I've learned to like it there better than my own home. At the girls home, It's a bit stricter, but at least I can communicate my opinions, ideas and feelings more openly. I had an upset with my mum and stepdad recently. I felt really hurt and depressed by their words, not just that day, but the past as well. It was all coming into one, and so I decided to do self-harm. 

When my mum came into my room, she started to yell at me, ""you're only doing that for attention."" I threw the knife, and it hit her (which I found out later, the cut was on her leg, and it was around the size of a pimple). I tried to get her away from me, but I ended up on the ground with my legs up, trying to protect myself from her. She grabbed me by the leg, and started to pull me out of my room. As this was happening, I started to yank on her hair to try and get her to stop pulling me by the leg. She was very angry as this was all happening, and looked like she wanted to hurt me. 

My parents don't accept my opinions, and I never go to them about my feelings, because I know they'll reject them as well. I've learned to just keep my feelings to myself, bite my tongue and obey. They do nothing but lower my self esteem, and when I lash out from keeping all of my emotions inside, they force me to apologize and then punish me.

I'm talking with my biological dad, and I plan on moving in with him. He thinks it's a good idea, too. My bio dad is the only person I feel like I can openly talk to. I don't have any doubt that he loves me, when I question if my mum and stepdad really love me. I feel like I'm not a part of the family when I'm with them (mum and stepdad).

719,"Hey guys, so...  I need some advice from strangers, which aren't involved in the situation...

My Ex and I have decided to end our relationship of two years in late February 2020. He was very mentally abusive towards me and f.... up my psyche, where I would get depressed more and more each day. He leeched off my earnings and lived at my apartmend more or so rent-free...   
After we separated, he then wanted to stay friends, but I didn't. (I clearly stated, that I did not want it, because it hurts me) But he insisted. He contacted me on every app on which we were connected (even on our shared google calendar...) so, I told him **multiple times** over text to leave me alone. He didn't, so I blocked him everywhere except his number - just to be prepared in case... (you will see why soon)

So, when I started ignoring him and his texts, he first contacted ALL of my friends - even the ones he has no relation to but somehow got their phone number.  
After some time, when he realized, my friends wouldn't leak any information about me, he started parking his car in front of my apartment (which has multiple parties) and goes off to a nearby soccer field to play there. This started in the end of spring. (I live in a European country and we had the right to do so back then.)   
So I was emotionally very depressed and felt very anxious because I couldn't predict his next moves and knowing that he's here and hearing his car (he has a loud exhaust with a distinct sound) every time made me very nervous and cautious. During that time I was in home-office, so there was no place for me to go.   
After a month or so, I then confronted him and asked him to stop doing so, because I was on the verge of my nerves… He said, that he will do his best not to park in front of my house again. (you can imagine, that he didn't try to avoid me at all - he never ever ringed my bell or confronted me directly, but he knew that it bothered me, that he parked in front of my door, that's why he kept doing so)   
I also checked my legal actions that I could do and in that talk we had, I even threatened to take some legal actions against him. (but in the end I didn't because of personal reasons)

After bugging me and my friends by trying to contact me and them over and over again - I gave in. I told him to meet me at a place to talk. We met, and I told him to leave me alone. He saw how he emotionally hurt me. So, this worked out for a while… he didn't park in front of my house and generally avoided me. This lasted up to the end of September.

I was feeling better, started to forget him and what he did.  
I went home one night and suddenly, there was a single rose (there was no note, no message, f.... nothing.) by my door. (I live on the second floor, and he cannot get into the building without a key or ringing my neighbors bells.)

I was scared and contacted him - afterwards I felt dumb. But I really was afraid of what could happen next... So for a week or two I crashed at a friends place, just to cool down and be safe from him.

At the end of that week, his best friend contacted me. He said, he did not want to be anywhere near him and came to the conclusion, that my ex is abusive, a liar and that he was just annoyed by him. (the friend never lied to me, was always there for me and gave me no reason to mistrust him - so I met up with him.) He then told me every lie my ex told everyone behind my back, listed every girl he has treated wrongly (got them drunk and .. you know.. used them for his advantages \[disclaimer: It's just what the friend told me, but it lines up with the other things my other friends told me\])

He also told me, that my ex wouldn't leave him alone. He would text him every day or the other and the friend simply ignored it.

By that time, I wasn't that anxious anymore and I felt nothing but disgust for my ex. 

I then proceeded to ignore the fact that my ex started parking in front of my door again. I just simply didn't want my life to be restricted by him anymore. He sensed that and texted me again. (Why I didn't block him by that time? - Because I wanna be prepared if he does something stupid again.)

This went on until it got cold enough, so he couldn't go and play soccer anymore. I thought I was safe for winter... but I did not prepare enough I guess.

Today, I was gone for a Christmas visit for a few hours and he dropped off a Christmas gift. My favorite cookies, my favorite perfume and a single f.... rose. He - this time - even sent me a text wishing me merry Christmas. He also contacted all of my friends...

And this is, where I come to an end of everything… I need advice, on what to do next, what to tell him to make it f.... stop. I cannot deal with this anymore and neither can my friends. I really wish it would stop.

In advance, I want to thank you for reading this and maybe taking the time to respond. I wish you a blessed Christmas and hope you're all safe and sound at home. Stay healthy!",24Dec2020,1

724,"I wrote this backwards as I had no idea how to start it, so this will probably be a mess, I apologise in advance.

I feel like my autism gave me a trade, more academic ability in exchange for social ability, though now I feel like I am nowhere near as good academically as I was four or five years ago, and worry that I have damaged my brain with how I've not looked after myself.

I got accepted into a prestigious university and am in my second year, but the work is really difficult, and the term times very intense, which I just feel gets worse and worse because I haven't been keeping up, and this just leaves me shaky as we cover new material. This hasn't at all been helped by my feeling of drained motivation out of term times (and on the previous one spent at home due to the virus). I feel like I will end up failing my exams, and I haven't been putting enough into my coursework, it should be better than it is but I've been doing it simply to satisfy the deadlines rather than to get it done to a great standard. I feel like my life is an out of control car with the accelerator pinned to the floor, and I'm sat in the seat watching my life pass me by, and my opportunities close.  I don't know if I'm actually interested in what I'm doing (science) since all of my choices through school were just for things that I was good at without any effort, since I was incredibly lazy when it came to work, which I got away with because the teachers didn't care so long as I got the results. I feel I have matured a lot from where I was back then, and wish I had persued something artsy, or history, or music, things I previously looked down upon, to be honest.

I don't really have too many issues socialising with people in the moment, I am pretty good at putting on a confident ""mask"" at the time and think I come across pretty well, but I have trouble with forming regular, long term, and deep friendships - it feels like everything is just in the moment. I am not social media savvy at all. My main issue comes from an unwillingness to actually get myself out there, which is even more difficult due to the pandemic, but I have also been using this as an excuse when I could have done more, and just hide in my room, feeling lonely but also trapped.

I think a lot of my difficulty stems from my current lack of interests or experience that other people would be interested in, having been a nerd through my childhood, playing games on my phone, and only very recently blown all of the money I had in my addiction, and (hopefully) finally getting over it in the last few months, though I have briefly relapsed a little and redownload a couple multiple times, only to delete them again within a day, though usually immediately. This seems to happen when I'm feeling unengaged and want something to ""progress"" with, and I guess a need for instant gratification - I have always had an issue planning for things in the future or working towards goals that are not immediate, and have been lucky to get where I am doing things at the last minute. I now feel like I'm not really interested in anything, and spend large swathes of my time listening to YouTube as it alleviates my loneliness a little, at least temporarily.

This does mean that I am totally financially dependant on my parents, which I hate. Every job I've had up to now I have been taken advantage of to various extents, due to my desperation for work, feeling valueless and expendable, and non-confrontionalness that resulted from this.

I also don't really know how to ""progress"" in my relationships with women, a couple have shown interest in me, both when I noticed it at the time and didn't, though when I did I inevitably messed it up rather rapidly, getting way too invested way too fast - something I look back on and cringe indefinitely at, but am not sure I have actually fixed. I'm feeling starved for any sort of human contact, emotional or physical, but with the pandemic and my degree work, I feel trapped.

My physical health has been suffering due to how poorly I have been looking after myself - my social anxiety will often keep me from using the kitchen on my floor until the early hours of the morning in fear of encountering other people, even though when I have it hasn't been any issue. This means other than some snacky stuff I have only been eating up to one meal a day, so I am underweight, and also usually dehydrated. I also don't exercise much outside walking to the shops and stuff, and this has been the same for years, so I'm weak, have poor posture due to a weak core, and can't even bend my legs at 60° from the hip if they are straight since my muscles are so tight on the backs of my legs.

My sleep ""schedule"" has also been, honestly non-existent, with maybe half the nights a week being all nighters, and most of the time feeling zombified, with even the times I get good sleep, I wake up feeling awful. This is probably ruining my efficiency with my work too which only serves to exacerbate my other issues. I was using energy drinks to extend my waking hours for a few weeks but stopped because it was making everything worse.

I procrastinate a lot, which I think causes a lot of my issues, and since I'm aware of it I try to fix it, but without an immediate deadline over my head I tend to fail.

Thanks for reading this far, any advice would be appreciated, but I really needed to talk to someone about this, but there isn't anybody in my real life.",24Dec2020,1
726,"I started working for a large warehouse about 2 weeks ago. The company is big and has many roles even within the process of picking and packing items for orders. 

Anyways, there's a cute guy who's caught my eye. He's funny, hard working, strong, and attractive. He has been with the company for 3 years(shows responsibility). It's a busy place so I can't carry on more than a 2 or 3 minute conversation, not to mention it's loud from the machinery.

728,"Hi everyone. This is a long post and if you can't help, I understand. Before you all read all of this, know that my mom is one of the best persons in my life. She has been one of the most caring persons in my life. My family lives in the United States, but has lived in Australia before. Everyone but my sister was born in Bangladesh.

My mom has been depressed for a very long time and my family has been trying to help her out, but she refuses to receive any sort of help like therapy and denies she needs help. She believes therapy is bad and for insane people, though we keep telling her that it is totally safe and normal and that it will help her out. My sibling has gone to therapy, yet my mom refuses to believe it will help her. Additionally, she cannot express herself well in English as she speaks Bangla primarily, and she feels that going to a therapist who speaks mostly in English might not be the best for her. 

To explain more of my mom's depression, at one point during the year, my mom gets seriously depressed, almost to the point where she doesn't want to live or just wants to leave the country to live with her mom in Bangladesh. This has been the case for many, many years. Ever since 2016, when her dad died, things have gotten worse, though she was always quite depressed before then. She will have moments every single month where she is very upset. However, for 2 or 3 weeks, she'll be completely normal. She will be happy and she'll speak with everyone normally. This happens throughout the entire year until at one point, she goes through a very bad moment or episode. 

Her relationship with my dad hasn't been consistently good. She will talk with my dad very normally during her happy weeks, but then think my dad is the worst person in the world during her sadder moments. I know it might seem that my dad may be the sole reason for why she is depressed, but the thing is, ever since I can remember, my dad has been the most supportive person in my life. And not only for me, but for my sibling and my mom too. He does a lot for us, and apart from the stress from work, he is very happy around us and is always there for us. He will play games with us, spends time with us, and is almost never away from us. Ever since I can remember, I have never seen him be abusive to my mom. He has never hit me or my sibling either. He has yelled at us probably fewer times than there are fingers on my hands. He is seriously my best friend and I can't imagine a life without my dad. 

For a very long time, my mom believed that my dad was cheating on her with someone else. We have moved countries twice and moved cities 4 times, yet my mom believes that everywhere he goes, my dad is doing something suspicious. The thing is, my dad used to come home from work at a regular time, like 5pm, everyday. He used to always drop us at school and pick us up when we were done with our school activities. He has been able to help us anytime throughout the day nearly every single day of our lives. Apart from this, neither my sibling nor my mom nor I have been able to come up with any evidence of my dad cheating, yet my mom used to believe all the time that he would cheat. My dad even asked her to hire a detective to investigate him, though my mom never did. Recently, like the past year out of probably the last 10 years, she has stopped believing that my dad is cheating. Maybe because of covid and that my dad has been at home she thinks my dad isn't cheating, but she still thinks my dad did bad things before. 

My mom is also very materialistic. Ever since she was little, she was brought up into a large house, and even until now, she desires things that are completely unreasonable. Things that are unnecessary and unaffordable, such as a big car or a big house, are things that she wants and every single time she realizes my dad doesn't have that and can't afford that reasonably (given that he has to pay for things like our college tuition), she will get upset and say that we live horrible lives. I notice that when my mom has money, as in when she has a job or when she has money with her, she is much more happy. My mom has good education, a master's degree in finance, and she has had many decent salary jobs in her lifetime. However, she has never been able to keep those jobs for very long. When she's not working, she uses the money to either support her mom living in Bangladesh, buy food for our family, or buy a lot of expensive things for herself like jewelry or clothes. Spending money keeps her happy but it's a very temporary thing. She doesn't save money at all and she has a bad spending habit that has existed for a very long time. 
 
My mom's relationship with my sister isn't the best either. My sister has never been great academically, and as a lot of Asian families are about academics, my mom has always been a little harsh with her about school work. She has helped my sister a lot, but the past 4 years, she has slowly stopped. Recently, she frequently gets upset about how we aren't the ""smartest"" individuals and that we won't be able to do anything successful in our lives because we are not like those kids who go to the prestigious schools that she wanted us to be in. She gets more upset at my sister because she has always been worse at academics (noticeably worse but due to health conditions that I was fortunate enough not to have), and my mom believes she will be useless in the future. This is usually how she thinks when she is in her sad state, though she believes in us when she feels happier and normal. 

Anyways, just these past 2 weeks, my mom has been incredibly sad. For some days, she will be happier, but she has stated once again that we will be better off if she didn't live. She believes she is worthless and that she hasn't been a good parent. I've always been the one to bring her out of this sadness, and quite frankly, I've only ever cried in my life for her, but I just can't do it any longer. I've been able to prevent her from committing suicide and have brought her into happiness, but she will inevitably get depressed again and again. She refuses help no matter how many times my dad, my sister, and I have asked her to get help, but there is nothing that will change her mind. She does not want help but knows that she is sad. We just don't know what to do. Everytime she feels happy again, it feels as if everything is fine, but then she gets sad and nothing is good. I constantly tell her she means so much to us, and she always changes her mind and believes we need her, but she reverts back and says she is useless. She will most likely be happier the next few months as this is usually one of the times during the entire year she is this sad, but I want to get rid of this problem. I know it's late and I'm so guilty for waiting this long, but I have been scared to do anything before. I'm finally in college (studying from home) and I realize that soon I will not be there to help my mom. I just want to help before I leave. I know my dad will try to help, but I don't think my mom will be able to live with my dad or even my sister happily. Constantly seeing her happy then sad then happy has made it difficult to act on this problem. I know it's my fault for not doing anything, but I realize I have to do something soon.",24Dec2020,1
729,"This is kinda complicated. I'm 25. Me and my fiance moved in with my parents, renting a house from my grandma. She wanted to sell so i offered to try and get approved for a mortgage to buy. I did, got the house.
 But now here's the issue. My parents dont really like my fiance. She had to quit her job for a surgery thats been taking a while because of covid. Both my parents aren't working either. She's been staying in the room nit leaving, and she's been feeling suicidal. Fear of living here the surgery and everything else. I'm not good with advice and even if I was she doesn't want to hear it. No doctors, no therapist/phychiatrist she's tried before and it didn't workout. Recently she told me she wont marry me if my parents are still living here. Both my parents don't make a lot of money. They weren't even paying rent when renting from my grandma.

Basically thats it. She's going to her sisters for a while and I feel like if she's going to kill herself because shesiving here maybe we should break up and she could live with her sister and get her head straight, or do i kick my parents house because it's my house, and they go live with my grandma? Both situations seem kinda shitty to me. Advice?",24Dec2020,1
730,"hello, im 18f &amp; extremely sensitive to where it's significantly impacting how i go about my day. quarantine has only made this worse as i have no control over who's around me anymore. 

basically, everyone's actions around me have extreme effects on me. it doesn't help that my family is very hot-headed and rash with words &amp; love to yell, &amp; I'm the youngest so I'm basically everyone's 'punching bag' (for lack of a better word, I'm not actually getting physically abused here). 

the problem is, these are just words that they (&amp; sometimes others, as life is) use against me, but it's gotten to the point where something any other teenager would casually brush off has caused me depressive episodes. i could be completely fine, minding my own business, &amp; receiving a short scolding will cause intense sadness within me that honestly even i can't explain. 

it also completely takes over my thoughts. i can't think of anything else the whole day if someone is mean to me / says something hurtful. I'd just keep replaying the instance over &amp; over. ive had days where i literally do not do anything for the entirety of the day because someone happened to hurt my feelings and it completely consumes me, even if i try to do something i can't focus on it. I've been surrounded by harsh people my whole life so you'd think I'd get used to it by now, but it scares me how much control simple verbal offenses have over my life. 

the clearest (albeit most insignificant) example of this is when someone said something in an annoyed tone to me while i was taking an online proctored exam and my brain got completely consumed by that and i failed the whole exam (on a topic i knew well) because i kept replaying that instance instead of focusing on the questions. 

i don't know how to fix it. i really need some way of learning how to brush comments off and not give weight to other's words as much as i do.",24Dec2020,1

734,"So my friend (who will remain nameless) has always had a somewhat secretive family life in the sense that although we were very close, they always seemed like they were presenting themselves as if we just met (always somewhat formal, surface level talking points that never revealed anything about the inner working of there life). all my friends have noticed it and it’s sort of a running joke without our friend group. It was never something of real concern as we always chalked it up to just a slightly strange family dynamic. My friend has always had a very hard time opening up but recently he talked about his lifelong battle with depression and substance addiction. He alluded to the fact that it stems from his family life, however I couldn’t pry any specific details of why. His father is very high up in a natural resources company however he recently took a step back from this and began expanding into the restaurant business. This was my first red flag, why would you take a step back from your high 6 figure job and expand into an industry that is virtually shit down during the pandemic. On top of this, my friend told me that all the restaurants they own are fully staffed however receive next to no business. The logical thing to do if you were in their situation would be to cut your losses, temporarily shit down, and try again when things open up again. However they did the exact opposite, the continued to open 1 or 2 more restaurants which followed the same theme of operating at a massive loss. This obviously is very strange behaviour from a fairly intelligent and experienced business man, so I began looking into it a little more. My friends dad is very good friends with someone who is well known in our community for being involved with less than reputable behaviour (primarily cocaine trafficking), which is strange as my friends family are regarded as a very straight and narrow group of people and they go to great lengths to be perceived this way. There family recently installed video cameras around there entire house along with an expensive security system (we live in the same upper middle class neighbourhood and we have never once had a problem with crime in any way whatsoever). They also own a large trailer which they regularly park in a way that blocks there driveway along with any view into there garage. I have no concrete evidence that back my theory however from the outside looking in it is obviously that something strange is going on and it is clearly effecting my friends mental health. I understand this isn’t much to go off but please give me any suggestions or theories that come to mind. I genuinely hope that I’m wrong about this but something is clearly going on and I want to be able to help my friend if he ends up needing it.",24Dec2020,1
735,"I'm 19 and I'm working part time as a cashier in retail. My husband works full time and the only expenses I currently pay for are gas, phone bill, and soon it'll be another bill my husband currently pays for. I think it's something for my car, which will be about $80-ish a month. I told him I'd handle getting small gifts for everyone in our family that we'd be seeing and then I'd pick up on it. 

I seriously struggle with overspending. I should have a certain amount of my check that I shouldn't touch, a certain amount that I can spend on wants, a certain amount to spend on needs, but because I work various hours and sometimes I make more, sometimes I make less, and I get paid weekly, it's overwhelming and I end up spending more than I mean to. 

Does anyone have any advice for how much they spend per paycheck and how much of it they don't touch? 

I get paid each week and I work about 25-30 hours a week, I get paid $9 an hour and on average I'd estimate I make about $200-240 a week. Gas is about $20-$30 a week since I live half an hour away from work. My phone bill is $60 a month.

I have really bad social anxiety and they were one of the only friends i had. I admit im not the best messager, i mostly give short/medium length replies because i dont wanna bother them with long paragraphs and im terrible at messaging first because i feel like im bothering them and that im a burden which causes me to panic , which worked okay because they know about my social anxiety and understood, so i mostly wait till they messaged first. I feel like recently ive done something wrong because we havent talked in over a week which is different to our normal everyday talks, but im too nervous to message because what if they dont wanna speak anymore and im just being annoying or if they dont like me or just something aling those lines.

Growing up my parents didn’t have much money. Whatever money we had went to the essentials and dental care was not considered a essential to my parents. Mainly because it was costly and because it required constant up keep that my parents couldn’t afford. Fast forward, I am not 24 years old and suffer from a number of dental problems and i am currently in a dilemma. I have worked hard to save money for any potential dental procedures I need, but only have so much. Recently, I learned that one of my wisdom teeth needs to be extracted. It’s causing a lot of pain. In front of it, is my second molar that had a massive filling that sometimes  causes me pain. I have had several failed root canals (they just don’t sit well with me) and have lost  teeth located on the bottom right side to failed root canals.

Poverty is in my face in a way that's it's never been before. I don't have much family. And I've been alienated from the community around me by my parents. For good reason, I live in a very unstable and poor community, keeping me away meant more time for me to study. 

But even studying was hard. I made it through my degree but it was very difficult I don't have great marks and I couldn't keep going. I had to take a break but that cost me and now I had to get a job thats not in my field.  I couldn't get one in my field because I was too exhausted mentally to keep going. 

I starting to worry I may not be able to cope. I grew up in a culture that sees asking for help as a weakness and something to scoff and look down upon.

748," Hello. I have a friend from since I was 7, we have essentially grown up together.  Even 17 years later he is my only friend, and I am his only friend. Early on we were depression-friends, failing at everything in life but failing together, making suicide jokes and embracing the humour in having no future. We purposely made ourselves as useless to society as possible for humour's  
sake.  


We are soon 24, we are NEETS with no studies nor work experience. I regret the life I have led so far, and I am now studying, searching for work, and training daily. He still games for 10 hours a day, eats garbage food, and accepts depression as a personality trait. I pretend to enjoy video games and trash food so that we at least do something together. Every day we have less and less in   
common with each other, the only thing we laugh about anymore is memories from elementary school. He tries to drag me back down to depression and  
addiction against my will, I try to push him into discipline and being future-oriented against his will.  
It's clear we have lost all respect for each other.   


This question would not be difficult at all  
if we weren't each other's only friend, and   
if we didn't grow up as practically brothers.

destructive behaviour in order to keep the friendship somewhat alive. 

  
\&gt;b) Keep pushing him toward improving   
ourselves together even if he thinks   
its' annoying.

750,"So my (21F) best friend (21F) has suddenly lost a lot of weight, started getting red spots on her face and picking her skin, and her teeth have turned like BROWN. This was really strange and happened within around two weeks. I saw her two weeks before and her teeth were normal.

Has anyone got any idea why this might happen? She smokes but only like 4-5 a day and drinks tea, which is what she’s been blaming the teeth thing on. Me and our other friends are getting quite concerned, she’s barely able to concentrate on a conversation.

She also drinks pretty heavily and smokes a lot of weed. She slapped one of our friends (lightly but it was weird) for literally no reason, and attacked her sister when her sister challenged her about her drinking. We have another friend (also 21F) who’s very druggy, who I had to cut contact with, and my best friend is being very pushy about us making up etc, which makes me feel uncomfortable. 

This behaviour is very unusual for her, she has a history of anxiety, but is otherwise a very highly functioning, happy gal.

Me and our other friends have tried to talk to her but she just talks about how great she’s doing and how happy she is etc, which may be a front. Not sure tbh. 

She’s been treating me badly these last few months (begging me to break social distancing and go to house parties when my parents are vulnerable, being late all the time, lying about me to other friends which I only found out this evening). I’m going to distance myself from her but just want to make sure I do the right thing for her well-being so she gets help, while maintaining my boundaries.

752,"  A bit of a weird problem, I know. I have struggled with my self-worth the majority of my life, and one thing that I was actually appreciative of was my teeth. They were the one thing that no-one would ever comment on at school.

   I actually really liked my smile a year ago, but my family is forcing me to get dental work and it's severely impacting my mental health. They pushed it for years, but I never conceded \[I've had issues with dentists in the past; three different surprise pullings that I never had a choice in. One of my earliest memories was my mom forcing her finger inside my mouth and pushing back a baby tooth that she swore was ready- it wasn't. I screamed, and I still remember the feeling of my mouth filling up with blood, even as a seven year old\] and only recently gave in when I finally got tired of their pushiness. They surprised me with the ortho visit \[again\]. That was seven months ago.

   I've had countless breakdowns over it, especially because I love the uniqueness of my teeth.  I had/have expanders, and they disappeared during those in-between months when you twist them open. Today, though, I had an expander change? I don't quite know, I'm mainly kept in the dark about whatever's happening to my teeth. The expander change brought all those issues back to the surface, which is why I'm making this post.

   My one stipulation when I agreed to it would be that I get to keep this one specific area of my teeth the same- I have a snaggletooth that I really like. Yes it is a strange request, but it makes me feel a lot better about the whole thing \[The dentist has known about this since the beginning, but the last time it was brought up I got a ""we don't have to worry about that right now""\] 

The problem is, when I had my upper expanders switched out today, there was a lot more space than would be needed for my other teeth. 

   I'm worried that they're going to pull the rug out from under me and ignore my request, and I need advice on how to talk to them about it, or advice on how to be happy with the inevitability. Should I even confront it? I don't know.

753,"My teeth are just slightly yellow, as a kid I went through a phase  where I didn't have decent oral hygiene. I have always been insecure about them, a lot of people say it doesn't matter, but I feel like it means people don't take me seriously in life and I look unattractive to women.

I want to make sure it absolutely works, so although there are a range of home options from like 50£ to a few hundred, I want to get the in-surgery option which costs £600 pounds because I want to be absolutely sure of my results if I go through with it

754,"I 16(M) left my school in the uk, this year to go to year 12 at a specific college. Unfortunately the year was cut short by COVID, and I feel like my friend circle is in tatters. People I used to be close to I haven’t been able to meet due to COVID since March, and those I’ve tried to reach out to online- on Xbox and messaging services have ignored me. My closest friends who have talked to them have pointed out how they talked about how I tried to play games with them. 

The new problem is that I haven’t been able to even get close to making friends at my new college. I am socially awkward, I know that, but at my previous school it felt much easier to make friends. It’s been a whole term, and I’m starting to worry. The problem is that these people obviously know each other outside of college, whereas I’m the only person I know from my previous school to go to this college. 

Any tips for the new year and extended college life?",24Dec2020,1
755,"So, I became friends with this girl about 4 years ago when my ex and I moved to a new city, I’ll call her Ashley. My ex and I were at a bar and sprung up a conversation with Ashley and her and my ex became pretty good friends. We’d go over to Ashley’s house play cards and her and I would do some harmless flirting and she was always asking how I was or how my family was. She’d ask my wife and I to go to her parents lake house for weekend trips. Ashley met a guy, and we started having even more date nights and go on trips together. Slowly, I started noticing how close not physically (yet) but mentally and emotionally Ashley and I were getting. We have so much in common and just seemed to click. We’d go to the zoo and we’d want to see the same stuff or we’d be the ones walking next to each other and it would happen so organically that I wouldn’t notice it but when I did I would drop back to be closer to my ex or the weekend would come around and she’d want us to do something I had mentioned to my ex about wanting to do. She’s funny, outgoing, gorgeous and has a great personality. Slowly I found myself wanting to do stuff almost exclusively if Ashley could come and I got the vibe she was feeling the same way. That led to essentially me lusting after her and causing harm in my own relationship which caused it to end, but was definitely not the only thing that caused it to end. Ashley got pregnant with her boyfriend and they have a now one year old together. After my ex and I broke up, Ashley and I would text randomly just checking in and sending funny memes. I’d ask about the baby and even got to meet her a few times. Now I’m slowly thinking that I’ve unintentionally developed feelings for her. One day I text her and asked “How’s my little princess doing?” jokingly referring to the baby, and she responded with “oh I’m doing pretty good, start a new job in January!” I text back “oh that’s exciting! ;), is the baby getting big?”..I didn’t know how to take her sort of twisting it back on to her like I was calling her my little princess. But inside I felt like butterflies, just at the thought of being able to call her mine. She’ll text me complaining about her boyfriend and I dont know how to take her saying that so I didn’t know how to respond and just say I’m sorry to hear that. She sends me a video of the baby taking her first steps and says “I wish you could’ve been here to see it!” I just don’t know how to interpret what she text or if I’m reading to much in to it. I know I have feelings for her because I seem to constantly think about her, associate songs with her, I think she feels the same way but I’m not certain and I want to approach her about it but at the same time I don’t want to risk losing her friendship if I read too much into stuff. 

I’m certain I didn’t add every pertinent detail but I hope I put enough to get some advice.",24Dec2020,1

I know this probably doesn’t exist. We love San Diego the most, but it is so expensive, everyone around here says not to move to California. Even though here in the D.C. area, is also expensive! Reasons we don’t like it here: people in general are very uptight/stressed/competitive/only lookout for themselves/unhappy. The humid weather, with extreme all 4 seasons. I get seasonal allergies in spring and fall, and I am miserable being so hot/cold in the other seasons.

During those ghost days she’s sometimes online. I mean, she is starting the convo. It’s not like I’m trying to speak with her and have a hard time with it

Months ago we approached each other with dating aspects but it didn’t work out. After a short time we decided that we won’t date any further she was insistent to stay in contact and we casually spoke.

She was often times very “lazy” speaking with me and that was actually very tiring and it was one of the reasons that made me actually reluctant. I honestly don’t have any feelings for her anymore. 

Now maybe the adult way is to speak as she does since I’m not in love with her or not trying to have her. But this bothers me a lot. When I brought this up some time ago, she said she doesn’t like social media and therefore lazy using it but she can be online to speak with others.

759,"I started working at my current job two months ago and things have been going pretty good so far. About a month in one of my co-workers started to show signs that he might like me (talking to me a lot, trying to flirt with me). I didn’t think much of it at first but then he would start touching my hair or getting really close to me. I didn’t know if it was because he thought we were friends but it made me really uncomfortable. I felt bad and thought maybe I had said something to make him think it was okay but either way it made me uncomfortable. I talked to my other co-workers about it and they told me that that wasn’t okay. I was scared to talk to the co-worker that was doing it cause I didn’t want to make things awkward and I was afraid of what he might say or do. A couple weeks ago, I told my manager about it and she told me to take it up with the assistant store manager and that they would talk to him about it to get him to stop. I thought it was a good option since I was afraid to talk to my co-worker about it and I didn’t know what to do about it. After I talked to my manager, he stopped doing it so I thought that everything was okay. But, today at work he was clearly avoiding me (he would walk out the room when I walked in, he would ignore what I said to him and won’t acknowledge me). Other co-workers noticed this too. So, I decided to go talk to him about it. He basically told me that he was pissed off that I didn’t talk to him about the situation before going to management about it and that I was in a way hurting him. He made it seem like all of this was my fault. He made me feel guilty about going to my manager about it cause he brought up that he needs this job and that he can’t just go get a new one. He also mentioned that he doesn’t know what the “line” is and that in a way he is justified in his actions of being kind of rude to me because of that. I told him that I just want to be adults about it (to which he got upset cause he thought I was calling him a child/childish). I understand why he would be mad about me not talking to him first but i felt uncomfortable and I didn’t know what to do. Did I do the right thing? Am I the bad person in this situation?  I don’t know if what I did was right and I don’t know what to do after this. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you",24Dec2020,1

762,"So I’m a 16 year old (f) from Mexico. I’ve been boxing for around 4-5 months now, and my brother (19) wanted to have a playful sparing with me. He has always been physically more active than me, since he’s always loved basketball and he did boxing for longer than I did as well. He’s about 195 cm tall, and weights around 100 kg. I was never that physically active up until 2 years ago, when I went abroad to study in an international school that focused a lot of physical activity. Now during holidays, I went back home to spent time with family, and we attended a boxing class together. I weight around 58 kg, and I’m around 168-170 cm tall. He beat me very quickly and I felt very embarrassed, I was paralyzed in fear and I didn’t block any attacks and I lowered my defenses a lot. He hit me hard on the rib and I started crying. I felt so embarrassed and weak, and I felt like my coach was heavily disappointed on me. My brother has always been tough - and the fact that he gave a lecture on our way back home, about how I’m not training hard enough or I’m not particularly good enough really hit me hard - he was saying that it’s good to cry of pain, but that I shouldn’t be such a fucking idiot and let my fear take over me and paralyze me.

768,"Quick backstory I’m 25M single.. been single for 6 years now. Not depressed about it anything like that.. although I do get lonely from time to time. Recently at work a co worker suggest in a light hearted and positive tone to try hinge. I said nah. One morning I woke up, couldn’t fall back asleep and thought why not. I didn’t take it seriously at first. However after a while I thought.. maybe this isn’t a bad idea. Few things I wanna say. I think using a dating app makes people depressed in a sense that when they don’t get results they get sad. I kinda felt this.. but more on that later In the post. 2. Is paying for it worth it. Ya gotta buy extra roses and there’s a monthly sub fee for about 25$. Idc if I end up spending like 50$ if it means I get a girlfriend. However dating apps are like gambling addictions in that sense and I don’t wanna fall into that trap and end up spending a lot. Which is why I kinda wanna delete it.. yet eventually I’ll probably get another match, even I don’t pay. Also I can only imagine that girls get way more matches than guys. I’d like to know if paying for the boost monthly is worth it. So far after having the app for 5 days.. and admittedly buying a few roses, I got 2 matches. I talked to them. And oddly enough they both have left mid convo.. maybe they’re busy but I can’t imagine I’d take more than 6 hours to reply mid day. 3. Since I’ve gotten this app.. I think it’s negatively affecting my mental. For example I check my fb like once every week or 2. I don’t think social media is healthy and dating apps kinda follow my train of thought on this. Ever since I stopped checking fb and insta every moment I can.. which I’ve been doing for about.. I’d say a year now. I’ve felt a lot better about myself and down to earth. So that’s my dilemma. Like.. I didn’t think I’d be here a week ago yet since getting this dating app.. also bumble. Is paying for the monthly boost on hinge worth? The thought of meeting someone again and having a gf just excited my mind. Maybe I’ve been forcing myself to stay single for so long because I work a lot.. I mean. Everyday. Thanks for your time and reading. I think I may have forgotten a point or two I wanted to make so I’ll edit this when I remember. Thanks",24Dec2020,1
770,"so i have this wonderful friend, i’ve known her for almost five years and she’s one of the coolest people i’ve ever met. we’re 20 now and she’s had a rough run the past few years with stuff like addiction recovery (which has gone well but i’m sure is still a dark cloud) and the death of a close friend earlier this year, really sad stuff like that that just hurt to watch helplessly. we don’t really hang out all too often now that we’re out of HS plus covid obviously, but we’ve worked at the same place pretty much since we became friends so we talk and keep in touch that way

Well, she filmed a short on my camera and sent it to a local film festival. However, she didn't give me a 'Special Thanks' in the end credits. We've known each other for three years now, and I feel like I've put her on a pedestal all the time.

Even with my extremely busy weekly schedule, I was always emotionally available for her and I even brought my camera with public transport to her house. She even asked me two times to collab, because I'm into screenwriting, but in my opinion she always pitches her ideas and dismisses mine.

This year was a battle, went through a lot, I almost got a burn-out. It made me think that I've put too much energy in this friendship as well, when I can't simply get a 'Special Thanks' in her first finished short ever.

In my own projects for school I have always thanked her in the credits for the littlest things, like searching people to interview or just being there to help over the phone. It's a simple favor I was expecting back, that's all.

Without my camera she couldn't even make that film. It's a crucial and expensive piece of equipment I gave her for months to use freely and I couldn't even get a 'Thank you' back? Am I being petty?

Last Sunday I put in my 2-weeks notice of resignation and today coincidently received a bill of OVER $1,000 for the surgery. This surgery took place in September. 

Today is Dec 24, 2020. I’m very confused and extremely upset about it. I feel like I can’t even fight it though because there was no nothing written of her saying it would be free of charge. Only verbal confirmation. There might be a witness (the medical assistant who helped with the procedure). However, the dr might lie and say she never told me that it would be free. 

I will add that I was required to sign the consent forms too.

793,"This Christmas my parents are going to force me and my brother to smoke cigarettes. Neither one of us are legally allowed to smoke cigarettes. It is strange because my parents have never smoked cigarettes before so this is all out of the blue. I am concerned for our health, especially my brother considering he is 8. What can I do to get out of this?",24Dec2020,1
794,"Not sure where to post. 
The restaurant I used to work at has had an employee who directly handles food test positive for COVID. This person worked for several days with food before finding out they were positive. 

The restaurant has sent a message out alerting employees but has said that they will continue business as usual and are not alerting their customers. They are also saying that everyone needs to still come in to work even if they have been in contact with the exposed person. 

They have also kept on doing indoor dining when it’s technically not allowed in the county right now due to COVID restrictions. 

This restaurant is extremely popular with the elderly and is the most popular place to eat in my city. I feel like I should report them to someone? Has anyone else encountered this?

Thanks in advance for any advice!",24Dec2020,1
795,"Yesterday my mom said we were going to stay at a lake about 1 hour away from our home with her boyfriend and his daughter Amelia, also my younger brother Anthony. We spent the morning packing food and driving to the little hotel / suite thing. My mom mentioned that she had spent more than 1000$ on the trip and that she hoped he was going to take the opportunity to propose to her as they have been dating for 1.5 years and she's getting tired of waiting. I make the assumption he probably is going to propose as well. I told her I don't want her to say yes because their have been issues in the past with him saying mean things to my mom (like that her car isn't clean or the lunch she made for him was too cold) to the point that she comes home crying and I said they need to promise to get couples counseling. My mom reminds me its her choice and I don't know what a real relationship is like. I say he is getting more mean as time goes on and I bet that he's just putting up a front for when he gets abusive in the marriage, there's a reason he has had 4 ex wives. I keep my thoughts to myself because it would hurt my mom's feelings if I said anything. He somewhat takes on a fatherly role for me, when I had my seizures he comes and helps my mom take care of me, he was at my birthday and I his, etc. However, we never have really argued and I never thought of him as a father, just a good friend. I'm 18 now so maybe it's just too late for that. 

At the hotel everything went to shit. We setup the tree, and decorated the place, everyone was having a good time and no mean things were said. Someone said we should take a pic so I started propping up my phone when he insisted we use his. When I asked why he said his was an Apple, I said mine was much newer and being a recently released galaxy the quality would be better, once again not thinking much of it. Mom says to just use his so I set his up and we lineup to take the pic, everyone is laughing and just genuinely being jolly. He starts using his apple watch to remotely take the pic when he says can your phone do that? I replied with yes but I wouldn't spend 400$ on a watch, jokingly laughed and looked at the camera. 

He lunged at me and pushed me against a wall saying thing like I was a piece of shit and ""Did I want to fight him"". I replied with ""Nobody wants to fight you what the fuck is wrong with you"". My step sister started crying and said something along the lines of ""Daddy why are you doing this he was just joking daddy stop being mean etc."" My mom basically said the same, that I was clearly joking and so was he so why was he upset. 

When I was up against the wall I kept thinking of when my dad would beat me as a kid and started shaking / breathing and panicking but tried to keep my cool. I can fight, but he's much bigger and stronger and would easily win. I told him I didn't want to fight but I would if he hit me. I was scared and idk maybe that was dumb. He punched me and since I was wearing socks I couldn't gain my balance before he had began choking me. I couldn't breath for quite a bit, was starting to black out and was afraid I might seize again as I do atleast 2x a month, when he finally let's go because of my mom and his daughter crying and pulling him off of me.

My mom sends me to another room and they talk for a bit, why I wait alone. When I come out he's sitting on the couch and mom says we should talk. When we go to talk on the porch he keeps grabbing my hands and making threats to kick my ass and that I should stop trying to be a big man, but I'm just trying to avoid getting choked again. I tell him I won't respond to any threats and we both go back inside. No apology. 

My mom and him go to their room to talk but he refuses to come back out and keeps making threats to beat me again. I'm trying not to cry and freak out. I call the police secretly from the bathroom, wait for the police to come, who don't do anything and also don't believe me. I leave the hotel alone. Ask a friend for a ride home and sleep in my house that night alone even tho it was already 4 am and sleep deprivation causes my seizures. I call my older brother from another state and bro says he was going to propose Christmas Eve.

Now my mom wants me to come back, but he has sent nor said anything. I said I'll only come back if I get an apology and a garuntee of safety. My mom says he won't apologize, claiming he already did before I called the police and we were on the porch, which is a lie but she doesn't believe me. I told my mom he has my phone and can call me anytime. We keep talking but I refuse to go back without that basic human decency and also I'm scared. If he chokes me out I may very well die. I just keep listening to music and crying alone in this empty house. 

My older brother says I should swallow my pride and go back, but I don't feel I should. Its Christmas Eve, and everything is fucked up. I ruined everything but I honestly don't feel this is my problem to fix.",24Dec2020,1

797,"I’m female 23. Me and one of my guy friends were having a conversation the other day he’s saying he would cut off his female friends if his gf wants him too once he gets into a relationship. Also According to him ur friends that u cut off should understand why u did that and be ok with it. 

I disagree I think u should treat your friends as equally important as ur girl/man and that u should not cut them off especially if you’ve been friends for years. Just because u have a girl doesn’t mean u should put her on a pedestal and forget everyone else in ur life. 

The funny thing is those same ppl that cut ppl off once they get into a relationship are the same ones that try and contact u after they break up with the person they’re dating to be friends again which in my opinion is disrespect, cuz ur telling ur so called friend that they were a last option and meant nothing to u. 

So question for the men would you cut off your female friends once you get into a relationship and why or why not? Or for the ladies would u cut off ur guy friends when ur in a relationship why or why not",24Dec2020,1

 Ok so we talked for 2 years and planned to date but she just wasn’t ready to become official, then a week before we became official we were told our families were somewhat related, but once we were told there was no relation, we continued on and have now been dating for a year and 3 months. Well, fast forward to a little over a month ago she got curious again about all of this and we found out that we are in fact 5th cousins and now she feels guilty for not researching when we were first told.

 Personally, I don’t have any issues with continuing our relationship and I don’t feel weird about the situation at all because the relative that we share is our great (x4) grandpa and he was born about 160 years ago. I have just been having trouble with comforting my girlfriend and making her feel better about the whole situation and I need some help because she has been very upset over it all recently. She is stuck in the mindset of associating me with cousin and It makes her feel guilty about our relationship, and I don’t know what to say or do to help her get over that.",24Dec2020,1

Now, I am a bit obese too and i am pretty sure my Crush is not into me but we started chatting recently and I would definetly be open to get into a relationship with her and i thought to myself there may be the tiny chance of her liking me back.
