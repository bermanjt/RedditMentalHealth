0,CFL Light above me blown out giving white smoke and weird smell. I opened windows and disposed the light bulb after 15-20 minutes. Is there any danger of mercury poisoning? CFL bulb can apperantly have 4-5 miligrams of mercury but human daily max is 4-8 micrograms. So bulb has lot more. I know not all vaporised but still scared how much went into air and to my lungs and surfaces I use. Also does bulb blowing out same as it is getting broken in effect of chemical exposure or is it different? Thanks.,29Sep2020,1
1,"My husband who I loved more than anyone, came home last week and confessed that he had cheated on me. 

My husband and I have been through a lot together. We have had an extremely difficult relationship in terms of what we've had to deal with together but we always had each other's backs through it all. We faced illnesses, financial difficulties, job losses, deaths in the family, house fires, you name it. We were strong through it all. He had a lot of mental health difficulties and I have supported him emotionally and financially for a large part of our relationship. 

He asked me to marry him 2 years ago. I felt like we were happier than anyone I knew. We seemed to have the perfect relationship. We were so right for each other, despite all of the problems we faced. 

We had a plan. We were going to get married, then have children. We were searching for a home to live in together so we could start our family. We even had our children's names picked out.

Then he came home one day last week and told me he had taken money from my account to pay for a $150 hooker. He cried and said how sorry he was at first, but I just felt so disgusted with him. He said I had done nothing wrong and yet he wasn't happy with me and he thought a hooker would solve his problems. I threw him out of the house, furious that he could throw away 7 years of my life, everything I've done for him, for half an hour of sex with a complete stranger with my money. He kept calling, telling me how sorry he was, how he only told me because he wanted to work through it, how he clearly had an issue, how he regretted all of this and it just proved to him how much he actually did love me. I was heartbroken. 

Since then, he has been a complete bastard about the whole thing. I've tried hard to remain reasonable since I want his things out of the house and gone without any reason for him to return. I packed all his stuff and put it out on the lawn for a pre-arranged time for him to pick up to avoid any fighting. For this, he has screamed at me, repeatedly threatened to have my house broken into, called me childish and a bitch, cussed me out, threatened to take me to court, all while telling me how nice he is being about the situation because he paid back the money he stole and didn't demand ALL of his furniture back (only some). I'm trying to keep things civil and getting constant aggression. It's hard to keep up when I feel like I want to rip his stupid disgusting head off. 

I'm so furious at his lack of remorse, from someone who claims he still cares about me. His apologies at first were full of self pity. Now it's like he's not even pretending to be sorry any more. How can this man who says he loved me do this to me? 

I'm still processing the whole thing. I don't even really know what advice I'm asking for here. Just anyone. Please. How do I deal with this? Where do I go from here?",29Sep2020,1
2,I rent in an old house with old hardwood floors. I dropped a kettlebell and there is now quite a large dent in the wood.

3,"Ok so to start I’m 14, male, and I’m in 8th grade. I’ve been seeing a therapist for nearly 5 months and when i started seeing her I wasn’t in as bad of a spot mentally as i am now. I have trouble getting through a school day, nearly skipped all last week bc i couldn’t even get out of bed, and i think it’s bc i had a sudden realization of how shitty my life has suddenly become. I used to live in a nice town with both my parents, my siblings, and a dog but now i live in an old vacation home hundreds of miles away from my old life and friends and going to a school that i absolutely hate. About a week ago i came to the realization that what i want is to get away from where i live, basically in the middle of nowhere where the possibility of me having friends over and going downtown or taking a fun little drive through town isn’t a possibility. The closest town is probably like 20 mins away from me so I’m not close to any of the people i know at school. I think i realized that i just can’t take living here anymore, and i don’t think I’m suicidal but i just don’t have any reason or strength to get out of bed and go anywhere. Here’s the part that i think is impossible but i really wang to happen, and what i need advice for: i have some family that live in a pretty big city that I’m mostly familiar with and would love to live in. I know my mom could never afford to move there but i can’t imagine spending even more than a year where I’m at. I’m pretty close with one of my aunts, who has an apartment in this city that has two bedrooms. This aunt housed my sister there earlier this year as she is attending college there and didn’t want to pay for a dorm or apartment but now her schooling is online so i don’t think she’ll have to go back. My aunt has a step son that doesn’t live with her but i know he visits her and stays with her from time to time so that’s why she got an apartment with two bedroom. I don’t want to push myself on her and her life but she seems like the closest chance i have at not having to live in farmland with no friends and pets that i hate to take care of. I feel like i should be grateful for my mom and i shouldnt want to leave her but going to live with my dad doesn’t feel like an option and the longer i stay here the worse my mental health is getting so i don’t know what to do. I have an appointment with my therapist in a few days and I’m planning on bringing up how i want to move but I’m kinda worried that it’ll put everyone in my family in a difficult situation. 
Uhh TLDR: i hate living where i live and i want to move but i don’t want to force someone to take care of me that doesn’t want to. Any advice for where i should go from here?",29Sep2020,1
4,"Really torn on this. Maybe internet strangers can give me some guidance.

My state is doing well with COVID and most schools are open again. My daughter is 6 and in first grade. On Friday, she woke up kind of lethargic and had the sniffles and a couple times an hour she might cough.

We didn't really have time to assess her, so we kept her home from school to be on the safe side. (My daughter is autistic and mostly nonverbal, so she can't give us any nuance on how she's feeling; we just have to observe her.)

I took her to her pediatrician that day. He said it just looked like a slight cold, based on his examination and the mildness of her symptoms, but said if she got worse we could do a COVID test. She seemed to feel better this weekend. She isn't eating a lot, but mealtime has always been a challenge with her. She seems happy enough and is playing, but still has the sniffles and an occasional cough.

Tomorrow would be her first day back at school since we kept her out on Friday. (She was off Monday for Yom Kippur.) On the one hand, I could get her a COVID test tomorrow to be on the safe side, but the results wouldn't be available for 48 hours. She would miss 3 more days of school, which she loves and the routine is so good for her.

I want to be responsible and I certainly don't want to expose the school to anything, but I don't want to overreact either. A lingering sniffle or cough is common after getting over a cold, and the pediatrician thought that was likely all this was. Also, kids are germ magnets, and they (and their immune systems) are just encountering each other for the first time after 6 months of isolation, so it stands to reason some of them are going to catch colds and stuff. 

I don't know how long this virus is going to be with us, and while I want to be careful, I don't want to panic and make my kid miss school for a week every time she gets the sniffles, which can happen often at this age. I'm really struggling with where to draw the line on this. This would all be so much easier if she could describe how she was feeling, but we're just not there yet.

Well, internet strangers? What say you?",29Sep2020,1

6,"Hello everyone I hope you are all doing well. This is going to be a bit long but there is a lot to explain.

Ok so I am a 13 year old girl and im in 8th grade so is my crush. I have had a crush on this boy since kindergarten. He’s adorable brown hair and brown eyes like me. And the most kissable face ever.

So in kindergarten we sat on the bus together every day we used to chat and I wanted to marry him. He did not know. Anyways fast forward to 4th and 5th grade we were in the same class. He has anxiety and others kids were often mean to him. I didn’t really have feelings for him, but I felt bad for him and stood up for him. We soon became friends and he was so kind to me. He always knew how to make me laugh. I started to crush on him.

One day in 5th grade this girl in our class was really mean to him. Turns out she just had a crush on my crush. She told me and I told my crush to see how he would react to someone liking him. He was like eww, (girls name) likes me? That’s when I knew that he found girls liking him gross and I knew that I shouldn’t tell him about my crush on him. I will had that he REALLY hated this girl.

Anyways in middle school we had no classes together☹️ So we just stopped talking to each other. Last year when we passed by each other in the hall almost every day he didn’t even look at me. So this year (8th grade) we actually have two classes together.

I was really excited I’m like this is my chance! But he still ignores me now. When I asked him where the vanilla was in cooking class I don’t think he even looked up.

I’m a really shy girl and talking to him seems super scary to me. He is the first thing I think if when I wake up and before I sleep. I imagine us chatting, kissing and um well you can imagine what else. He is adorable especially in a bow tie. On my elementary schools talent show night he was a narrator in 5th grade. He wore a bow tie. He looked so cute I nearly fell out of my seat.

Additional info:

\*our moms our friends, my mom jokes about how I should marry him. (She does not know I like him.)

\* I would 100% marry him and I think he is my soulmate. But can you really know who your soulmate is at 13?

\*he is just such a nice boy

* he cares about school (like me)
* I doubt that he is interested in dating anyone😫😞☹️  
\*none of the other girls care for him. He has never been in a relationship.
* \*we are pretty similar
* \* I’m think it’s way more than a crush

i feel like if I don’t get him I’ll never forgive myself. I can’t live without him. Every day I look forward to seeing him. I can’t stop thinking about him or ways to talk to him. (Even though I try the two days a week i go to school. I can never muster up the courage to talk to him. I have school tomorrow what should I do?

Please help me! Also thank you for reading up till here. Every bit of info is important! I can’t live without my crush! I’m feeling really sadly because deep down I know that I cant have him. Again sorry for the long explanation.",29Sep2020,1
7,"(21fUK) Basically I just don't know where my life is going anymore. I had plans and goals but then covid hit, I Iost a career start opportunity, failed my college course, had a breakup and moved into a HMO with some disgusting house mates, got let down with a job, went months with no income, went on benefits and now I'm just stuck. 
I was going to become an outdoor instructor, with the way things are going that's just not going to happen any time soon. 
I have high anxiety when it comes to being with the open public, shop jobs just don't work for me, I love caring for people but have had no luck finding a job that will guarantee me hours and that I can actually get to. The ones I applied to never got back to me. I don't drive, I have no savings, I've been so close to homelessness that I just couldnt even risk coming off benefits without knowing 10000% that I'd have a reliable income and stable job. I have nowhere to move into to help short term and I've moved so much in the last few years that I don't think I could handle another move right now anyway.
I want to do something with animals, caring and outdoor stuff, I have no qualifications though and limited experience with animals though I love them. I don't feel that I'm actually able to achieve my goals, I'm not getting any further forward and this year's dragged me right back..

I'm still productive with schoolwork, and am relative healthy in regards to diet and exercise. While I'm an introvert i still try to have an assemblence of a social life, so that hasn't degraded.

12,"I’ve been seeing this guy for about 3 months. For the first half of our relationship, things were going great until my insecurities and anxiety got in the way. He used to say really sweet things to me about how much he likes me and dreams about the future with me (he said he sees potential that this could work out long term) and his actions show that he loves me. I still can’t shake my anxiety, and we’ve had some arguments over it because I’ve (irrationally) freaked out that he did things similar to my abusive ex (though my therapist has assured me nothing new guy has done is abusive. I’m just traumatized). An example is last week we had sex and afterwards I panicked and asked him if he only wants me for sex.. and obviously he was hurt. And then in the morning I was crying and panicked because I thought he ignored me crying, so I ended up leaving in anger. I later apologized and we made up and had a great time the whole last weekend. 

I love him, and I feel sorry for all of the pain I’ve put him through. He’s stopped saying all the sweet stuff in an effort to not freak me out, but now I’m ready to hear them and I think I’m feeling insecure because I’m *not* hearing how he feels anymore. I know he’s being guarded because of my past reactions, and he’s told me it’s up to me what pace we go- I have to set it. I admire him so much and the way that he treats me. I love being in his presence and have so much fun with him, and although he has flaws I can’t think of wanting to be with anyone else.

After B got her product she texted A and pretty much said “why didn’t you tell me she was doing this I would’ve become her friend and tried to pick her brain so I could do it too” A went on to invite her to a nacho night we’re doing Saturday so I could tell B how I do things. My problem is A told B I would tell her how to do what I do with out my permission and afterwards just showed me the screen shots of their conversation and pretty much said “hey, B is coming over so you can explain to her what you do” so this “friend” of mine just took a customer away from me without my permission. Now I really like B so I wouldn’t have minded doing it anyway but I feel like A crossed a line, she’s also a business owner so I feel like she should know better. I want to confront A so should I do it in person at nacho night after telling B what I do or should I just confront A in text tell B how I do things in text and just not show up at nacho night.

19,"This might seem dumb but I just want advice. 
This few months I been finding my razor on the bathroom sink then the bathtub and I suspect it is my brother because 1- I only shave while taking a shower. 2- Its only me and him that use the bathroom.  3- he has a habit of touching things that doesn't belong to him.  I'm assuming you are asking why, it's because I have a feeling he is using my razor for something (most likely shaving his face) and I don't want him to use it because I shave my privates with that razor. I think it's very gross if he is doing that. However the second suspect if he wasn't shaving is that when I went into the bathroom, I found it right next to the glass foam cleaner. I don't know if he has the brain to shave with a chemical product but entering the bathroom to see that made me consider. If I shave with with me not knowing and cut myself by accident, I don't know if it can infect me or cause harm. Either way I want him to stop using it.

20,"I (22, female) just started a part time job at the mall that I was so excited for. Context: I just moved to a new state by myself and have no friends yet, so I was excited to have a job with girls my age that could maybe be my friends. I was happy at first: I enjoyed the work and how chill it was, and I felt for the most part that the girls I worked with were sweet and were really good to see when I worked because I’m mostly staring at my apartment alone with the virus happening. However, I’ve noticed my assistant manager doesn’t seem to like me. I thought it was me at first: sometimes I take a while to warm up to someone and be their friend, so I thought maybe I just wasn’t connecting with her. I really tried asking her how she was doing, trying to compliment her and stuff. But I started noticing that she genuinely never wanted to talk to me unless she was yelling at me. I would be talking to a coworker while stationed in the back of the store and she would yell at me for talking when the front needed straightened up after previously yelling at me for working in the front. She always would yell at me and not the girl I would be speaking with. Coworkers started noticing and checking in on me, saying that they don’t understand why she’s always cruel to me and nice to everyone else. I even noticed that I was hired differently: she was the one that was supposed to run orientation for me, but she ended up just telling me to go learn register on my first day instead with another girl. When I worked recently, there was a bunch of new hires and she spent the whole orientation joking around with them, giving them tours around the store, even encouraging them to try on clothing and telling them how cute they looked. More context: I am between being normal and plus sized, and while I fit in the higher ranged sized clothing we sell, I can definitely say I differ in size from the other girls. One day I was talking about how I liked a pair of leggings to a customer and told her how I personally sized down in them because of how they fit, and she pulled me aside to tell me I needed to be truthful to customers because “there was no way [I] actually would wear that smaller size.” She is a size small or extra small (everyone is open about their sizes there, including me because I’m comfortable in my body). What she said hurt me and made me start to think she had tagged me for not wearing sizes xs-m like everyone else that works there. I also wondered if that was why she didn’t ask me to try on anything to see how it fit before: did she assume it wouldn’t fit me? I have noticed her talk behind my back as well; one of my friends there even said that she had made a comment to her about how I looked terrible in my outfit that day when she owned the same clothing herself (my friend stuck up for me, by the way.) I feel she is negatively impacting my view of my body, which is something I try to be confident in and love. While I like this job and 95% of my coworkers and bosses, I don’t think I can continue feeling like I’ve been unfairly hated by this boss and I genuinely feel she is trying to run me out of the store. (She also schedules me less than anyone else, which adds to this theory.

She’s Very Selfish and no ones problems matter but hers at all times. Like if something is going on with you and you just wanna talk to a friend about it, she’ll litterally make up some bs just so the attention is on her. 

She introduced me to a new friend of hers and when me and this other person seemed to get along, my friend was hen mad at me and said “ I get jealous because I want all of your attention”

She will literally send me selfies on a daily basis just so I can tell her she’s pretty and if I miss one (no matter what I’m doing) she’ll stop talking to me for the day and never address why she’s mad even tho I know. She has a husband so idk why she needs to reach out to other people for validation.

She doesn’t do anything for herself. She says on a daily that she’s a “kept woman” but that issue is... I’m not her lover, girlfriend, wife, so I don’t have to do any of the shit that she is low key hinting at. And I keep telling her that she is married and he should be giving her attention; she says he does 😐😐

She’ll literally ghost me (for the day) if I don’t have the money to hang on some days. And I keep reminding her that I live alone and pay my own bills vs her having a husband who pays 95% of the bills so I don’t have extra cash to just spend whenever.

33,"About 3 months ago I (34/F) met someone (44/m) online while RPing. We quickly hit it off and now he talks about wanting to meet me in person in the summer. 


Here’s the problem. He wants to make out and have sex when we meet. I am on the autism spectrum with crippling social anxiety and I have literally zero dating experience. I’ve never kissed, held hands with a guy, had sex or even been on a date. He says he’s ok with my inexperience. I am very attracted to him and would love to experience those things. I’m just not sure how things are going to work out. So guys normally want sex when they meet up with women?


He’s been very honest with me so far, but there’s a couple things about him that make me uneasy.  First, he said he hasn’t had sex since his 20’s when he was married. He is divorced now but says he hasn’t had any luck with women, which is kind of hard for me to believe since he’s very attractive. Second, he says he owns a 9 mm handgun, which scares me. I don’t want to meet up with him and have him turn out to be like one of those psycho guys from a Lifetime Movie. Third, all he talks about now is how he masturbates thinking about fucking me and asks me all kinds of sexual questions. 


I like flirting with him online, but in real life, I’m a completely different person. I am very quiet and awkward. He says he wants a relationship with me. I would love that, but I don’t know how it will work out with a neurotypical person who is an extrovert.


We are planning to meet in a public place, but he wants to take me to a secluded area in the woods and go hiking and then maybe have sex. 


Do you guys think it’s a good idea to meet this guy or does he seem like a creep? Also, I haven’t given him my picture yet. He keeps bugging me for one. Would it be a bad idea if I sent one to him? Not nude of course. He keeps asking for nudes as well. Not sure if this is a normal guy thing.",29Sep2020,1

[serious] It’s been a shitty chaotic Monday.  I don’t really know how to proceed. A coworker of mine attempted suicide at work today. He came in early to do the deed and was found hanging from the rafters. Thankfully was found by what ever grace makes people do things outside their normal schedule by my manager. He was taken to hospital conscious so we are hopeful, But who knows if they’ll survive the night or the oncoming treatment. I believe he had full intention of not making it. So my question is, how do I interact with  if I ever see him again. He’s an essential part of our team and I really like the guy and he’s fun to work with. I genuinely hope he comes back to work but there will be a massive elephant in the room. Do you act like nothing happened so it’s not awkward? do you ask why? Do you ask if he’s ok? Even though he’s tired of hearing it? How and what can I do to help?

35,"I'm a 21 year old male and I don't find anything appealing anymore. 
I have no friends, work is annoying, I have no interest in college or joining the military, and life at home is no better. My days off are just spent sitting there on the couch watching tv shows that don't even interest me anymore and playing video games half hearted. 

I have a girlfriend but I don't even want to have sex anymore because that's grown old as well. We don't really talk like we used to either. All we say is ""I love you"" and that's the highest point our conversation goes. I've talked with her saying how bored I am and she doesn't get it. She just tells me how I should be thankful for my blessings... How I have a job and a roof over my head. It's a job that I hate and I live with her parents because I can't afford my own place. My girlfriend doesn't work and I've tried to apply to higher paying jobs for months now and no one above 13 an hour will higher me. 

I've tried to meet new people but I cant seem to find anywhere I can do it. I can't even drive anymore because I have a DUI as a result of my past alcoholic behavior. I don't drink anymore but I used to just drink a lot so I wouldn't be bored. 

I'm not close to any of my family except my brother but he is in across the world because he's in the military and I rarely am able to talk to him. I'm not close with my girlfriends parents either. I can't even be myself anymore because it's like people just wait for me to fuck up. I'm not gonna lie, I like inn appropriate humor and swearing. But I can't do that because everybody freaks the hell out because they're Christian. (No hate towards the religion, I consider myself Christian)

I can't do anything fun because everything is either locked down or I just can't afford it because all my money goes towards food and rent. Also worth noting that her parents are very controlling. When I try to go to my room to watch shows that aren't only the news (yes. They only ever watch CNN) then they text my girlfriend with passive aggressive messages about how we're being anti social and we don't have to hide from them. I don't even play video games with the one person I would consider a friend because that is met with aggressive behavior from her parents. 

I don't know what to do anymore folks. I can't move out from this shitty environment cause I'm broke and I can't try new things. Can't get a new job and don't want to go to college even if I could afford it. I need advice",29Sep2020,1
36,"Let me just start by saying this whole situation is, like, “holy shit” levels of toxic. 

I’m really drunk right now and I’m trying to be careful to not say anything stupid, but I’m simultaneously wondering how the fuck I’m gonna explain this whole thing.

I’ll just cut to the chase and if you guys misunderstand, I’ll try to respond and make things more clear.

Let me give some context first. I’m an interesting character. On the surface, if you just saw a picture of me, you’d probably think I had it made in the shade. I’m not trying to brag, but I’m a really good looking person, but unfortunately, I’m also an extremely awkward and socially anxious person. I’ve also been through a lot of trauma and family abuse. I was even a meth addict for a couple years.  With most people I meet, my personality honestly sucks, unless you are patient and take the time to get to know me and make me feel more comfortable.

Something that often happens in my life is women are interested in me (because of the way I look) and quickly lose interest in me, because of the way I talk and act.

This one woman, however, this REALLY special person, was patient and accepted all my shyness and weirdness and I cannot tell you how  fucking excited I was about her. She is very pretty, SUPER intelligent, and just has this crazy magnetic “thing” about her. Like, I wish I could just end this post without saying anything else, but unfortunately, that’s not how life works.

She and I met on Facebook, because I meet most of my friends online due to my social/mental problems, and the best two weeks of my life were when I reached out to her and I thought this perfect woman liked me, but shortly after we started talking, she told me that she had a huge confession. She was “cohabitating” with this husband of hers, who was apparently threatening and somewhat abusive, and they were separated. They slept in separate rooms and were “soon-to-be” divorced.

Keep in mind, this is what I truly, genuinely thought.

She loved me when I was on meth and homeless, and was kind to me. Well. She EXPRESSED love during that period. 

We started talking a LOT. Nearly every day for 10 months. 

Okay, I’m upset, so I’m gonna make this ending short, but here’s the deal: I learned (over time) that her husband is actually a pretty decent guy, which really fucks with my moral convictions. 

She also does things to manipulate me and she has had me in tears a few times, and, rather than apologizing, she gaslights me and makes me think that me being upset is my fault.

I’m a little bit scared of her.

I looked her husband up on the internet and have his phone number. I’m fucking terrified, but I want to message him and tell him EVERYTHING.

She has cheated on him before, so he is super paranoid or her.

I want to tell him everything and save him and save myself, but for me, that means no more phone calls and no company or fake “love”, which means I’m back on my own with no friends or anything. That’s gonna be devastating, but I want to do the right thing.

What the fuck should I do.",29Sep2020,1
37,"In short:

I’m in college, I have to work in order to supplement my Car Note, My Expenses, and overall rent. I don’t live in a town but very small college city.

I work 3-4 days for 12 hours a day, degrading my body to explosive movements and injuring my self day in and day out.

I cannot even focus on school work because life in general (including the pandemic) keeps smacking me around. From a family member almost getting COVID, to overall work threatening me to fire me if I don’t cover a work day, to whatever else you can think of, I cannot progress through life like I want to.

I see everybody else, and everybody has got parents that are loaded with the money they saved so they don’t have to worry about a thing. They graduate in time, and I am still less than 24 credit hours (honestly, I’ve been in 3 three consecutive semesters so far). 

I feel like I’m being forced to compromise with falling behind and not being able to enjoy college like I’m supposed to, while everybody else is just lackadaisical and zooming through it like nothing matters.

How do I even get the three things I’m seeking out:

1) financial support to make sure I can focus on college

2) feel like I’m progressing in college

3) not have to worry about anything other than grades and deadlines

I don't want her to lose me, but the way she sees me isn't the way I am, if that makes any sense.

I can't keep living like this though; every time I get called my birth name or have she/her pronouns used for me i feel sick, not to mention the physical dysphoria as well.

My mom isn't transphobic or anything, but she has a hard time adjusting to change sometimes and I don't want to make her life more difficult than it already is.

Also, I'm not even sure if I'm trans or just going through a phase. 

I don't want to come out and then be wrong later (not that there's anything bad about that, i'd just prefer to get it right the first time), but being seen/referred to as a boy makes me feel so euphoric.

Research is in the medical field, but at undergraduate level, and dissertation counts towards I think 70% of overall grade. nearly all my actual project got cancelled because of the ‘rona but still had to write a 25,000 word dissertation on the subject anyway, and just realised some of the results I DID manage to get I’ve reported incorrectly. 

I’ve basically interpreted a table of post-hoc statistical test results as not significant, when actually, they are. Now this doesn’t affect the rest of my thesis because actually I ignored the (what I thought was) insignificant post hoc testing as the p values were significant for some of the results, and still talked about those in the discussion. So it wouldn’t exactly have changed anything at all, I just have about 6 different tables where I’m declaring “No results reached significance after post hoc testing lol!” when they do, so I feel a bit dumb.

I got drunk the other night, like blackout drunk, I have a VERY high tolerance so when I’m trying to get drunk I usually end up drinking too much which ends up in me blacking out. So long story short I went out to a party with my boyfriend and my friend (girl) and ended up blacking out. (Take into fact that anyone I’ve ever been around when I’m blacked out says I act and seem completely normal almost as if I’m sober (which is weird) So anyway, by the end of the night I was blacked out and apparently I asked my boyfriend and friend if we could have a threesome which I don’t remember at all. We went back to my place and had a threesome and I don’t even remember the beginning of it, I just remember becoming conscious in the middle of it and continuing because I also did like it once I was aware. Now the problem I’m having with this whole situation has to do with the next morning and a few other things. The NEXT MORNING! I wake up and I was super hungover and tired asf cause we were up till 4am and my friend woke up at 7am ..I woke up and saw her come from the bathroom and my boyfriend said come here and she went to him and he literally turned his back on me and started cuddling with her I immediately got extremely sad and kind of frozen cause he was completely ignoring me and just giving her attention which isnt what I signed up for if I even signed up for this at all. He cuddled with her and they started whispering to eachother and fucking again right next to me so I turned over and tried joining again cause I wanted to see how he would react and he fucked me once and went straight back to fucking her. And I literally kept looking at him trying to see if he would even try to fuck me or approach me and he didn’t and laid back down (I literally don’t know why I did, I just didn’t know how to react) and he kept fucking her and even ate her out then took her to the bathroom to fuck her and once they did that I just left. I got really upset and smoked outside and he came down to see if I was okay. He keeps saying they thought I was sleep the times I was laying down, and I’m like well that’s just the problem it’s not a threesome anymore I feel like he was just taking advantage at that point to fuck someone else which makes me think what if I never even asked to have a threesome and there making it up but then part of me is like probably not cause they said I seemed pretty normal. Which is something people have said to me before what should I do? My boyfriend apologized for the morning so many times but I still feel like complete shit.

I decided to remain with friends B (big fucking mistake) because we had some common interests. I could honestly tell he ""liked"" me and while, I was willing to be friends with him, I had no love for him. 

After hanging out with him just a total two times, I can see why my friend dumped him and now I want nothing to do with him. Unforenately, like a bad habit, he's stuck to me and I don't know what to do. He's a high school drop out with zero ambitions in life, he treats his mom and younger sister like slaves (I left and stopped talking to him after he started insulting his sister to her face and called her a ""zionist worshipping cunt."" wtf) and acts like the world owes him everything. I don't know how or why my friend put up with him, he's probably one of the most pathetic people I've ever met. Plus he's clingy, so fucking clingy. Everyday, he texts me and while there's nothing wrong that, he told me how ""depressed"" he gets when I don't reply right away and how he worries about me. 

A few nights ago, he told me that ""he loved me"" and that ""I mean the world to him."" When I replied that I felt uncomfortable, that I had no interest in dating him and wish he'd just leave me alone. Anyway, that morning, he sent me a long text apologizing, begging me to let him ""hear my voice"" just one more (so dramatic) and told me that he was drunk. I didn't respond and just blocked him.

I kept all that annoyance in but this lady was always somehow there like if we were on vacation she was calling him for something that had nothing to do with the kids and of course he dropped whatever he was doing to answer her.

When I went to his Instagram that was still signed in I found a bunch of messages between him and another woman and he had her numbers saved in his phone as John. When I confronted him about it he said she was an ex and she hacked his ig and made up all those messages because she was mad at how he ended it with her and wanted to sabotage his relationship.

I used to see I love you texts on his phone under a work contact and he said it must have been a mistake and would call and ask the person if I didn’t believe him but I said it was ok he didn’t need to. I now know those texts were from that woman. I decided to text her myself and she told me to the truth and sent picture proof. He was cheating on me 3 months into our relationship up until the time I found out and he met her on a dating site and they would meet up and have sex and go on dates while he barely took me on any dates. He did things with her that we made plans to do together and never did. I was so afraid of losing him because he made me feel so loved and cared for before that and I thought we could work through the cheating. His excuse for cheating was that he was afraid I was eventually going to leave him because of the age gap and he always sabotaged anything good in his life. He promised me he would change if i gave him another chance. And I did. A month later, I found out he was hiding a huge secret from me. Aside from the 3 kids I knew about he had 4 more that I had no idea about. He made me feel like I was the wrong one for reacting the way I did. I forgave him and gave him another chance. About 4 months ago, i was going through his phone and saw that he still had the phone number of the woman he cheated on me with saved in his phone but this time it wasn’t under a fake name, it was under her real name. Now he knows how much he broke me when he cheated and he still had her number saved. His excuse was she had texted him “hi” back in December when we were on a break and he saved her number so he would know it was her if she ever tried to contacted him and he would know not to reply. I forgot to mention that during our break, I found out he gave me herpes from this woman. During this time, i also found out he had followed an old ex of his on ig and kept it from me. He claims it was no big deal and he was just curious and unfollowed her after 3 days because he realized it was wrong. I said if it was no big deal then why keep it from me? I know he wouldn’t like it if I hid something like that. I lost any trust I had in him. Gone. We work together so I see him every day and we hang out here and there because its so hard to let him go because he was my best friend. He says im not giving him a chance to show me he’s changed. He refers to everything he’s done as “the past”. He says im stuck going in circles and I will never move on and be happy because I’m going to be stuck in the same place instead of us moving on and working on our marriage. Every time we have a conversation about our relationship he finds a way to turn everything on me and make me feel like our relationship is where it is because of me and me not wanting to give him a chance to show me he’s different. How can I be with someone I don’t trust? Am i the one in the wrong? I don’t want to lose him but I don’t want to be with someone I don’t trust my whole life or be worried about what’s going on behind my back.",29Sep2020,1

65,Hello I'm 16 years old and about a year ago I did something really disgusting and now I'm considering turning myself in to law enforcement. I messaged a girl with a pfofile picture  of a person that wasn't me on a dating site and I asked her to sext with me. Even though no photos were exchanged we did masturbate while texting and I feel guilty about it. Im trying to change as a person but now I've realized that what I did was basically sexual assault. Now I feel like I need to turn myself in to the law but I'm not sure if its the right thing to do. I mean I have no way of contacting the victim so she obviously can't press charges or testify and theres no evidence or witnesses to incriminate me. On top of that I feel like this might just be an unnecessary obsession and I should just move on and be better but I'm honestly not sure what to do. Some advice would be greatly  appreciated.,29Sep2020,1
66,"So I started this new job right before COVID started. The assistant that I work closely with and have to interact with has pretty intense mood swings and takes advantage of me being new in many ways. Here are some examples...Whenever something is broken or not put away properly I get blamed, I try to come in early to get my room set up and turn on all the equipment, catch up on reports because she comes in early and tells the boss that she is doing all those things, but in reality she just turns on the stuff she directly needs and leaves everything else for me to do. She pretty much has my boss convinced that she is the best she is doing everything that I am actually doing, she has been with him for like 15 years. I have just been letting it go for a while but it is starting to get to me now. She is friendly with just about everyone in the office and I am thinking that they are all trying to stay on her good side so that they don’t feel her wrath when she gets upset. I try to just go in and do my job and go home but she tends to make it hard some days by whatever mood she is in that day. I guess I am just trying to figure out how to not get walked all over but I am also worried if I stand up to her and call her out that she will make my life hell at work.

67,"I’m gonna preface this by saying my problem isn’t very important compared to others here but I just really want others input. Since I was a kid my dad always wanted me to be just like him. He hunted so I hunted, he fished so I fished but last year during hunting season something just clicked and I just didn’t want to do it anymore. He always liked doing those things with me (my mom as told me that it makes him happy) so I kept going. With bird season coming up he asked me if I wanted to go this year and I just kinda avoided the question to the best of my ability but I could tell he was disappointed. He then later asked me why I don’t do these things with him anymore and I tried to avoid it but I couldn’t anymore so I just told him I don’t really enjoy shooting things. He just kinda looked at me like I’m crazy, his father hunted and his grandfather hunted etc... he probably think I’m just a wuss but that’s besides the point. He then told me well if I don’t like doing it I should of said something sooner because he spent a good part of his time out there wondering why I don’t do anything with him anymore and what he did wrong. Now I feel absolutely awful about all of this. I feel terrible that I’d make him think it was his fault somehow. I feel terrible because it almost feels like I burned a bridge that can never be rebuilt. That was all we did together and I actually had fun doing it because we got to spend time together but now it feels like it will never happen again and idk if that makes me happy or sad. I’m sorry for making such a long post on such a trivial thing compared to many others problems but I just don’t know how to feel. I just want to go back before I said anything.",29Sep2020,1

69,"I am the office manager at an internal medicine practice. The office staff is typically comprised of a receptionist, the physician, and myself; however, the receptionist was laid off due to COVID and we have not rehired/replaced her yet—so it has just been me and the physician for the past few months. Last week, the physician I work for left for India for 4 weeks to see/care for his unwell parents. One of my boss’ colleagues, a hospitalist, is currently covering for him while he is away and I have some reservations about this guy. 

First, I’ve noticed him leering at my body dozens of times already—the kind of stare where you can just tell he is picturing you naked. And I dress conservatively at work—nothing tight or revealing, ever. 

Second, I have to stay late after patients each day for him to finish his notes because he does not have an office key to lock-up with. During this time, I often have to help him with his documentation because he can’t figure out our EMR system. So either I remind/show him where things are in the program or if we are running really late, I type his notes for him as he dictates because I am a “much faster typist” and frequently, he will stand WAY too close behind me and looks over my shoulder at the screen, almost speaking into my ear to dictate notes. Today, I asked him for some space and his response was “sorry, I just can’t see the screen from that far away.” He also commented that I smell nice on one of these occasions. 

Lastly, he is pretty flirty and constantly jokes about me coming to work for him when he opens his office, which I just awkwardly laugh off. He asks a lot about my personal life and my relationship, and when I ask him about his wife and kids, he just says “oh they’re fine. I work a lot.” He fancies himself as a gentleman and insists on walking me to my car and opening my car door for me every evening after work, which is really kind, but also unnecessary and sometimes slightly irritating because it’s late and I just want to get home at this point and he’ll lean on my car door and want chat for another 5 minutes.  

Now that it’s all down on paper, it doesn’t seem like a lot but something about being alone with him makes me very uncomfortable. It’s just the way he stares at me, the frequency with which he’s in my personal space, and the fact that he’s much bigger than me. He hasn’t ever touched me  (except for once when he put his hands on my hips as I was reaching for medicine in the sample closet, but that might have been protective/for balance?) and he’s a physician, so I know he’s probably not dangerous. Am I overreacting? Are there precautionary measures that would be wise to take? TIA",29Sep2020,1

71,"I’ve been with my partner for almost 2 years. Her lease expires early next year. I own my home, she rents a 1BR. 

During the strict lock-down quarantine she lived here consecutively for about 5 months and there were essentially no issues. She helps out a TON here and of course while I’m at her place I’m willing to lend a hand (although upkeep is much less w/o a yard and what not). 

She’s back to her apartment most days of the week as our job roles have ramped up and with so many phone / web calls its nice to not worry about too many distractions of each-other’s calls and  what not. 

That said at the start of the year we both (tentatively) are due back in an office assuming the pandemic has tapered off enough. So let’s hope life normalizes! As stated above, her lease expires shortly after that and I’d like for her to move in, but I don’t want to make her feel like she *needs* to say yes. We both like each others spaces and alone time but more so I love having her around.

I know the title sounds conceded, but I don’t mean it to be.
Not really sure what advice I’m seeking, but I think it’s mostly that I’m intrigued to see if other people have been in the same boat and what it has been like. I have always had my guard up for feelings for people. I’ve built walls and historically, I get uncomfortable letting someone in. I also get uncomfortable when I sense that someone is into me more than I am, which has happened in the few relationships I’ve been in - I would contribute this to that reluctance to be vulnerable with someone. It’s almost been a turn-off to me when I know someone has stronger feelings for me. 
Here’s the kicker: I have feelings for someone. And they’re mutual...ish. For the first time, I feel like I am into her more than she’s into me. Not gonna lie: it kinda freaks me out. But she’s so easy to talk to, I can be myself with her, she’s very down to earth, and quite frankly: I just really enjoy being around her. Though she’s told me she has feelings too, I have gotten the sense that I am now the one who may feel it stronger, and quite honestly: this makes me so uncomfortable. 
And I don’t know what to about it. 
Again, don’t really know how to handle this or what advice I’m seeking but if anyone has some wisdom to share, I’m all ears.",29Sep2020,1

82,"My brother (10) has recently started expressing  issues he has with his body. He worries that he’s too chubby, compares his appearance to his friends, and criticizes himself for not being more muscular. He plays soccer and is active in general, but has been resting the past few weeks because of an injury. Since then, he’s been worried about eating too much because “at least with soccer he was burning off the calories.” 

It’s heartbreaking to see him struggling with this. I said to please not worry about burning calories. I told him that his body is working so hard to grow right now and that it needs all the food he’s getting, regardless of whether or not he plays soccer. 

I also reiterated to him that he’s healthy and that appearance doesn’t measure his worth. I’ve said uplifting things to him like that he’s beautiful inside and out. I know that he’s still struggling. He deals with a lot of anxiety and self-criticism already, this is a new manifestation of that.

While I try to be there for him as often as I can, we don’t live together so it’s sometimes weeks before I see or talk to him. He lives with our father and my stepmom (his mom). I strongly believe that our dad has influenced this negative outlook on body image. He has always been a yo-yo dieter and frequently steers conversations toward his diet and exercise habits. I plan on bringing this up to my stepmom, but I’m not sure how she will handle it.

Thinking back, my own body image issues started at around his age. I don’t want him to spend his adolescence battling this internal enemy.

89,"***Sorry for the long post ahead of time!***


So to expand on the question above, I am stating this because it’s almost like it is time. Whether you believe in fate or any of that type of stuff, I somewhat believe there is a time and a place for everything. I’m a 22 year old male, and even though I feel completely lost in life, tomorrow is a good day as I start a new job. Well, it’s not a new job. I actually used to work for this same company 2-3 years ago. I was only 19 and I didn’t leave on the best terms, but not bad enough make me non-rehire able. 

Just as a bit of background about myself, I’m an overthinking introvert. I have multiple chronic illnesses that have put me into a consistent dark place for over 8+ years now(since I was 13-14). I never want to hurt myself or anything like that, I just feel very hopeless a lot of the time. I’m already on a lot of medication, and even though it helps, I feel that I’m still prone to negative thoughts based on my past and because that’s how my thoughts have mostly been for over the past 8 years. I feel it’s tough to break even though I’ve been in therapy for majority of the last decade. 

That’s why I bring up how can I take control of my life and what can I do to change it for the better? I know like almost everything I need to do as far as managing my chronic conditions(as they’re pretty debilitating). But I always, always overthink to an extreme on what I should do to help myself mentally. It’s just how I’m wired I guess. 

As far as my new job, I’m not getting paid much(meaning that it’s more than minimum wage in my state by a few dollars, but I’ve been paid more in the past). And I bring that up because I’m not really looking at the money, even though more is better. I’m looking at how I can make up for my past mistakes when I last left the company. I’m looking at my future - how I need to take the job very serious because it very well has the potential to be a building block of where I want to be in the future. Like I still live with my mother, that needs to come to an end within the next year or so. I first need to get out of debt actually as that’s another thing that has been bothersome to me as well.

Just the last thing is that I’m having pretty bad anxiety about starting tomorrow, but I’m excited so I’m extra anxious... if anyone has any recommendations about what I can do to cope better for both tomorrow and for anything in the future, please let me know! I know a few coping skills but I have not been using them of late. So a refresher might go a long way for me.

Thanks for any advice in advance!!",29Sep2020,1

We let him up, turned up the AC, and started our day working from home. by 10, something was clearly wrong and he had started moving strangely. A long story and several emergency vet visits and neurologists appointments later he was diagnosed with IVDD(a neurological degenerative disease), lost all control and feeling in his back legs and bladder. We were told that our dog has a 5% chance of being able to walk again.

I guess the advice I'm looking for is what should I do at the moment to prepare for my life when I turn 18? What should I keep in mind and what are some things I can do once I'm allowed to leave my parents behind forever?",29Sep2020,1
97,"Hi so much has happened in the passed 24 hours so sorry for typos or any mistakes because I’m still shaken and jumbled. Yesterday I got a bunch of spamming text messages from my mother same question (how are you, what are you doing, what’s t doing, where is t at, what are the girls doing, where are you,) and so many more question and t is my sister in law and my mother hates her and knows she’s not allowed to ask questions about her (brothers request). Then my mother was like I’m picking you up you have no say get the in car. Keep in mind I’m 18 so I was very confused as to why she was demanding I come home. She said I’m not an adult and I still had to abide by her rules (this happened in the car). I said “I’m 18 anything legal and illegal falls on me now not you so stop with all the questions I don’t mind telling you where I’m at but you don’t get to ask questions about t because you hate her and are just being nosy”. She starts yelling at me “you’re not an adult you don’t get a say you’re not allowed back over there”. And in anger I go out the car and say “maybe you need some therapy for your daddy issues because you need to let go and let me be an adult”. Fucked up yes I know. So we walk inside the house and she goes “okay the real reason I wanted you here was to tell you something. Your uncle Bob (he lives with us) said “he was molested and sodimized in the middle of the night and only he and your father were home”. I said “okay I’m leaving I’m completely done with this family I can’t do it. T is picking me up we’re going to Walmart to get boxes and coming back with a cop to make sure everything goes peacefully.” And she said “no tf you’re not” and I said yes tf I am. She slapped me across the face so I punched her she fell and hit her head (currently at hospital). I don’t believe that my dad did anything to my uncle mostly because it’s physically impossible. My dad had a stroke last year and can barley lift 100 lbs and my uncle weights 300+ pounds and only sleeps on his back due to liver and kidney problems. So I’m calling bs I feel like he made the accusation because he hates my dad and has been trying to break up my parents for years. I moved in with my sister in law, everything feels like chaos I need advice I don’t even know what to do with myself anymore I’ve just been crying non stop and I don’t know what to do or how to feel and my oldest brother (30) basically disowned me and told me it was my fault and told me not to contact him for “nonsense” ever again but all I did was contact him because I wanted someone to comfort me. My second oldest brother (28) was more comforting though so I guess that’s good. So I lost a brother and a mom all at once. My heart hurts and I just want someone to tell me what to do.",29Sep2020,1
98,"I met this girl online about a year ago. We recently started dating; it has been a couple of months.

Her father is bipolar and my GF has opened up to me about it. Although, it is hard to get her to do so. It has gotten to the point where she doesn’t feel safe in her own home. 

Here is something that she sent me

   “Just- I want to get out of my dads house because he’s getting worse and worse to be around everyday! I feel guilty or scared every fucking day and I don’t want to put that on other people and over text that’s the best way to hide”

I don’t really know how to handle any of this. I love her and really want to help her out of this terrible situation. 

Her mother and father are separated, so there is the chance that she could have custody be given to her mother. Though, my GFs father won’t let her see her mother even though there is a court order.

Is there any way that we can use the legal system to get her custody over to her mother?
I really worry about her.

Thanks for your support.

99,"I’ve been in a 18-month long distance relationship with my exgf. I’m in Europe and she’s in California. The relationship was always rocky and on/off with breaks initiated on her end.

Prior to her, I never had a girlfriend but I did have friends with benefits, as well as one night stands. My ex lost her virginity to me at age 24 (she had been Christian, then deconverted and met me around the same time). She always felt resentful of my “promiscuous” and “colorful” past, while she had been holding out for her future husband, and felt “betrayed” that I had not waited for her.

When we first met in person, the sex was mind blowing because there was such an emotional connection. She was the first woman I’ve ever loved, and the first time I’ve made love to someone, not just fucked. It was bonding and unforgettable.

I know during that first trip, however, she felt dissatisfied with the lack of physical affection, especially in public. It’s embarrassing but she’s actually the first woman I ever held hands with in public at age 29.. the first woman I’ve gone on true dates with, etc. I’m not naturally good with physical affection like that, especially since I never had a gf or truly dated someone. I did do my best to please her but I could tell she wasn’t fully satisfied.

After I went back home, the relationship got a bit rocky for several reasons, but I never stopped loving her.

A few months after the first trip, I went back to California to visit her for 9 days. During that second trip she was more vocal about her complaints about me.. especially the lack of physical affection. I’m new at a relationship so I did do my best but some things don’t come naturally to me, like holding hands all the time.

I felt unappreciated and taken for granted, so sometimes I wasn’t in the mood for sex. I think she initiated like 2-3 times but I turned her down gently. But one time she actually broke down crying, asking if I didn’t find her attractive or desirable, which wasn’t the case. I was physically attracted to my exgf, but I just wasn’t in the mood because we had been arguing and I felt like she treated me poorly.. I felt unloved.

When I returned home again, that’s when shit hit the fan. She started digging in my past if i desired my previous fwbs more than her, that I couldn’t satisfy her sexually, that I was selfish in bed, etc.

Ultimately she broke up with me. During that breakup, I really missed her and didn’t even think about being with anyone else. I was trying to move on but I couldn’t. About 3 weeks after, I reached out to her again, only to find out she had actually fucked another guy and they were casually dating.

We sort of mended things, she broke things off with that guy. The next months were brutal. She kept digging in my past again and started hurling abusive words towards me, comparing me to this recent guy. How he was a “sex machine” and how he made her cum every time, how he was generous in bed and how I was lazy. How they had multiple sessions while I rejected her. How he was all over her and made her feel beautiful and desired.

Eventually she broke up with me again... then fucked a new guy. I found this out when again, I reached out to her hoping to mend things, and then she told me what she did. During all this time, even during the breaks, I have never been with anyone else.

Tldr: exgf blames me for breaking up and fucking other guys because I didn’t please her enough with affection and intimacy, and she felt undesirable. Is what she said valid? Am I to blame for her breaking up with me and then fucking other dudes? Is it because I didn’t give her enough affection and intimacy?",29Sep2020,1
100,"(for context i am a female who recently turned 15, and the affirmentioned boyfriend is also 15)

I met some gaming buddies quite a bit ago, and we all get along super well, we formed a gaming group and now try and play games together as much as possible.

One of the boys started flirting with me a bit ago and shortly after we started dating. He was always very sweet and constantly compliments me, but it started to be a little overwhelming. Not that long, maybe a few days after we started dating he told me he already wanted a family with me. I keep having to tell him to tone it down, and have had a serious talk about him wanting to move to fast. Every time i tell him he apologizes and agrees, but then continues to do the things i had told him made me uncomfortable. He told me he loved me not even 24 hours after we started dating, as well as the family thing. One thing he said even made me a bit worried. Im sure it was a joke, but when i told him people aren't always that nice to me he asked who they are, when i told him im not telling him and that he shouldn't hurt people for something like that, and he said he'd go to jail for me. This also within 24 hours.

He also constantly dms me whenever he isn't sleeping, even when he should be doing school, should be sleeping, or something else, he always wants to message me, and he tells me how sad he is that im constantly busy(to be fair, i am busy quite a bit of the time. Im a national athlete, an honors student, im in 3 clubs and starting 2, plus ive been having to go to the doctor quite a bit lately for a knee injury and migranes).

Also, since ive been so busy and we were planning on telling our friends next time we game, we haven't had a chance to tell them we are dating yet. Only 1 of them knows because he is the oldest in the group and i was asking him for advice on this since i started to feel a bit uncomfortable with my bf.

I want to break up with him because he seems much too immature for dating, but i don't want to tear apart our friend group or make things awkward. What do i do?",29Sep2020,1

110,"I signed a lease with one of my best friends and I can’t stand living here anymore. I’m like her mom, constantly reminding her to pick up her mess for the sake of everyone here, picking up after her, reminding her to do her chores, gathering stuff and throwing stuff out that’s cluttering our house, etc. For example, I can’t use the dishwasher because she doesn’t take her dishes (90% of the dishwasher contents) out until about a week and a half after when I beg her to do it, and she acts very annoyed. I understand if it bothers me that much I can do it for her, but I’ve done that a few times already and I don’t have to be a 24 year old woman’s maid. The trash hasn’t been taken out despite it spilling over despite it being her turn to do it. Her room is incredibly messy and the contents have spilled out into the hallway and she has shown no sign of picking anything up or throwing it out. I’ve had to gather some of her stuff for her in a bag to donate and asked if I could donate it, to which she readily replied yes. She’s a reckless spender and complains about the possibility of not paying utilities on time (which is why she doesn’t have autopay and ends up paying late), yet gets at least 5 boxes from Amazon a day paid with credit. She almost lost her job for doxxing someone on the internet for saying something bad about a celebrity, and thought the situation was hilarious when she found out she actually wasn’t going to lose her job and only got written up. These are only a few examples of the things she’s done to show you how she is, which I didn’t know until I moved in. 

I’ve tried it all. I’ve had conversations with her, I’ve done the reminding and I’ve offered to help her divide up her chores so things are more or less equal around here. The thing is, she has anxiety and depression and uses that as an explanation as to why she can’t do her tasks and chores. I understand that it makes it difficult to do daily tasks, but when you live with someone, you should still be a considerate person. I’ve offered to help her start a savings account, find a therapist, make a list of things she needs to get organized and she never follows through. I’m tired of being someone’s maid and living in dirty conditions and not being able to use some things in common areas because they’re full or dirty. I’m also tired of constantly playing the caregiver role with her. I’m simply fatigued.

I don’t think this living situation is the best for me. I want to find someone to take over my room and then move back home. I don’t know how to tell my roommate/best friend that I’m moving out, but I don’t want to not do it just to avoid hurt feelings. I’ve tried all I could to help out this situation and I’ve been told I was a bad friend for “giving up.” This sucks. :(",29Sep2020,1

112,"Alright so, first of all, I hope your day is going amazing and if it’s not I wish it gets better.

I’m (16 M) currently living in Mexico as I have my entire life. About 18 months ago my family got the opportunity to begin legal proceedings to obtain a Green Card, if it all had gone as planned I’d currently be legally living and studying in the US, however, Trump signed an Executive Order in April that temporarily stopped immigration into the United States.

The immigration firm my family has been working with says we’ll ‘probably’ be living there by March (but they have been kinda unreliable with their estimates), so I don’t know what to believe anymore. This without considering what may happen next year as either Trump or Biden could serve as president.

All of this has got me quite worried, since I know for a fact I don’t want to attend college in Mexico and I’m - if converted to the US education system- a Junior. And I feel like the more time that goes by the more my college options shrink. And Gee, having only one year (my senior year) to adapt to a new life, new school AND college is honestly driving me nuts.

Currently, because of my parents, I’m enrolled in an American home school Christian curriculum called A.C.E, which I don’t think is good academic wise, and it also kinda indoctrinates people into their beliefs. 

In case you don’t feel like looking it up; you basically learn from 50-page books by almost entirely rote memorization, no room for critical thinking at all, you have weekly tests to pass your books, then, you get new books and so on. As far as I know, the system isn’t even accredited, so it kind of feels that this month -the time I’ve been in this ‘school’- has gone to waste. I also feel like being in a non-traditional school (as I’ve been my whole life) is gonna hamper my ability to adapt to the usual American public school.

I’m also concerned by the fact that immigration ‘on time’ seems unlikely and a big IF. As I said before as long as I don’t do college in Mexico, I’m golden. So I wouldn’t really mind considering options like Canada or some parts of Europe.

My parents said they’d back me up with any decision I take so; what choices do I have? What could I do to prepare myself so I’m actually ready when I actually move? What programs that could suit my situation are out there? Should I take this six months off and see how it plays out? Maybe study for exams that would allow me to enroll in international studying programs? 

I’m just really confused and not at ease at all, so all help is appreciated.

116,"Little background...

I did a gap year last year with three other people, one girl and two guys. While I was there I was dating someone who I had met that summer and honestly I just have a bad history with guys, but he wasn’t a bad guy. Our group (the gap year students and people around our small community) were a tight group but my boyfriend at the time wasn’t a part of that so the people in my gap year (really just the boys) didn’t like him very much. They had excellent reasons honestly, but a big one was that he took me out of the community rather than attempting to be a part of it (he knew some of the people which is a long story, but he didn’t dislike them.) Despite their dislike, when I spoke fondly of him they were supportive and generally kept quiet unless I asked about their honest opinions. 

I have since broken up with said boyfriend for good reasons that weren’t the same as the boys’ reasons. I’m glad it ended but that’s not the point. The break up caused me to make a list of qualities I search for in a guy, as a husband. Things that make a good husband rather than a good boyfriend. I realized that throughout all our conversations, one of the guys (we will name them Rich and Andy, I like Andy) displayed pretty much all of the qualities I am looking for. Throughout the year I really liked him but ignored the feelings because of my relationship and some other girl he liked who I am friends with. I have met his family (parents and siblings), and I love them. His best friend is my best friend. We are the three musketeers, the greatest trio of equal trouble makers.

Since the gap year we were separated for a couple months from March until June (but more like July) my boyfriend’s and my relationship was going strong over the summer, and then at the tail end I suddenly lost all interest in him. I began to be interested in Andy and saw the qualities he had that my boyfriend was seriously lacking. I ended things with my boyfriend and promised myself and the two boys that I would be single for 6 months which ends this coming March. 

Andy is from Minnesota, grew up and lives with his parents in Colorado, but is on a contract job in Wisconsin for at least a year. I live in Minnesota but have close ties to Wisconsin. People say we make a great team, and some even knew I liked him throughout the year before I had even accepted it. 

REASONS WHY I THINK HE MIGHT LIKE ME
He was sad he missed my birthday. He always wanted to hear about my love life but didn’t enjoy talking about his. He lacks personal space with me (would sit close next to me on the favorite couch or lay on me in an obnoxious way). He defends me when Rich pokes fun at me. He seriously gave me advice when I asked for it about my boyfriend. On one evening during a staff fun night we swing danced together from 6pm to 10pm after people had mostly all gone. He then said it was his favorite night of the summer. He also asked if I wanted to watch some tv show with him in on the last night, he asked in front of Rich and when the time came he didn’t tell Rich where we were going to watch the show even though Rich asked. And that night we hung out until 3am giggling, watching the show, and he kept “counting my ribs” which was probably an excuse to tickle me. 

REASONS WHY HE MIGHT NOT LIKE ME
He lacks personal space with a lot of people he is good friends with. He never really texts or calls me first when we’re apart. I don’t think I’m his type. The last two girls he was interested in were curvy, had brown hair and brown eyes, were pretty quiet and shy, total rule followers. I’m kinda skinny, have blonde hair, hazel eyes, I’m outgoing and talkative, and definitely not a rule follower. 

REASONS I LIKE HIM
He plays piano. He knits. Loves his mom. Has cats and dogs. Gives great back massages. Enjoys the outdoors. Is adventurous. Enjoys talking about politics and his faith. Loves to cook. Is hard working. He’s attractive 😉 He’s a good listener. He is funny. Is confident. A great leader. Is direct. 

What do I do guys? Do I move closer to him? Do I wait until he says something or do I say it first? Should I let it go and move on?",29Sep2020,1
117,"So I'm 22(m) and I'm pretty sure I've been hetero my whole life, but I've doubted constantly for the past 2-3 years.

I had the most wonderfull relationship with a girl for two years, and for all that time I never doubt it at all. But two years ago I took mushrooms with a male friend, and at the end of that trip he started playing some gay vibe music, making me feel different and also making me encounter my first conscious gay tought, nothing happened, but before that I actually kissed a boy once being hetero, wasn't a big deal really, I just saw it as a crazy stunt. I honestly was kind of heartbroken and wanted to know what did my ex-girlfriend felt when she kissed me. Kind of weird, but made sense to me back then.

For all that time I was certain about my sexuality, so fast forward to the complicated part. I smoked a joint with another male friend and once high, I started thinking to myself: Am I giving him a gay vibe? It felt wrong and very anxiety triggering. That was the head start to the heavy uncertainty about my sexuality, because that question I made to myself that day, started appearing every day since then, making my confidence dissapear, and causing some heavy anxiety, like never before, I hated having lunch with my family or having physical conversations at all, because the anxiety was overwhelming, words like ''hard'' or ''banana'' or simply grabing something phallic shaped triggered the big question, am I gay?, I don't want to be gay, I'm okay like this, but what do these messages mean then. So like a good gen z individual I google it, and found out I had HOCD (homosexual obsesive compulsive disorder), tried to learn how to handle it, I sort of handle it, but all of the messages and red flags kept showing up.

So, all this nonsense colapsed one day and I told my mom: I think I could really use some professional help. Couple of sessions passed by until one day my psychologist along with my psychiatrist diagnosed me with Cannabis induced psychosis. Started going to a day hospital, I got medication, stoped drinking and smoking. I felt good.

Time went on, still on medication, I had a party in my house, 6am, drunk and high, started to realize something really weird, I felt that all of the conversations had a second meaning, for example: if I told a girl, This has to be one of the most wonderfull days I've ever seen, the REAL meaning was me refering to her, that SHE is one of the persons most wonderfull I've ever seen, only by looking her expressions or looking at my feeling at the moment I said it.

So it's kind of exhausting and also weirdly magical but I've been giving this tought attention for the past months, and some of the thing I learnt listening to conversations are, how to tell when a girl or a boy is intersted in me, or what are the toughts that my brain flags as important in people's conversations, one of the main topics I constantly pick up, is whether I'm gay or not, maybe bi, or straight, or even asexual, I recently came to the conclussion that I'm bi-demisexual but I'm not 100% sure yet, I still doubt if I'm just gay, or bi to be more precise.

The more recurring thought really is that I'm actually gay, but that doesn't convince me, I dont know if I'm just deep into HOCD, or all of this is just the actual discovery of my sexuality, I don't feel comfortable at all about being gay, I love woman, I love soft-flirting with girls, my attention when there are girls in a party comes to them, not the boys, but I can be alone with a girl or a boy who's clear intention is to kiss me and I wouldn't have any problem about kissing any of those genders, I have a lot of trouble making the decision of just going for it tho, but trust issues maybe are for another subreddit.

I really don't know what to think, I'm 85% sure I'm bisexual but that 15% is killing me, I want to be sure about my sexuality, and I feel my body is kind of rejecting the gay part of being bi, not having a clue of the reason why. I really don't know if I'm just gay and try to overthink it to feel comfortable.

If someone can give me some insight, or have felt something similar, I could really use some advice. Or if you know some sexuality guru that has the time to read this, it would be awesome, I really need help. Thanks for reading",29Sep2020,1

Our anniversary for us being friends is October 9th and I’m really glad I met her. I already bought a holloween themed basket, was thinking of putting candy in it and giving her a plush too and a home made card and just put my thoughts on the card. 

The plush I originally wanted to give her is from a smaller company and I thought they could deliver with 1-2 weeks but it’s not even close so that plan is out the window. Idk what plush I should give her, she likes to reference things to animal sometimes and she says she looks like a sloth and she said if I were to be an animal I would look like a monkey she thinks. I thought it was pretty funny so all the plushies I’ve given her has been sloth, she always squishes them when I give it to her and she showed me it’s in her movie room. I think to myself if I keep giving her sloths that whole room will be sloth themed lol.",29Sep2020,1
121,I cosigned a vehicle while I was dating my ex. I was verbally abused and cheated on and ended the relationship. They stopped paying for the vehicle and moved back to the state they were from. I had to file for bankruptcy and the car loan was discharged. I am trying to remove my name of the title as I am terrified of getting into trouble since the car is in a different state and I have no communication with my ex. I had to pay toll fees for the the state of VA where he's at. My ex will not turn the vehicle in and the car loan has been looking for this vehicle for almost going to be 2 years but in my state since I am the main one on the title. Advice on what I should do? I just want my name removed of the title. I have no communication with this person.,29Sep2020,1
122,"I sort of came out to my psychiatrist, they were real supportive about it but. Long story short: they told me they weren't sufficiently educated in that topic, still proceeded to make their opinion known, and added to the heaping pile that is my self-doubt.

A grand total of three people know this: the aforementioned psychiatrist and two of my friends.

I'm currently throat deep in self-hatred as I dared pretend to be nonbinary to get attention, therefore disrespecting the entirety of the LGBT+ community. Though I hear wanting my secondary sexual characteristics gone and not feeling associated to my sex assigned at birth isn't very cisgender of me.

In other words, I've been living comfortably as cishet until I recently discovered I am not quite cishet and am now in need of your advice. To all redditors that come across my post: how do you keep invalidating comments from getting under your skin?",29Sep2020,1

125,"Hey everyone! So my birthday is coming up on Friday and I’m planning on hanging out with a friend of mine (19f) on Saturday, since she’s staying on campus for school and Friday may not work. We’re probably going to hang out at my place for awhile that afternoon (which we’ve done before). I mentioned to her that she’s welcome to hang out for as long as she wants to that day, like if she wants to go to dinner with my family and I, and even watch a movie at my house (which we’ve talked about doing before) or go for a walk that night. If that’s the case and she’s able to hang out late, then I can take her back to campus that night or even the next morning if she’s comfortable spending the night (campus is like 40 minutes away). We both like to stay up late so I figured why not mention that we can hang out later if she’s okay with it. I personally don’t see anything wrong with that but I just want to ask you all’s opinions about it before I mention it to her (that she’s welcome to stay the night if she wants to). Like would that sound weird if I said that? She’s been totally okay with things before that I wasn’t sure how they’d come off (because I’m a guy and she’s a girl), so I don’t think she’d have a problem with me offering that, but I just want to make sure... My other friends think it’s totally fine but my parents are worried it might freak her out, (when it’s really nothing different than what I’d ask my guy friends about doing). I’ll be seeing them on the Friday though.


So basically is it weird if I mentioned to her that she’s welcome to stay the night if she’s comfortable with it? Cause I’ll also tell her that I can drive her her back that night too if she’d rather do that as well...

Thanks!",29Sep2020,1

Am I really so unloveable that my own mom doesn't want to sleep on the same floor as me? What did I ever do to make MY OWN MOTHER dislike me so much? My dad's been very supportive but my mom's been extremely cruel, cold, and demanding of me saying I'm not trying and the reason I'm behind is because I'm, and I quote, ""lazy, unmotivated, manipulative, lying, stealing, cheat"" she never considered the point that I've told her at least 100 times that I don't know how to navigate teams and that I'm working as hard as I can to the point where if my eyes are shut too long I'm dead asleep, I've also been having these panic attacks lately where I feel like I'm going to throw up, my vision gets fuzzy, my jaw starts biting down like I'm shivering (my tongues always in the back of my mouth when this happens), the whole room starts spinning, my chest hurts, and I can hardly breathe to the point where I have to lay down on the floor (this happens at least twice a week) to which my mom starts screaming at me to do my work and get back in my chair before she calls the school to drop me out.

For example: when she takes the dog out for potty, she keeps kicking him if he's distracted by my dog who wants to play with him, and she does it openly too. The shittiest part about this too is the dog is a service dog that's supposed to assist her for her mental breakdowns. I don't know how to explain what she's doing to the dog is wrong, and she's hurting the dog in the long run.

135,"First post! So I'm fresh out of high school and new to college. I've known for a long time that I really never wanted to pursue further education after high school because I really hate homework, projects, etc. but I never knew how to address that to my dad. He's always sort of pressured me to do well in school and go to college.

 I got accepted and am currently majoring in business administration, but I really don't like it. I know it's early on, but I just don't like any of my classes. I'm doing everything online and I feel like there isn't enough communication between me and my professors. Not only that, but I have pretty bad ADHD that makes it hard to do work, concentrate on work, etc. So far, all college has done is worsen my mental state to the point where I've almost SH and have had thoughts that I might need to go to a mental hospital. My mom knows that I feel this way, but I think she thinks I'm over-exaggerating, and she keeps telling me to just ""take it up with Dad,"" but I don't think I can. I'm afraid that he'll be so disappointed in me that he'll never forgive me. (I'm still living with them and I don't plan on moving out for a bit since my mom has MS and I like to make sure she's okay.)

I really want to just drop out since we didn't have to pay anything this semester (besides books) thanks to some scholarships, but I have hefty scholarships for the other 3 years of the degree that my mom keeps telling me is something I shouldn't let go of. I feel like this degree won't make much of a difference nowadays anyway, and it isn't even what I want to do, I just settled on something because I didn't have enough time to decide.

So, reddit, should I just suck it up and go to school? or should I tell my Dad?",29Sep2020,1

142,"Around June, I got laid off from my previous job due to covid circumstances. I was an assistant manager in a retail store and while it was nothing fancy or super well paying, I absolutely loved it. I worked there for close to 5 years. I have worked my entire life in retail or the service industry (I'm 27) despite having a degree in IT because I actually enjoy interacting with people. 

Come August, I finally got a job offer at one of the only large companies in my town (they hire 2000 people). They are a sister company of a top 50 company in the world. This place is considered the best place to get hired in my area, because they work across so many different industries and are very well respected in the community. They treat employees incredibly well and offer loads of opportunities to get promoted and cross train in other areas of the company. I've been trying to get hired there for years but could never got in and I finally got an offer although it is absolutely not something I would've considered working in pre-covid, I got talked into taking the job and ""sticking it out for 6 months / a year and then transferring to a different department"".

Well I'm 6 weeks in, and I absolutely hate it. Its answering phones, but its unbelievable how much knowledge you need to know. We had 4 weeks of training, 3 weeks more than any other department in the company and it feels like we needed 3 months. Its honestly incredibly overwhelming. I'm a very social person, I'm great at customer service *in person*, on the phone I feel completely out of my comfort zone to the point I feel nauseous due to nerves. I have *no fucking idea what im talking about* but I'm expected to deal with very sensitive information. The only.positive thing is my managers and team are insanely nice and supportive. They all started at the same point and say it gets better / easier, but also that we are criminally underpaid for how much shit we have to do / learn and there is very high turnover due to the difficulty of the job. 

I work for an American company while not being from America. I am constantly asked to speak clearly because Americans can't understand my accent (I'm a native English speaker). I have to deal with financial professionals who expect me to know the in depths of taxes and investing, even though I only started learning about it weeks ago. It's work from home, so there is no turning around and asking someone for help outside of ringing an internal help desk line which is usually full. Its incredibly lonely, sitting in my spare room waiting for phones to ring all day and stressing out for 8 hours, 5 days a week. Oh it's also not in my time zone so my hours are completely out of whack to normal work hours. (2pm - 10pm). I've worked 6pm - 6am shifts and this is way worse, I feel like I have zero time in the morning or evening and almost never get to see my girlfriend. 

This is an incredibly long rant and I realise I sound like such a whiny bitch, but I just don't know what to do. I told myself and my girlfriend I could stick it out for 6 months and hope I get a transfer, but I honestly dont know if I can last that long. Plus if I leave, the job market isnt exactly booming right now and I could be throwing away the only chance I might get at working for a well respected company with opportunities to actually have a career. There is also a chance I stick it out and dont get a transfer, because it seems like I joined the one department were transfers are rare because they invest so much time in training you up, they dont want to let you go and have to train new hires all the time.",29Sep2020,2
143,"So like the title says I'm 24 (and a half) lol. But in all seriousness I feel like I'm facing a sort of life crisis.

I had a rocky start to adulthood. I dropped out of high school a month before graduating, then my bestfriend died just a few days before graduation and I spent that entire summer getting drunk and high every waking moment.

Eventually at some point between 19-21 I became obsessed with being ""successful"" and decided I would do it through marketing. I wanted to become a digital nomad. Travel the world and work from a laptop. I spent every hour (to an obsessive level) studying marketing, thinking about marketing, and critiquing everything I saw around me in the world.

My friends liked to party just as much as me and didn't share the same new found passion. Eventually I stopped hanging out with everyone I grew up with in pursuit of this new goal and they stopped visiting from college.

I've moved to different states, worked in tons of jobs from cashier, waiter, IT Technician, Painter, and so on.

Long story kinda short I finally landed a marketing position, and then another.

The position I'm in I've been at for almost two years. The longest I've ever stayed in one position.

The job is remote, and I work about 5-10 hours a week (Yeah, 40 hours a month max).  I'm on salary and make a decent amount of money especially for a dropout.

Will I become rich from it? No.

But I drive the car I want, don't really feel any desire to upgrade my living standards, and can save about $1,200-$1,800/month if I stay focused on my budget, more once I pay off my car.

Lately I've realized I don't really know what to do with all my free time. I have a few hobbies but I always seem to have spare time (which I currently fill with MASSIVE bong rips if I'm being honest)

I feel strange because I was a popular kid growing up but now I have no close friends or anyone I really hang out with. My old high school buddies are either still in school at grad programs or have gone off to the corporate world and work full-time.

I guess I'm a little lonely and have promised myself to work on this area of my life but I'm not entirely sure that's what giving me this empty ""missing something"" feeling. I also SUCK at making new friends, I haven't got a clue even where to begin and since all I've thought about is ""business"" and ""marketing"" for years I always end up steering conversations towards this topic which is boring for most people and not even really what I want to talk about either it's just the only conversations I know how to navigate.

I think I had a much more grand vision of life as a kid and now at 24 I'm relatively free of work and have accomplished the bulk of everything I had dreamed minus living abroad which is still doable. 

I also lost the need to own a Lamborghini, fly private jets, and live on an island. Maybe if I still had friends this stuff would be cool but if you don't have anyone to measure up against all that stuff is worthless.

I guess if I'd known I would have gotten to this point so quickly I probably would have went to college and had fun with the rest of the people my age. Even now at 24 just a couple years past the ""normal"" college age I feel like I gave up all those fun nights I could've had for nothing.

It's scary to think I need to fill potentially 60 something more years of life with activities and stuff to-do. How do I become less scared about this?

Going back to school has crossed my mind but I'm not sure I want to take on the financial burden for the promise of what? 

A new job in the future that takes 40-60 hours a week for more pay... Is this supposed to be what I continue to strive for?

If so, I feel even less hopeful than when I began writing this haha.

Hoping one of you strangers has some wisdom to pass on.

144,"This is my first time posting here, so forgive me if I’m doing something incorrectly. I just need advice and I figured this is the best place to turn to. 

For some background, I (F,20) have been struggling with a friend group for awhile now and I was looking on a way to get out of said friend group causing the least amount of drama possible. This group consists of 3 girls and 1 guy and we’ve been friends for around 2 years now. We met in college and pretty much done almost everything together since our freshman year.  

Due to some financial reasons, I wasn’t able to be roommates with the girls this school year. They wanted to be in two doubles and refused to be in a quad room, which I simply could not afford. In addition, last school year I roomed with one of the girls, and it didn’t work out too well. She was stealing things from me and denying it, and she would never clean up after herself, leaving me with her messes to clean up. It caused me a lot of stress, but that’s kind of besides the point. 

Now I’m with a different roommate group, which they assured me repeatedly that it was okay. However, I’ve noticed that ever since this school year they’ve been acting really strange towards to me. Intentionally leaving me out of plans, not telling me what they’re doing, ignoring my texts, etc. I knew that if I roomed with a different group of people, I wouldn’t be with them as much, but still. 

 I’m home for medical reasons and not a single person from the group has reached out to me or asked me how I am. It’s been about 5 weeks that I’ve been home. After reflecting about things, I’ve noticed that the whole time we’ve been friends, I’ve been taken advantage of. After doing some investigating, I noticed that 1. They’ve been charging me 2x the amount on Venmo for things (dinner, birthday gifts for the others, etc.) 2. They have been going to my room at school without knocking (knowing that I’m not there) and straight up stealing things from me, telling my roommates that “I’m okay with it.” My roommates have since locked the door. 3. They constantly guilt trip me into doing things that I don’t feel comfortable with all of the time (drinking, smoking, partying). 4. One of the girls in particular has straight up degraded me to my face about my major, my acne, and even my boyfriend. 

Basically, just looking for a way to leave the group without causing shit to go down. I know they already ignore me, but if I leave the group chats, then I know for a fact they’ll act like I’m the one in the wrong. 

TLDR: Friend group at school has straight up taken advantage of me, ignored me, and degraded me. Looking for a way to get out of the group without causing drama.",29Sep2020,1

I know, it's a pretty unhealthy routine but my classes are online, I have an unlimited supply of entertainment, and I do game development as a hobby. So that explains why I'm on the computer 24/7. 

My sister, who isn't home 90% of the time, thinks I'm a loser and a few of my friends have unfriended me because I choose to spend my time alone. I mean, there isn't really a whole lot to do around my town. Everything is closed and the only thing my (old) group of friends would do is either take a drive to the beach or do childish shenanigans.

I feel like it's deeply affecting my academics and social life. What can I do?",29Sep2020,1
154,"For context, I work at a gym in Massachusetts. Chain location that I can’t name for legal reasons. Think purple. 

This girl walked in at 7am on a Tuesday morning, and I knew I would never be able to forget her face. She looks like a bulldog in the prettiest way possible, if that makes sense. I couldn’t figure out if she was the kind to stick around, but I really hoped so. “Hey, I’m only going to be here for a few months, but can I get a membership?” Nice.

I found out she was the early morning kind. Not super chatty, but she was warming up to me. I tried to be there when she showed up. I normally walked to work, but I gave my manager a heads-up that I’d be needing a parking spot from now on. But, ever since I started taking my scooter he's gotten mad that I'm driving it. I still don’t get it. I park between two spots since cars can fit on each side, so I take up like no space at all. Anyway, I’d make sure to get in nice and early. I’d roll up the sleeves of my polo shirt, unbutton the top, and show off a bit. I’d put them back down after she checked in, though. I know I have a reason to be proud of my body but I really don't want to be too narcissistic, especially around other people.

So eventually I ended up getting her phone number. I already had it in the system, but I made sure to get it from her before I texted her so it’s not creepy. We made small talk and when the conversation died down I texted her, “Today my cat has been acting weird and I wonder if he’s sick.” He wasn’t sick, I don’t think. He’d eaten a full cup of yogurt, so he probably just had the shits. But I knew she was into animals, so that was some kind of connection. She volunteered for some kind of nonprofit. I have no clue how she made her money. 

We seemed to be hitting it off and everything was going great, then she moved to Portland about a week later. We hadn’t even hung out yet and I was ready to marry this girl. The day I found out, a fast food chain had just served me a hot dog with moldy bread. I was already feeling shitty, and then she hit me with the “hey I’m moving across the country.” I’d be lying if I didn’t say I was ready to pack up and move right then and there. The only things I feel I’d be giving up are my cats and the few friends I have now. 

I’d been told to let it go, move on, forget her, ignore her and all that. So I ghosted her. I figured that would get her to start texting me again, and I’d be the one that moved on. Of course, she reached out after two weeks, asking me how I’ve been. Why can’t anyone care before that happens? I told her I was fine and apparently that was the cue to spill about how great her life was. “I spoke to the head of the primates and he said to send my info to the zoo and will get a scheduled interview on Wednesday.” Great, good for her.

Basically, I’m heartbroken and kind of obsessed with this girl. I don’t have any connections in this area and I’ve been wanting to move. She’s the main reason, but I don’t want to be weird about it. Anyone have any good suggestions on why I’d be moving to Portland? I don’t want to freak her out. 

By the way, I’m set on doing this. Don’t try to convince me out of it. I just want to figure out a way to spin the move so it’s not obviously because of her. I'd also appreciate literally any idea on how to prepare for such a big move.",29Sep2020,1
155,"I'm sixteen and male if that's important.

My relationship with my dad is already shit. I'm not exaggerating when I say he's the person I dislike most on this planet. Today, I found that he's been keeping tabs on everything I do. There's probably more that I don't know of but here's what I found so far:

Every email I get sent is automatically forwarded to him (all multiple of my emails)

Every internet search is monitored 

Every text message I've sent and received has been checked at night whilst I'm asleep

He somehow found the password to every site I frequent and set his number and email as the recovery

He has access to every file on my computer account

I've changed all my passwords, emails, recoveries, etc. and reset my computer account. Still, I feel like shit. I feel humiliated and betrayed. I want to run away. I want to just disappear. I hate that man. Every joke, every flirt, every conversation, he's seen it all. And he doesn't even feel the slightest bit of shame in doing so. He thinks it's his right as a ""parent"" to know, but he's not even treating me like a human at this point. 

If he sees this post, whatever. I don't care. In a year or two, I'll leave this shithole of a ""home"" for good.   But until then, how the fuck do I live in the same house as him? How the hell am I supposed to feel about this?",29Sep2020,1
156,"I’m honestly sorry if this is a dumb question, but I feel like I’m not right.

I always never think about other people’s needs. I always think for myself and never other people. An example would be: I grab myself a snack while someone’s over at my house and I forget to offer them any, and just don’t think to offer them anything. I feel so ashamed when my friends point that out. I have 3 friends and everyone else are just people, I talk with them and I think of them as a side character in a movie. I always try to figure people out, I’m always thinking how to make people trust and like me, but don’t actually care if they do. My thoughts are always locked up in my mind and I never tell anyone anything. If I’m upset I like being alone, without talking to anybody. I don’t like people seeing me hurt, because it makes me feel weak. I don’t like pity or complaints. I like being alone all the time and I feel disconnected from the world, and I like that. I don’t want anyone in my life, I don’t want kids or a partner. I’m always thinking about how things will impact me, but nobody else. I still think about people from time to time, but it’s rare, and all I can fell is guilt for being so selfish.

157,"So last night I needed a jug for some pineapple mango rum I was making at my parents house So I grabbed a jug of Tropicana with a little bit of liquid ( that I presumed to be old OJ ) and poured it out, put an assload of dawn dish soap, filled it up and emptied It well about 5 times. 5 times seems like a lot for some old OJ, but dawn bubbles work a little too well. Didn’t want dish soap in my alcohol. Anyways, I had a few cups, had a good night. It is 24 hours later and my parents have informed me that they were using the opaque Tropicana container for their fucking round up! I feel perfectly fine, but I’m wondering

I don't see the need for him to apologise. He hasn't done anything wrong..things like this are normal and can happen to anyone..Even though I find this cute and endearing I really don't want him to feel sorry for spending time with his family and friends who means a lot to him

I asked him to please stop yelling at me and that I just forgot that it was still in the kitchen. He got even angrier and said I had no right to tell him what to do in his house. I wasn't trying to tell him what to do, though. I was just telling him that I don't like being screamed at. He worked himself up and he came towards me like he was going to hit me.

This this the guy I would’ve deadass done anything and everything for and he knows it too. The part that hurts the most is I thought he liked me too but I was completely wrong he hates me and wants nothing to do with me and it couldn’t be more obvious. 


He tells me he’s too busy to chill with me meanwhile he has time to link with everyone else but me. Like for example last week week I asked him if he wanted to go to the movies with me and he pretty much said no and I haven’t chilled with him in 2 months because according to him he’s been to busy to link with me. 


Clearly that’s a lie if he has time to link other people or girls amd not me. The thing that hurts the most too is that me and him used to talk/text all day everyday and chill like everyday too. So I know I should say fk him and ignore him but my mind is not letting me do that and I can’t stop thinking about him like it hurts a lot. I feel so depressed and sad because of it. 



What do you think I should do? U know I have to get over him because he clearly doesn’t want anything to do with me: the funny part is we still talk/text but he never wants to hangout with me anymore which I don’t get because it seems like we always have had a thing. Anyways how can I get over

168,"For context, I am a mid 30's woman who presents as very feminine in a male dominated field. I have been previously successful in my field, have been offered several senior leadership/executive level roles, and have been complimented on my professionalism and commitment. I have previously dealt with both internalized and very overt sexism (everything from colleagues assuming I'm an admin when they meet me to issues like being propositioned by executive leadership during work functions), I am currently in a workplace that has made me feel more disempowered and dismissed than I have in my entire career and have been struggling to trust my own perception of events. I know that it's difficult to determine the source of truth without being part of the situation, but does anyone have any advice on how to address some of these issues? For context, I am also in an essential field and we were not able to work remotely or shelter in place, so these interactions are occurring face to face. 

A few months ago, I was offered a promotion as a senior leader in a department that was newly formed. The promotion was well within my skill level and previous work experience, and I start putting together the new department and processes. 

However, my manager did not communicate the change to the organization and when I mentioned that the lack of defined structure was causing confusion, I was told that ""people will just know what your role is when you start acting like the Role Title"". The lack of clear organizational structure continued to cause problems, with many employees deferring to my male colleagues in place of me, and any conversations I've tried to have on the issue have been met with more statements like ""no one is going to bestow the title on you, you just have to act like it."" 

Additionally, colleagues from other departments walk into mine on a weekly basis and give direction to my employees with no prior discussion with me, i.e. informing my direct reports that they don't like the way I've set up a process and having my employees start performing the work to implement their change. I tried to address this behavior with my manager today, simply to request that any feedback goes through me and my colleagues discuss any potential changes to my department's processes with me. I was told that it's unfixable because we strive to have a culture of empowerment where people speak their mind and we don't want to take away from that, that I need to take feedback, that I contradict myself and that ultimately all my decisions can be overruled so it doesn't matter anyway. When I've pushed back previously (which is part of my job, to push back and advocate for my team), I've been told that I don't understand how anything works and my experience is meaningless.

172,"I had a fling with a guy from my school this summer. (I’m 18 and I just graduated high school for reference.) To preface, during my senior year, we became friendly. We would talk to each other during study halls and would Snapchat when we were out of school. It was hardly flirty but I secretly had my eye on him and would always drunk Snapchat him during the weekends. We weren’t super close because we aren’t in the same friend group, but we still talked. 

In March during quarantine, we started talking a lot on Snapchat. He was a lot more flirty and complimentary of me, and I tried to brush it off because he had a history of being a fuckboy. We continued to Snapchat since school never went back into session. Late June came around, we were both drunk and Snapchatting one another. He told me I was cute, and he wished he told me sooner. I was pretty excited because something that I had been thinking about for a while was finally coming to fruition. But in the back of my mind I knew it was bad considering his past. 

We would continue to flirt until it was around the middle of July. He told me he wanted to actually hang out. I was pretty nervous because he’s more popular than I am and as I mentioned, has been with a lot of girls. We hung out the first time in his car and it didn’t really click. It was just kind of awkward, and he had mentioned that he would hook up with me if I wanted to, but I didn’t expect him to want to the first time we hung out! The second time, I snuck him into my friend’s house at 1:00 AM. I was a little tipsy, but it was honestly a lot of fun. My friends were hidden away in another room, trying to keep quiet. We hooked up, nothing more than making out and him feeling me up, though. The third time, he picked me up at night and we went to a spot. We did more than make out if you know what I mean, but kind of ended on a weird note. 

For some reason, when we hung out it would be awkward and sort of just weird. The conversation didn’t click the same like it had in school. I actually found out he was flirting with one of my sister’s friends when I had told him that if he was trying to get with other girls, he should just stop talking to me. We don’t Snapchat anymore and if we do, it’s streaks. He never used to leave me on opened and delivered but now he does.Thank god he left for college recently because if he didn’t, I know he would still be hitting me up to hang out and I would probably be saying yes. Although I feel a little hostile towards him, I still find myself looking for what he’s doing on social media. I check up on it or see if he’s liked certain girls posts. I “got over” him in the past few weeks but sometimes I have dreams with him in it and it brings back old feelings. Or sometimes I look through my Snapchat memories from a few months ago when I was having more fun, and look back fondly on the times when we were talking. We never even dated and had trouble making conversation in real life, so why am I sort of hung up on him? My friends told me I deserve better since he lied about what he was doing.

181,"Ok so I was dating this chick for two years and we broke up. Shortly after I met this new girl, let’s call her L. So me and L hit it off pretty good, flirting and stuff as we hung out at parties and stuff, We also texted frequently. Soon it was me, L, her best friend and my best friend going to the beach and having bonfires with just the four of us. So I got to have more personal time with her. Then her best friend kept on telling me this “ohhh L likes you a lot, you should ask her out” one day she texted me this so I asked her “so what should I do” she told me “be more direct” so I thought “huh, they probably talk about this stuff considering there best friends, maybe she told her to say this” so I did exactly that. And I said this in a text “hey L, I think your really cool and I’d like to hang out sometime” she replied “yesss that sounds awesome”. the next day, Boom, no text at all. I was shocked. This went on for two whole weeks, she would only text me once a day. I was so confused on where I went wrong. So I actually (Ik it’s stupid) wrote a song about the situation and posted it on my soundcloud, she then heard the track and she texted me that night saying it was so sweet and that I never messed up. She basically said she was giving me time since I just got out a two year relationship, i thought that was a bit weird to quit texting me and not giving me a reason at the time. As of Today we text frequently again, and we have hung out one on one once. And it’s so hard to hang, a million things come up. She sends screenshots of chats that prove she’s not lying sometimes, but it feels so hard to hang with her. I just don’t know what to think about this whole situation. So what changed? Did the song bring her back to me, or did she really still care? And why is it so herd to hang with her. She will tell me she’s busy then hang with her friends. I have no clue!

Had obviously just been smoking (I’m an ex smoker cause my wife won’t allow). He Seems a little mortified but he went back in for his keys and we went about our days. 

So listen I’m a parent who used to smoke too but never while my children were awake and I took it outside. The house reeked and the child was left unattended and who knows how close he was smoking it. My conscience screams report. I think the neglect goes deeper. Pot isn’t legal here either. 

What do?",29Sep2020,1
183,"First off, let me say that I realize that I made a terrible mistake. You live and you learn. 

I [22F] am struggling to live a happy life with my ex [36M]. We dated for 2 months , then I decided that he wasn’t a good fit for me (controlling, bad temper, weight issues). It was the start of quarantine and were bound not to see each other for a few months. So I broke it off. He took it badly but still agreed to the promise he made back when were dating (that I could move in). 

I needed to leave where I was at. I had a new job lined up in the city where he was and tbh I was planning all of this for months. Fast forward a few months and we’ve had countless silly arguments over basic respect (no farting at the table while eating, no prying into my personal matters or stalking , and not getting jerked off on the couch we share). He makes me so angry with his lack of respect. He loves to compare me (sexually) to recent dates/girlfriends he’s had. It drives me nuts! And most of all his bragging about how these new women love him and what their plans are , really really grind my gears. 

I just want to live in peace. I don’t want to feel defensive and awkward when women come over. I don’t want to continue to fight. 

My parents are aware of this but don’t have any solutions rn. I left my moms house due to her abuse so I don’t feel like I need to go back. My sense of self would be snatched from me once again. 

Rn I’m trying to focus on saving, working, and getting back in college (that way I can get back on campus). I’d like a relationship in the future but not now. I no longer have feelings for my ex but idk how long I can stand the constant “I have a date/relationship, you don’t” contest. He spends most of his days lamenting over him being single and unlovable , so when he gets attention .. it’s over board/in your face. Tbh I find it to be sad that he feels the need to do this to someone 15 years their junior (never doing that gap again either).

TL;DR- Living with ex out of need. Feeling tormented by ex’s bipolar mood swings and grandiose. Need tips on how to stay sane when someone is clearly trying to break you down, and you can’t leave.",29Sep2020,1

I don't know if one these is gonna take place again ever and It really sad because I want another chance to at least send my application this time. I don't feel scared anymore.

Is there a way to post on youtube on instagram that gets some views? Should I post my singing on my personal instagram? How do I make it less embarrassing?

185,"i suffer from depression, severe anxiety, and poly-drug abuse. my oil pen died tonight and because I cant smoke, which is all I want to do because it calms me down, it’s taking a huge mental toll on me right now. i smoke all day, almost every day to escape from the constant boredom and apathy I feel. i can’t get any sleep without it. 

i have a weed cartridge (just not the oil pen) and my close friend who lives near by smokes too. we always help each other with our anxieties and depression. we respect each other. a few hours ago i asked him if I could borrow his pen and I’ll return it to him in the morning, just to help get me through the night. he told me he doesn’t want to be an enabler and that he doesn’t think it’s a good idea, even though he let me borrow it last week and we smoked a joint together last night.

I replied back “you’d really be helping me tonight. i won’t ask to borrow it again.” he didn’t reply for 10 min and the knot in my stomach kept growing so i texted him again saying  “im just desperately trying not to feel this way but im sorry nvm, I’ll leave you alone, goodnight”

he wrote back “don’t make me feel bad. you can’t manipulate me.” 

i can’t stop crying right now. the one person in the world who I feel truly understands me and my life experiences can say some of the meanest shit sometimes. whenever we talk politics, to make his point he’ll always use me as an example. like saying i get handouts from my father or that im currently unemployed and my parents still pay for my car/health insurance. 

I don’t know why he accused me of trying to manipulate him, knowing that i would take that in a deeply, personal way. i shouldn’t have even bothered explaining to him why it would help me tonight because now he’s just twisting my words and making me feel like a shitty person.

should I back away and spend some time apart from my friend?

186,"I have a friend who constantly likes to leave things with me as his parents are super strict on him with his spending and what he buys.

On this occasion he bought a new expensive poker set from overseas during his university exchange trip and left it in the boot of my car as he said he will never use it unless I'm there anyway.

Fast forward a few months later I end up in a car accident where a garbage truck T-bones me and the backside of my car is basically crushed (I managed to escape with little injuries luckily dw). The car was towed away then taken to my insurance where they had to write it off and destroy it (I think I'm not too knowledgeable on this process) 

Anyway that included everything inside such as his poker set. Now he wants me to pay for it so he can buy a even newer one. What should I do? 

Note: I normally don't mind but he always makes me pay for random things like nachos that were shared for his birthday, sushi which someone else ate and took home, etc so I'm conflicted on this for some reason.

190,"I generally don't make friends and honestly I don't have any friends in real life. I work different freelance jobs and there's not much time to hang out, sometimes I play video games though. I met Adam a year and half ago online, despite our personalities being polar opposites, we got along well and quickly became close as we both had a lot of free time in the summer and ended up playing together frequently during it. Occasionally he had major family problems and I would lend an ear and give advice if he wanted it. He's 18, and I'm a couple years older.

  


Long story short, but my Mom got really, really sick(before covid) and this was a big deal for me as she had to go to the hospital. Of course around this time he had met a girl online he became smitten with, and he didn't give that much of a damn about my situation. Anyway my Mom thankfully recovered, but I decided to stop logging on anything and went back to working 24/7. It freaked me out and it freaked me out no one gave a damn. Which is typical, all my previous friends never really 'get' health problems and disabilities and whatnot, I've found they never care anyway.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The title makes it sound very cut and dry, but this guy is still messaging me despite not being online for months at this point, which has never happened to me before. So I guess he's left the honeymoon phase by now. He saw me log on once a while ago and instead of a short message, sent me this long sappy paragraph about he's played with me for over a year, I gave him such great advice so many times, he wants to know how I'm doing, etc. Great that he cares, but where was this when I actually needed it.  


&amp;#x200B;

I'm still bothered about being brushed aside when I was at my lowest point, especially over some random internet girl, but now dropping him feels somewhat of a mistake. No one's ever followed up and reached out to me before but messaging him feels like a mistake too. I'm bothered about being ditched at such a crisis. And if I message him, I'm not even sure what to say. Friendships are exhausting, I don't get the boundaries in this sort of situation, I know they vary person to person, but I don't know what's fixable at this point or not.

192,"My ex claims I am still trying to harass her via ""fake accounts"" I have been doing no such thing. She has made lies about me using fake accounts and phone numbers to harass her. I have never contacted her via multiple phone numbers. And every account I messaged her off during the breakup process has been legitimate, prexisting accounts I'd messaged her on prior to the breakup. There were no ""fake accounts""

After agreeing to cut ties with her two weeks ago. I have only contacted her twice. And I'll admit these were with accounts I had not contacted her with prior, as she had blocked me on my actual accounts. But both were for what I feel are legitimate reasons. Once to advise her about a man spreading her nudes, because I was legitimately concerned for her. And another because she was posting lies about me with threats to report me with lies about animal abuse. I have never abused an animal, she does not have legitimate ground there. So that is of no actual concern. However it was worrying that she intended to cause me such problems.

Should I advise my friends of this liar or just continue to hope she stops?",29Sep2020,1

I’m (18m)currently in program where I graduate from high school with a diploma and an associates degree in science all free and on my community colleges campus. This is all supposed to be transferred to a four year university to make college easier but to be honest I’m burnt out, I’m barely able to motivate myself to do much schoolwork because I can’t see myself doing anything with it. I would like to finish here, graduate, and move on to something I enjoy doing and get a job and live I suppose I’m great with computers and technology I always have been and that’s what my major was initially in but I had to change it back to science.
I have skills outside of school work that I could possibly get a job in, due to an unfortunate passing of a close friend I’ve gone back to my old martial arts instructor and I currently have a job there teaching martial arts and helping her with office work, I think it’s be cool to finish up help my instructor for a while and maybe open my own dojang at some point at the moment I’m kind of lost as to what to do I apologize if I’ve been rambling or confusing if I need to clarify a few things just let me know in the comments and I’ll do my best, thank you for your time.",29Sep2020,1
196,"This isn't a ""feel sorry for me"" post, the topic's just been nagging me and I'm looking for honest opinions no matter how harsh they sound. I've never had anyone show romantic interest in me before. Don't get me wrong, people have flirted with me or wanted to hook up, but nobody's had actual feelings for me. These people are both ones I met in person and ones from dating apps (which I had briefly for 2 months and then deleted), but the majority were from dating apps. A few of the people who I met through dating apps have tried to pursue something more serious, but I wasn't interested and ghosted them. So yeah, I'm 18 and have not had my first kiss, let alone any sort of ""love life"". It's been bothering me whether there's actually something wrong with me because everyone I know in my age group has had at least some sort of experience in this area. I don't consider myself severely unattractive; I work out regularly and am actually proud of the outfits I put together. I'm a shy person, but I also don't think I have a dry personality once you get to know me. I always had crushes on people in middle and high school, but it truthfully was never something I actively pursued (I never made the first move). I've been in college for a month now, where hook up culture is the norm, but nobody here's expressed any interest in me that way. I have no issue with hookups, but the only reason I didn't hookup with any of the people who have wanted to, is that I was afraid they only wanted to hook up with me because they can't pull anyone else. I don't wanna hook up with someone who's only doing it because they're desperate, and I definitely don't wanna lose my virginity and get my first kiss that way. Truthfully, I have commitment issues and don't even want a relationship right now. But the more time goes on, the stranger it seems that I have nothing to show for my ""love life"" whether it's an actual relationship or hookups. My friends are all either in serious relationships, have history with someone they like, or are hooking up with people. I don't wanna be 20 and still never done anything in this department.

201,"I started going to therapy in seventh grade because my parents were worried that I was too stressed out. It turned out that my panic attacks that I got once a week were not normal stress symptoms and actually undiagnosed anxiety. 

Long story short, I started going to therapy for anxiety, then anxiety and depression, and then anxiety and OCD. My family does have a history of mental illness including depression and schizophrenia. The OCD was the most recent diagnosis and it’s definitely what I’m the most worried about. 

When my OCD was bad and my antidepressants weren’t dosed high enough to help because we didn’t know, I was constantly distant and worrying over things and trying to do my little ‘rituals’ at times that were dangerous simply because I couldn’t stop it. For example, I always need to touch everything in my bag multiple times before I get to my destination. 

In my mind it goes along the lines of: missing something = unprepared = people disappointed in me = people not wanting to be near me = me alone, etc. I had to check and touch everything so many times and I realized it was a problem when I was doing it while driving (reaching over to the passengers seat to open every zipper and touch every item in my bag). This was so dangerous for me and the other people on the road and I realized that and got more help/increased medicine doses/increased therapy. 

The worst of it was about one year ago and recently I made strides towards my better self. I went to therapy (and zoom meeting therapy once quarantine started) at least once a week and I was finally at more peace than I had been for a while. I’ve gotten much better at separating rational thought from goblin-brain-anxiety thoughts and my therapist and I even reached a point where we agreed that I am strong enough to stand on my own and have been three months graduated from therapy. 

Here’s where the problem is. Recently, I’ve noticed an increase in the paranoid thoughts. I am still worried about missing things and continue my touching ritual (never when driving- I pull over or park somewhere if I really have to check) but this has been different. I’m paranoid that everything is some elaborate joke and everyone and everything is secretly out to make me look stupid/invalidate me. 

I keep thinking things like “my friends all secretly hate me,” “my teachers are putting in good grades to show me where I need to be, not where I am now,” “Someone replaced all my hair products with hair removal cream,” “you’re missing assignments and now you’re not going to pass the class so you won’t get into a good college.”

Rational brain knows that everyone has these worries and that I’m the one stretching them to the next step, but goblin-brain is telling me that I can never Really know. It’s starting to feel like it did before I started working on my OCD- like an itch somewhere in the back of my brain that I can’t stop until I do something. Except this time I can’t touch something or count things out because they’re all worries about intangible things and abstract ideas. 

I feel like I’m full of bees that are buzzing all down my limbs. My hands start to physically shake when I can’t release these feelings the way I could by touching things.

I haven’t changed my habits since I ended therapy and I’ve taken all my medicine just fine. It feels like it all bubbled up and now it’s bubbling over. I’m scared to tell my parents because then it’s real. They were so happy for me that after five years, I was at a place where I could happily take a longer break. We’re not struggling financially but I also have to think about the money for college instead of therapy. 

I’m so lost but I hate this feeling. Rational brain says to go back but goblin brain is being really loud. What should I do?

TLDR - I went to therapy for five years for a number of reasons but recently I’ve graduated out of it and have been out of therapy for three months. I’m starting to feel paranoid and so full of thoughts and worries that I’m physically shaking. Do I go back to therapy? Would I be disappointing people for going back because everyone was so happy for me?",29Sep2020,1

I'm not sure how to approach this person because we haven't talked for a while.  We kind of had a falling out that I still to this day don't understand, but we haven't really talked or hung out for over 2 years.

But at the same time, I'm not sure how much more he'd be willing to hang out.  I feel like I will need to be straight up with him and ask wtf is going on if he doesn't talk about it.  At the same time though, I don't want him to think I'm trying to word him up or whatever.  I'm not sure how to approach something like this.

210,"Hi, I'd really like advice for what to do regarding a possible severing of a long - time friendship. I would ask friends, but the truth is, I only have two. One who I'm probably going to be severing a friendship with and another, who is currently taking care of a kitten, juggling schoolwork and plays video games. Very late. I'd really not inform her of this. At least not now as they are close with friend 1. I suppose I want a view that isn't biased. 

Friend 1 [ let's call her .... Lucy ] still has continued contact with a bully I wish to have nothing to do with [ but have been cowardly to actually do something whilst in their presence ]. It isn't physical or verbal bullying, but social. Bully has slowly been excluding me from my friends [ Lucy and Friend 2 ... let's call her Poppy ]. At first, when I met Bully [ I'ma call her and Bully 2 ... Beth and Stacy ], she was kind and we used to talk a little [ along with Stacy ]. However, me being socially awkward, I never was one to constantly engage in conversations with them. Soon, they both ceased contact with me, only asking when they needed something [ which was mainly my school supplies ] and constantly asking my friends over to sit at their table for lunch. Again, I was too cowardly to approach them with my discomfort of this. I eventually started sitting on my own in lunch, envious of how easily Lucy and Poppy could converse with others. I still remember this one infuriating moment whereas I had accidentally dropped some papers on the ground and scrambled to pick them up. Beth merely stepped over where my hands were and continued to her desired area. No, ""do you need help?"" [ I would've been fine if she didn't want to, I was more upset at her lack of manners ] or ""excuse me"". This was during a class period, not lunch. I also remember a time during Language class  when we had to color in a skull for, ""Day of the Dead"" and me, attempting to say something encouraging to Beth, blurted, ""You can do it!"" only to recieve an awkward but arrogant, ""I know."" I shut my mouth afterwards, embarrassed and discouraged. I have a tendency to overthink situations, making a mountain out of a molehill, could I possibly be in the wrong for that? Painting them in a bad light, never actually interacting with them?

Oh! And I'd like to add, Beth used to follow Stacy around. They were together EVERYWHERE in every class and were almost like twins. I don't want to make this post too long, so let me hop right to it. Please let me know if you'd like more info, though. 

I told my friends during the first year [ I was bullied by them [ Beth and Stacy for 3 ] of how uncomfortable I felt and how sh**y they made me feel. I cried a lot during my first year because of them. I couldn't bring myself to tell Beth and Stacy, so my friends tried to do it for me... It didn't work for long. They tried to include me, but eventually stopped and went back to making me feel like a ghost. I wasn't even spared a glance unless they needed one of my supplies and I felt so ... angry. They knew how they made me feel and continued? 
I eventually distanced myself from them and refused to sit at the table, causing Lucy to sit with me [ saying she didn't like them all that much either and Poppy was currently at another state for the second year ]. Beth and Stacy sat down, asking me if it was okay .... my scared butt said yes. My comfort spot ... taken from me. 

Oh my goodness, here I go making it longer [ I'm on mobile so it appears like a lot of text for me, I'm sorry ]. I told the counselor of my issue and the school didn't do shit [ This was in my third year, of highschool! Starting from freshman. ] So basically, I have this large ball of anxiety from my experience with them, and knowing Lucy didn't like them but still kept contact with them [ Well, just Beth because apparently Stacy turned mean after finding someone else ], churned some unpleasant emotions. I cried prior to writing this, perhaps it's because my emotions are heightened during the last days of my cycle. So anyways, I know I'll never be happy if I'm friends with someone who still kept in contact with the person who often made me feel like skipping school.

216,"My boyfriend and I go to the same college and didn’t get to see eachother for about 6 months because of the pandemic.

But I would be missing the same two classes in person again. I attended them remotely from his house on Friday and would attend them remotely tomorrow too, I’m just worried this one professor will get annoyed that I’m not in person again. It’s not just me wanting to go over though, I missed him so much over those 6 months that now I feel like I really need to jump at any opportunity for alone time with him because idk when school will shut down again. If it shuts down next week then I’ll regret not spending that day with him.

225,"I don’t exactly have a question rn now as i begin to write, i just want to share my situation and see what people have to say.

Me and my partner (m/m) both in our late 20’s moved in together 2 years ago. We had no each other prior for almost a year. So its coming up to a 3 year relationship. 

Things were fine the first 2 years, lots of new and exciting moments, always planning trips and having fun. We had our ups and downs and there were a lot of times i could genuinely imagine a future. But it was all very fast. He being from overseas, was running short on his visa so we applied for a pricey partnership visa. It was a bit stressful, especially the uncertainty of work and staying for him. But it got approved early this year.

Now we have been in lockdown since march. Both jobless, i receive government money which is enough for us to comfortably survive. I dont think he has any savings, the visa prevents him for working longer than 6 months at 1 place and he gets taxed a lot. He has qualifications which were very expensive to get approved here so we avoided that until we felt very certain he’d be staying. Ultimately, we rely on my pay outs and our security is my own personal savings. We are safe and comfortable but he is definitely under my thumb when it comes to money and we both hate that.

Emotionally, it’s been very basic lately. We stopped being intimate, we don’t speak in depth, at one moment he made a remark that we behaved just like friends. And i feel this way (i know i feel it more than him). Honestly, the intimacy was never a high point for me so it doesnt hurt me much.

The empty lonely feeling i had always had lingering in our relationship rules now in my heart. There are times i wish we didnt move in together, get a lease, get a visa. So much of our commitment was tied in together very fast. Its like a web ill never unweave without tearing the whole thing down.

The end of the year is approaching and we still wonder what we will do. I want him to know that in my heart its over. But its so hard. I feel like a terrible person. I dont want to just send him back overseas after a miserable year. I feel like i have tied him down and ruined his time here. I dont know what ill do. I dont want to go home either. But without him, i didnt have much reason to be where i live now.

We talk about travelling when we can, and where we might move. But im just lying when i agree. And i lie because what can i do. If i end it now, we still have 3 more months, maybe more. We can’t leave our state without paying a lot of money, he can’t go home overseas yet, he can’t live on his own as he has no money, i cant support two rents. And he is alone here now. All his friends moved away as they werent on a partner visa. We are all we have at the moment

Is it fair for me to leave? Am i doing the right thing by staying when i dont really want to? Should i end it now and let us suffer the rest of lockdown? Or keep the peace as we are coping and comfortable...",29Sep2020,1
226,"So I met a group of girls online. I’ll admit that I have a slight crush on one of them, but long distance is absolutely not an option of me so it doesn’t affect the dynamic too much. I’ve always been very platonic with them. Anyways. 

We all talked a lot for a couple of months and I thought I had become pretty good friends with them. But I can tell recently that they’ve become pretty disinterested in me. And I just don’t know why. 

I really try to make it a point to be true to myself and my personality when making friends or talking to anyone. But it seems that whenever I make friends,  they just fade away and passively remove themselves from my life. I don’t think I’m a bad person, I just don’t know what I’m doing wrong. 

But I still care so much for them. We had a lot of fun at one point. Got to know them pretty well and had a lot of conversations that were really enlightening. But they’re slowly removing themselves from my life. You know how you can just feel it sometimes? 

I just feel like a fucking puppy. I can’t stop caring for them despite their lack of care for myself. I just find it so hard to give up on people. How do I stop caring so much?",29Sep2020,1

228,"I'm a senior (17m) in highschool and I'm having a ton of trouble with school. I need someone who isn't me to try to understand my problem and how to solve it.
 
I'd like to say that I'm an above average student, around top 20% in my class, but I can't seem to focus in class or get my work. I know that what I'm doing is a terrible idea and I need to change, but I can't bring myself to do the necessary amount of work. I'm in higher level classes and I know I am fully capable of excelling, because when I get little spurts of motivation I do amazing. 

Whenever I'm in my classes I try to pay attention but I find everything so unimportant subconsciously that I just go all glaze donut and my mind wanders (I don't have ADD as I can focus on a lot of things outside of school). I don't find any of my classes particularly interesting but I know in my head that I need to focus and get my work done so I can be successful. 

It's just everytime that I need to finish an assignment, I either procrastinate as long as possible or end up not doing the work. I know this seems like senioritis at it's finest, but this has been an issue since I really had to start paying attention in classes (around 8th grade). 

To put it simply, I have no motivation to do well in school, but I know that I should do my best. How do I try to apply myself better?

229,"I know this seems like kind of a weird question, but honestly, i’m dead serious. 

I’ve grown up in a christian household, (I’m still a christian to this day.) and i was always taught that making out before marriage is a sin. I was told, “A simple kiss can lead to making out, making out can lead to sex, and sex before marriage is a sin.” which is personally understandable for me.

Due to growing up with that mindset, my plans for my own love life in the future, is dating someone PURELY for the sake of seeking out a spouse. But, in the midst of that relationship, i’ve decided that i don’t think a chaste kiss here and there will provoke me to have any sexual desires about that person. Nor do i think cuddling would have that effect. 

Let me get slightly back on track now. I’ve always been a huge daydreamer. I’d rather have my head in the clouds all day, mindlessly fantasizing about fictional worlds and characters, then be anywhere in real life. Normally i read a lot of fantasy books and such. 

I’m also huge romance lover, a real sucker for any book with a good romantic plot splashed in there somewhere. 
I’ve been that highly romantic person for as long as i can remember, so a lot of times i find myself making my own “persona,” to fit into whatever fantasy book i’m reading, and ship myself with whatever character i’m attracted to. That’s what causes my wild romantic fantasies for my own pleasure. I’ll imagine myself in a whole relationship with a specific character, and even though i wouldn’t make out with someone i’m dating in real life, i’ll often imagine myself having small make-out sessions with the fictional character. 

Now, i used to imagine my own characters that i’ve designed from scratch, (They have nothing to do with me, or my personas.) participating in sexual intercourse. (I never really imagined in full detail, cause i was always slightly embarrassed about it.) but i’ve stopped doing that completely. i also refrain from any thoughts of my personas, and fictional characters from books, or tv shows, participating in those sexual acts. I ONLY imagine them and me/my persona’s making out from time to time. But that still feels slightly wrong to me. 

I once read someone saying that, “Imagining a sin is the same thing as committing that sin.” So, if i personally believe that making out before marriage is a sin, is fantasizing about me/my persona’s making out with a fictional character a real sin i’m committing?",29Sep2020,1
230,"I don't even know where to start. I just turned 32. I'm back living at home. I've failed at everything I've attempted despite being told I'm so bright and smart.

I'm ""overqualified"" for minimum wage jobs I've applied for.

232,"not sure what advice anyone can give but if you've been through something similar it would be really great if you could give me some advice and how you went through with this :)

It's been seven months since I last attempted, which has been a while ago but I'm not sure why I have such a hard time moving on, or why I think about it so often. I haven't really felt the same way since, and just noticed that I'm a lot more apathetic and hollow. It's just harder for me to feel and life seems to feel gray. I've lost my drive for a lot of things in life afterwards and overall just find it harder to go through the motions. Even more odd, after I tried to go through with it and failed to do so, it was like something clicked and I kinda stopped feeling extremely depressed and felt fine and happy for a while until a month after. 

I guess I never felt so emotionally traumatized before and I can't stop reliving that day and remembering how I felt. Especially since it was the past, I'm lost on how I should feel and whether or not this is unhealthy.  I never really talked to anyone about this in depth either.

sorry if this is a double post btw hehe. I've looked around for a while and couldn't find anything on this topic, and am unsure if this belongs in r/depression since I don't believe I feel depressed.

234,"Until a few years ago, we lived a very lower middle class life. We were not extremely poor, but we did live paycheck to paycheck and had very little to spare for non essential uses. Our first child, Margo, didn't have a lot growing up. We definitely fed her good healthy food and ensured she had good clean clothes and all the books she needs, but not much else. Recently, my husband's aunt passed away. She is a very wealthy woman who never married and never had any kids, she raised my husband while his mom was shooting up drugs and ruining her life, and loved his as her own. She was very wealthy, and in her will, she left her entire estate and everything she had to my husband. Within a short span of time, we were suddenly much richer, and probably never have to worry about money again if we are careful with this inheritance. 

&amp;#x200B;

This all happened last year, when Margo was 14. Now she is 15, and we told her she just needs to get into college and we will pay for it, and she is more than happy about it. Our younger one, Julie, is 10, and she is living a much more comfortable life than Margo did. She has her own phone and laptop, which is actually for her online classes but she uses it whenever needed. Margo says its ridiculous that she has one, since she never did. We splurge on food from good places more now, and Margo always tries to take Julie's food away saying she didn't get to have it so Julie shouldn't either. Julie has a lot more toys, clothes and things than Margo ever did, but we also told Margo that we will buy whatever she will ever need. We bought her a car and new phone but she is still so bitter. She thinks that we should be giving Julie only what she had, that we are favoring Julie over her and she is convinced we don't love her as we are giving Julie a much better quality life. 

&amp;#x200B;

We have also been planning to move Julie to a different, more expensive and private school, and told Margo she can move as well. She refused, saying all her friends are in the public school and that if we move Julie, who is more than willing, we are telling her that we don't love her and that she is the black sheep of the family. We tried to talk to her about it and tell her that isn't true at all, but she is convinced we never loved her. I don't know what to do. I'm scared I am alienating Margo, she isn't seeing reason.

235,"Ever since I was young, the words gifted have just been thrown around. Somewhere down the line I slowly started to stop caring. Little by little, I stopped doing homework, stopped paying attention in class and so on. I stopped trying, I really did. I guess I never had someone who believed in me, who encouraged me to do well, it felt like it was me against the world. I honestly stopped trying. The fire in me which is curiosity dimmed down. Eventually it was extinguished. I stopped answering questions. Sometime in my elementary days I realized that I felt angry if someone knew the answer to which I didn't, which happened rarely. I realized I probably made others feel stupid, and little me thought that others probably have this resent towards me. I am currently a junior in high school. I am writing this because I am at a crossroad. I have a 1.5 gpa, you probably would call me stupid. Everyone had given up on me since like 6th grade. Only recently did I find someone who hadn't given up on me, someone who wanted me to succeed and face my fear of not living up to my potential. I went from not trying since like 6th grade, to wanting to try now, as a junior in high school. And only when I started trying did the dreaded words start being used again. I even had my vice principal pull me out of class to discuss my extremely high assessment test scores, I even got a letter of recognition, apparently it is something called a gifted identification letter or something (scoring 95% or better) for my MAP scores. I blew a cover that I was trying to maintain. I am disappointed in myself. I am a failure. I realize that I honestly could've done so much more if I had put my mind to it. My thirst for knowledge has come back, I now just want to learn and learn and learn. I guess everything has always been easy. Never had to study a day in my life up until now, even now I still don't try. Everything comes easy to me, I could honestly pick up some random mathematics book and read through it in a couple days and understand it fully, you know, the basic gifted kid shtick. I never wanted to try something that was challenging when others forced me, because I was scared of not performing to what they expected. But I am over this fear now but I fear I am too late. I have a 1.5 GPA, it is honestly so depressing seeing that. I could easily have gotten straight A's my entire academic career, gotten a 35 or something on my ACT and gone to Harvard and gotten a PhD in physics or what ever, maybe even have made a breakthrough in some unexplored mathematical concept and maybe in 50-100 years from now maybe someone would've read my published papers and would've called me a genius, and those publishing's would've gone on to pioneer other mathematical concepts in out futile pursuit of knowledge.

236,"So I (19f) have been in therapy since I was 14. For the most part this has been unsuccessful in helping me make any major progress. Out of maybe 10 therapists/ programs I've tried, only around 3 have worked for me. Unfortunately most of these programs/ therapists have based on age range or fixed time periods, so every time I did find someone helpful, I had to leave before I really got anywhere. 

The therapist I'm seeing now is okay. He's not actively mean, and I haven't had any terrible experiences with him as I have with some of the others. However, he doesn't really listen to what I say, and as a result I don't trust him enough to tell him about the biggest issues I really need help with. I have opened up to him about some things but he hasn't really been helpful, and brushes past them pretty quickly. I've been seeing him for a few months by this point. 

I'm considering either trying my luck with another therapist, continuing with him and hoping for the best, or just giving up on therapy entirely. 

Maybe I'm the problem, because it feels like I'm just being too picky. After years of therapy, if it's mostly been unhelpful, then maybe it's just not meant for me.

240,"
A quick backstory, I met this guy thru Instagram, he  seemed like a nice guy and I could tell he didn’t have many friends and was struggling w a lot. I’m naturally drawn to people who I think are in need so we got “close” fairly quickly (big lesson learnedly.) 

As time went on the more needy he became and I started noticing some red flags. He started acting strangely and when I asked him abt it he admitted to developing feelings for me. I brushed it off but told him we should probably keep some distance so he can get his head straight. Which obvi didn’t do anything, he became more and more obsessed and after several convos, both via text and over the phone I stopped replying to him and removed him from all social media.

I assume he got the idea for awhile but when he realized I wasn’t coming back the texts increased, first guilt tripping then increasingly aggressive. This was over the course of several months (sporadically) until it finally stopped for some time. Then I soon figured out he was creating various accounts to try following me on social media again- then having his now friends ask to follow as well, which I think is somehow even more creepy. 

Here’s the thing, it’s been OVER a YEAR since I last had contact w him and told him to stop contacting me. I haven’t replied to the first text, call, or follow request until the last few weeks where I finally blocked his number and all accounts (friends included) attempting to follow me on social media. Tonight I received a phone call from an anonymous number and then a voicemail w a rather change of tone, almost threatening. He hasn’t physically threatened me yet but I’m afraid he might try to “out” me if anything to my family somehow (as he mentioned doing to someone before, which is when I knew he was officially crazy) I don’t know what to do. I want to call him and go off so badly but several friends have said the best thing to do is keep ignoring",29Sep2020,1
241,"Hello, I’m a 16 year old female and I really need some advice. My best friend is suffering from depression and I want to be able to help her but I don’t know how. I’ve know her since we were elementary schoolers and we’ve been best friends since. I love her so much and I care for her very deeply. About two year ago in the 9th grade, I started to notice a lot of changes in her behavior. She used to be a very happy go lucky person who was bright eyed for the future but that was no longer the case anymore. She started limiting her time with people and became secluded. She gave short responses to texts and didn’t talk as much as she used to. She also stopped doing a lot of the things that she loved doing as well like writing, playing the violin, calligraphy, etc. In about December of 2019, she had told me she went to doctor with her parents and she was diagnosed with depression that month. Ever since then I’ve stuck by her side harder to make sure she knew I’d always be there for her. Sometimes there are days where she’s as happy as she can be and others where she wasn’t feeling so great. 10th grade was not the best year for her because she had gotten into a relationship and things did not go well for her. She was also suffering from a lot of body issues during that time. We are now Juniors and things have not gotten much better. I know she is going to a therapist and has anti depressants but is throwing them away. She also has a new boyfriend and they seem very happy together. Everyday I always make sure to check on her via texting (because we cannot see each other in person) and always let her know how much she means the world to me. Today I am writing this here because she had relapsed. I talked to her through it and wrote about how much I cared about her and love her a lot and that she is not a disappointment because I know she’s feeling that way.

242,"Ok so it’s complicated asf but in a nutshell, we were friends for about 2 years, one day he got really really depressed, as always, I was there for him day and night, fed him, fought off his chain of command (military) so he wouldn’t get In trouble etc. 

Well, about a week and a half into this he stopped talking to me. Like up to that point I had been the only person he’d talk to but around the 2 week mark he started talking to people and still didn’t talk to me. Hasn’t ever since. 

I’ve used countless amount of hours trying to figure out why or just be there for him (while he was still depressed) and nope nothing. Initially, my own mental health went down the drain. Not just that but I was also going through shit and couldn’t do anything because I was too busy taking care of others. Idfk. At this point it’s been about a month? Since then and I’m right about done. Like I no shit deeply care about him but at the same time, he doesn’t want my help and there’s nothing I can do about it. 

Anywho, tomorrow is his bday. He doesn’t wanna do anything so I was thinking, when I get off work go get him some food from this local shop that’s really good. I know he hasn’t tried it which amazes me. I also got him a gaming mouse, he drink energy drinks like water so I got him a 10 pack. Likes skittles so I got him one of those big bags of em, 2 packets of his rank chevrons, and I was gonna get him a 75buck gift card for papa Johns since he eats that shit almsot every day but I’ve been busy asf so think I’ll just give him the cash. 

Since he’s not talking to me I’m thinking just coming in, drop the stuff off and leave. Leave a little index card, “happy bday fucker (shh that’s how we talk(Ed) to each other), before I can be there for you I have to take care of myself. You’ve already demonstrated countless times you don’t want my self and there’s nothing I can do. For the record though, I should at least know why”

Is that too “deep”? Initially I was thinking just “happy bday” but with time he’d be like “huh wonder whatever happened to that one guy who claimed he’d be here for me” Idfk maybe I’m just overthinking it but yeah it’s been a few days since I stopped trying and not planning on trying anymore unless he literally tells me to",29Sep2020,1
243,"Maybe I’m being overreactive but hear me out. 

I’m 21, and I’m not gonna lie, I smoked with him on occasion about a couple months ago. But back then he wasn’t smoking nearly as much, and I would only do it when I was feeling anxious. I was going through a rough time in my life so I just felt like I needed that. I thought he was doing the same thing. 

Time went by, I went through a lot of stuff and started to see things differently. I lost a lot of my anxiety, stop smoking weed because I was paranoid of being caught and I didn’t like smoking smoke in general. To be honest I didn’t care if he did it, and my Mother was much more angry about it compared to me. Especially because he would smoke outside in the backyard. She realized he would find a way to get more, so she told him to at least not smoke it on her property. It got worse. Way worse. He has been smoking everyday, 3 bowls a day, hanging out with friends and smoking blunts, and he has completely ignored my mothers request and keeps his weed in the bushes and smokes outside while she’s at work, or at night. He even smoked in his fucking room several times. My Mom tried taking his Xbox because when he’s not smoking, he’s on that, and he got really violent, started screaming, and went through a tug of war over it. 

He got it back. She never punished him. She has been completely submissive to him. I asked her if she was gonna do anything about it, and she said, “If you don’t like the way I parent keep it to yourself” and on another day, “My kids own this house I guess”. She’s completely defensive and at the same time submissive. She got a puppy about a month ago, and today I went outside and guess what? The puppy found his weed bag and was in it. That was the last fucking straw. I told my Mom if she won’t throw it away I will. So I did, and I guess she told my brother or something because he was pissed and threatening me. 

I think the main thing that pisses me off here is his complete lack of respect for my mother, and the fact that he knows she’s too pussy to punish him. She bluffs ALL THE TIME. And when she actually does something he looses his shit and gets her to back off. He’s become a little shit and I’m done. And just for that, part of me wants to call the cops and report him for smoking just to teach him a lesson. Problem is, I’m worried he’ll tell the cops I used to smoke weed with him, but can he actually get me in trouble over an accusation? Which is all it would be. And I can’t report it anonymously because he would know. I just don’t know what to do here. I’m so sick of my Mother being submissive towards him and not being a parent, and I’m sick of him being a fucking shithead.


Please don’t comment shit like, “Oh he’ll be fine, you need to mind your own business” or “Oh let your Mom parent” because my Mom isn’t parenting at all. No mother should give in to their child. And given all the shit he’s done recently, I really don’t think weed is doing him any good.",29Sep2020,1
244,"My dog is well trained. We’ve been training him since we adopted him at 4 months old. 
He does well. We crate trained him because he had separation anxiety and would destroy the house or hurt himself while we were at work. So for a while we just put him in the kennel. 

Now he is finally able to be out for long periods of time without destroying the house or getting into things. 
We give him long walks, I run with him once or twice a week. Take him to the dog park twice a week. Play with him every night. Give him good treats for his supplement meds. Also to help digestion. We feed him twice a day. 
We always follow up on commands and keep training.

However the past few days have been so weird. 
We have no idea why he is misbehaving all of a sudden. He isn’t listening like he used to. 
We’ve trained him to ask us for many things like pointing us to his leash or food when he wants it or telling us he needs to use the restroom besides our daily walks. He hasn’t been having any accidents.

The main issue is he’s stealing food from us and our cat. Like not aggressively or anything but he just walks up to you and steals food out of the cats mouth or out of our hands even at the table. He hasn’t done this since he was a puppy. So his behavior is very odd. He asks to come up on the bed or couch before just jumping up. Just because he knows sometimes we don’t want him up with us. However he doesn’t ask anymore. Almost like he’s just given up and just does whatever he wants. All I can think is that the change in him being free to roam while we are at work has given him chances to steal food or do things he isn’t allowed to do while we are home. So now that we are home we are just catching him doing things he now thinks is okay because he doesn’t get in trouble just due to us not being home. 

I really don’t know why he is doing all this randomly. We give him lots of attention, food, exercise and tons of comfy places to sleep. We give him dog treats too. I don’t understand why he is now stealing food from us and the cats bowl when he never did before. Or why he is jumping up on the bed or couch when we tell him no. Sometimes we just don’t want to sleep with him. He is also getting really bad about taking things and hiding them. Like clothes, shoes, hair ties. 

Please help! Any ideas on what we should try? I looked online for answers with not much to go on. Thanks for taking the time to read!",29Sep2020,1

246,"So let start out with some history. I’m (f29) and married to (m30) we have 2 kids (2m&amp;4f). We were living 2 hours from my parents in July, when ran into trouble with money due to covid. During that time, my father (56) was diagnosed with stage 4 pancreatic cancer. So we moved into my parents house (3 bedrooms) to help each other out. 

We seemed to have caught at the crosshairs where we both needed help, and it seem like the only logical thing to do. My father, as much as he wants to help, seems very unsettled having to deal with my 2 loud young children who never leave the house because of Covid. I am also hiding my cat upstairs where he doesn’t go, because he doesn’t like cats, and thinks I got rid of her in the move. 

So my husband and I applied for an apartment 10 minutes away, shortly after moving, and were recently accepted to move in October 24. It’s just a lot moving so far, having all of our stuff in storage, changing jobs, losing privacy, having 2 young kids around a home not suited or baby proofed for them, and having to tread around family like a teenager again when I’m in my late 20s with my own family. We want to be close by, but in our own space.

Only problem is, I haven’t told them about us moving yet, and I have to have things situated in 3 weeks. My dying father is relying on me heavily to take care of my financially dependent mother. This house is paid off, and she has some savings, but his medical costs are depleting them quickly, and it hasn’t been long enough for them to receive any ssdi money yet, and my father was a provider his whole life. My mother has zero interest in staying in a home they’ve built and lived in the last 30 years because she doesn’t want to be reminded of him around every corner. My mother also will not be happy to hear I’ll be leaving because my children are definitely the only light she has in her life right now.

Tonight my father was sobbing because he says his intuition is telling him he doesn’t have much time left...I’m definitely on his side. I believe he’s right, and I believe people definitely can feel that. So now I have to decide if I want to move out and risk him dying in the near future and I won’t be around to take care of my mother financially, because I’ll be in a 1 year lease. Or just contacting the place and telling them I’m not going to be moving in, and give up that taste of normalcy I’ve been craving since this all began.

So do I stay here, regardless of what I want? Or do I move, and risk having my father pass shortly there after?",29Sep2020,1

the hookup was fun and good, to be honest i just wanted to fuck someone because it was my birthday weekend and ive been in a dry spell. anyways, we did not end up having sex because of ~drunk complications~ but he spent the night. the next day was my birthday and when i went out i saw him at a party and again i was super drunk and do not really remember the conversation but we left the party and went back to my room again and did have sex for a little bit and he spent the night again. 

the problem is that he was talking about this other girl the whole time. hes like obsessed with her and would not stop talking about her while i was naked in my bed with him. i asked him to stop and he apologized but like he was going on and on about how shes so attractive and they have so much in common and he was super sad that he simped for her and shes been ignoring him ever since they had sex. it was really weird to me that he would say that stuff in front of me. 

anyways. i dont wanna have sex with ANOTHER person because i dont want people saying things about me. but hes so obviously into this girl and im wondering if its a lost cause. he texted me and apologized and told me he was done with her but i dont know if i believe that based on the things he said the other night. 

i dont know if i should give up or try to slowly get him to chase me. i have a method that has worked in the past but idk if that will work because i already had sex with him. usually i stop reaching out to them and flirt with them A LITTLE bit when im with them but mostly flirt with other people where he can see it. and then basically just live my best life and usually guys will come around. 

is it possible he would come around? or will he only see me as a body because i already had sex with him?",29Sep2020,1

254,"I'll preface this with the fact that my grandfather suffers from severe dementia; he has a very hard time forming recent memories and consequently is difficult to accommodate. He is also hard of hearing and refuses to wear hearing aids. We need to shout to communicate.

My grandfather is from a foreign country and has recently moved in with us, due to my grandmother's passing. My grandmother was his primary caretaker, and her absence has left my mother in worry for his safety, as he is very able-bodied and likes to go outside. But, back in his country he constantly gets lost due to his dementia, and wastes a large portion of his retirement money on taxi fares home. Back home, our extended family is unable to care for him. Consequently, my mother decided that:

\- he will be safer in our country than his own

\- since he is cut-off from his bank, he cannot waste his money or cause disturbances in banks for money

\-we have more time to take care of him as a family

&amp;#x200B;

However, since his arrival, things have been a steady state of chaos and stress- me, my sister, and especially my mom. My grandfather sleeps only for hours at a time and wakes up not knowing where he is (due to his dementia). Then, he would proceed to open all the doors to our rooms and ask where he is, who we are, why he can’t go home (his home country), and a number of similar questions that usually end up making him angry. He constantly rearranges our household furniture which wouldn’t be a problem if he didn’t also misplace things that are important to the family. My grandfather also asks where his wife is, which is difficult to answer as my mother is still in the grieving process- to constantly have to tell him and to describe how she passed is incredibly straining for her wellbeing. The combination of these questions are asked throughout various periods of the night, rendering a full nights sleep impossible. My mom has to talk him down a few times a night for at least half an hour, as he tends to forget whatever happens.

&amp;#x200B;

His dementia also prevents him from understanding we are currently in the middle of a pandemic and has actually been brought home by authorities for not wearing a mask and causing disturbances in public because they won’t allow him inside. As much as we want to take care of him, it’s exhausting and I don’t believe we are fit to take care of him. My younger sister is in middle school, I am in university and have a part time job, and my mother works full time in one job, and holds a casual position in 2 other places. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've asked my mom to put him in an assisted living place, but she is against it because he does not speak English and is prone to aggression when angry. My mother doesn't want him to be confused all the time, but I'm concerned for her physical and mental wellbeing if he doesn't. And if he doesn't, then I'm at a loss for what to do.

I’ve always despised zoom meetings and just not being in a classroom, but I still try my best to turn in all my assignments and attend all my meetings. Unfortunately, I am failing almost all my classes. I do horrible on most of my tests and usually find myself not understanding my homework. 

I’m even doing awful in math, which I say surprised because I’ve always excelled in my math classes, especially last year when I was the top 3 in all my math teachers classes and I would even help other classmates understand their work. But as of right now, I have a 30 something percent in my math class and I can’t even finish some assignments because I literally cannot make sense of it. I watch many youtube videos which do help, but it doesn’t cover every type of question of my assignments. 

Because of these grades I got both my counselors constantly calling my mom and leaving voicemails. Which obviously leaves my mom mad at me and always bothering me about my work. Eventually, one of my counselors wanted to talk on the phone with me about my grades, so I told her how I was struggling because of distance learning, yet all she did was send me a schedule showing me when to join zoom meetings.

My siblings and I all look exactly like my dad and his side of the family, but some of us got our moms skin that won't tan well. I can speak fluent spanish though I have a hard time reading and writing it. I did grow up in the US. Went to a mostly white school and lived in a mixed community but my dad made damn sure that we knew about our family and culture. He would take us to a near by mexican community almost everyday to visit his friends and a lot of the community is still a part of my life today.

Unfortunately my grandparents and some of our aunts and uncles don't have the same thoughts. I grew up visiting my dad's family where they would literally reject us because our mom was white. They would tell us were not a part of that family and caused fights with dad because he would bring us along to family events. Tell him his first wife who was mexican was better and so on. Vise versa, my mom's side of the family would literally talk about how Mexicans and Hispanic were all naturally criminals and how they ""just rape and steal""  then point out how we were half mexican. This is something I grew up with and honestly realize it pretty quickly and hated it. (There's family that isn't like that but it's crazy that there is.)

Before I begin, I just want to say I am not trying to garner sympathy or have a pity party.

And don’t ask me to get help either.(because that is just not going to happen.)

With that being said. I have been suffering from medically induced suicidal ideation(anti-convulsant(s) since 2013. For the longest time my thoughts were(or at least I thought so) under control. Every time something negative would pop-up.I would think nothing of it. During this point in time I even made a few rave friends  and we would rountinely talk with each other.That is until about nine months ago. when I had a temporal lobectomy. After the surgery I became increasingly more withdrawn and depressed.i slowly began to lose touch and disconnected with my Snapchat group.(partly due to not being able to take feel good drugs with them. Due to the synapses reforming) the other due to my own feelings of paranoia,inadequacy and distrust.the people who I dated either faded outor lost interest. The people who I hooked up with were mediocre at best. Leaving my needs unfulfilled and ultimately sexually frustrated. Despite all this, I wore a mask everyday to prevent my family and friends from knowing how I truly feel(mainly because, I don’t want some two-bit hack of a doctor  committing me, virtue signaling and  talking to me in a condescending manner. All while  giving me an MAOI or lithium,or for that matter any drug that messes with the 5-ht2c receptor.)

I asked him for my copy of the book which was behind him, so I could find the page and follow along, and he said “No.” in a weird tone, like he was like, happy to be saying it, like how a toddler says no when you say something. 

I was not expecting him to say no to my request for him to fucking hand me MY book so I got up and said “fine I’ll get it myself.” And then he said “alright alright here” and handed it to me. We kept reading but that felt really weird to me.

After we were done reading I was pretty upset still and he said the reason he didn’t want to give me the book was because he felt like I didn’t think he was capable of reading it and was going to be “babysitting” him.

Idk, it feels really weird to have someone withhold something from you when you ask and it is yours when you’re asking as a favor.

I didn’t really start pushing for one till late last year when I found a stray kitten at the grocery store I work at. We didn’t want her to risk getting hit by cars. At first she was clawing till I wrapped her in my jacket and feed her and gave her food and after that She clung to me and wouldn’t let go. I asked my parents can I keep her, My mom told me to ask my dad and he said no. Fortunately one of my coworkers were able to take her. I really liked her and I like to think she liked me too. Fast forward to last week Monday after my birthday my dad tells me I can have a cat. I was excited I was hoping for a cat  to hold and and love like I did with my backyard cat . I wasn’t expecting to be disappointed . on Friday I went to a pet supermarket to adopt and I adopted a 4 month old female kitten. She  was in the back of her cage and scared which I thought was cause she was in the shelter for so long. When we got home I opened the cardboard pet carrier she was in and she stay in there till I tried to pick her up then she ran and hide under my bed. I had to bring her to her room cause cat owners say they need a room to themselves to get acclimated. After running around my room I catch her and put her in the living room. She’s been there since and doesn’t explore till night time. I’ve tried feeding her she only eats once I’m away same with treats. She hides behind the computer and sometimes I try to pet her. She always backs up. My fingers make contact but she’s behind so much cords that I can only use a finger. She likes chin scratches but everytime I approach her she backs away. I’ve met friendlier strays and I feel like sending her back and maybe getting another kitten but idk. Some people say give her time, my gf told her pick her up by force cause that’s what worked her her cat but I don’t know what to do. It’s been bumming me out cause I’ve been looking forward to having a feline friend but it seems like I’m just a food guy for this cat and I feel like sending her back and trying another one would be the best decision. I’d really like help.

Ig TLDR: wanted feline friend got the complete opposite and want a redo.",29Sep2020,1
267,"My partner and I have recently become sexually active after dating for 3 months. We've had sex together about ten times and I've noticed some odd behaviors that I have never experienced with a girl before and don't know if I am doing something wrong:  


\- shes very quiet. Like eerily quiet. I've stopped several times to ask if she wants to stop because she just seems like she's not enjoying it. It's weird because during foreplay she's quiet, but I can tell she's enjoying it. When we're actually having sex, I just can't read her.  


\- along the same lines, she doesn't move. Unless we change positions or I ask her something, she just lays there and usually just holds onto the sheets.  


\- she always goes to the bathroom to get dressed immediately after. Even if we're just cuddling, she goes to the bathroom and gets dressed and then comes back.  


\- I'm someone who is super cautious when it comes to consent, especially with her. I ask if things are ok before proceeding to avoid making anyone uncomfortable. I know it probably sounds weird, but I've had multiple girls take the out before. Because shes so hard to read, I usually ask while changing positions if she's still good and she says yes. She always says yes, but it doesn't seem like she really wants to be so the other night I stopped and said that I think we should stop because she's clearly not having a good time and she got upset  and kept saying she was.  


\- other more minor odd behaviors are that she doesn't make eye contact, she shakes like she's cold, but whenever I ask if she's cold she says she's fine, she's never cum during sex or if she has I cant tell, her expression is completely unreadable.  


I have tried talking to her about it and every time she just shrugs and says she enjoys it, but it's clear that she is not.  


The other night, I was behind her for about ten-ish mins before I came and when I grabbed her a towel I realized she was crying and when I asked her what was wrong she said that she told me to stop three times. I honestly didn't hear her and I explained that to her, but I still feel awful for it.  


I don't know what to do really or what's wrong with her. I do really like this girl and we were good friends before we started dating. I just want to help, but I dont know how.",29Sep2020,1
268,I wanna move to London. I live in Texas. I’m bored of it here.,29Sep2020,1
269,"This is long, I’ll try to sum it up in a TLDR below.
I’m a depressed 20 year old college student currently home because of covid. I started a job at this chill seasonal place in my local mall. It’s a 30-40 minute drive and because I am unable to drive I depend on my mother to take me, so I have to make sure I work around her schedule. (I would get an Uber but it would literally eat up my entire savings which.. I now have none.)
I’ve been paying my own bills but now I need a job so I went out and busted my ass and finally got one.
I started working there on the 9th (9/9/2020) and it was cool. I worked four days straight, about 19 hours and 49 minutes. Not a lot I know but I’m really proud of myself.
So that first week was stocking, opening the store. Now it’s finally opening week! I wait every day, waiting to even receive a schedule or some kind of text asking me to come in. Nothing. I DID tell him that I wasn’t available for a doctors appointment on Thursday, but every other day was fine. But I still got nothing.
Finally Saturday morning I get texted about working a four hour shift on Sunday(9/20/2020)
I say okay! Cool, I’m happy to work!
I go, I work. So now I’ve got 23 hours and 49 minutes under my belt and I’m excited to work more! I asked about the schedule, my boss said he didn’t have one yet. He says he’s working on it. He says he’ll text me when he needs me. I’m like okay.
I wait for an entire week. Nothing. Again, he texts me Saturday morning(9/26/2020) to work Sunday (27th) I say cool! But I had a bad feeling, I was getting sick.
My throat started to hurt, my sinuses got congested and over night I got hit by a massive cold and had to text him and say I can’t come in. He was okay with it, understanding.
But then I realized something. I was supposed to get paid on Friday 9/25/2020. Everyone had been told we would be paid Friday the 25th so I was waiting and waiting but there was no direct deposit. There was no check in the mail. I called my boss and asked if I need to pick a check up at the store and he said nope, it should be direct deposit. I told him it wasn’t there and he was like “oh the company messed some stuff up, Most people got there’s after a wait but I’ll call HR later.” And I never got anything back. Now it’s Monday.
So now I’m sitting here thinking about things. I can’t drive myself, I can’t pay for an Uber or taxi. No one at work is friends with me yet and even if they were they don’t want to drive 40 minutes out of their way to come get me for a 4 hour shift. I have doctors appointments, trying to make therapy appointments, important things (I might have a heart issue and MAY need surgeries) And I need to start getting ready for college in spring.
Oh and I’m kinda depressed.
I’ve only just started making my bed again. I’m still trying to just wake up at 10AM! I’m overwhelmed!
I’m not sure if I can actually keep this job. I can’t tell if it’s actually a good idea. I try to talk to my parents, I try to talk to my sister but they all think I’m making excuses and trying to find an out.
I don’t want an out, I want to work. I want a job.

TLDR: Lots of problems keep popping up and I have yet to be paid for my work that I have done I’ve been told no reason other then “the company messed up” so now I’ve gone negative in my bank account and Im struggling on how to get to work when my mother can’t drive me. Uber cost 23 $ a ride. My pay is 9 an hour. I can only work 4 hours.

Sorry if this is confusing, I’m still sick and feeling a lot of emotions. I’m sad, feel like shit and stressed because of this. Any advice is helpful.",29Sep2020,1
270,"Not sure if this is the place to post this I'd not please tell me.  Still shaking 

So I get off of work and was going to hang out with one of my three roommates who was on something we didn't know what, he was being very slow and confused and beyond clumsy. I went outside to smoke a cigarette and by the time I got back he was passed out and looked like he wasn't breathing I called my other roomate upstairs to help while we tried to wake him up and I checked his pulse it was a little fast but normal. Throughout the night I had been keeping an eye on him to make sure he was ok even though I had to work early in the morning. I was relaying info to other roomie to let him know he was starting to get better but was still not ok. Roomie told me he had heard him opening prescription bottles frequently which scared us even more. And roomate finally had enough of it and confronted him he was saying that all we ever do is talk about him behind his back and that I was worst of all (I never use his name in anyone elses convos unless it's positive) but he then threatened to kill everyone that lives here for disrespecting him like that even though the only thing we wanted was to make sure he was ok. I even made him some light food to see if maybe that's help him out some which it had seemed to so I went to bed. 

I'm not sure what to do our fourth roomate is missing and not answering his phone and I'm having a panic attack because I don't like yelling (thanks mom and step dad).

For context, almost 3 years ago I was very unstable mentally. I started screwing around with some guys and my mom found out and became incredibly angry and distrusting of me. Since then, she's held a grudge against me and been sort of passive aggressive. I understood her concerns though, and have ceased engaging in such relationships to focus on myself. 

Tonight I was sitting on my laptop in a sports bra just playing an MMO. (not conversing with anyone or anything.) My mother came downstairs and became irate, accusing me of whoring myself out and hit me, dug her nails into my skin hard enough to leave multiple welts, and berated me. I tried to explain to her that nothing was happening and that I was only hot, but she didn't have it. 

She then called me upstairs and basically told me it was all my fault that I got hit, and mocked me for crying. And that I should know better.

I don't know what to think. Maybe I should have known better, but I'm scared and feeling incredibly alone. I can't talk to her. I don't have anywhere to go or anyone to speak to. And I'm honestly just feeling confused and broken down.

277,"So I've been dating my boyfriend for a year now and the last few months have been anything but ideal. Recently I've figured out how different we really are and I've been thinking about how he doesn't seem to value my opinion on anything. And don't get me started on his mother (one of the most two faced and disrespectful people I have met). I feel like he isn't good for me but I really don't want to leave. The last two months, he's made a point to complain about masks &amp; people who share my political views every chance he gets and I know it started after hearing his mom do it. They're both convinced that their deviated septums are enough of a medical excuse if anyone asks them to put on a mask despite the fact that both of them are mouth breathers. My boyfriend picked multiple fights over masks claiming I was trying to force him and people like him to wear a mask (I've never told him to wear a mask, only asked) and in one of those arguments, I did an experiment. I brought up a thing that happens sometimes in couple's therapy where each person gets three minutes to talk and the other person is only allowed to listen. He wouldn't take his turn first (after me listening to him almost nonstop for thirty minutes) and I made it 30 seconds talking about our issues and how he doesn't listen to me before he laughed at me and rolled his eyes. At the two minute mark he cut me off and went on a rant about how I was avoiding the issue and how I always avoid the issue (but when I asked what his issue was, he couldn't come up with anything). He's tried telling me I'm always trying to censor him but I haven't tried to censor him over anything. Heck I even unfollowed him on Facebook so I wouldn't have to see the things he finds funny that absolutely disgust me (like pictures making fun of how the men Kyle Rittenhouse killed died (I don't care what the men were, I've always held the belief that you don't disrespect or make fun of the dead and I had previously told my boyfriend that)). If I ask him how I'm trying to censor him, his answer is almost always something along the lines of me not agreeing with him being how I'm sensoring him meanwhile he actually puts effort into making it where I won't be comfortable/can't actually express my opinions and beliefs. And I know some of his behavior is abusive and plenty of people want me to leave but I don't want to leave him and I'm not sure what to do anymore. We got a place together not too long ago and he's always had the habit of self sabotaging whenever something goes good in his life and I know he started acting like this because things were going good. The last few weeks, he hasn't shown much interest in me at all unless he was horny or wanted to complain about liberals on twitter (not to mention he's a troll but that's a whole other rant).

I feel like no matter what I try, I'm not heard in my relationship but I can't bring myself to leave and I don't really want to leave. I'm not sure what I can do to feel better about any of this.",29Sep2020,1

279,"I got engaged about 1,5 years ago. The wedding was supposed to take place in April but got cancelled due to the virus. 

The new date is end of this year and me and my fiance would be so happy about it if it wasn't for one thing. 

About 18 years ago my parents split up in a really messy way. For my father it all started when he found out that my mother was cheating on him with another man. For my mother it all started 20 years ago when she found out that my dad violated my sisters privacy in a massive way. There was never any physical abuse, but the whole thing involved hidden cameras and you can pretty much guess what he did from that point alone. 

My mom found the tapes, was devastated but didn't tell a single person for 2 years. Only after my father caught her cheating she spilled the beans. That is why my father to this day claims that my mother forgave him and that she had no right to treat him like she did afterwards using a fleet of lawyers and publicly shaming him for what he did, including him loosing his house, his job and his friends (all of them, even his best friend). 

13 year old me didn't understand the full scope back then and kept on visiting him. I needed a father and my sister (who also only found out at the break up), kept crying when I wasn't looking. 

Me and my sister never had a really strong bond when I was 13 and she was 18. Sure, we were close, but we would only develop a somewhat stronger bond until we were 8 years older. 

My father was not there for us when we were little, and he never really caught up to that. He was always working because we earned little and if it wasn't for him working 70 hours every week, we would have lost the house already years ago. He managed to offer us nice holidays, plenty birthday and Christmas presents and  the feeling that we didn't lack anything at the expense of his relationship to my mother and of course his time with us. 

Back then I was starving for his attention and I was there for him in the time of the breakup even though I still lived at our house with my mother and sister. 

The breakup broke him. He became paranoid, filled with a lot of anger and overall very negative. He once told me that if it wasn't for me, he would have killed himself back then. 

How my sister felt about this whole thing was out of my scope at the time. I rarely saw her. She had a live of her own being 18 and soon moving out. 

I couldn't stand to watch my father suffer end even though he would later in life more than once be a total asshole to me for sharing my mothers last name and for continuing to live the majority of my life with her, I could never quiet shake the feeling that he too is just another victim of this whole mess that he and my mother brought onto themselves. 

My family moved on, the gossip in our small town got quieter, my sister moved 100 miles away and both of my parents eventually found new partners who they are together with ever since. 

Now my wedding comes closer and I have the same problem I had before April: My sister won't attend my wedding if my father shows up. She told this to me quietly but on the verge of tears. She was understanding and told me it would be okay and that she won't have hard feelings for me even though she admits she will never be able to understand me fully in this matter. 

My fiance came up with the idea to split the wedding into the wedding ceremony and the party, where my father would only attend the ceremony and my sister would come afterwards to the party when he left. 

When I told my father about this, I expected some sort of fightback under the idea that (from his perspective): ""Every celebration takes place with your mothers family, every holiday you spend with them, every major event you only invite her and her family."" (which is true). I expected him to want to be part of at least this major thing.  

Instead of being this often hot-tempered and negative person, he said ""I understand, and you don't feel bad about it. It's okay."" before I even started to present the idea of splitting the wedding. He expected to be not invited, which brought me back to feeling sorry for him in a split second. 

Now everything changed again. There won't be a celebration for the wedding because my fiance and me already got officially married in April because we wouldn't be offered another date for more than 2 years if we didn't do it then. 

So now, there will be no celebration. 

Another big issue here is that my grandmother, which is the only person of the paternal part of my family besides my father that is still alive. She was a lot like a mother for me. Where my father was missing in my childhood, she was there double. I love her a lot and but she, being 84 years old, never understood the side of my sister fully. She is from another generation and suffered abuse herself but she claims that after such a long time you need to be able to let the feelings of hatred down. Not forget and not forgive, but live with it and accept. 

Now I'm at the point where I don't know what to do again. It's either my sister or my father. Objectively I feel like this is a no-brainer and I don't know what to expect from Reddit but some words of encouragement or maybe just the possibility to talk about it. 

My fiance takes my sisters side on an emotional level but doesn't force me to do make a decision because of that. She told me she won't make the decision and won't be angry with me no matter what I decide on. 

So now I ask: what do you think about this? Is there any valid reason I can invite my father? Maybe I still can split the celebration and send my father and my grandmother away after some hours. It hurts though. I don't want this decision and I never asked for this mess that is my parent lives. 

I really don't know what to do.

This is a throwaway because said boyfriend is on here and I’m kind of embarrassed about this post. 

So my short background story is that my boyfriend and I recently graduated high school this year. He’s been my best friend for over two years now and we’ve been together for almost a year. I’m very confident in our relationship. He has been in the army for a few months already and we found out that he’s going to be stationed in Germany next year. 
The distance and 3hr time difference right now is difficult and him being in Germany would make it a 9 hour time difference and it would be nearly impossible to communicate. 
I really want to go with him to but I’m just not sure how to go about this. We’ve talked about marriage and it’s something we both want to do but my parents aren’t too keen on that.

———
For background: My parents have been married over twenty years, I am in high school and my brother is in middle school.
———

I guess it all started this past weekend, my dad let it slip that they've been attending therapy for a few months. At first I thought it was a joke because we were kind of joking around but I wasn't so sure so I just kind of laughed it off and we continued talking.

Part of the reason I thought he was joking was because I'm pretty close to my mom and I thought we told each other everything and she's been keeping this a secret from me for MONTHS. (I know it's none of my business but I would've just liked to know)

But yesterday I borrowed my mom's phone because I wanted to show her something, and keep in mind she puts EVERYTHING on her calendar, and low and behold my dad was right and their next appointment is tomorrow.

The past few days my dad has been hanging out with my brother and I a lot more then normal, he's normally busy or working on stuff around the house. I thought it was a little weird but I played along.

I didn't really see this coming because they've always sort of argued or snapped at each other a little bit over the past few years. (One of the recent factors being COVID, my mom's a germophobe and doesn't think my dad is doing enough to keep us safe while he's grocery shopping or coming home from work.)

Tonight I asked him if anything big was going to be happening in the future that I should know about (a divorce) and he kind of got quiet then laughed it off, saying the whole point of the future is that no one knows what's going to happen.

I know it's probably for the best and they'll be happier if they split up, but I just can't bare to see them with anyone else. I have anxiety, I'm clingy, and I don't like change. Pretty much a horrible combination to have right now.

I guess I just want to know what'll happen if they get a divorce, can anyone else relate to this? I don't have anyone to talk to in real life that would take this seriously, and I cant get a therapist to talk to without my parents knowing.

Another question I have, should I give my brother a heads up? As far as I know they haven't told him, but I don't them to sit us down and tell us they're taking a break and it completely surprises him.

I'm going to go to bed now because I have school in the morning, but I'll reply as soon as I can to anyone who replies.

Thank you ♥️",29Sep2020,1
289,"My younger sister, only by one year, just turned 18. And I suppose she felt as if she was an adult so that gave her the right to not tell any one where she would be, causing everyone to worry as it 12 in the morning. My mom called and called until finally there was an answer. Apperantly my sister got drunk, for the first time, and was at her boyfriends house. During the conversation she was yelling and telling them that they couldn't tell her what to do anymore because she was an adult. They asked for the boyfriends address so someone could take her home but she refused. 

Long story short, we ended up getting her and my mom and step dad had a talk with her the day after. She said she had no regrets, that was the funniest time she ever had, etc. Originally I thought they had taken her car away as punishment but my sister said something to my mom that made her feel guilty and fearful and thus not punishing her. My mom and stepfather feel ""blackmailed."" My mom does not want to punish my sister cause she thinks that will drive her out of the house while she is still in highschool. My step father however wants to punishe her but he fears my mom will leave him IF my sister chooses to leave, because she would see it as his fault that her daughter left. So really they don't know what to do. And honestly, I don't either. How do you punish someone who is technically considered an adult? Do you even punish them? If so, what are ways without pushing her out of the house?


DONT HAVE TO READ THIS, ONLY iF YOU WANT MORE INFO ON MY PARENTS PARENTING STYLE

I guess she felt throughout her whole intire highschool life that our parents were more strict then others. We had cefews, had to let them know where we are going, had to let them meet boyfriends before going on official dates, etc. My sister thought these were silly since other kids got to stay out later and didn't have to text or tell their parents where they were going. I also should mention that my step-father told me that he would have allowed me specifically to stay late or over other boys houses or whatever because I was an adult and acted like one. He also said since I wasn't in highschool and instead in college I was able to have more freedom and less rules then my sisters.

292,"it was recently pointed out to me by my boyfriend (he will likely see this post tomorrow, so know that i love you babe) that i cannot remember certain things. he'll bring something up specifically that he remembers, but i can't remember for the life of me. it makes me feel bad cause i want to remember everything i can when i'm with him and everything that we do together, but it's just not that simple. 

and it's not only with him, it's everything. he asked me if i could remember the details of saturday (it is monday right now) and i couldn't remember anything at first. obviously i dwelled on it throughout the day and little by little kept coming to me, but barely. it feels like all of these memories are running from me in my brain, just out of reach for me to grab. it is concerning me and it's kind of scary. i don't expect to remember every little thing, but for a whole day, only two days ago, to evade my mind, is scary. i've always had trouble remembering things, but i've never fixated on it as much as i am now.

i know the reasonable response would be for me to see a doctor if i'm as concerned about it as i seem. but the problem with that is that i live in america so i obviously have no healthcare benefits, and i make too little to pay out of pocket.

i guess i'm just writing this to see if anyone has any ideas on how to remember things. i already write important dates down, but i'm thinking of making a calendar on my phone and logging everything. it's just really bothering me now and i can't shake the anxious feeling i have surrounding it",29Sep2020,1

297,"First of all, thanks for reading this, kind strangers. Secondly, buckle up because this is a long one.
I'm currently 21 years old, about to hit 22 if that matters. Summer of 2018, I admitted to my parents that I had failed out of university. I hadn't been attending class and after seeking help, I was diagnosed with mild depression as well as an adjustment disorder. The doctor at the time also warned that my resilience was low and the wrong event could tip that mild depression into severe. After the news of my failing and new diagnosis, instead of returning to school, I stayed at home with my parents. They were coming to terms with everything including the fact that the money they had spent on my university had been wasted. Within a couple of months, I was on speaking with a counsellor regularly. During this I brought up the general unhappiness I had regarding my parents. Now, my entire life, my parents have been relatively fine. I used to hate complaining because they weren't abusive or neglectful or separated or horrible in any real way. So I always felt like I was exaggerating things. However, my father has always had the attitude of ""jump when I say jump."" To this day, he rarely asks for help rather than demanding something be done. Both of my parents, in my opinion, are always quick to find flaws in things. For example; I work at a grocery store as a cashier. I work 24 hours per week. They both insist I need a full time job which I understand is important but I currently lack the ambition and motivation to seek one out. Today I didn't work. Instead, I sad woken up at 8am and pushed over 3 hours to stay up and go work outside (we live on a farm). Around 11am,i finally made my way outside. I worked until 6pm, with only one project not getting completed fully due to me not putting in maximum effort. My father worked inside before coming out to work at 130pm. At this point he had gotten home from another job and only had 1.5 hours of sleep before getting up at 8 to begin working inside. The job he was doing inside is more for fun than anything. We are not really hurting for money. Anyways, hearing I had not fully completed one of the projects had him furious and insisting I be up the next day and finishing the hour or so left of work before going to my job to work 10-630. Moments earlier he had told my mother that him and I had a good day, which I agreed we had. I have been paying $500/month rent on top of regularly putting in hours of work on the farm. I'm almost 22. Am I crazy here? Is it me? I appreciate any and all advice on what to do /where to go from here. According to both parents, due to my depression, I'm ""in no state to move out."" thanks again for reading. Feel free to ask questions. I'm sure I've missed stuff but this is just off the top of my head.",29Sep2020,1

299,"So lolis are basically anime girls in hentai who are underage. And today, all of my friends were freaking out about some loli video on Instagram. It wasn't nude. It was a little anime girl swallowing jizz though. While it's weird, I don't think it's illegal. 

Anyway, in the comments, some guy doxxed the user. Literally his name, where he works, and what city he lives in. But then my friend takes this info, finds the guys address, and posts it all. I said he was taking it way too far. He accused me of being ""soft on the pedophiles who post child porn"". 

The thing is, there's hentai of animated characters in TV shows and movies who are underage already. It's not real, and when you're fapping to lines, circles, and colors, it really gets really blurry in terms of morality. Personally I don't watch animated porn but it just doesn't seem wrong to me and I don't know.

Now he has it in his head that all the loli accounts the poster was following is some big pedophile ring and he wants to go after them like he's Q or some shit. I have no clue what he's gonna do but he's kinda scaring me.

309,"Hi friends.
To start off, I know I did a dumb by getting married in the first place. I also know that I’ve made multiple mistakes along the ride. But here we go.

I was stuck in army basic training for almost a year due to an injury, and got married almost immediately after getting out to someone I met while I was there. He didn’t end up passing basic, and now lives with me where I’m stationed. 
He made it very clear from the start that he had trust issues from a past relationship, and wanted me to stop talking to certain friends (all men) or let him know any time I spoke to any of them. At first I was so in love I had no problem doing this. However, I soon learned that he has problems with alcohol, and whenever he would get drunk he would accuse me of talking to them anyway, call me a slut, cunt, etc. This went on for about two months until a friend finally reached out to me, and I was so at my wits end I told him everything that was going on. I then started speaking to multiple friends of mine regularly that I wasn’t supposed to be talking to. My husband eventually found out about this through mutual friends and it obviously caused further altercations.
At one point my husband and I agreed to separate, and I invited a friend of mine that is stationed near me to visit once he had left. He had mentioned something about casual sex and I said I would have to think about it but wasn’t opposed. However, my husband and I made up and I left it at that.
About a month ago my husband got extremely drunk and went through my phone while I was sleeping. He saw that conversation, as well as the others detailing how he had been acting over the past few months. I ended up being dragged and pulled across the apartment, he threatened to hit me, there was a wrestling match for my phone at one point where I was bruised and scratched and both my phone and my personal computer were destroyed. Once he passed out I called the army victim advocate and was taken to stay in the barracks. He contacted me the next morning through Facebook messenger on my government computer, saying first that he had killed my cat, and then that he would starve her until I came home. He ended up being sent to the hospital later that day for suicidal ideation and his BAC was somewhere around .3. 
My dad flew here to help, but he wanted me to surrender my animals to the shelter and drop out of my lease, tanking my credit. I wasn’t okay with either of those. My husband called me and said he was being given medication and access to therapy, and thought I should come home. All of these combined reasons led me to return to the apartment. 
Of course, it didn’t get better. He doesn’t have an episode every time he drinks, in fact there has only been one since I got home last month, but it was slightly more physically aggressive, and also brought on by absolutely nothing (he was angry that I was holding my dog, ended up ripping my arms apart and dropping her on her head, slamming me into the wall, etc). 
However, this time I’m completely isolated. The stipulation of me coming home last time, because I “cheated” (I disagree), was that I have no social media, I block all of my friends numbers, and he has free access to my phone whenever he pleases. My father isn’t speaking to me since I didn’t accept his help when he flew here. I also cannot walk the dog, check the mail or even go on base for PT without him there. I don’t know what advice I’m even looking for, I’m just completely and utterly lonely. I miss my friends, who I’m sure are completely disappointed in me for randomly blocking them and going home after what he did last month. I can’t get a divorce without losing my animals and having to drop my lease. I’m so so lost. Any advice would be appreciated.",29Sep2020,1
310,"So, I'm a civil engineer (M28) and I work as one for almost 4 years in a small country in Europe.

2 years ago, I decided to go on IT college that lasts 4 years.  I went on classes in another town that is 50km far away, after my regular job, in afternoon to noon. It was exhausting and I spend a lot of money on college, traveling and what not. Then I decided to pause for 1 year because of that, and because I figured out that to become rich, I don't need another diploma. A bit too late, but who cares.

&amp;#x200B;

* Why I want to finish another college.

1. The thing is, since coronavirus become a thing, I can attend classes remotely from home, so I would save money and time on traveling.  
2. I think that another diploma from another sector will be a great backup, or maybe it can become my first income. 
3. I love IT, I am learning programming from home because I enjoy it and want to create something that will make me at least some passive income. 
4. I like to finish what I have started. 
5. In civil engineering you are mostly not at home with family, but in another town where construction is built. Working in IT, I could work and live in the same town. I only have a girlfriend for now, but I'm trying to think for the future.
6. I still don't know where to invest saved money but in real estate, and for that I need a loan from a bank anyway. So I can spend it on college.

&amp;#x200B;

* Why I don't want to finish another college.

1. It's expensive. I have to go to college for another 3 years. In that 3 years I would spend my yearly expenses on tuition. 1 year of expenses = remaining 3 years of tuition.
2. I want to invest saved money in something that will make me financially free, even though I don't know what.
3. I'm afraid that I would be too old to find a job in IT with no working experience in that sector. I would be probably 31 years old. 
4. Because of number 3., I believe that going on that college will only be  to learn some new things. Which I can do also by myself at home, for free. 
5. I believe that I can earn some bigger amount of money by investing in real estate and if everything is going to be as planned, I would be financially free before retirement, so there is no need for another diploma. 
6. I can fully be focused on that one programming language I'm learning right now and on the app I want to create. 
7. More time to go to gym.

TL;DR I'm searching for excuses to finish another college, but I don't want to because of money and believing that another diploma wouldn't help me much to become financially free.

I just finished my first quarter of dental school, and I think I got mainly B’s and maybe even failed the lab courses (all my grades are interim and won’t be final until the end of the school year, and most of my class will probably fail lab, especially due to COVID).

I’m also in an accelerated program, so it is definitely hard to keep everything balanced. I feel stupid because I found out I got a D on my physio final, and the average was a C. It dropped my A to a B, but I can make it up next quarter hopefully. 

I’m just frustrated/feel stupid because I cannot memorize minute details since we have to study 1000’s of slides for an exam that is no more than 50 questions. It’s especially disheartening since I was a straight A student in college.

Does anyone have any advice on how to detach their self-worth/esteem from their grades? I know a doctoral program is a whole other ball game, and it’s unhealthy to keep obsessing about GPA, especially since this is the last educational program I will likely endure (I’ll be a dentist in 3 years!).

I just pretend i didn't hear her. It did bother me like why would she even say that, those are her God kids. We continue talking and they know its going to be our daughters birthdays(same day 3 yrs apart) and i tell her that they should come over its just going to be us and my parents and she says she'll let me know.

 We they are about to leave all the kids are playing in the front yard she's still inside grabbing her stuff and i am there watching the kids. My daughter(3) is shaking the water out of a toy by the water hose their daughter comes over and she bumps it as she is trying to get water she starts rubbing her head so i go over and make sure she is okay i have my 3 year old say sorry and now her mom is coming out and as soon as she sees her she tells her ""mom feel this she hit me"" and i told her mom "" she is saying she(my daughter) hit her in the head but no it was an accident. Without even checking her or even listening to me trying to tell her how it happened she tells her ""you have bump"" and she says yes which i checked and she did not and just says ""okay lets go"" and just waves bye to the kids usually she will give them a hug and i can see she is upset now they are by the sidewalk and i can hear telling our kids godfather to check her and he says she is fine. They leave and i just haven't text her and she hasn't text me since. Maybe i should of texted her clarifying that i saw what happened and it was an accident and that i did talk to my daughter and she did apologize.

Yesterday was our daughters birthdays and they obviously didn't come. They didn't call or even text. Im not sure if they just forgot or if she is still upset over what happened. I understand if they couldn't come for whatever reason but the fact that they haven't even call really hurts. Im thinking maybe i should text her but then given their role they can at least do that regardless of how upset she is. I mean at times i feel like its so stupid and cant believe she took it this far but then im like maybe im wrong? Should i text her ?",29Sep2020,1
326,I just recently met someone who I really like. But I feel like we are rushing into things really fast and we barely know each other.

328,"A long story ahead so please bare with me here.

In July I found out my boyfriend of 8 months had veen cheating on me. He left me to be with the other girl, which obviously hurt like hell, and ive recently managed to get over it and move on. That's not my problem tho.

My problem is my current boyfriend. We've been friends since I was just a little girl. I've always considered him the love of my life. We've been together for a little over a month now. But heres the thing. I just got a text from this girl telling me that he's not a good guy and that he has anger issues and that he has cheated before, a couple times. Of course I asked him about it before jumping to conclusions, and he confirmed it. So now I dont know what to do. Because this guy who I've loved for a long time, this guy who I've decided to trust, even as hard as it was after my ex, is not who I thought he is. 

I love him so much and I am willing to try and leave the past in the past and believe he is a changed person, but from what I've seen so far, he isn't. Well, not by much. What do I do?? I want to try and make things work with him because, after all, he's never personally done anything to hurt me before, and I dont think he will. Im so lost. Im so afraid to trust him because every time trust someone, I end up hurt.",29Sep2020,1
330,"I’m 17 so some of this is probably just normal teenage angst and I do acknowledge that but it’s deeper than that.

My parents divorced when I was about 8-10 (I’m not too sure because I can’t remember most of my childhood) and they co parented for a while, then my Mom broke up with her at the time boyfriend and completely dipped out of my life leaving me and my brother with our dad. Disappeared for about 2 years completely ghosting a preteen/young teen me every time I called and texted including on birthdays and holidays. Then she came back with a new boyfriend and his three kids and was a housewife and tried to convince myself and my brother that our dad was/is abusive (he has anger issues but has never harmed or threatened either of us so she was lying)
Even after she came back there was a whole bunch of issues including her outing me on another Christmas, excusing blatant bigotry in her house, etc. anyway after ghosting me for years she then constantly texts me and has been for the past 3 years. 
She wants to talk all day every day and when I don’t respond she gets upset saying that I don’t love her and after everything she’s done for me she deserves a response, the usual. And when I’m forced to go there (my dad makes me go so that we can have a “healthy” relationship) she uses me as a therapist and a maid. She tells me about her relationship issues with my stepdad, stuff about his children that I shouldn’t know, and stuff about the kids own mother which I shouldn’t know. I’m also tasked with picking up after his children who are 18 and 16 so they’re not young. I’m also constantly dragged away from my school work to go run errands with her right now and it’s hard for me to do well. (I forgot to add this in but she’s also in a weird cult and is trying to get me to marry one of her church members who’s over thirty in April which is when I turn 18)

Basically though, every time I get a text from her when I’m back home at my dads I get irrationally angry. It gets so overwhelming that I’m on the verge of throwing fits for basically no reason because I dread the texts and the constant spamming. Is this just me overreacting to my teenage angst or is it sorta justified?",29Sep2020,1
331,"I'm thinking of quitting my job as a data analyst, for my former team manager being toxic. Which has opened my eyes to pursue other potential careers, mostly due to my hate of coding (tried to enjoy it for the last 4 years at uni). I've made a fiverr account and two gigs related to comics/pencil art, bunch of print on demand stuff in stores no sales on either, and applying (advised by another redditor) for a Business Analyst position at a tech company where the climate would mostly be better suited to my personality. 

I'm doing all these things but the dream is to become an artist, even a small time artist on YouTube with a barely min. wage salary is decent to me. 

In the back of my mind I know and fear that this won't work out and I'll be risking losing a job I hate that pays well enough, one that I believe I shouldn't have gotten. And that I won't find work for at least an extended period of time. I'll have to deal with judgemental parents, God bless I'm not forced to work for their sake, my own insecurities and the possibility that I could be putting so much effort into all this for nothing.

332,"one of my best friends, started dating a guy and his friends became our friends. That is how I met my friend.

Everything was super chill and we all had a blast whenever we hung out. Him and I would always talk about life and what it all means, how to level up, and our realizations about the world. He always gave good feed back and listened to our conversation which I really appreciated. We’ve had some moments where we kissed after being drunk but it was always clear we would never date. He didn’t want to date me and I didn’t want to date him. The thing is he started thinking I liked him and became distant/ignorant of me which made me feel bad since I thought we were pretty close friends. After that I completely stopped messaging him, talk to everyone in the group but him unless he initiated and so on did the same thing he did. 

A long while ago we talked about our situation and he randomly said that he wouldn’t mind “trying” to date me (keep in mind didn’t actually like me, he was just willing to try and see if that would change) but I told him I’m not looking for a relationship (because if something bad happened between us it would ruin our friend group and he thought the same). Tbh I think he was using me as an ego boost or something. He used to be a person I could share very personal issues with and he always help me with them. 

We are gonna continue being acquaintances because our friend group usually plans road trips or hangouts. And idk if I should put in the effort to fix our friendship or just leave it as is. 

I think it’s best to leave everything the way they are but I really want to get this out of my head and the only way possible is to talk to him. If I message him, he most likely won’t want to talk or might take things the wrong way. He has been very cold and our last conversation ended weirdly. 

All of this weirdness between us might just be me overthinking everything but I need to get it out my head.

Summary: my close guy friend started acting like an asshole towards me and I want to fix it but don’t think it’s worth fixing even for the friend group. Especially since he hasn’t tried either.",29Sep2020,1

334,"I'm (25M) a guy with some weird past and in kind of weird situation. I'm a suicide attempt survivor. Though I'm not depressed and living an awesome happy life it's kind of very hard to find a good partner for myself. I've accepted everything about my life and my past but society here have kind of stigma due to which even if I try my best to talk openly with anyone they either run away or show too much sympathy, mean people just don't consider me a normal human. I even tried to make friendship with my school buddies but it also didn't work and doesn't work even after trying and failing everytime. I also don't believe much in social media which makes things more like impossible to find friends and a good partner or soulmate (I'm not picky but experience taught me not to so and be in real life world). It's kind of very hard to absolutely start a new life all of sudden where you know you can't connect with people who you knew in past (considering good of self and others). Most of the time I feel lonely and don't know how to deal with this situation. And due to recurrent medical treatment I've been through eg :- ECT'S and all or I don't know what they were I just don't have much of the past memory. Like someone absolutely erased all the unwanted memory from my brain but I also lost the names of friends I knew in past. I just want to make some good friends and have a good partner. All I do is just business, books, music eat sleep and repeat, it's like not having anyone in life. It's ok but one also does get bored of loneliness and self company.

335,I moved out of my five bedroom apartment with my roommates and I was in charge of paying the Wi-Fi bill and I neglected to turn in the Wi-Fi router to the post office and I told my roommates that I would do it and then I have to do it but I have no deadline but no one checked up on me if I didn’t do it. We were recently charged on my friends account of a balance to be paid for not returning the Wi-Fi router to the post office but I was told by the representative from the Internet company that I can turn it in whenever and there’s no deadline. No my roommates/friends say that it’s my responsibility to pay for the full amount because I didn’t ask for help on returning the router(I am across the river and it’s a far travel to go back to the old apartment that I lived in). What should I do should I pay for the full amount ($60) and take the L or should I convince them to split the cost with me since I believe it is everyone’s responsibility to pay for the Wi-Fi while we lived there. But I took upon myself to return the router and said I would but didn’t and failed to ask for help. My old landlord cleanEd the apartment and threw out the router we believe. I asked the super through text that he read but didn’t reply because I believe it was too late in the day (7pm) if in during the cleaning he found it in there if he threw it out by any chance.

339,"TL;DR my sister who is 13 won a car through the maccas monopoly app. Since she's underage, we can't redeem the car. Is there anything we can do? 

My sister is 13 and we live in Australia. Today we went to get mcdonald's for lunch, and right now the monopoly thing is on, where you peel off the sticker and win a prize. On the way home, my sister was typing on her phone and wouldn't talk to us. I didn't see what she was doing, but I saw she was holding a MacDonald's monopoly ticket, so I assumed she was trying to redeem something like a soda. What I didn't know is that we won a car. 

At home, she yelled 'WE WON!' and ran into the living room and showed us her phone. She won a Volkswagen T-Cross on the macca's monopoly app. We were all cheering and yelling happily, because we were thinking of buying a new car.

What we didn't realise was that she made a maccas account under her name, and she ticked the 'im over 18 or I am over 14 and have permission from a parent' so she was underage. After reading the t's&amp;c's, we realised that we couldn't redeem our car.

She just turned 13 this year, so there's no way we can wait until she turns 14 to redeem the car.

Is there anything we can do? Or have we lost the car? We don't need a car, but it would be nice to have a new car.",29Sep2020,1
340,"So I could write a book on the our relationship together but I'm gonna try to sum up until we moved in together to get everyone up to speed here goes

Moved to across state for a job. had couple of dates that where meeh. then swiped on a girl who i never thought go for me. we match. instantly click. went on our date. best date ever where we did nothing but just talked and vibed. didn't even wanna have sex with her cause i didn't want her to think i'm just here for a hook up. still did that morning she started it. car breaks down.  i go fix her car. super nervous cause this one is amazing. Go 110% to get the girl. scares her and walls up. back off. comes around. tells me about hated being treat cause she's pretty and has a drink problem and not having money. told her i'd support her to quit drinking and told her how awsome she is other than her looks. uses her looks to go a roof top bar. remind her of what she said. she blows up i feel like i totally fucked up. seems like we patched things up. still says she isn't ready for a relationship because of her past. said okay i''l wait and help you learn to trust again. should walked a way. helps me with an event said she is living with a ""friend"" now. i knew it was a dude. should have walked a way. kept this up for a couple of months until i got tired of the bullshit. go out with my first new match. Super fucking into me and super fucking crazy. girl get jealous. show i'm in a relationship, then next day she does. i realize i don't like the girl i'm with. get a text at that moment of original girl saying she think she made a mistake. i said so did i. agree to both break up with our people. i did. she didn't. really should have walked a way. couple days later she calls and comes to my place. cheats on her boyfriend. I thought it meant we was finally getting together from what all she said.  told friend cause i was so excited we're finally getting together. friend got and tells her bf behind my back. girl feels betrayed. shes she loves me but loves him differently. it just said okay. help her lie to bf. drop sticking their nose in friend. couple months more go by. we still talk. randomly get calls crying asking to come live with me. i say yes. she never does. couple of more months go by. hanging out with her and bf. they get into an argument. he wants to break up with her. she deck him and starts stomping his chest. he flips her pound her face and pours a beer on her head. pick her up. quickly put her into my car and rob the place of he stuff. let her pick the next place. got her a dog. bought her a bed, let her use my dresser and tv. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now to sum up the past 4 months. drinking all the times. gd from 3 jobs. random dude going in and out of the house (least 33) only here from her when she wants something or needs me to resuce her from something. has tried to fuck me twice. once right after another dude getting into my bed naked with her stomach shinny from his cum..didn't even want to touch her. another was on a new tradition of a bff day. she was too drunk and i didn't want to take advantage of her like everyone always does. next day told her about what happened she's embraced by it. never have another bff day since. got tired of the lies. can't tell plain as day when she does. got a new job offer so quit the worst job i've ever had to the new one. she gets fired 2 days later. we broke as shit. I'm selling my guitars and musical equipment to keep us fed. she's still getting drunk, fucking dude, and having time of her life while we're struggling. i'm on the job for 3 days. still broke. we have a good time watching the game. things are looking good. next day sell my last equipment i can part with to fed us...another random dude comes over. i call her out on it. she lies again. super douchebag talking shit about our place. try to stay calm as best as i can. got to the bathroom and her door is next to it. here dick sucking sounds. knock like a cop. told her to get the fuck out. went completely off kick douche after he's trying to fight me in my own house. go full anger. first time she has ever heard me yell. tries every manipulation in the book including the ol' ""i'm gonna kill myself right in front of you"" none of it work.

We talked for a while then I realized this is all my fault. if i would have walked a way. Both of us wouldn't be here like this. Now here's where I need the advice I told her she has to go to AA in order for me not to kick her out. she's has a problem and I've seen it before. my friend died at 30 from alcoholism and she going down his road hard. she doesn't even look the same anymore. but she has nothing. a computer and 3 bags of clothes that it. IF i kick her out. she's either living in her car or using her body to have a place to sleep at night. I do really car about her and do really love her..she doesn't feel the same. just been taking advantage of me this whole time....but she is an addict. everyone has given up on her. even her family. it would be easy just to pack her shit up and tell her to leave. it would hurt. she would hate forever and that would make sure that I could finally move on from her. but it would be cruel. the other thing would be to give her time to find a place and we go our separate ways but that would always give me hope to cling to. What I really want to happen is that she does go to aa and at least gets better...but i'm pretty sure she's already trying to find he next place and vamp.   So honestly i don't know what to do. the guy who does her hair is an aa manager. I thought about contacting him and getting him to help me get her into the program. but again feel like she's gonna vamp any day. this has been her two days off didn't come home last night only stop to get her dog (who she never took care of and shit all in my floor and she never cleans it up) left and never came back. So either she is actually taking care of the dog or she's planning to leave. I'll only know after tomorrow if she comes back and cleans up. or cleans her stuff out. so I don't know what to do. should I talk her into staying but push for the aa...should i just stay out of the way like i have and let her vamp, or just wait it out and let the pattern respect itself....she is my best friend. and honestly i need her now more than ever cause first time the rent is all on her.  i see her how she is giving the rent but then leaving. and yes I was jealous of all the dudes. especially after covering 2 moths of her half of the rent, paying her car payment twice. rescuing her off side of the road. talking her out of a dui. always always being there for everything but all the random ass dude get to fuck her on the bed i bought her. yes I not claiming the victim because i made it easy for her to get all of that. she just have to hint a couple of time until i finally offer. I was the one to always push for us to be together..I always thought if i can proof myself enough to her. she will finally see i've been the only one in her life that's always there ...sooo i really don't know what to do. best guess is to just stay to the side and see how it plays out...but a part of me wants to apologize not for what i said but how i said it. try to work it out with her, but at the same time if i do she'll just go right back to how see was....so reddit help me out here what should i do or is there an option i'm not seeing?",29Sep2020,1
341,"Hello, this is my first time posting anything on reddit, so I’m hoping I can get some help out. So for some context, I got a job in high school, and when I graduated, I moved to a different state so I could go to college somewhere else. Luckily the company I worked at was expanding to my new location so I was able to keep my job and just transfer to a new store. 
Well I wanted to go to school out of state for mainly three reasons: I didn’t want just a second version of high school where I know everyone at college already, the school I wanted to go to had a great engineering program, and they also had a great ROTC program that would help with my future career interest. I quickly realized that engineering was both harder than I expected, and it was also not a passion of mine that I had really put some thought into. So I changed majors. Then, I wasn’t really adjusting to the whole lifestyle of the ROTC atmosphere, and dropped that as well. I became unmotivated in school and didn’t pass my courses, so I decided to just take a break for the time being instead of pouring money into something where I had no idea what the end goal was. I started to take my job from high school a bit more seriously and began to get promoted. 
While I’m out of school, I recently went full time with my job that would allow me to move out of my parents house and into an apartment. To which I need to do by the end of this year. And I’m stuck between moving into an apartment here, or down to where I originally lived. I’ve become very isolated where I am now. I don’t have any friends outside of work, I don’t really go anywhere other than work and home, and when I am home I just spend time playing video games or chatting with my old friends. On one hand, if I stay up here, I will likely advance further in my job and be able to climb the ranks a bit more, but I’ll live alone and be lonely. I’ve never been the most social and honestly I don’t know how I have the friends that I do. And on the other hand, I could move back, live with a couple of my friends, still have the same job but probably not be full time, and probably not have a lot of room if any for advancement. See, where I live now, the company is still expanding up here, versus my old home, where the company literally dominates the market and everyone and their mother works for this company. I could switch departments to one that makes just as much money as I do, for part time, but I know that won’t be a great end goal. But at least I’d be able to afford to live and be with my friends. Help! I don’t know what to do. 

tl;dr one place has more room for advancement with work, the other has my friends but a saturated job market already",29Sep2020,1
342,"Hi, hello, this is my first reddit post so be gentle and English isn't my first language, so it's gonna be messy.
I'm (22f), been living alone for a long time, I have a job, no friends and a now ex boyfriend (24m) that hit me last night. We were together for a year and 1/2 approximately. I've never been in a more loving, passionate, happy relationship before. Important side note is that we were also coworkers but we started working from home since the pandemic started. It was going amazingly until in July this year I decided to go through his phone while he's sleeping. I've only did it once before and all I found was pictures from other females both normal and nudes. 
Back to the story, I went through his phone and I found that that in May he stopped working in the middle of his shift to go with a coworker to a place that is known for people having sex at. Mind you, this coworker person (23f, we'll call her Amanda) I've known for almost 8 years because we come from the same part of the country and she dated one of my best friends for 5 years. Also an important side node, Amanda has been working in the company for the longest from all of us, then me and lastly my ex-bf. She never seemed like the slutty type until I started working in the company. I brushed it off as being friendly and didn't pay it any attention until I went through my ex-bf phone. I don't wanna go much into that because although it plays a big role in the situation, it's not the point. Normally, I thought that he cheated on me and we had a whole fight about it, but his explanation is that she was coming onto him and she didn't take no for an answer so he decided that it's best if they talk in person. I decided that I'm gonna believe him even tho deep down inside I didn't believe it and continued the relationship.
He told me that he wants me to respect his privacy and not touch his phone without consent which I understand and I haven't touched his phone since that happened. Afterwards we had a couple fights that would end up into ""breakups"" because he decided to. He would then come back to me and we would work it out till it happened again.
Since then he stopped working at the company and is currently training to work in a different company. This guy, he has told me multiple fuckboy stories before and after we started dating, how so many females are after him (which was kinda true, because a lot of girls were infact calling/texting him). 
After stuff like that and the situation that I explained, I got a little insecure. I'm not really a big social media person, I recently deleted every social media account because I feel like I need a detox from it. I posted from time to time but I keep my business private mostly. My ex-bf is not the type of person to post selfies and stuff but he does spent a lot of time on social media. I was wondering how in this year and 1/2 he doesn't have any sign on socials of being in a relationship.
 His excuse is that he doesn't wanna post selfies, that he doesn't consider himself to be photogenic etc. which I understand but it would be a nice gesture if he had just one picture with me in it. I've never asked for stuff like this in the past and didn't plan to. 
Things escalated when I asked to see his phone (he told me to ask him for consent to do that) and he got really defensive and asked for mine back. I never hid anything from him nor is my phone off limits to him, he can do whatever he wants. I just thought it was very suspicious that he reacted that way and I gave him my phone anyways. He told me and I quote ""I'm gonna going through your entire phone, even email"". As I was going through the hundreds of nudes that he saved on his instagram, I asked is this the reason why he wouldn't hand me the phone and he started aggressively tugging my hand and his phone. 
He took the phone and slapped me. I tried to speak but he slapped me again and again and again. Until I fell to the ground because I felt like I was gonna black out. I got up crying, not feeling the left side of my face because I wanted him to sit down and listen to me. He started calling me names, hitting me, telling me how I'm the only person that brings this out of him and that I make him this way. He said that it's my fault that I've been abused before because I'm a psychopath. He said I deserved everything that has happened to me and more. He said that he should be sorry and that he should want to hug me but all he wanted is to hit me. He said that the reason why I don't have any friends is because I'm a brainless piece of shit that carries my head on my shoulders for nothing. He said that he doesn't want to see me ever again and left. I can go on for hours because he said a lot of things and I've never been this hurt in my life. I just wanted to get this out of my chest because I don't have anyone to talk to and if you got this far, thank you for reading.
I'm now all alone stuck with a job that makes me super depressed and I barely make ends meet, no friends or family, no boyfriends. What should I do? Where should I go? I'm starting to lose my mind and I'm really scarred.",29Sep2020,1

He also has his bed right up against the wall and a different women over each nice it honestly sound like someone is knocking on the door really loudly. I really don't know what more I can do i have spoken to him and said he's making loads of noise but he hasn't done anything to change that, I've spoken to my other neighbours and they can hear it all too. What do I do i really can't deal with it much longer and don't feel I should have to move just because of some arrogant arsehole.

Any advice?",29Sep2020,1
347,"hello, so a year ago I joined a new class. there was this guy who took interest in me and pursued me. long story short I was really mean at rejecting him and played his feelings and stuff. I know I'm a asshole :(( it took me awhile but at the end of 2019 I realized what I've done and how toxic I've been. now in 2020 I wanted to start a fresh and try to be nice to everyone. I apologise to him and we became friends. atleast I think we became friends. we were chill for most of the year and we talked casually. he added me into his private insta and I did too. all the sudden today he just was really quiet and did not really look at me in the eye. I tried starting a convo but he blatantly just did not look and speak to me even tho I was right infront of him. I was suspicious of him bc I really don't know what I did AND IVE DONE NOTHING TO OFFEND ANYONE RECENTLY.  He removed me from his private account now. 
his clique is chill with me and idk if I'm just over reacting but I'm really hurt and idk what did I do? 
any comment or advice or anything that can help me understand things?",29Sep2020,1
348,"I'm 20(M) and I'm a law student. Long story short I am having huge anxiety problems. I always feel like I don't belong at my college. I'm always very hard on myself. Usually, I used to grab every opportunity which is in my hand but now since I got into stoicism, I haven't been really using every opportunity and labelling it as betterment for my mental health I have become lazier. There's a moot competition culture in law schools where you'd represent the college competing with other colleges in dealing with cases. My whole self-worth was put into that I know it's not the right thing to do but my college culture has this atmosphere that if you're good with moots you would be a good lawyer. I want to succeed something in my life. All my life I have been an imposter trying to fit in every place I go to. My dad is not proud or happy of me taking law since he has his own selfish reasons that I'd get separated from him. Also, he wants me to look after his business which I clearly don't want to. It feels like it's been a mistake that I took law since I don't feel like I belong there, my parents aren't really proud, I don't even have the required skills. All my mates are so talented and great that it cripples the fuck outta my anxiety. 
Idk what's the state here, my close friend sees me as a competition and it sucks. It has drained our relationship. We together planned to start a law journal together but he did it with someone else and it hurts like hell for me. Idk I feel neglected and bad. I make up my mind that it's all his ego for competing with me but deep down I know for a fact that it's his life his choices who am I to say him to start the journal with me.

Today another best friend of mine wants to do moot with another team and this seems okay and normal but I'm fully hurt since we actually planned to do it together. Now he left me  I'm so fucking down and I feel like  I'm in rock bottom. I don't even feel like picking up my own team and start it I'm just way too tired and lazy for that.

My future is uncertain I don't even know what he fuck I'd do. I badly need money to move out and have a good life. Considering my degree it takes a lot of time to settle down and earn well. Thinking all about this uncertainty gives me great anxiety. I am familiar with the stoic quotes that if you do not have control over something, do not worry about it and all that stuff but it just gives me temporary relief to a permanent problem.

I always feel like I'm having trust issues with everyone. I broke up with my girlfriend last year and I used to be the guy who's always surrounded by friends and popular but now all I want to be is alone and I keep pushing people away from my life. I want to deal with this anxiety alone because every person I have trusted has ended up betraying me or using my weaknesses to their advantage. Idk if I'm overreacting but it sucks and I have lost faith in trusting people. It's like if someone does something to me it's not even bothering me and it seems like I saw it coming. Now this pandemic has made me feel more anxious and uncertain. Now the online classes have improved, moots have been conducted online but I still don't have the force to try it online since I find it super lame to argue online (maybe I am giving reasons for my laziness) but the friend who a abandoned me told the same reason and now he is doing it with another team. It seems like everything is going to be online for a few months so I should get used to all the stuff to be done online. I don't feel like doing it. 
At home, I'm pressurized by my dad to help him with his work and he would threaten me that if I'm not of any use for him, he would stop helping me or pay for my college. At the other hand, I have not been listening to college classes, not participating in anything related to college work. All I'm doing is surf through Reddit and also learn random stuff on mental health and psychology which is not even related to my studies.  I hit the gym and maintain a decent body which is the only reason I could have a little self-worth. I have no great hobbies to look upon since my school days my dad did not join me in any extracurricular activities as he was not ready to pay extra for it. He says paying for the education, giving food itself is a huge favour for me. 

Sorry for this rant. I feel like I don't know what I'm doing with my life. Every external happening is deteriorating my mental health. I am very anxious about my uncertain future.  I don't know what to do please help me out. Is there anyone going through my phase?",29Sep2020,1

350,"To provide some context, he’s pretty famous but I’m definitely out of his league appearance wise (he’s cute at best), so there’s motive for him to actually want to pursue something w/ me beyond just sexting (right?). 

Him and I have been talking consistently for a week now and there’s moments when we’ll actually have crazy good connections and have similar senses of humor &amp; overall style/vibe. However, he mostly wants to talk about sexting related stuff &amp; send “sexy” pictures back &amp; forth. My issue is, I’m not sure if I should continue responding or if this is just a dead end. I’m not super into sexting but if something might come of it then it may be worth it to me. He lives pretty far away so that’s also a factor, but then again he may very well be the future father of my children (lol). 

Anyway, my question(s) is,
1-should I keep messaging him? Like is it possible that he actually might want something more or is the fact that he’s seemingly mostly interested in sexting a sign that that’s his main and only motive?

2-any advice on literally anything as far as continuing to talk to him goes? If you’ve dated someone in the public eye, did you notice any differences in your relationship vs. dating a non-celebrity?

Last night they went out (my ex, his friends and my son) I thought i'd look on her instagram just because... anyways she added to her story a photo of my son and ex playing and wrote on it (I know it's been a tough road but I hope after tonight there is some light at the end of the tunnel) 

Idk what she meant by this; maybe becos i finally let my son stay the night at theirs with his dad? But i've NEVER stopped him from seeing his kids, he is the one that always cancels last minute or wont stick to our mediation plan. 

I have also offered him to spend the night at my place if he wants to spend the night with ALL the kids (we have 3) but he doesn't want to do that because apparently it messes with his head... even though i've said multiple times i'd be more than happy to leave so he has the place to himself. 

But I thought ""why not let my son go spend a night with his dad"" so I let him, my son enjoyed himself and she was really nice and kept messaging me to keep me updated on my son.

353,"I’ve(M21) been friends with C(F22) for about 2 years. Its not that long but we’ve been through a lot and i had a feeling that we were close. We’ve talked about how we’re just like family.

The situation started about 6 months back when she casually mentioned she’d die for some artsy pens but she can’t get them because they cause her pain in the hand. I thought it could be a great idea to get her a birthday gift of the type of stuff she likes and thus, i wrote it down.

Fast forward to this month, her birthday finally came. I prepared a lot of adorable funny pictures and memes of her, made a video with a bunch of edits that took me and my friend hours to make, and also got her 100 bucks worth of pens. Now, i hardly make any money at all (country culture) so i had it saved up. Comes the day, and im getting cold responses to all my posted pictures. The night i was asked to join her other friends on a video call (all thanks to covid). I thought we had a blast. The following day i received a text saying “those people last night are like my family, I’m glad you were there too”. 

The morning after i send her the pictures of the gift i got her. i got a “wow thanks” for the gift, i was quite underwhelming but i thought it was just her being busy with other people. I mentioned the text she sent and she told me she figured i had got the idea from that. I don’t know why but something felt wrong. I asked if she has somehow played it to get the gift. She denied it. I baited her by saying that i was hoping it was true as it would be quite a power move. And she just admitted it.

I felt being taken advantage of. All this time i was thinking that i was genuinely doing something good but i was just being baited into giving her what she wanted all along. I don’t really know how to feel about all this, i guess i wanted a little more honest communication and not a manipulative tactic. 

She has always acted high and mighty above the rest, but I didn’t expect this. I’m guessing this is what adulthood feels like.

354,"I have this one friend, I haven't really known that long but we became really good friends for a while. It was an online friend and we use to talk a lot about random shit, sometimes I'd vent about my problems to her and sometimes she'd do the same (although probably not as much as me). And then she kinda just stoppped coming online, she comes on like once or twice a month. I met her in May I think and some how she became one of my bestfriends (For context I don't really have many friends).

Every now and then, I do get really upset that I don't talk to her anymore, I have spoken to another friend about this. The other friend thinks that I might've ""caught feelings for her."" But I don't think that's the case, I don't think I like her romantically (I don't even know what she looks like lol) but I've never really been someone who understands his own emotions.

Apologies that this is long, just trying to give the full picture x

Hi I’m 20(F), I need some advice if I should message this guy to let him know that he hurt me even though there’s a 50/50 chance that he won’t care. 

I started speaking to this guy I met at work once during quarantine and at first he seemed like a nice regular guy and like he really wanted to get to know me, but eventually I had to let him know I was not interested because he kept doing things to piss me off and would never get how it was wrong. 

Anyways, he happened to be in my university city maybe a month later (few days ago) and he messaged me to ask if he could see me and I said no at first but the day after I thought fuck it and asked him to come over. I wasn’t expecting anything from him except for company and I knew we were likely to do stuff but he came super late and the vibe between us was off. 

Anyways we start kissing and stuff and not even 5 minutes he’s asking for sex and I’m like no. And then he asked again and I said no. Of course I knew we were bound to do sexual stuff but I didn’t want to go all the way. Anyways at one point I just said to him “you’re ruining it, you just keep talking and asking and it’s off putting”. I know at this point I should have just told him to leave but he apologised and then we continued. I gave him head and then he insisted again that we have sex and went for the condom and I just didn’t know what to do. 

I’m really disappointed in myself because I thought I was stronger than to just give in, as in my mind kept screaming at me just tell him to leave but I just said nothing and we had sex and it was terrible. He was like a rabbit and he kept saying he was tired (cuz he was drunk) and he couldn’t even finished he just stopped and said he couldn’t do it (not even 5 minutes).

 I felt disgusting because it was like he kept insisting we have sex I gave in even though I shouldn’t have and he just used my body to masturbate and couldn’t even perform well. He knew I was vex and kept asking me to speak to him and say what’s on my mind but I just didn’t know what to say at the time and wanted him to leave ASAP. 

Anyways I know I should have never let him round in the first  place and it’s my fault any of this happen but I felt so used and I’ve tried to get over it but it’s bothering me. He didn’t even message me the day after. I want to message him to tell him how I feel even though I know it’s a big chance he doesn’t give af but I need to get it off my chest because I just keep thinking about it and I don’t really want to keep getting vex over this useless boy.",29Sep2020,1

I've been struggling with my faith for a long time, it started especially when I had depression and thats when i lost my faith in Islam and questions like ""If God was the Almighty, why did I have to go through this?"" went through. I did, technically, believe in a divine being but not a specific religion, i just didnt know the word for it.

I got back into Islam but after awhile I began questioning it again. Things like genuine criticism of the Koran or Hadiths etc and I began to think whether I'm an actual muslim or not. Ex: if God is so flawless, why does He allow husbands to beat their ""rebellious"" wives? I stopped praying 5 times a day but I still do pray to Allah in my heart. A part of me wants to believe yet another is skeptic. 

Being outed as an agnostic could mean death to me, and im scared for my life. Theres even the risk of me being thrown out of the house and unloved by my parents. No matter how much i try ti explain that my views are not against nor supportive of them, i know theyll never listen. Ill just be labeled as an apostle and get thrown in jail.

370,"I just realised how toxic this cycle is after yesterday when I had a disagreement with a guy I know.

A little background, my last relationship wasn't the best, we were both toxic and whenever I disagreed with him or didn't go his way he would lash out. He'd yell at/be angry with me daily and would hit me and threatened to kick me out.

People constantly say how you aren't responsible for people's feelings however I am responsible if it means they'll physically hurt me. Which I can't not gauruntee will happen

Yesterday with this guy, I shared a tweet I saw about how women need to meet a man they're willing to get hurt for and a man cheating on a woman and abusing her is part of the ups and downs of a relationship

He said how these women are just stupid for not leaving

I asked him to elaborate and he said ""why stay with a partner that cheated on you?""

I was pretty concerned about his viewpoint, I asked him why do people cheat. He said because the partner isn't satisfied in the relationship

I said it was simpler than that, the 2 premises for cheating being wanting to cheat and believing they can cheat

He then replied to my message with his previous message about not being satisfied (replying as if he was saying ""uh that's what I already said)

I clarified that not being satisfied COULD be a reason why they want to cheat but not necessarily is not feeling satisfied is ALWAYS the reason to cheat

I felt like it was pretty important to understand that the reason why someone could want to cheat and believe they can cheat is because their partner cannot or at feels like they cannot leave them, whether it's for abuse, financially or they're being threatened/pressured to stay.

To just outright blame the other person for their partner cheating because they didn't leave is just a bit... Shallow minded would be the best way to describe it?

He stopped it by saying he's too tired for this and isn't in the mood to ""deeply analyse"" a situation. I don't think it's that deep analysis

Well I said fair enough and I was pretty upset by that exchange

Hours later though, I find myself apologising to him for being in a bad mood and not bringing it up again and being nice to him.

I gaslit myself like ""maybe your view is wrong, what if he wants to get back at you""

Now I've realised how quickly I changed my tune and how regularly I do it to keep the peace.

People that have treated me like shit I'm so sweet and complimentary too, all because deep down I'm absolutely terrified.

I can't live like this anymore. Other people's feelings and opinions mattering more than me, worried if I ever have a shitty tone having people lash out at me.

I've been tempted for a while to learn martial arts and lift weights to defend myself in case I do ever get attack.

I’m tired and stressed and most days don’t want to talk to or see people if I don’t have to. The only time I get to myself is the one day bubs at daycare or if my parents have her for a few hours. That time is usually spent cleaning the house, doing laundry/dishes, running errands in town uninterrupted by bubs antics. Then the rest of it I actually get to myself and I relax by doing things I enjoy. I get maybe 4-5 hours a week absolutely to myself a week total. 


On top of everything else bubs sick/teething. Like screaming the house down if I put her down or move away from her. I can’t even go to the toilet without her there with me right now. (Yes we’ve taken her to the drs don’t worry) so I’m not taking my sick toddler to anywhere other than home/ her grandparents house. She didn’t go to daycare last week because if it and I don’t know if she’ll be going this week either. 


My friend knows this. I’ve told her that I literally cannot be away from bub and most of our time right now is spent laying in bed together. So she’ll ask if I can hang out when my husband is home. No. I’m not dumping bub who will scream for me on him after he’s been working on a farm for 9 hours. He needs to be better than me at least so he can actually work so we can live. So she asks if I can hang out when she’s at daycare or my parents have her. No that’s my time plus she didn’t go to daycare. I don’t get any other time to be by myself. I don’t feel like seeing people. And my god I need time to myself right now.


I’ve tried to be as nice about this as possible but it’s gotten to the point I can’t even post on social media without her calling me asking what I’m doing. This will sound super lame but I make tiktoks and post on Instagram. At this point it’s an equal hobby and job for me, I have sponsors and brand deals that I have to do within certain times. If I post them she’ll call me straight away and talk to me for ages about it and anything else then ask if I want to go hang out. (Remember this is me literally working, at least that’s how I make myself feel so I don’t feel lame) I can’t share anything or post anything on Facebook because she sees it and will message me then too. Reddit is the only place I can do anything without her knowing. 


I’m literally at my wits end right now. My baby’s sick and stuck to my side 24/7, my husbands at work and I’ve got to take him/pick him up, I’ve got to clean the house, I’ve got to make posts, I’ve got to run errands, I’ve got to make sure everyone is eating, I’ve got to try and look after myself, then I sleep. That’s my day. My own mental health is playing up too right now. I’m so dam tired.


I don’t know how to nicely tell her anymore that no I don’t want to hang out and no I don’t want to talk on the phone. Literally everyday is excessive and it’s draining me. I’ve tried ignoring her, then she messaged me the next day guilting me for it. I let her phone call or FaceTime ring out and she’ll just keep calling. I’ve sent her messages saying I don’t know when I’ll be able to hang out. Yet she asks every single day. I’ve told her that my mental health has been bad right now and she said hers is to and we should hang out and chill for a bit. 


I don’t know what to do anymore. I literally see the only options left is to keep ignoring her, sending her a message telling her to back off and leave me alone for a while, or just straight up block her for a bit. Neither will go down well. I don’t want to lose my friend but I need some space to breathe. 


I don’t even know if I just needed to rant to someone who isn’t in our friend group so she won’t know or if anyone has any actual advice. Literally any advice or comments will help me stop going mad here",29Sep2020,1

381,"For the last five years of my life, I celebrate my birthday with my ex boyfriend, because he was born a day before me. Our relationship was emotionally abusive as the relationship I have with my parents. 

Last year, my birthday was one of the worst day of my life. I wanted to celebrate it alone with my boyfriend since my parents were really hard on me at this time (I had really bad anxiety and depression). But he absolutely wanted me to celebrate it with my parents and told me what I wanted didn't matter. So we got from his house to my parents' place and we had a piece of cake with my mom, and then I thought I could do whatever I wanted from my night. So i went to my sport's club, he droves me there and on the road I told him I would like to go get a drink with my best friend. He snapped at it and went mad. He gave me the silent treatment. There he watched me and the others people with bad eyes and before the end of the courses he left. No text, no calls. He just let me there and gave me silent treatment for two days. 

I was really in love with him. The day before I bought him gift and made everything he wanted to give him the best day possible.

Now, my birthday is in two days. My mom said my grandma will come over and we will celebrate it. I told her before she invited my grandma that I didn't wanted to celebrate it. 

It gaves me really bad anxiety and I just feel like disappearing for the whole day and night to flee this situation.

383,"So I have severe anxiety disorder, panic disorder, arachnophobia(I don’t know how I got that) and possibly agoraphobia and being in lockdown for 8 months seems to only have made them worse 

Before lockdown I could hardly stand to be on the bus and walk home by myself but now I flinch and jump at every little noise and I can’t even walk through my house without being scared that I’m gonna see a spider. It’s so bad I avoided my shower for 2 months because there was 1 spider in there and I convinced my mom to let me use her shower instead. I can’t even go into a room in my house without stopping and inspecting it from the doorway then all the way to where I wanted to go and I tiptoe the whole time because I’m scared of stepping on a spider. My mind has even started randomly imagining a spider on my shoulder or something and I get scared but there’s never a spider. And if some hair on the floor (or a leaf if I’m outside) rolls towards me I automatically jump away from it 

I can’t even sleep because every single noise puts me more on edge than before. It’s 2:22 am here and I’ve been awake for almost 3 days now(got 2 hours of sleep before that) and i can’t even pay attention in class nor can I take notes because my hands are shaking so much 

Does anyone know how I can stop being on edge so much? I’ve already tried the 3 anxiety medicines my doctors said would be the safest for me (I get prescribed a lot of medicine) but those didn’t do much if anything at all.

Lately he's been looking up things about pedophiles, and I'm getting worried that an adult might be grooming him in secret or already has molested him. But I don't know any adults he's close to, even in the family.

Examples of what he's searched: ""how to tell if someone's a pedophile"" ""signs of a pedophile"" ""signs of a predator"" ""signs of a molester""

My brother and I are pretty close. I asked him if something was wrong while he was using his iPad, and he said, ""No, why?"" He shows me what he's doing and doesn't hide it from me. I don't think he's talking to some guy online or anything like that. One other concerning search I found is ""is brother pedophile"". I don't know why he'd think I would be one.

395,"So my best friend (we’re both M14) from childhood who moved to another estates lost all of his friends right before the summer. This has been especially hard for him because of quarantine and the fact that he struggles with severe depression for which he sees a psychiatrist twice a week. 

We’ve kept in touch through FaceTime and social media after he moved, but this summer we ended up spending a lot of time together since he felt so alone and empty. And yet, I wasn’t enough for him, and his depression got worse. I was understanding, because one person can’t fill all the holes in another persons heart, but this made me so upset. He just felt like he was all alone and that nobody besides me liked him or would ever be his friend. His confidence and self esteem was shattered. We tried to make friends online together, but you know how it is. People online are usually toxic, and they only reinforced the idea that he’ll never make friends again.

So I, um, decided that he needs more “positive” friends around him to rebuild his confidence in time for school. And so I decided to create fake profiles on the different social media we frequent to befriend him. It was a really complex thing to pull off, but this was made easier because my twin older brothers just finished college and handed down their two laptops to me. So I had three to use to catfish him. I won’t get too much into the details, but there were whole group chats, fake profile pics, etc. He never suspected a thing, honestly, and it worked. His confidence was slowly rebuilt, and now that he’s started school, he’s making friends once again. 

Now, I’ve been a little concerned about the ethics of what I’m doing, because even though it was with good intentions and a pure purpose, it’s just so wrong to make someone feel something so real and have it all be fake. Cat fishing is just plain wrong and I’m so disgusted I even stooped to that level, but I didn’t know what else to do and I felt so helpless everytime he sat there crying with me during our times together. 

But now that he’s made friends, I’ve also decided to slowly terminate each and everyone of the catfish profiles, because he doesn’t need it anymore now that his confidence is rebuilt, and it’s better to eliminate all evidence of what I did (telling him is out of the question. If he ever finds out, his confidence would be destroyed again). But after terminating 3 of the profiles (via gradual ghosting), today he came to me crying and so upset, saying that he just feels so sad that what he had this summer with these friends who made him feel confident again was slipping away.

This made me feel a few things. Firstly, it made me little upset, because not only was I not enough for him apparently, but he’s also kinda been drifting apart from me (I get that we’re far away and it’s back to school for us, but jeez you’d think he’d be more considerate. It almost feels like he only uses me as a shoulder to cry on when he’s lonely), and the fact that he felt these “other friends” made him feel confident, and not me, was kinda hurtful. I’d like to think that he just doesn’t say it, but also knows that I was there for him and helped make him more confident again. But then again. I don’t really know that.

Secondly and the biggest problem I’m facing: I’m now really struggling with the ethics of what I did. I had pure intentions, and it really worked to help him. But I always thought that he’d be fine with his online friends slowly drifting away when he got new friends irl. I never expected him to be so impacted by his “friends” ghosting him. Honestly, I almost cried with him when he was crying to me. It’s just so obvious that he’s so hurt. And I did this to him.

Yeah... so that’s basically what I’m going through right now and I had to get that off my chest. Any advice or thoughts on this would be helpful. I just need some perspective. Feel free to bash me because I still believe catfishing is wrong.",29Sep2020,1

It's going to be expensive to fly there especially since my husband and I are most likely going to have at least one baby by then and everyone lost their freaken minds. 

This happens everytime I mention a baby. 

It's not like a secret that we want children. But everytime I talk about babies, everyone acts like it was the first time I mentioning I want one.

I have big goals like publishing a book, having my own business, investing in the stockmarket, and finishing my PhD but no one seems to care about those. When I try to reach out for support about those goals, these people shut down and don't really talk back. In fact I get picked on/yelled at for wanting a PhD. ""I need to come into the real world some day"" they say. *eyeroll*. But if I talk about having a baby than they light up like a Christmas tree. 

I got really fed up with it today and I asked why does everyone want me to have baby so badly? I want us to at least reach our minimum financial goals before having a baby. And everyone got mad at me for that. 

I know this situation will happen again, because it aways happens. What should I do instead? It makes me feel like my only worth is in my ability to have children. These people are mostly family and they know I may not be able to bear child due to health reasons I dont want to discuss with them 😞",29Sep2020,1

406,"Hello everyone.

TMI warning, there is a lot of sex related information.

It is quite hard for me to post here, since I truely love my girlfriend. She is smart, funny, I won't list the things I like about her because there is a lot. I am deeply in love with that person. But there is a problem that leaves me feeling crap very often.

I'm very often sexually frustrated. I think that it is because we don't have enough sex, and/or because we don't do things that really satisfy me. I have to say that I have a pretty high sex drive, and she has an average, maybe slightly above average one. We live together and have sex around 4 times a week on average. While this may not seem that low at all, I used to initiate more than that, basically everyday or more and got rejected a lot. Over time, since it was obvious that initiating this much was overbearing for her, I started doing it less. To compensate and to not feel horny all the time, I have to masturbate quite a lot, at least once a day (sometimes not but it's uncommon). It's not great all the time though, as it can make me feel resentful and itching for more. We have talked about it and since she doesn't want to have sex when she is not in the mood or help me relieve myself this is the only solution I see. 

Another issue that exacerbates the previous one is that she doesn't want to try most of the things I want to. For example, I'd love to try finishing inside of her without a condom, finish inside of her mouth (I don't care about swallowing), finish on her face, try anal with her, try anal things on me but she doesn't want to do any of this. We tried only one thing I wanted us to do and it's finishing on her. I even wanted us to try to give her a new type of orgasm that's not clitoral but she didn't want to and kept saying she was satisfied with what we had and that it probably wouldn't work anyways. She agreed to try finishing inside her in February with family planning (fertility awareness) but nothing has happened, and when I ask how this is going it causes an argument with her saying I'm pressuring her. She also told me we'd try me finishing inside her mouth, but then we stopped talking about it for a few weeks and when I asked her she said she'll never want to do it because she did it with her ex a few times and it traumatised her. She also told me not to count on her letting me finish inside of her because she has an unstable period. 

I was ignoring the fact I was unsatisfied because she told me that we would try those things in the future, but now I realise that it's unlikely that any of those will ever happen and that things will probably never get better. I don't know how I can continue living constantly sexually frustrated and wanting more, knowing that I'll never get it from her.

409,"Hey fellow Redditors,  
Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I am in a pretty weird situation: on Saturday nigh around 10pm I ate a space brownie, which a friend made (he used 3gr for a batch of 10).  


20 minutes later I was high, and for a third day in a row I am in this weird state - my short term memory is odd ( i can hardly follow what my body is doing and I feel like I am not truly present, its as if I am an observer of myself, bicycling is insane).  


This has continued all Sunday, Monday and is ongoing as of now, 1pm on Tuesday.  


What should I do to get back to normal?   
I drank plenty of water (at least 3l/day), ate a lot of good food (salads, home-made meat, avocado toasts), had 8h of sleep every night and worked out.  


TLDR; ate a brownie, been in a high-like state for the past 60 hours, what to do?",29Sep2020,1
410,"**TL;DR Should I stop researching career options online if it is not helping me, giving me anxiety and I don't have enough time? I have my final exams in Feb, 2021.**

&amp;#x200B;

I am high school senior. I studied physics, math, and chemistry as my main subjects. I have not been able to perform well in my courses. To be honest I picked these subjects only because I wanted to keep my options open. 

Now that I have realized STEM isn't for me, I want to switch to different subjects in college. But I'm not sure what yet. On the top of that I have my final exams around feb-march, and I don't want to mess up my grades (I'm not that bad at them, after all. Only anxiety ridden.)

 I spend a lot of my time googling stuff, visiting career websites, watching YouTube videos about a variety of stuff. Instead of helping me, it has only induced my anxiety and keeps on increasing it as I feel a compulsion to do it all the time. 

My time is getting wasted. I took several personality/career tests online and it did help me understand myself, but not in what I should really do. I live in India, I must mention, and here's almost a craze of taking up engineering/medical/civil services jobs by everyone. I'm not interested in any of these three (and of course, medical is neither possible for me as I didn't take Biology, nor am I interested in it a tiny bit). I'm thinking of taking a different career path.  

I don't think I'm gonna take admission in a college right after completing high school. I'm not prepared for any college entrance tests because my studies have been hampered in this pandemic. I'm most likely going to take a gap year to prepare for entrance tests once I'm decided. 

&amp;#x200B;

But here's the thing. **I'm not seeking career advice here. I'm not asking you to tell me what I'm supposed to be in my life.** I'm just worried about the fact that 'researching' is just becoming a waste of time, and I have less time in my hand. I often feel the 'urge' to do it. It feels good for a while, but as I spend a lot of time on it and come across a highly cynical and negative article on the Internet, I feel like going to the bathroom and vomiting out of serious anxiety. So I really don't know what to do about it.

When I look for career advice on Quora, it almost kills me. I have a high aversion towards poorly written stuff (like unforgivable grammar and spelling mistakes) and stuff written only to sell you something. But sometimes I just wonder what if I miss out on a great advice just because of being this judgmental? I don't know. It makes me feel nervous. They always have to tell you that all jobs are bad. Business is bad, law is bad, journalism is bad, academia is bad. There are no jobs. There are no opportunities unless you become a doctor or an engineer. Everything is bad. I wonder how the hell this world is even functioning. 

Indian career advice websites are equally bad. Unprofessional as hell. But I feel impulsed to check out everything. It never helps. It just makes me more anxious. I get distracted from studying. But wasting more time is not an option anymore. They don't help. They suggest the same options over and over again. In fact, I have to take the same tests sometimes for two different career opportunities. This doesn't make any difference. It sucks.

(More on Quora: Unless these guys have no credentials or are paid 'digital marketers', they will always suggest the same thing. Most people have no idea what fashion designing or animation is, so they already know 90% of people are going to skim through them. Those who want a career in these fields are already doing them. They won't seek advice.)

&amp;#x200B;

I am tired of 'hunting' things like this. It already seems to me that nothing is out there. Maybe I am not at the right point of time to think about these things. My gut says I should just stop doing this for god's sake. Maybe I will be mature enough to decide only once I'm done with my final exams, and thus have less stress to deal with. If you are seeing signs of immaturity in my thought processes, you might not be wrong. I think I *know* that right now I'm not mature enough to take this decision. I'm just getting lost in an ocean of choices. Along with these things, it would be a terrible idea to pay any attention to the thing I found was the best option for me if it turned out to be something out of the subjects I'm currently studying. For I know that if I mess up my final exams, it may stay as a stamp on my forehead for the rest of my life. That's how it works here. It's a third world country with an outdated system. Things are changing due to the new education policy introduced this year, but it will take years to implement. It may not have any effects on my life.

&amp;#x200B;

Please note that I have to do everything on my own. I have no teachers to help me. I have no counselors to help me. My parents are not educated enough to help me through this. It's hard to resist the temptation of 'just checking it' once again, then I go down a rabbit hole. It only gives me anxiety. It kind of makes me feel 'out of touch' when I stop doing it though. As if I'm missing out on something. I can do it after I complete my exams too, but I just keep getting the urge just to look.",29Sep2020,1
411,"Hello everyone, and thank you for reading my post.

In short: I am 28 years old and I don't feel like I belong anywhere in life, and as such feel like I have to start over. I currently live in Egypt and I don't feel like I am able to handle the stress that comes with it, so I come to you to ask for advice on where would be a good place to, well, start over, given little to none work experience and a low stress resistance. Some place that would be safe, forgiving and provide a healthy environment to recover from post grief depression and grow. 

Allow me to give a little context:

I studied Management abroad (BA) and moved back to Egypt last October. Throughout my life, I've lost a lot of opportunities and attempts due to family issues, which cultivated a belief in me that ""none of my plans ever work"". Every time I tried to step on my own path, something major happened that chained me to problems that weren't mine in origin, but I had to deal with no less. I had a very sheltered upbringing, which didn't exactly help with facing the harsh realities of life, so I never had the needed resilience to overcome issues. I developed a mentality that my life isn't my own.

The latest tragedy was the long and harsh sickness and passing away of my mother 2 years ago, something I haven't quite recovered from yet. It split our family up and I spent a long time alone finishing her affairs, with some still being undone, which weighs down on me tremendously.

So with all that in mind, I came back to Egypt to live with my dad, at his promise that he and some family members will help me get on my feet, help me find a flat and a job to get started with. None of this happened, everyone bailed on their promises and the next 5 months I just spent home, slipping back into a hopeless state and getting sick.

Towards that time, a lot of acquaintances advised me to leave and ""recover"" somewhere else, since I was largely unhappy. Some people even chastised me for coming back to Egypt, given the poor and depressing situation in the country. No one gave advice as to where to go, though, but at some point it became the only thought that I could bear: I need to leave, at least for a while, to get my mind right.

In February, I met a person who promised to find me a job - and they actually delivered. It was a job abroad as well. I got my first job interview that went well, and was supposed to start paperwork the week after.

The week after was the announcement of a global COVID shutdown. I lost the job, the opportunity to travel and with it my last bit of hope was crushed. I got stuck in a place that made me unhappy, and became a huge burden to my father, being a 28 years old fuck up who plays games all day. He doesn't feel that way and is very empathetic towards me, but I feel that way every day nonetheless.

My father is a great comfort, but he is unable to help me get on my feet.

&amp;#x200B;

All that being said: I don't see myself in Egypt at all, since I never felt compatible with the local mentality to begin with. My untreated depression prevents me from being more proactive and able to weigh my options with a clear mind.

So I don't know... where would a good place be to start over? I have some friends across Europe who invite me to come study there. I'm torn between studying (not even sure what), or finally starting a career at 28 (but my lack of work experience and age haunt me).

Or maybe it would be best to just go somewhere for a few months to recover and come back healthy and able to work? Covid would be a huge hurdle there, though... I am so lost.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: As a depressed and hopeless 28 years old guy with little work experience, which country could I move to finally start living a secure, peaceful life where I can build my life up and work and be happy..?",29Sep2020,1
412,"I recently moved into uni and we had a party with these girls downstairs. From the moment I saw her knew I liked her and got the feeling she felt the same towards me. A few days later I ended up getting pretty drunk and she kept offering to bring water to my room and we spent the night together. She admitted she saw me the first night and liked me too. I told her she was my first and she was surprised/slightly pissed at me for not telling her beforehand and said I should’ve waited for someone special so it actually means something. I struggle badly with social anxiety and I’m very self conscious about my body but when we were together I felt just comfortable and like I could be completely open with her. I think my mind was really telling me she’s something different. I told her personal stories and was vulnerable with her like I had never been, even with my closest of friends. 

We texted constantly throughout the next days saying things like I feel like I haven’t seen you in ages and that I just wanted to be with you right now. We hooked up 2 more times since then and I told her I wanted to be with her and asked if she felt the same. After avoiding talking to me about it for a few days she finally said I really do like you and like spending time with you but I’m just not looking for a relationship right now. I really don’t know what to make of it. I understand from and outsider perspective you’ll think she’s just not interested and politely telling me to fuck off. But I really don’t feel like that’s the case. 

Just for some background info about her, she told me about how she overly stresses over everything and wanted to keep us low key whilst we slept together. This would sometimes mean staying up until 3 in the morning so she could sneak out without anyone seeing her. 

She’s similar to me in that she sees to many potential outcomes of the future so doesn’t like making serious commitments as we don’t know what they’ll lead to or what we’ll miss out on. The fact that we don’t fully know each other yet and just have feelings towards each other plays a part in the hesitation as well.  
I regret that my dumbass pressured her early on asking for a commitment. 

But since then I’ve been at a low point just drinking in my room doing zoom classes and not socialising when they come to our kitchen. It kills me a bit inside to hear them out there. As I said I have issues being vulnerable with people, it seems every time I put myself out there I get crushed. I know rejection is a part of life but I just don’t take it well. I turn into the worst version of myself, I self isolate and become on edge and defensive to people who care about me as a defence mechanism. I don’t know what to do...",29Sep2020,1
413,"I've hated trying to get this law degree done. With ADHD it's difficult enough, but the recurrent severe depression has made it almost impossible. I have exams in two weeks and have absorbed exactly nothing from either of the two units I'm studying. I've done almost no study this trimester, largely due to anxiety and depression as well as other circumstances. I managed to get an 80% grade in a group assignment for one unit (surprisingly), and I failed the mid-trimester test for the other unit. 

Basically, I'm very concerned I'm going to fail these exams because they're worth 60% and I doubt I'm going to be able to learn an entire trimesters worth of content in the next two weeks. The exams are open book and take home, so essentially an assignment for each that you have 48 hours to finish. I'd be taking two weeks off work to study. But my mental health has been absolute trash this year, and far worse in the last couple of weeks. Actually had a nervous breakdown last week and have been suicidally depressed most days of this year, worsening lately. So I am not confident in my ability to rapidly absorb any information at the moment, let alone complex law texts. 

I've tried several different kinds of antidepressant medication this year and had no success. The ADHD medication is the only thing that has kept me going and enabled me to get out of bed. I've made several attempts to increase my exercise but it's tough going.

I'm thinking that rather than risk two fails on my transcript and ruining my already poor grade point average, it would be better to withdraw from this trimester. I have until Sunday to get a withdrawn late grade, which isn't counted in your grade point average calculations. 

I'd also really like to discontinue my course because it's been eight years of misery and poor grades, but I also have just seven units before it's completed (counting the two I am currently studying). The main reason I have persisted for so long is family pressure and expectations. But maybe if I withdraw from this trimester and take next trimester off, then I can hopefully improve my mental health in the meantime and finish the damned degree next year. Or at least give myself more time to make the decision and not make that choice when seriously depressed.

I don't know if this is the right place to post this. Maybe someone here has been in a similar position or could throw their two cents in. Thanks in advance.",29Sep2020,1

415,"I am not fully blind, I’m near sighted. I can still see things if they are far away, but its all just really blurry and gives me a headache. My contacts are +3.00 and +1.50.

My sister is a manipulative bitch. She loves to snoop in on other people’s conversations to find secrets to use against them later. She does this to almost everyone. She has done this to my brother and I the most, but she has also done this to many kids at her school and even once tried to do it to my mom. My sister knows now to do that to our parents, but she still does it to everyone else. And if there’s any time she wants to manipulate anyone but doesn’t have information to hold over their heads, she will find something that is valuable and attack at that.

For me, she threatens to break my glasses or dump out my years worth supply of contacts. I always feel as though I have to obey her because my dad is the one who pays for that stuff, and I always listen to the cashier when people buy me stuff. I know glasses are NOT cheap, and contacts are even more expensive. Even though my dad’s insurance covers a good portion of the price, it is still really expensive.

Yesterday, she wanted to make a tiktok in my room. At the time, I was trying to remove my contacts and get ready to sleep. She did not like this. My sister started yelling at me for “hogging the only mirror” (which there is more mirrors in the house if she really needed to use one) and for “ruining her tiktoks”. So, just like any “rational” person would do, my sister poured out an entire bottle of contact solution.

No place in town will hire me and I only have $2.53. I can’t keep doing this. How do I stop this? I don’t have the money to replace things on my own and I hate asking others for money to replace things that get broken over stupid shit like tiktok.

I work near a clothing shop with just women in it , and there is a girl that a while ago just complimented the shit out of me , I'm 18 and don't have that much relationship experience so I'm quite afraid of losing a friend if I try to date her.
She told me that everyone in her shop likes me for how humble I am , and that she really liked meeting me ( she is leaving the job today) and that for our ages someone like me is rare, she also commented that one day I will find a girl that really sees the true value in me , I answered with the same thing that she would find a guy good for her someday too.

There is one point tho,I commented I was interested in her with one of the security guards at the mall and he told her I was interested in her directly, she asked me about it and I said she was pretty and my age so probably yes and asked her if she had a boyfriend 
She said she didn't have one and the conversation just ended there because customers walked by.

I’ve posted lots of about looking for a career and stuff, but I’ve finally settled on one I’m really interested in, becoming a diesel tech. I’m wondering exactly what all options I could take though to become certified and work ready, aside from going to school. 

I wouldn’t mind going to school, and I’m sure there’s a good amount of financial support I could get from it due to being in a low income household and having divorced parents (some sort of tuition coverage, I’ll have to look into it).

The only reason I’m asking is because I’d be interested in an apprenticeship or some sort of other on the job training program, mainly because I’ll have to be working full time whilst I go to school, and would rather just work a job that trains and prepares me for this career rather than spend 16 hours a day at both school and work.

433,"This post is really hard to write and I seek advice.

I'm 21F and got into medschool (Balkans, no debt). All my life I thought I'll be a doctor and never really thought if I really want to do it. Sun shines, sea is salty, I'm going to be a doctor. My parents and I even choose my HS thinking that with it I'll get a better foundation for medicine. I never really partied and went out because I was always studying and escaping into fantasy books.

We are a middle-class family. My parents aren't doctors, only dad finished college. They are afraid for me because they think I'll repeat their mistakes. They’re usually rational parents, but if I didn't follow what they have imagined for me, things turned ugly. They are very afraid with the situation in the world and think that being a doctor is the only safe option. My happiness isn't important.

Month before entrance exams I began having second thoughts if I really wanted to be a doctor. But parents pressured me to write them. I wrote them, not really thinking I'll get in. I barely got in. My parents were aware of my uncertainty, but we agreed that I at least go 1y and if I don't like it to transfer. I didn't like it. It was very boring and hard. I hated just memorizing. I always had a mathematical mind and hated that type of learning.

I again told them that this isn't working out. They went ballistic and said hurtful things. How stupid I am, do I want to see a psychiatrist (in sense, you are crazy and only crazy people go to psychiatrists). If I give up, I'll always be a failure, you young people think you know everything, we won’t be paying for this BS…

I failed 1. year. We had many conversations like the above. I was sick of fighting, and it not going anywhere. I tried rational arguments and appealing to their emotional side. Nothing. Just if I drop out, I'll always be a failure. They won't ‘let me’ attend 2. college because I'll just waste time there. Why? Because I'll drop out because I'm a failure. Whenever I tried to explain to them it ended with me crying. I was insulted and persuaded by ridiculous shit that were disguised like rational arguments e.g. if it was so bad everybody would drop out, don’t you feel guilty you took some kid’s place…

I wasn't going to ruin my future just to please my parents. I don't have the means to move out, so I lied. Told them that I’m attending classes I failed. Instead, I went on a pause. I didn't know in the beginning which college to attend, so I started attending various seminars. Accidentally, on a seminar I found my dream college. Math. To be a math engineer. The speaker’s story resonated with me. She talked about her job and it is exactly what appeals to me.

When I was applying to colleges, I haven't even thought about that one because my math teacher was awful and I thought I was bad at math. Actually, she was a shit teacher and I wasn't learning correctly. I changed my studying methods and begun understanding what I really struggled with in HS. It became fun and I was loving it. My dad discouraged me from attending that college because with math I can just become an asshole math teacher who heals his complexes by torturing students.

In our last conversation about all this, I told my parents my desire to attend the math college. THEY LAUGHED AT ME. That is the moment I decided to shut up. I won't tell them I dropped out and transferred until everything is done and they can't do anything about it.

I got in! The only thing now left is how to tell them. How do I tell them so they don't throw me out? I’d like to support myself, but college is time-consuming. I won't say that I haven't attended classes. I'll just say that I finished first year so that they can't tell me why haven't I at least finished 1. year. In sense, look how smart I am, I finished something I hated from the depth of my soul just you can see that I'm not stupid. I don't think they'll throw me out, but am prepared if they do. They'll probably cool down when I pass first exams.

How do I start the conversation with them? Bluntly, telling them; ‘I finished 1. year. I hated it from the depth of my soul and I entered college you think I’m too stupid for. I know you don’t like it and think me a failure, but if you have any amount of affection for me, financially support me this school year and if I really fail, you can go NC with me and never see me again. But, if I pass please support me until I finish my bachelors.

This whole situation is very sad because I’m very ambitious and am doing everything to succeed, but my parents are being in my way because they think I’m too stupid to succeed if I don’t follow the well-lit and structured plan. They just want me to be safe, but they are going totally wrong about it.",29Sep2020,1

436,"I’m (21F) currently working as a software developer, a company took me in as a student so they’re about teaching me the ropes and giving me simple assignments to get the hang of programming and such since they’re aware I haven’t really gotten a degree yet. At the same time as I’m working, I’m studying an extra course of mathematics since I had a bad run with education and I’m trying my hardest to get into university to study Computer Science. 

I spent a month focusing on learning mathematics because I need to get the hang of it before March 2021, where I’ll be taking an exam for Mathematics to enter the Computer Science course. I didn’t go to work on that period of time. It really mentally drained me to study so much but I feel like I am now knowledgable and confident enough to just leave Maths on a little back burner while I go to work. 

Thing is, I kind of shut myself off during that month of studying. I had just come out of burnout from an intensive course I had dropped out of, and just managed therapy, so I’ve never been too good at informing things to others or writing messages. Today is the first day I’m returning to work, and I will only try to be there for two hours at a time because it’s making me feel really anxious that perhaps I won’t match up to expectations. Especially with a month (!!!) I didn’t appear after having been there for 3 days every week. 

I’ll try my best to explain what’s happening, what I did this month since I feel like explaining over WhatsApp is futile. Is this an okay step to take? How can I get over this anxiety?

I don't know how I thought our relationship was good before. I think I was manipulated into thinking it was and I just recently started realising that this isn't a healthy relationship. To keep it short, my dad would always hurt us then play the victim. He'd say he's sad and hurt that he had to yell at us and hit us and would have us feel bad for him. We weren't allowed to be gloomy or sad about what he did to us, we'd have to act like we're still happy and interact with him like nothing happened. And if we did act sad he'd blame us for ruining the mood and we'd be forced to act happy or else he'll get mad again. And the cycle would repeat itself every once in a while. I don't know how to deal with this now I always believed that he is the victim and it's my fault that he got angry. I always blamed myself so I never thought he's wrong. I don't know how to proceed from here. I want to move out but I can't. In my country I'm not a legal adult until I'm 21. I can't work without my parent's consent.

I can't even go to a therapist to try and fix my situation without his consent. So I'm stuck until I'm 21. I want advice on how to deal with this situation until I can run away and never look back.

Sorry if this is long.  I had 3 friends (known one for 10 years, one for 5, and one for 3) who were incredibly important to me whom I loved very much. I accidentally told one of these friends, lets say friend A, personal information (that I didn't know was personal) about the other, friend B. Once I realised that I shouldn't have told them, I asked them to not mention this to my other friend until I;d told her about what I said, as she is very short tempered and acts without thinking sometimes. But they didn't listen to me and told her immediately and added a bunch of fake details to make me look bad. Long story short, I fixed things up with friend B and she accepted my apology, but when I asked friend A why they told her after I asked her not to and why they lied about what I said, they blamed everything on me and started accusing me of manipulating and abusing my friends. A &amp; B talked an entire day about me and all the bad things they'd thought I done, despite my requests to talk offline and ask them what they meant as they were being incredibly vague about the issues I'd caused, and decided to cut me off completely and inform me that no matter what I would always be a terrible person. They soon told friend C this, who without any details cut me off. I suffer from bipolar disorder and anxiety that was the product of an abusive childhood, and this really drove me to the breaking point. I honestly considered killing myself a few times (not to get them back, but to stop feeling so disgusting).

I don't know if I really was a horrible person to them and if I could have been better because they never explained what I actually did that hurt them. Most of my close friends agree that friend A was being a bitch and it's a good thing we're no longer friends, But I've known B &amp; C for so long and I cannot stop dwelling on these relationships. Its so stupid and pathetic and juvenile but I spent so many years with them and I trusted them with important information. Recently C has started going out of their way to insult me online over txt, which makes me dislike them but the main issue is one of my closest friends has started to take a liking to both A &amp; C and cant see how it has affected me. He even goes as far as to cancel plans with me to go see them. 

I'm unsure of whether or not to be mad because I shouldn't control the people he sees and I should just accepot that he likes these people. But I can't stop feeling like he views those relationships as being more important. And why the fuck can I not get over these fucking friendhsips???

444,"So I have:

1. Primary job that led me to good relationship with employer and somewhat managing position. I like it but I don't want to spend so much time and efforts on it (5-6h/day, sometimes evenings and rarely weekends)
2. Secondary job which I started only month ago. It pays exactly as primary job, but this one is not managing but something in my specialization field
3. My specialization - I learn Applied Math at university. 3rd year into Bachelor degree. I really like it but it suffers a lot because of lack of time.

So, the shit is my education suffers. I will finish my degree no matter what (it is not that hard for me at my specific uni to stay afloat). But I would also enjoy actually studying.

Also, I want to pick up a hobby. Probably gaming (as I did before). Because now I have time for only exactly 1 cs go game per day, which is about 30 minutes. And even this is very satisfying tbh

Now, my secondary job will finish first stage in late October. Then second phase begins, and I can either take a bigger role there which will eat all of my remaining time for a nice pay, or stay about the same, or leave completely.

And my primary job just sucks this month. I'm not sure what will happen next, but this particular month was a nightmare. It's a decent pay for me now, and I like my duties and an employer, but I'm not so sure I wanna stay. 

The last: my employer will be very upset if I quit, because a lot of stuff is on me and he will lose a ton shit of time and money to replace me. He is almost my friend now, I don't want to let him down. However, he says I should finish my degree.

453,"I've (32M) been having a really, really hard time for the last few weeks. I've recently developed feelings for my best and closest friend, and while I keep wondering if little things she says says and does could give me hope, and while she definitely has an attachment to me and has explicitly said she wants me in her life long term, I think it's safe to say she sees me as too much of a friend to consider me. So, I don't know that I can ever tell her how I feel without potentially losing the friendship, and I really don't want that, as she's very important to me.

So, having to swallow down these feelings is hard enough. But it just really kinda breaks my heart thinking that two people who can potentially be so good together just can't get together. And don't get me wrong, I'm not naive enough to think we'd be ""perfect"" together, or anything, I mean, obviously you can't know such things without actually dating someone. But we have such a great foundation to build off of. Even before I fell for her, just as a friend, she's someone I'd do anything for. I'd move the earth for her, if I could. I'd do anything to make her happy. And she probably doesn't even fully know I feel that way, heh...

Even though she only recently ended her very long term relationship, it's probably not going to be very long before she finds her new guy. And I do want her to be happy more than anything. But there's always going to be a part of me that wishes it could be me. I wish I could be the guy that makes her heart race, that she has a twinkle in her eye for, that she wants to hold close and never let go. I want to be the guy that gives her everything she wants out of life (heck, we both want the same things, so that would be a mutual gain).

I dunno. I've never been able to date, ever, and as badly as I want to be with someone, I've never found anyone that gets me excited about the idea of dating. Much like everyone else, I always hoped that I'd find a partner that would be my best friend. Sadly, I've found my best friend, but... It looks like I can't ever be with her, at least not as more than that.

And to be honest, that scares me, because I can't really imagine meeting someone that excites me more than my friend does, someone I truly care about as much as I do my friend. And as much as I want to be with someone, I don't want to end up in a relationship where my partner isn't someone I truly ""love"". I don't want my partner to be someone that makes me think ""Eh, I guess this is fine"". But given my track record, along with my current feelings, and I just don't see how I could have anything but.

I dunno. In general, I wouldn't say I'm an unhappy or depressed person at all. But all these recent thoughts and feelings are bogging me down quite a lot lately. I don't feel like myself, I've lost interest in most things, I can't get much sleep at night. And I just don't know what to even do with myself, at this point.

I feel that I lack the ability to form good habits, even basic habits that most people share, as well as the ability to mentally commit myself to anything beyond a few days of work, I have absolutely no work ethic, and the interests I do have get pushed to the side in favor of laying in bed wishing I had something to do. Sounds like depression, I know. This is something that has been consistent throughout my life, since I was in 5th grade. I am now 18, graduated high school, but waiting for college.
This deep underlying feeling that I have, to put it simply, absolutely no idea what I’m doing with life.
I have struggled in school to pay attention, to the point where I zone out of entire classes and never do any work. I seriously can’t remember the last time I automatically remembered to do schoolwork, so I failed and had to retake many classes.

455,"I have been in a relationship with my wife for 4 years. We have a child and we've had 4 VERY nasty years relationship wise. Full out war. 

This year, we've managed to stop it. We've stopped the fighting almost completely and manage to get along. However, things are far from ideal. We're both still struggling to find peace and genuinely thrive in the relationship. 

Earlier this year, after reaching a really low point in my well of darkness, I finally sought out therapeutic help, and, with the help of a great therapist, have made HUGE progress with my anxiety, confidence and ability to love and accept myself. 

However, I still require a person to routinely listen to my uncertainties, to my interior conflicts, to nestle my vulnerabilities. I have always expected, aside from friends, that my partner should be the one to do this since it's such an intimate thing. But she simply wont. Me talkimg about what pains me triggers her in aggressive ways. I realize this is because she needs to fix her own issues. But she wont go see anyone.

My final point is: I am receiving this fundamental, emotional support from my tgerapist, it was very difficult for me to even accept it, since ive had a lot of trouble vulnerably connecting to anyone at all. Its made me stop beimg resentful towards my wife, and its actually made me more willing to give her the support she needs.

But sometimes I feel it amounts to emotional cheating in a way. Like, my vulnerabilitoes are the thing I wamt to share most with a partner, and it makes me incredibly sad that I can't. And theres no way to do this with my wife, not until she gets her own help.

460,"Hey everyone, 

BACKGROUND INFO: Without going into too much personal info; the company I work for offers us company vehicles that we're expected to use for work (carry equipment/tools, travel to meetings, travel to sites to troubleshoot and repair) but with the additional perk of being able to use it personally (taking it home, using it to go shopping, hell even going camping, etc)

We're not given gas cards but are re-reimbursed in our paychecks for business miles and are expected to pay for any personal miles (no issue there).

At least as the policy stands currently (the company has plans to revise it heavily the beginning of next year) were able to do one of two things 

1) Pick out basically any vehicle we want within reason as long as its under a certain amount (lets say 30k) and then anything over that amount you pay out of pocket from your paycheck. (Lets say your truck is 3 grand over the limit you may have to pay say 50 bucks a month out of pocket for the whole lease period of 5 yrs)

2) Pick from a list of ""recommended models"" like a van, truck, car, suv, etc with basically no bells and whistles but you don't have to pay anything out of pocket at all. 

Most of the simple maintenance is on you such as oil changes, breaks, tires, etc. 



QUESTION: Now that the background info is out of the way here's where I need some advice. I'm eligible for a replacement company car and am not sure if I should just keep what I got or upgrade to something new. 

I'm currently driving a smaller SUV which for the most part hauls all the tools and equipment I need it to but is down right disorganized and finding what you need in a pinch or knowing what you have is difficult. Plus I'm usually unloading stuff to free up space for bigger things if the job calls for it. 

The gas mileage is pretty great (roughly 30mpg avg) which is a BIG perk as I put in about 300 personal miles a week just going to and from work and then on top of that usually an additional 300 business miles (sometimes more sometimes less. Maybe between 100-500 miles)

I guess cheap maintenance is also a perk as with a smaller vehicle everything's a bit cheaper. I should mention that this vehicle is nearly at 200k miles and I know it'll probably get to the point of requiring more and more maintenance that will probably end up coming out of my pocket. I know on certain things the company will pay portions of but at the end of the day its not my vehicle and even if I only have to drop a few hundred bucks in an engine or a tranny I dont know if Id feel comfortable. 

I should mention though that so far the vehicle hasn't really given me any big problems. I keep up on oil changes, make sure the tanks always full, do breaks, get tires when needed, all the basic crap. To be fair I probably idle the car more then I should but in the few years and nearly 200k miles ive put on it the ol girl hasnt left me stranded. There were a few random glitches but ive only seen them happen once and then never again since. 

If I was to get a new vehicle I'd probably get a truck and then personally buy a contractor cap to put over the bed as I dont want any of my stuff left out to the elements. Id be able to get a lot more stuff on me so in theory less trips just to get supplies, I'd be able to use it personally for lowes runs or to move big stuff from point a to point b.

The few big cons I can already predict (and I'm sure you all can think of some) are

1) Bigger vehicle = more expensive everything. Tires, breaks, oil, filling up, etc. I used to drive an old 90s V8 in my younger years and boy did that thing like to eat money and drink gas.

2) Way worse MPG. Like I said I get maybe 30mpg avg and I'm guessing on a good day I'll probably get 15-20mpg with a half-ton truck. Business miles arent necessarily an issue but personal is. That's basically a guaranteed 300-350 personal miles a week.

3) Harder to Park/Drive. For the most part I'm fairly confident driving a truck but where I work I may occasionally need to parallel park or park in a parking garage. I could probably find ways around this but I know its something to keep in mind.

4) Winter driving. Our winters are unpredictable in my state and I live in more of a rural area where sometimes  our roads arnt always nicely salted or plowed. I know trucks even equipment with 4wd handle a heck of a lot more different then my shorter awd suv. Im sure with a cap full of tools and equipment I'll atleast be slightly more stable with the added weight in the bed but still. Its a longer wheel base and not much you can do to counter that to my knowledge. 

I've always wanted a truck (I have a super small 4ft bed truck personally not through the company) and honestly having to borrow my fathers pickup to do any ""real"" hauling is a lot of needless back and forth plus I just dont like having to put miles on his truck.

Plus the added organization and space would hopefully allow me to do my job more efficiently. I also wouldn't have to worry about equipment sliding around and destroying my vehicles interior like I have to worry about now.

So what do you think everyone? Is it time to get rid of my current company car and possibly dodge future maintenance bills and down time or should I just keep it for the time being and try to make it as efficient as I can by building some shelves and whatnot?",29Sep2020,1

Finally got her (10F) to admit she stole a substantial amount of makeup from me (eyeshadow palettes, lipglosses) after a year of her denying she’s been stealing from me. She started crying and I was tired of looking at her, so I sent her away. 

Stealing and lying is EXTREMELY in character for her, she’s stolen substantial amounts of money from family friends, my mother, her friend’s parents. My cousin cannot be trusted because of this- my mother hides Christmas funds in my bedroom because of it.

465,"My best friend is struggling with severe depression and I couldn’t get in touch with her for a couple days. I was really worried so I called her work just to see if she was there today or not. I called a mutual friend later in case she had heard from her. Turns out my call got her into trouble at work. Which caused her to have a panic attack, which meant she had to be sent home early. And I didn’t know before I called but- she is currently switching medication so I basically made her day a living hell instead of making sure she was ok. I apologised to her and said I didn’t need a reply because I know she may not want or feel like talking to anyone right now. I’m going to wait for her to reach out to me when she feels ready. But I think I really hurt her and I can’t stop thinking about her suddenly getting called into an office and being berated to the point where she couldn’t breathe all because of my ignorant mistake. I want to know, how should I act and what should I say when she does reach out to me? Can anyone who has been through something similar to my friend tell me what they would want to hear from me if they were in her position? Did that make sense? If anyone out there might know how she feels can you tell me what you would want your friend to do or say? I feel so awful and just want to do what’s best for her when she’s ready to talk to me. 
P.S She sees a psych regularly and has all of the professional help that she needs and a really great support system thanks to aforementioned mutual friend. I just want to know what she needs from me to be ok. And I’m scared of making things worse for her again.

466,"TRIGGER WARNING: THIS STORY IS ABOUT SEXUAL ABUSE.

I wanted to post this in AITA but wasn’t allowed due to the subject. 

Really long story but I’m interested to see peoples non biased opinions. So basically my mum has been married to my step dad for 20 years (since I was 4 YO) I used to be very close to him and really considered him to be a second dad to me. When I was a child my mum suffered from very severe postnatal depression after my youngest brother was born. This went on for years. I have memories of her on her worst days. I once found her on the roof with a rope made from bed sheets tied round her neck. It was really bad. But she got through it and she’s good now mental health wise or at least we thought. During this time I turned to my stepdad for parental support and comfort (I only saw my bio dad on the weekends) and we became very close. Now as an adult looking back and remembering some of the things I heard and saw, I know he has been and still is very manipulative and emotionally abusive to my mum. I even overheard a conversation as a child suggesting that he raped her. Of course as a child I didn’t understand any of this but what I heard has stuck in my head. 

This is where it gets really messed up. I have 2 particular memories that I pushed to the back of my mind for so long that I can’t quite place them, but I’ve worked out that I was around 13/14 years old when it happened. My stepdad abused me when he came upstairs to say goodnight. I decided when it happened that I wouldn’t tell anyone because my mum was unwell already and my baby brother (step dad’s bio son) was so young and I didn’t want him to know. 

For years I tried to forget about it and act normal around him though our relationship was obviously not the same. When I was 19 I struggled with my own mental health and was seeing a therapist, for the first time I spoke about what happened and after months of therapy I told my mum what my step dad did to me. Mum had recovered from her depression at this point so I felt I could tell her although it was really hard to open up about it. She was mortified, listened to and believed everything I said and asked if I wanted to go to the police. I said no because baby brother was still only 12 YO at the time. After opening up about it I moved in with my bio dad but didn’t tell him about any of it. I didn’t tell anyone anyone else except my older brother who also agreed to just act like he didn’t know to protect our little brother. My mum did confront my step dad and he’s spun this ridiculous story about how he has some disorder where he tries to have sex in his sleep and it was all a miss understanding, he must’ve thought I was my mum and he can’t remember it which I know is all lies because I was there. The things he said to me make my skin crawl. He knew it was me. And the way he looked at me the day after, he gave me this “don’t you dare say anything” look. I understand my mum was in a difficult position and she wanted to believe us both so I never held the way she’s dealt with the situation against her but I avoided seeing my stepdad as much as possible. 

Fast forward a few years, I’m now 24 living with my boyfriend (28) whom I told about my step dad last year and he has been very supportive of me.  We are very happy, got our own place and trying to start a family of our own. But 2020 had different plans for us of course, during lockdown I lost my job and miscarried our baby at 12 weeks. We grieved and cried and eventually started to heal emotionally but physically my body wasn’t getting over the miscarriage. I bled for 4 months, had medical management twice and ended up with an infection. Meanwhile trying to find a new job in the middle of the COVID crisis. And also dealing with this awful memory of being abused and the fact that he got away with it and I basically cracked. It was all too much to deal with at once. But I am a strong person, after seeing my mum suffer from depression I knew I had to act before  I spiralled into a really bad place. I decided that I was dealing with too much on my own when I didn’t have to. I realised I didn’t need to keep this secret and I shouldn’t have to. 

I drove to my mums house (he was at the pub) and I told her I’m not keeping it a secret anymore. My mums response was amazing, she said “that’s absolutely fine, if you need to tell people then do it. Little brother is 17, he’s old enough now to deal with it”. I thanked my mum for being so supportive and I said I wanted to confront my stepdad before I told people. She called him and he came home from the pub. I sat across from him, looked him in the eye and I told him. I told him I remember everything he did, and everything he said. I even quoted the disgusting things he said to me. He looked like he’d seen a ghost but denied remembering it and claimed it was a misunderstanding. I told him there was no point in lying because I know the truth, he knows the truth and now everyone else will know the truth. Told my mum I love her and walked out. I was so empowered and proud of myself. I then drove straight to my dad’s house and told him and my step mum who have been amazing. It’s not a secret anymore, all my friends and family know and I feel like I’ve got an army behind me.

This is where the problem with my mum starts. The next day she wouldn’t answer her phone and naturally I was really worried that either he had hurt her or she’d hurt herself. Though she’d seemed ok for years I was worried that my actions might have set her back. I spoke to my older brother to see if he could get in contact with her and that’s when he showed me the texts she’d sent him. Baring in mind my brother has known about my stepdad for years, this is what my mum said to him... “Your sister is out of control and has made allegations against step dad. I’m concerned about her mental health after her miscarriage and think she might have postnatal depression. Please don’t fall out with us as it’s all untrue. Your sister needs medication to help her”. I am absolutely heartbroken that my mum would do this to me, she knows I’m telling the truth because she’s known for 5 years and I had a miscarriage 4 months ago. And to say that I’ve got postnatal depression when I had a miscarriage in early pregnancy. That’s not postnatal depression, it’s grief. I grieved and I healed, I still get upset sometimes which is understandable but I actually feel really good about trying again now. 
She’s literally trying to tell people that I’m having delusions because of my miscarriage which I think is pure evil to be honest. 

It crossed my mind that stepdad might have made her send these texts so after a few weeks I phoned her when I knew she’d be alone and tried to fix things. It didn’t go well. She just kept saying that he would never hurt me on purpose. I tried to tell her she knows what he’s like because he’s been emotionally and physically abusive to her (overheard the conversation about him hurting her). She denied all of this despite being open about it with me in the past. In the end I told her if she didn’t believe me then our relationship couldn’t recover. She still said he wouldn’t hurt me and it must have been a misunderstanding. In tears I told her I love her to bits but our relationship is over. Hung up the phone and I haven’t spoken to her since. 

Should I forgive her for believing her husband over me?  Should I try and contact her to fix things again? I really don’t know what to do. I feel like I’ve lost a limb not having my mum in my life as we were so close but if she could do this to me then how could I trust her with my own children. We’re hoping to conceive again ASAP and I know I will protect my future babies at any cost even if that means they don’t have a relationship with their grandma.",29Sep2020,1

I'm sure I'm not the only one out there who's unhappy with government and the state of the world. A lot of things seem f'ed up now and I'd like to be a part of a solution for a better tomorrow.

* Looking online or local news to join an activist group
* Staying aware of what happens in government
* Donating
* Creating my own organization or community group

469,"So my sister and I spent ages trying to find an apartment that accepted cats and dogs(we have a small dog and a cat). Anyone renting with pets knows how hard that is. We eventually just lied about having a cat and got a place that was dog friendly, since cats are more inconspicuous. They have come by a few times for maintenance and I've had to take the cat to my moms/friends house, and I just feel like I need to tell them and get it over with, but I don't know the proper way to tell them. 

The cat is perfectly trained, very low maintenance and has all of his shots/flea treatment/is fixed. We are both very clean people and our landlord seems to like us; we pay rent early every month and we both work a lot so the house is very quiet all around.

470,"I have this one friend, I haven't really known that long but we became really good friends for a while. It was an online friend and we use to talk a lot about random shit, sometimes I'd vent about my problems to her and sometimes she'd do the same (although probably not as much as me). And then she kinda just stoppped coming online, she comes on like once or twice a month. I met her in May I think and some how she became one of my bestfriends (For context I don't really have many friends).

Every now and then, I do get really upset that I don't talk to her anymore, I have spoken to another friend about this. The other friend thinks that I might've ""caught feelings for her."" But I don't think that's the case, I don't think I like her romantically (I don't even know what she looks like lol) but I've never really been someone who understands his own emotions.

474," I belong to a group of around 20 people that plays sports routinely on Sunday every week. Recently it just came to light that one of my group members who was somewhat of a friend to me, but we're not even close or hang out on a daily basis, has done 2 majorly wrong things.

The first is that he went behind his childhood friend, who's also part of the group, and had a relationship with that guy's ex who just broke up and slept with her, secretly. And second is that he tried to rape a girl that all 3 of us knew, and he and his childhood friend were close with. I can somewhat care less about the first problem he did, but I seriously can't tolerate the second one. I can't ever tolerate a guy who tries to rape a girl, and this wasn't even done when the girl was drunk.

He just casually offered his apartment room for her to sleep in and he said he was going to go somewhere else so the girl would be left alone there, but then the girl said that he tried to force his way on her the minute they got there. I'm sickened by this story, absolutely disgusted, and frankly, I want him out of the group. Even though around 7-8 people knew of this second problem, none of them want to take the action of kicking him out of the group, and since I'm not the leader, I don't really have much say in it. I don't know if its because he's one of the oldest by age, or that they just don't want to potentially break the group apart since that asshole has built a close relationship with 4-5 members of the group (but they don't know about the problem).

I really feel like I want to tell the rest of the group, but this is a group of people who just want to play sports every Sunday, It's not like we're that close with each other (although I am close with the 7-8 that knows about this problem). Should I just settle for acting normal? you might say that I should just keep it cool since It's none of my business and all but I just can't stand the idea of being in one room with him (between the 7-8 people that knows this, 4 of them have become somewhat inactive and never plays again), I feel somewhat disgusted and angry every time I look at him and be reminded of the girl that locked herself in the bathroom of his apartment for 5 hours waiting for him to give up on raping her and fell asleep since he was somewhat drunk. I've wanted to get this out of my system so please go easy on me okay, thanks.

Oh btw, I can't really leave and find another sports group that routinely plays every Sunday since I haven't found one that I enjoy as much as this one. But if I ever do get one I'll be sure to leave them.",29Sep2020,1

Obviously this was unacceptable and in breach of contract so we contacted our letting agents, who promised to order us a new bin and clear away the rubbish. 8 weeks down the line, they keep giving us excuses as to why neither of these things have been done despite us ringing twice a week at least, reporting it to the maintainance staff when they came on an emergency job, and emailing repeatedly.


This would be annoying enough, but our next door neighbour is an elderly man who is really upset about this. He accosted me the day after I moved in to tell me he was upset by it all. I explained that as tenants we couldn't do much except continue to contact our lettings agency, and he accepted this, but over the weeks he has grown more and more agitated. He has knocked on our door to shout at us twice in the past 3 weeks, and has now taken to waiting outside in his front garden to accost us on our way in and out of the house to impress on us the importance of ""putting in a bit of effort"" with this. We have all explained to him we are doing everything we can, but he doesn't seem to believe us anymore.

We will repeatedly tell him everything we have done, and that there is little else we can do but keep pestering the letting agency, but he just harumphs then keeps going with his lecture.

2. Stay home and attend local uni and open my own business. I have already started my uni course here in my local country and I don’t like it. I hate it. The system is everything I was afraid it would be. But I have gained work experience in this one field and my parents told me that they can help me open up my own business (language school) over here.

486,"I am 21M my female friend is also 21, it's been a day since we had our fight on whatsapp she lives in other city in the same state. So basically we are childhood friends but due to my fathers job we changed cities and I lost contact with her when I was in 2nd or 3rd but 2 years back when I was in college I found her on Instagram and we connected back as if we were lost siblings meeting after a decade. We shared a very beautiful bond with each other I really liked talking to her as she was the only one I used to tell my life happenings though I didnt haven't any intentions towards relationship she already has a boyfriend (I am single) what I am trying to say is we shared same thought process we had so much in similar it's like we really were siblings in our past life. We almost talk daily on whatsapp she is a writer and fond of reading books she writes poems and send it to me for the feedbacks as I can more clearly relate her writings.
Some things were there that we havnt in common like she like cats and I like dogs very much. We used to share cute dogs and pics to each other and everyother stuff we found cute or interesting as we shared similar likings.
So a month ago she told me that her mother has started liking dogs and want to have one as a pet and the other day we were casually talking and she shared a pic of baby rabbit as it was very cute I acknowledged the pic and asked what about your mother she wanted a dog na? For which she replied that her mother has changed her mind so I replied ohk you should have a cat as you like cats very much for which she replied we are not getting anything and laughs , for which I also laughed and sarcasmly replied yes afterall they are feeding you on the other hand and that's fine for which she replied ' Yes, but I really love to be called a Billi'(Hindi word for a cat)
[Basically I am a fun guy and try to make people laugh with genuine sarcasm in the texts as well as in people also]
So after reading that she wanted to be called a cat , Pussy word strikes in my mind and I laughed ( guys seriously I have been using that word since I watched Tom and Jerry and for some time I only knew the meaning as cats only but when I entered in my teen life and in college I found that people are also referring cowardness and also Female Vagina as pussy because of which people most don't use pussy when referring to cats generally as it now has different meanings.)coming back after pussy word strikes my mind I laughed and  sent many emojis of laughing to her for which she thought I was laughing on her liking for cats so she replied ""asshole I love cats hunh"" so then I wrote "" yes I know you love cats but you want to be called as a Cat, you won't get it and that's ok"" some laughing emojis more. Here I didn't mention the word pussy but In my mind I was laughing because if I say you want to be called a pussy (which genuinely I meant for cats but it has some other meanings too that only makes that word double meaning and a urge to laugh) now back to chats after reading that my message that u won't get it she replied "" I got it , and I can't believe you are the same person I talk to everyday and share my poems with fuckoff"" I was in utter silence and in confusion like is she joking but since I knew her she wasn't joking and I instantly replied "" you got offended ??"" She left me on seen, I sent some more question mark but it was bit late i was tired so I slept. The next day I was still left on seen and again texted her to tell me what happened why have you got offended and what did I say that u got offended this much that made her to say that she can't believe I talk to this person everyday ( like seriously I got hurt it is a deep pain from a close friend like her to say that statement it matters to me and it has left me in shock and a question mark on my character) now again coming back to chats she never told me how she got offended so I got frustrated and explained my point that u said u wanted to be called a cat and I referred that to the word pussy that has double meaning that's why I was laughing
But guys she was mad as hell I really didn't realised that I  made her disappointed and a big mistake just by using or giving a thought of her wanted to be called a cat. I had a very hard time explaining her that I purely meant for cats for the word pussy but guys she wasn't ready to hear a single word from me and was cutting all my explainations , it went like for hours I was trying to explain her that I used to use word pussy just for cats but she took I still don't know like I think she directly took it to vagina and because of I laughed on it that time that made her mad. But it havnt came on any conclusions but we kept on arguing more and more explaining our view and she kept on neglecting my view , I accepted that I didn't know you will get mad from the word pussy and I am sorry you would have second told me that and I would have never used that word again in between us but she just wrote that one sentence that broked my heart[ I CANT BELIEVE YOU ARE THE SAME PERSON I TALK TO EVERYDAY , I SHARED MY POEM'S WITH ]
guys I really respect every human being regardless of any classification , and I respect myself very much for that but listening that one sentence after all our years as a close friend it shattered me and I am loosing my very close friend from which I shared my almost everythings.
I also apologised for using Word pussy giving explanation that I meant it for cats seriously but she hasn't accepted and is saying no u meant vagina only. 
She isn't sorry for what she said about my character and said almost 10 times that she meant it she meant it.
We decided to quit explaining to eachother and I left her on read.
Guys please tell me if i was wrong and I shouldn't have used and told about pussy to her also tell me if I am doing right for not apologising her anymore until she is saying sorry first for what she has said about my character judging or misinterpreting me just by one word PUSSY. Please let me know guys I am really frustrated",29Sep2020,1

489,"Hi, first of all I live in the UK, if that is at all relevant here. 

So my brother (13) has had a bit of a cold for a few days, this time of year it's to be expected of course. However starting last night and continuing on throughout today he has developed a continuous cough, been going on for many hours at this point. I explained to my mother how a continous cough is one of the main symptoms of Covid and according to our NHS, enough to warrant a test. 

However she has just dismissed this entirely and said I am overreacting, that he is only coughing because he had a cold and it cant be Covid. She refuses to waste time getting a test, has left the house twice today already and even sent my other younger brother (11) off to school. 

Am I overreacting here? I feel like we need to be self isolating as a family, getting a test and waiting for a negative result before we go about our normal lives.",29Sep2020,1
490,"Hi Reddit, Im super confused right now and just really need some advice even though I think I know the answer

I have been in a relationship for 3 years. We met sophomore year of highschool and fell in love fast. It's been amazing, I love her so much. We were extremely close and I saw her as much as possible, sometimes daily over the summer. We were so madly in love. The past year has been rough for us. She (and I don't really blame her for this part) has changed her birth control like 4 times and each time throws her hormones everywhere and she admits her mood has been hard to control. We have been arguing more often and she is extremely clingy. Don't get me wrong I'm clingy, but it has felt unhealthy with her. She would guilt trip me if I couldn't see her for one day or something even if I had legitimate reasons.

Two months ago I moved four hours away to college. She is still a senior. 4 hours may not seem like much, but seeing each other has been hard. On some weekends im very busy with homework or band rehearsal and simply don't have time, plus my car is a gas guzzler so the trip usually costs me (a broke college kid with no income) 40-50$. This has been hard for us too, since I moved we don't talk as much and bicker more

Our first big argument since I moved was these weekends. Some weekends I really just want to hang out here. I've made new friends and have become really close to my roomates, as well as he want to explore my new community and campus. She has felt extremely depressed about this. She feels as though she's holding me back from having fun and I'd be better off without her. while sometimes I would rather be going out with my roommates I stay home to FaceTime or drive home on weekends because I love her more than I want to hang out with my friends. She just takes it super hard even to the point of telling me not to come home so she doesn't stop any plans I had. This hurts me deeply (which I've told her) because I DO want to see her, that's my girl I miss her like you wouldn't believe. But she thinks she's stopping me from having fun

The biggest problem, is the girls next door. I live in a co ed dorm. The girls next door introduced themselves to our dorm on the first day, just trying to meet people. We have all become really good friends. This made my girlfriend jealous off the bat as I was hanging out with these new girls some nights (a couple times she could hear the girls and my roommates talking in the background while I was in my room face timing her). I have developed a crush on one of these girls. I hate myself for it. I know I'm unavailable, and I love my girl and will never cheat. I can't just avoid these girls or cut them off. My roomates and them are all good friends now, we get dinner pretty much daily. If I cut them out I will have no friends on campus. Especially during this pandemic I really appreciate having people to hang out with or share a meal with.

Part of me thinks I'm just lonley being so far away from my girl so now a cute girl I'm hanging out with a lot is making me crush. But the other part thinks ""long distance never works, especially highschool, you should just pursue the new girl and break it off"". The second part terrifies me. I can't imagine life without my girlfriend. I mean we know everything about each other, we've been through everything together. Years of love. I can't lose it, I don't know how I'd restart with anyone. She's the one, right?

Tldr: I have a girlfriend 4 hours away from my college, but long distance has proven to be very difficult for us. Breaking it off seems impossible to me, Should I try to pursue new love?",29Sep2020,1
491,"I've met a domestic abuse victim over the internet. When I found out what her parents do to her, I knew I had to help her escape, and my first thought was that she could come stay with my family. We are well off and have space, and she's on board with the idea. We decided we couldn't do it before her 18th birthday because the police might drag her back. But her 18th birthday is soon so I'm planning out expected obstacles in convincing my parents to let her stay with us. If necessary I will offer to pay them.

My biggest worry is that my parents will insist she go to some kind of shelter instead. Before you ask me: it's not even my decision. The friend is adamant that nothing will convince her to go to such a place. She seems to consider it worse than staying where she is. (I don't know if she knows something she doesn't want to say, or if it's just trust issues about going with strangers or something else.) So I could use help predicting the things they might suggest (ie. shelter institutions that would take an 18 year old), and reasons against them that will appeal to typical Catholic conservatives.",29Sep2020,1

Im 26 years old male and like most guys have loved boobs since knowing what they are as a young adult. The older I have got the more my addiction has got worse, walking in the street I automatically look at women's chest area first, boobs are always on my mind, only natural and bigger than a C, I dont like small boobs 

I go on dating sites like tinder and just search for girls with big boobs hoping to chat them up and get pictures or meet, I have found all the subs on here that post boobs and I'm constantly looking for new pictures of big  natural boobs (C cup or bigger) I find myself waking up in the night horny just for boobs

Is this normal or do I have an actual addiction? I dont even care what women look like I only go for their boobs, I can't keep a relationship because I haven't found a girl with big enough boobs who will put up with me

494,"I’ve had a friend of 20 plus years repeatedly borrow or ask for money.  I’ve told her I can no longer help and other than groceries I have not.  Since COVID she’s began asking my elderly mother for money now. First time my mom volunteered some  when there was a fundraiser for this  friends family member ( but gave it directly to my friend for her use through a hard time ). Then with a few weeks my friend asked her for more. I think this triggered the problem with my mom .  My mom , being very generous and caring , gave again.  Five weeks later another call , this time it was adding up to 1200 being needed and my mom says it would have to be a loan. Well , since it was a loan, my friend wanted to make it 2000.  Luckily my mom discussed This with me this time  told me she felt uncomfortable with it. We all had a chat. There were other solutions , including cut backs , pets insurance (she forgot  about?) and a daughter who’s capable helping her.   So my mom loaned her a smaller amount we all agreed on about 9 weeks ago.  Also this person uses an extremely large amount of marijuana, it’s where her money goes and I think she’s heavily addicted. She’s on disability , which in Canada is quite survivable , and she also works , which pays for the pot. She does hard physical work so she’s capable a lot of the time. 
She’s now lost the job , which had a boss that let  her smoke pot every hour , and has now called my mom again to tell her of several woes which I think are a prelude to a money borrowing call. She has also told my she won’t receive an inheritance she’d hoped to have with which to pay my mom (and me ) back for maybe another year more , but she told me two weeks ago it was getting settled probably this fall.
Also my mom forgave the loan as she couldn’t recall if she’d said it was given or a loan the last time. This is frustrating to me and it’s why I don’t want this friend contacting my mom telling her about  her financial  issues.  My mom forgets.

I’ve told my mom to not answer when this friend calls. I’ve messaged the friend and asked why she didn’t discuss this with me  and I got a flimsy answer. I’m at the point where I do know I need to make sure this stops. But my question is has the friendship been compromised. I have fostered this to a large extent. I did manage to get her to stop doing this to me.  I know we teach people how to us so.

So a couple years ago on my steam account, which I only played TF2 on, the main or Home Screen of steam glitched and it was so odd and to be quite honest I don’t even exactly remember what the screen was but whenever I tried to load up steam, there would be like weird numbers or stats (graphs if I remember correctly) it was like it was in another mode or something (I don’t even remember If what I’m describing is correct as I don’t remember that well) and I could not fix this issue and this screen would be up whenever I opened steam.

497,"This has never happened to me and while I still remember this miserable dream I will relay back to you. I’m still crying as I write this.

I’ve only had 2 hours of sleep because I went to bed at 12 am and woke up at 2 am and the reason I woke up at that time was because I had to get up early for a call of duty event for warzone season 6 and livestream it. I had worked till 10 pm the previous day and was very tired. After 5 hours of live streaming call of duty from 3am-8am, running strictly off of caffeine I went to bed and woke up crying at 9:39 am because of my very sad dream.

A lot of what I just wrote will not make sense as I was trying to write it all before I forgot it I literally just woke up.

My dream was very crazy, I dreamt I was in a call of duty world of sorts but it was also real life as my family was also their.
My buddy’s on the game were also their. 

I was so so sad in this dream constantly saying to everyone “I cannot take this anymore”. I was so depressed over the fact that everyone in my life would die and that time moves so quickly. I really wanted to talk to someone about my problems. I was even at work at times and I got so angry over the fact that my eye sight was becoming worse. I was supposed to type a . with the key board I had for a customer but everything looked like a . and I become infuriated.

I was angry because I thought my eyesight was getting worse because of all the time I spend on video games and I began thinking they were a waste of time which then spiraled into my other sad thoughts of how time goes by so fast and how everyone will die and life will be over so fast.

I was also nonstop being spawn trapped at a point in the dream by the enemy team. The dream was chaos to be honest and every single bad thought I had was being turned into reality. I even started to think my gaming YouTube channel I had worked so hard on was pointless.

This was by far the most wildest dream I have ever had, I have never in my life woke up crying of sadness. Please help me some one. Should I just disregard this dream because I was running off of such low sleep and that I went to bed immediately after call of duty or is their something more to this?",29Sep2020,1

499,"Hello! I'm posting for the first time do please show mercy and I'm writing on mobile so i don't know how formatting is going to be. Also English is not my first language.

I'm in senior year of high school (corona isn't that bad here so we're back but wearing a mask is obligatory), which means I'm graduating this year and I'm getting my school papers (?) this year. So it's important for me to have a good gpa since in my country these papers are required for some positions. The first week of school, I had my first class, which I expected to be pretty easy since I never needed to work to much for it. Anyway, my professor comes in and instead of teaching, she starts complaining about having to wear a mask, how the masks are restricting her freedom and then went on a rant about Americans who ""recoluted"" against the government when similar action was taken there. (Worth noting is that were 25 people per class in relatively small classrooms).

I ignored it at first thinking she's just get bored sometime and stop, but it only got worse. She went from complaining, to full on bashing any kind of science. For example, she also said that vaccines are restricting her freedom and people in China didn't die from coronavirus but beacuse of 5G antennas. At that point I told her that coronavirus also exist and I know that for a fact, since family members have been infected and unfortunately, it didn't end well for everyone. In response she repeatedly asked me ""Did anyone die? No, it's all a lie"". I was more or less crying at that point when I told her that someone in fact did, and I also informed the vice principal afterwards, who was very helpful and took action along with the principal. Today was my first class with the same professor after the incident and she was very strict about mask wearing for herself and the rest of the class, but I'm afraid she'll mess with my grade to ""teach me a lesson"". What can I do to not let that happen? Any advice is helpful, thanks in advance.",29Sep2020,1
500,"So i live on a ground floor apartment with roomates and we all happened to be out except for one but she was on her way out. Shes pretty strange and likes to sit in her car for like 30 mins to an hour before actually leaving so while she sitting outside of her window in her car she sees a man cut our window screen and open the window, head inside the apartment while 2 others go through the door and she freaks out and calls me and my SO and the police right after. So while the police were on their way shes scared for her life so freezes up and is hiding in her car and she sees one guy jump through the window and run off. After the police come and everything settles.. nothing is missing, window was left wide open and then they find the truck that my roomate was describing that she thinks she saw them leave out of, down the street. They find contractors at a similar address and same tactic.. ripped the window screen open to get inside. Police calls the landlord and so do we and he offers a settlement of 1000. 

I dont feel like 1000 is right but I’d really like to keep it out of court because of the contractors, they made a mistake, didnt take anything and it seemed like from what the cops told us they dont seem to have papers to stay in the counrty and putting them through the courts would send them back to the countries they came from and i dont really wanna do that.

501,"As some background info, I'm 18, and my siblings are all older sisters ranging up until 30. Ever since I was younger my father has been pretty aggressive to my family, but has calmed down in recent years as he's getting older. However, he's still quick to get angry and try to use his intimidation to force people into situations. With my mother being more independent financially, and my siblings growing up and standing their ground, my dad has not been getting his way in recent years, and along with being hated by his own family for his actions, I've been able to tell it has taken a toll on my dad.

My father is pretty hard headed at times and his arguments with my mother are pretty childish altogether. With this, it makes it really hard to open up his mind and change his actions, which goes for my mother too; leaving them in an endless petty fight where they're both unhappy.

So basically, how do I go about mending the situation? I love my dad, so I'd like to see him not depressed, despite him being a shit role model and person at times. I can tell in his face that he's depressed sometimes and he told me he was going to kill himself once; which I think was just a cry for help and not actually serious statement. (I definitely believe it ran through his head, but I know he's pretty religious and knows the value of life and that doing so would be a sin)

My whole take on the situation is that nothing can really change about this, and I can't do much since no matter what I say he won't change his mind. However, I'm hoping there's at least something I can do to at least make sure both him and my mother aren't miserable together forever. Thanks.",29Sep2020,1

507,"Last week I kept on hearing banging on his apartment door from the shared stairwell. The walls might be thin here, but noise from the stairwell comes through the door easily, especially this banging. I assumed it was him playing darts on the door (turned out to be a plastic tomahawk). I decided to approach him about it around 9:00 PM. I walked over and timidly asked if he could move it away from the door and to another surface in his apartment (by the way I'm mildly autistic and not good at confrontation). He dodged the question with something along the lines of how I shouldn't be bringing this up to him since I make a banging noise in my apartment. Now I haven't talked to him since I moved in almost a year ago as he lives here a few times a week and keeps to himself. I was pretty certain at that moment that the banging noise I was making had been heavy footed steps up on the loft in my apartment. When I told him that was probably what it was, he responded that he doesn't know what I do in my apartment.  So he accused me of prioritizing his noise over mine which I had no previous knowledge of (since he didn't come to me about it), and then proceeded to instead of trying to agree to work with me on solving my noise he makes a snarky remark. I then say I wish he came to me about it sooner, and then he said it's no big deal to him, but I shouldn't be complaining about his noise in the first place if I make noise. A few times I asked him for the answer to my initial question (if it was possible for him to move the target for the plastic tomahawks). He then proceeded to say that it was already set up there so why should he have to move it, which is incredibly vague. He didn't say he didn't want to move it, he didn't say it was bothersome to move it, and he didn't give any other options. So I asked a couple times awkwardly trying to get a definite answer as to if he could move it (yes or no). Then I complained that he also makes other noises that I just dealt with like yelling during football games and his loud movies (the walls are thin! I try to block most things out with a fan). It's more difficult that he's the grandson of my landlord, and it's a monthly occurring arrangement. Then after that I learned that my landlord had just had surgery and was recovering. But even before that I felt like I might have come at a bad time. I'm not sure if it was appropriate to confront him in the evening, I'm sure I came off as rude in retaliation, and he could have been in a bad mood for a number of reasons (including obviously his sick grandfather/my landlord).

Even though his reasoning was bad, I feel that I was in the wrong and am still very conflicted on what to do from here. How could I have handled that better, and should I have not approached him that late? Do I write him an apology letter and get him some kind of gift?

I also lack the education and skills to land a decent job, anywhere i go, so I'd like to continue my education. I've found a school I like, in a state that I like, with a very good program that I like. I am already talking to them about enrolling in the Spring. 

My plan is to enroll, borrow enough in student loans to give myself enough to live off of for the first semester, and if I can't handle being a full-time student + a job or two to pay my rent then I will have to drop out and try to make a living for myself in that area. 

Are there any major flaws with this plan?

I’m scared for my dad. I don’t know how much longer he can do it. Last night his girlfriend packed her bags and left right in front of us. They had got into a argument  a little while before. Literally the only time I seen him happy was when he is with her. Last night he sat on the balcony and smoked and stared at our old house for a few hours. He was also crying which I haven’t seen him do since my mom and him divorced. He hasn’t smoked a lot in a long time so I know he’s not okay. I asked him if he was ok and he said “no, and I don’t know if I will be.” It’s so hard seeing him in so much pain and I can’t do anything about it. He slaves for work and barely gets enough hours so he can pay everything. He has to pay child support for his other daughter that doesn’t give two fucks about him. He has to help my mom with the bills even though she cheated on him and then still has to pay for his own house. I don’t know what to do.

521,"My wife and I are US expats and live in Mexico. In June my mother-in-law (85yo) was diagnosed with esophageal cancer. Her condition was deteriorating so my wife went back to the US in August to be with her. Due to COVID, my wife needed to quarantine for 2 weeks and then demonstrate a negative COVID test before she could see her. The day my wife’s test came back negative, her mother was hospitalized for dehydration and placement of a feeding tube. Due to COVID concerns, my wife was not allowed to visit her in the hospital. My wife has since been at her parent’s house taking care of her dad (93yo) who has early Parkinson’s disease. My MIL was finally able to come home from the hospital this past Friday - she wants to get her affairs in order then have the feeding tube removed and then go into hospice care. It’s unclear long she will live without the support of the feeding tube.

Since she left, my wife has not been communicating very well with me aside from a few text messages every day ( She has never been one to chat very much on the phone). I feel like I really need to pry her for information and her responses are short. Last night I called her just before going to bed (there is a 2 hour time difference). I just wanted to talk and see how she was doing but she began to ask me to do a bunch of things and I told her I was going to bed and would do them first thing in the morning. She started crying and became angry and hung up. I then received a text saying more of the same along with telling me that I was insensitive and have no idea what she is dealing with.

525,"(Throwaway acc because partner knows my main account and I don’t want her to worry or know that I’m under stress over this) 

So, my parents, being my mother and step dad are really over protective. Recently I had an argument with my parents and my step dad told me that I spend too much time with my partner. My partner and I have been living together since late 2019. We have been in a relationship for 18 months so yes, I would be spending a lot of time with my girlfriend. After my step dad told me that I spend too much time with my partner, I simply told him to piss off and hung up. I received messages within a couple minutes after the call saying “you’re a little shit head”, “you’re going to regret saying piss off to me”, “I’ll show you what piss off really means” etc. Now my step dad is known to snap and say the most absurd things although he wouldn’t really do anything. However, this made me reconsider moving in with my parents although I did tell them I would move back in with them once the new house is built. 

Because the argument took place and moving in with them seems impossible, I ended up looking for places to rent as my contract at this current place I’m living at is coming to an end. I happened to have found a really nice place that is 10 minutes away from where I’m currently staying. I really like this new place so does my partner. We just signed the papers to move into this new house Oct 9th however my parents do not know about this. Now I’m awake at 3:19am in the morning typing this out and cannot sleep as I’m wondering what my parents will say as I still want to have good relations with them, I just don’t know how to approach them with this situation. I’m under a lot of stress thinking about this and I can’t help but vent it out. I don’t want to talk to my partner about this as I know she would worry about moving into this new place if I did bring it up. I don’t want my partner to worry about me either or know that I’m under stress. I just want to clear my head and get some advice on how I should approach this situation. Thanks in advance if I missed anything that might’ve been important please ask away and I’ll try my best answering most things as I don’t want to get too personal.

529,"GM - grandmother; A - Aunt/Dad's sister; C1 - cousin 1; C2 - cousin 2;

Sorry for the bad English, it is not my first language.

So since before they got married, mom dislikes GM and A because they had always been kinda snarky to her. But apparently it got worse since they got married, to the point where it's safe to say that she hates them now. After A got married, she got pregnant with C1, and my mom got married to dad. A few months after that, mom had me, and A got C2. A couple of years later, my mom had my baby brother. Now, A had always wanted to have a son, but got daughters instead. And because of that, she had always been kinda jealous. Growing up, me, C1 and C2 were best friends. Especially me and C1, we were inseparable during the holidays. As a kid that didn't know better, I looked up at A, since she had more money than us and had always taken me shopping and pay half of our holiday expenses. And I thought that since she was nice enough to pay for us, she must be a nice person.

Since I got into high school, my mom had been telling me the truth about GM and A. How they were horrible to her, especially when there is no one around, and that C1 was badmouthing me and being jealous of me (being in an Asian household, us first daughters were always compared). And I began to she A and C1 through my mom's eyes. However, me (being ""way too stupid to see the truth"" as my mom said), C1 and C2 remained close. Since then, my parents argue a lot about GM and A, because dad wouldn't back her up nor did he took her side when GM and A insulted my mom (my dad stayed neutral). I have to be honest, I did start to badmouth C1 in front of my mother too, and it felt nice at the time. But after that, I felt like ass, like I've stooped down to their level. And I didn't want that, especially since my dad always look uncomfortable whenever I or mom did that. 

These days, my mom had been talking about wanting to confront GM and A, and to hit back whenever they insult her, whether it is in front of other people or not. And my mom had been urging me to take her side when that happens. I mean, I would back her up if they hit first. But I don't want to hit first, nor do I want my dad's family to crack. And my parents' arguments had been getting louder and more frequent.

My birth name is Kassia (kuh-SEE-uh). I’ve always had a love-mostly hate relationship with it because of the pronunciation, the comments, etc. I think it’s a nice name, but not nice enough to be worth all the hassle it brings me. I’m 20 and if it causes me this much stress now, I doubt my feelings about it will ever change.

I wish to legally change my name to Kassie. I’ve asked all my close friends to call me that, and my sister (she’s the only member of my family who doesn’t call me that). I’ve told my family about wanting to change my name and they’ve all been receptive, seeing as most of them have already started calling me that anyway. I’ve always wanted a name that people read and intuitively know how to say and this would allow me that.

I think I just am a little worried about some things. I’m a terribly sentimental person and I worry that I’ll miss my name. I’m so used to saying it (from having to correct people, etc) that I find myself almost subconsciously calling myself that.

In the UK, I am considered vulnerable, I'm on medication that reduces my immune system so much a cold could put me in the hospital. Covid-19 could easily kill me, so myself and my parents are pretty against him acting this way. 

So far we've tried everything we can think off to get him to be a little more courteous to those around him but nothing seems to be working. My parents have tried talking to him calmly and explaining everything, to threatening that he's not allowed to come home without isolating for 14 days (he lives with us), to straight up telling him he could kill his sister just because he wanted to go for a meal. Nothing has worked. In fact he's going out more recently. When we tell him we'd rather he didn't go, he effectively goes on hunger strike until my mum relents.

This is how my husband feels:

He told me ***he has ALWAYS wondered who his Biodad was*** but never wanted the headache of SEARCHING. He also said ***he doesn't want to spend any money looking*** into this matter. 

My husband finally started asking his mother some hard questions about his BIOdad and here is what we learned: 

1. His name was David/DAVE Pappus (his name has changed)
2. They were neighbors in 1987 In Phoenix, AZ
3. BIO-dad (david) was flipping houses/remolding homes as work
4. of course, the Cocaine , lots of Cocaine

My ex (Ryan), a one night stand with a cowboy at the rodeo (Eddie), and a guy who is a mutual friend that is married at the place before coming here (Leon).

I told both James and Charles that the doctor said it was not possible for either of you to be the father as for how far along I was. We all decided to cut our ties and they both blocked me from contacting online.

A couple of months I gave birth to my son, and he is now looking more and more like James. He is mixed and the skin tone is more of less similar to his (I’m white). The only other guy who was black was Leon, but he was really black in complexion, and the other guys were white. I have birth early and my son had to be in the nciu. Apparently I gave birth at 37 weeks.

I messaged James from my moms account on Facebook, and at first he was communicating with me civilly, but then all of a sudden he said that he does not want to communicate with me only until after paternity is established. We both now live in different countries and the kit for my son is already at the lab while he is still waiting for his in the mail (been over a month). I keep on asking him to communicate and I really want to make things work with him and that I just made bad decisions but after each week I messaged him I am getting to understand that he seems not interested in or the kid.

I said that if he doesn’t want to be part of my life and my son then I will just leave. I don’t want someone who is going to teach him how to be mean and he deserves to be loved. This is when he says there is not point in communicating or talking about any of this until whether he finds out if is he the dad. Admittedly I understand, and when the time when it still up in the air between James and Charles he made a real effort in trying to make things work. I said to him to think of it as a sperm donation and I said that I wanted to be a single mother. I know I pushed him far away before and he said that he wanted custody of the kid. That pissed me off and I went off on him, and I said to him that I didn’t want him at the initial ultrasound. I felt bad and invited him anyways and then you guys already know found out that it couldn’t be his. I was really mad that he wanted an abortion in the first place. 

I could use just some advice how what to do? I’m 100% sure it is his but he is still waiting on the paternity test. At first James seemed like such a nice guy in reality of the situation, but ever since I messaged him 7 months later after I gave birth it just seems like he hates me. We are military so everyone is all over the world and he is in Europe and I’m back in the states. 

Our most recent conversation he said to me that I wanted to get pregnant and to find anyone that I could get to trap. I said to him that he lied when he said that we could work things and get married because that would be good for the kid, because now he doesn’t want that and his response was “I’m not a cuck” he sent his half of the paternity test in the mail and he said he will let me know when he gets the results",29Sep2020,1

Whenever someone reads my name from a list they get it wrong, but that's kinda understandable, my issue is that even if they ask me for the name, I say it correctly, one minute later they say it out loud *wrong*. I even automatically corrected people a couple of times in conversations like ""Miss Xxxka?"" ""Xxxtzka, yes.""

562,"I was broken up with a few weeks ago. It wasn't my longest relationship and i think we were only together like a month or two. 

Before he broke up with me i knew something was wrong. He would deny it and everyone around me would insist i was paranoid. Because of this i developed a peptic ulcer. 

Thing is, i had never felt like this before. I have never loved like this before. I am usually a very cold person who doesn't miss people. But this guy. This fucking guy is perfect for me in every way. We matched very well and i had never felt so at peace in my life. This man ticked all the boxes.

And then he broke up with me on the street outside his workplace. He cried and i comforted him, promised to be friends.

Its been weeks and i have met him a few times to pick up some stuff or smoke some weed or just hang out. He seems like he's doing just fine without me. I am happy for him.

But i am not happy.

Every day is agony. I feel so alone and empty. I think about him all the time and i get a lot of intrusive thoughts so it doesn't help when i want to get him out of my mind. I literally cant get him out of my mind.

My friends still hang out with him(without me). It hurts but he's their friend too so there is nothing i can do about that. 

Nothing makes sense anymore. Nothing feels good. I tried meeting other people but it never works. I can't even enjoy sex anymore.

My friends think I'm doing okay but I'm not. I have never been worse. I would like to talk about it with them but a lot of them don't understand so there is no point. Plus i don't want to burden them as they already have enough things to deal with. 

I just want to be loved man. I just want him back. I want him back so fucking bad its embarrassing. I have never needed anyone ever. But i feel like i need him.

What hurts the most is that i didn't even do anything wrong. He just decided he didn't want to be with me anymore. 
It was ""too fast"". But honestly i dont think thats  the real reason, especially when i always told him he could have space and alone time without it being a problem. I told him we could take it slower and he said it was fine. I did everything right. I was considerate. I was loving. I was honest and i tried to give as much as i got. I would literally, kill, die and live for him and honestly i don't know if he even gives a shit about me anymore. 

I am in so much pain. The only thing i can do is distract myself. I have tried fucking everything and nothing works. I want to be that cold bitch again. I don't want to have romantic feelings ever again. I really thought he was it for me. I really don't want anyone else. I just want life as i know it to end. I am well and truly shattered",29Sep2020,1

They have made many statements saying they will follow the guidelines of the health department and the state board of education.

But As an individual in November if we return to in-person learning I wouldn’t feel that it was safe. 
Not safe for the students or the faculty.

They tell me that it’s not worth quitting because
Of the benefits and pay I receive. They also keep downplaying the virus as a whole and saying that I’d be safer working in the school then any other job.

568,"I apologize because it's gonna be long. 

So.... I'll start by telling the whole story so you get the idea of what happened. 

Okay so it was around january 22(?), almost 2 months before the lockdown started in my country(india), our college was preparing for it's annual fest, and I(18) was a freshman at that time, first year students aren't supposed to help in organising the fest but they can take part in the events and it's the seniors who organise the various events and then they roam around the campus to promote their events so that the freshman can participate, now the story starts from here..... 

My friends and I were hanging out at our usual place and the seniors kept coming to ask us if wether we will take part in their events we refused almost all of them and just after that two girls came and stood in front of us they too were seniors(two years older than me since they were third year students) they started to tell us about their event, I decided that I'll participate in their event since it seemed interesting and I already knew one of those girls I mean we weren't exactly friends I just knew who she was, but most of my attention was on the other girl because she was the prettiest girl I saw in my college so far, I was thinking, ""this girl is soo beautiful... WAIT is she beautiful or is she cute...."", we gave them our names and participated in their event, after the girls were gone my friend said to me ""Hey did you notice that girl she was very cute"" and I was like ""yeah she was"", the domino effect started at that point because I didn't really think about the girl that much but that sentence from my friend made me think about it more and more...... The next day I was wondering if I'll see her again and surprisingly I did, during our lunch break she came into my class to promote another event and this time I asked her for her number using the event as an excuse although I didn't really use the number until later, after that I saw her almost every day during the span of the fest and whenever I saw her I couldn't help but stare and she even saw me two or three times it can be called stalking to a certain extent but I could never bring myself to start a conversation, after the fest ended I didn't see her that much, there was one time when she was passing by the corridor and saw me looking at her and it seemed like she was irritated by it and it was then that I thought ""what the hell am I doing this is so unlike me"" and so I decided to apologize although I had her number I didn't use it I used Instagram to message her and I apologized, she said it's fine and I shouldn't take that seriously, to me it didn't really feel like I apologized because I wanted to do it in person but I didn't message her after that.... Days passed and it was march already, I had this feeling that if I don't talk to her I might regret it and this feeling was killing me I mean i obviously had crush's before but i never felt this way, the problem was that i knew she'll try to avoid me as much as possible so i decided to use whatsApp but i was sure that if I outright started a conversation without thinking about what I am going to say then she will definitely block me so i constructed a message, it was funny(or at least I believe it was) and kinda flirty and it worked she didn't block me and we had a small conversation, I didn't really message her because I wanted to date her or anything I personally couldn't care less about having a girlfriend, I can think of two reasons of why I messaged her, first I think I wanted to know her better and second i am an introvert I don't make more than necessary friends but this time I wanted to become her friend even though there was no rationale behind it so I liked that feeling... After that conversation I thought that I might get a chance to talk to her and apologize in person for stalking her however the next day I didn't see her in college I thought that she might be absent but turns out she was present I thought ""well doesn't matter I'll do it next day"" But the next day never came since the government announced lockdown because of the rising covid cases, I didn't stop chatting with her though, but I didn't do it often because, for an introvert like me it's hard to come up with topics when I want to talk with someone who i hardly know so I chatted with her only once a week I occasionally flirted with her and it didn't seem like she was bothered by it in fact she was very friendly, I did realize that she couldn't care less about these conversations but as long as she isn't bothered by it I thought it was okay although I did make sure that I don't say anything rude.....the story ends there. 

Days went by the lockdown still hasn't ended(obviously) and i never called her or anything but I was chatting with her just fine up until now but recently while I was chatting with her I asked her a question which can be considered mildly flirty it wasn't rude or anything(or at least that's what I think) in fact compared to some other times I flirted with her it was nothing, she saw the message but didn't reply I thought she might be busy the next day I saw she still hasn't replied so I asked her if I said something I shouldn't have, she said ""no it's not that"" and she gave a reason for which she didn't reply and it was believable so I believed it and then I said ""well since you didn't answer my question yesterday you can do it now"" the message did reach her but she didn't reply she didn't even see it it's been 4 days and it's still unseen I know that she hasn't blocked me because I can still share status updates. 

So I don't understand what I should do now should I leave it that way(which I don't wanna do) or should I do something about it?, it hurts getting ignored when I don't even know why I am getting ignored, I don't understand what's going through her mind she was so friendly up until now. 

If you are going to make fun of me then please don't bother because I already know how stupid it is but I just don't want it to end this way.",29Sep2020,1
569,"Ok, so I (20f) just recently went through a break up.  Although it was a serious relationship, we’ve both pretty much moved on pretty quick.  He got a girlfriend and I’ve been going on dates and having sex with a few guys.  We’re both happier now and that’s what I wanted for us was to be happy, even if it wasn’t with each other.

Well, anyways, there’s this guy that wants to fuck me.  I’ve know the guy for a long time and he’s a sweet guy, but it’s awkward thinking about fucking him.  He is practically like an uncle.  AND LET ME MAKE THIS CLEAR, THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO BLOOD RELATION BETWEEN US!!  Let me go back a few years.

When I was 11, I moved from Arkansas to Louisiana.  My dad met the guy when I was 13.  Him and my dad smoke together.  He always seemed to like me over my sister because I would make jokes with him and my dad while they smoked and they thought it was funny (I would also like to say, my dad would not let me smoke with him and his friend until I was 16).  He never tried anything when I was underage.  He never touched me or made advances.  He was actually a really sweet guy.  He didn’t even try anything when I turned 18.  So I figured he was just really close with me and didn’t think much of it.  (A little information, me and my parents have a very dark sense of humor, so we joked he was gonna jump me when I turned 18.  That’s why I said that.  He also made it obvious he liked me more.)

Well, I’m 20 now and I was smoking with my and and him.  (The guy is 35 by the way).  We were watching an anime (We are aware we are weebs, we know) and it was funny and sad and very graphic.  So, we were making fun of it.  I, being the only female in the room, played the female that had her shirt ripped open.  (Again, very dark sense of humor.). And of course, my dad was in the room, so it’s not like I was gonna tear open my shirt and bounce my tits around.  So, I re-enacted the part with my clothing on lmfao.  And the guy is staring, HARD at me.  I was stoned, so I didn’t think much of it.  My dad seemed to notice tho.  And he got mad at me when the guy left the room.

I didn’t really understand what the problem was and my dad didn’t make it clear.  So, I just cut back on the re-enactments and just started making jokes like I usually do.  Well, again dark sense of humor and me being open about my sexual adventures, (my dad and mom are the same way) my dad would say something gross or sexual that him and my mom did/do and I would pop off with something I did with a guy.  We laughed, my dad gagged, repeat process.

Well, after he left the house, my mom came up to me and was picking on me and saying I was flirting and showing off.  But in all actuality, I really wasn’t.  I was just being me.  Stoned me, but me.  I tried to explain to her that I wasn’t trying too, but my dad was pissed at me for the way I acted.  But I was just my normal stoned self.  And then it hit me, the guy was staring awfully hard.  And that made me realize, my dad wasn’t mad at me, he was mad because I was being checked out by his friend.

Well, it’s a week and a half later, and I get a message from the guy.  He sends me a couple of funny pictures.  Now, I don’t usually talk to the guy through messages.  Me and him never really contact each other.  That’s more of him and my dad’s thing.  But, I wasn’t totally weirded out by it because it was just memes.  I send memes to people I just met lol.  But then he starts talking to me.  Asking me if I had to work tomorrow, or if I was busy.  I was getting a weird vibe, but I kept talking because, well, he’s a really close family friend.

Then he starts talking about what happened that night at the house where I was talking about my sexual adventures and the re-enactments.  I apologized and asked if I made him uncomfortable and told him I wouldn’t be doing it again.  He told me he didn’t mind.  He talks for a few minutes and then asks the question I honestly never thought I’d hear from him.  “You wanna fuck?”  I was taken aback.  I was shocked he would even ask that.  But... I didn’t say no.

We talked for a bit and we set up a place and time.  But I feel like I’m doing something bad.  It’s not like I want to be in a relationship with him, because to me, sex is just sex.  I felt this way at another time when so fucked a good friend of mine.  I didn’t regret it afterwards, but it felt wrong all the way up until the deed.  We are still friends to this day.  So, I’m really on the fence about this whole situation.  And knowing him and me, neither of us would tell.  And it would just be a one time thing.

I plan to slip a note to the waiter/waitress warning them of him, the fact he’s a scammer, what he’s going to do etc &amp; that they should be prepared &amp; not to hesitate to call the police if he tries to walk out, and also to pass this on to the manager/ whoever else needs to know. 
If [friend] asks what the note I passed them was, I’ll just say it was my ‘dietary needs’ as a cover. I’ll also confront him when he complains and point out the fact he already said the food was fine etc to make it difficult for him. Do you guys think this will work/ any ideas for improvement?
Or any better ideas altogether? Please let me know!",29Sep2020,1

575,"My husband (28m) and I (26F) started home shopping about two weeks ago and we’ve seen around 12 houses in person and crossed several off virtually (online viewings). 

We had three homes we really liked, but the first home we felt like the seller was asking around 30k too much even after putting a bid in, for context it’s still on the market. 

The second one had some carpet that needed to be replaced so we decided to think on it, only for it to sell
within 24 hours. The next one had an AC unit that needed repairing and some repainting I wanted to do. We figured we’d think on that one too and the next day it was gone. We saw another last night that we were told sold hours after we looked at it.

This has led to me feeling frustrated because we have a largish budget, but these houses are selling so fast we can’t even think on them before they’re gone!

My husband isn’t feeling pressured by this because we don’t need to move until Dec-Feb, but I’m worrying how many near perfect homes we can pass up on over small affordable fixes before we screw ourselves out of “the one” and never find another one like it?

Are we being too picky? I’m thinking maybe we are. We’re looking for a 100% perfect turn-key home, but don’t want to build a new construction. 

How many homes is too many to view?",29Sep2020,1

Over the last few days ive been exceedingly pissed off about the state of the world, I just feel disgusted by the way the majority of the population treats each other and the planet, sometimes i feel like the only one who actually thinks about other peoples feelings, and is conscious of the consequences my actions bring. On top of that, ive also been exceedingly pissed off about how I, and most children are brought into this world. Having a child is the single biggest responsibility that anybody could ever possibly take on, yet people are having kids like its a fucking novetly and that inturn breeds the type of people who don't give a damn about anything unless it effects them directly. Sometimes I want to do everything I can to help this world, and other times I just want to burn it all down and rid this beautiful planet of our disgusting existence.

So at the beginning (a few months ago) we just ignored each other except when I had questions related to work. But he always stared at me and helped me once when a customer was screaming at me. 
Over the time he went from ignoring me to greeting me and staring more often at me, even laughing sometimes when I did something clumsy.  (I kind of started to get a crush on him)
But on Saturday I talked to my sister on the phone (at the end of the shift) and asked her if she could pick me up. He just stared at me and since then he went back to ignoring me. 
And now I had to quit my job due to personal problems and Friday will be my last day at work.

I thought that I might write my number on a piece of paper with a little message on it and put it on his space at work (each employee has their own little space on a shelf). I don't know if it's a bad idea and if I come off as desperate and dumb.

586,"I'm at the point where I'm lost on what to do.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was in the middle of pursuing my bachelor's degree, I did an internship in research. The content of the internship was basically to plan a whole paradigm starting from the initial idea and later conduct the experiment as my bachelor thesis. Throughout the whole internship, my supervisor was negligent. They just nodded through everything I presented to them, no own ideas from their side, nothing. I had invested several hundreds of hours while they might have invested 5 hours tops when the internship ended (and these were again nodding or some really minor recommendations). They even signed that I had done everything independently.

After the bachelor thesis (on which they praised my writing, so it couldn't have been anything about my writing style) they told me that they would probably write a paper on what \*we\* did with them as first author. I told them that I would like to write that because I did like 99% of the work. They told me that while I did the work, they had supervised it (I mean, if you want to call that supervision). 

After a year they offered me a shared first authorship which I accepted (The shared authorship still includes that I do all of the writing, but I really want to keep this project). 

The original data were collected with fMRI but they later collected behavioural data (not they themselves but again through students). Now I recently got to know that they submitted a paper with the behavioural data - which are 100% based on my work - before we even started to write the shared paper. And I'm neither a co-author nor am I mentioned anywhere. It will practically seem as if this paper of them is the basis for the shared fMRI paper.

This whole situation makes me super uncomfortable. Since recently, I started working in the same department as they do, so I don't know how I should go about this. The whole thing seems like theft to me.

What I feel really unsure about is how other researchers perceive this type of situation? I understand that if a student only collects the data, they will not be co-author or anything but I basically did everything. What are my options here? What can I do? Should I do anything at all?",29Sep2020,1
587,"Hello I need some advice or help. I am dating someone that has a child with someone else. The other person is jealous that my partner is in a new relationship and they have have stalked my social media and have harrassed me off and on for months. I have filed multiple police reports for harrassment but did not feel the need to get a restraining order put on them at the time. The phone calls stopped but I have been harrassed on social media by their friends trying to add me to find out what i look like, etc. The ex messaged me a lot and tried to be friends but they have a switch and they turn a completely different person so I blocked them. Well this person has harrassed my partner with prank calls and calls and messages to the point where they are blocked on everything except their parent is allowed to call. But apparently now I have been labeled a psycho and I am harrassing them because I responded to the dms and tried to be friends at first. Then when they turned i blocked them. I have been sent messages now that they are taking me to court for harrassment. Is this possible? When they have multiple reports against them for when they harrassed me. Is there anything I can do to find out if they are really taking me to court? We live in different states. So that was one reason I did not get a restraining orfer was because they gave me the run around and both told me to do it in the opposite state. So reports are filed  both states.

588,"Hi all, so to jump right into it - I've been friends with this girl since like kindergarten and we are now 25. She and I have always been close and rarely ever got into disagreements throughout our lives. She came out as lesbian right after highschool and people tried to get me to turn on her by saying things like ""Isn't it weird that you guys slept in the same bed all those times?"" and I alwayyyys defended her and said no, because it was not weird to me. She never made me feel uncomfortable and even if she had been attracted to me why would that matter?

Regardless, she got into a bad situation a few years ago with her then-wife. They had conceived and during the pregnancy, they both got addicted to meth. My friend wasn't the one carrying the baby and she hid the addiction well. So well that her mom called me one day and told me she was being sent to a rehab in another state and that she needed a lot of support. I started crying because I hadn't noticed it at all and I felt so guilty. Granted I was away at college and only saw her on the occasional facetime. 

A few hours after I got that call from her mom I was mailing out an envelope of a letter and many photos I had run to get printed off. The photos were of us throughout our whole friendship, her daughter, and her family with little notes on the back of each reminding her that these are the people who love and need her to get better.

Fast forward to now, she's a year and a half sober and we live about an hour apart since I moved out of our hometown. I miss her and I don't want her daughter growing up not knowing me. So, last week we were talking and I said I wanted the three of us (her, her daughter, and myself) to go to a pumpkin patch or something fun. She agreed and sounded super excited. I reminded her yesterday that it was next weekend (she can be very forgetful) and she said she remembered and was excited. But today, she sent me a message saying ""Hey, I invited my friend and her 3 kids to come with us. Is that okay?""

For me, no, that isn't okay. We haven't seen in other in quite some time and I was clearly very intentional about planning this day around the three of us enjoying time together. I don't even know the person she invited and there will be 3 other children in the mix. I wouldn't mind so much if she hadn't just done it without saying something first - because now I have to look like the asshole and say no, or I have to go and not enjoy myself because she is obviously more concerned with including this other person than with catching up with her ""best friend"" of 2 decades.

I just feel unappreciated. I feel like I have really been there for her through a lot of shit that other people would have distanced themselves from. And I don't want a pat on the back for being a decent person/good friend. I just want a good friend in return.

Am I overreacting or was this rude of her? I thought about just telling her I can't go anymore and to have fun with them, but I feel like I shouldn't have to suppress how I feel to accommodate other people fulfilling plans that I initiated. Please help.

590,"So I'll preface this by saying I'm a pre-everything trans man, by which I mean I'm a man stuck in a woman's body, and I haven't taken hormones or gone through surgeries yet. I also turned 16 VERY recently ((18th september)), and I'm pretty sure he is 17.

So, around two years ago, I made a (male) friend, I'll make this short but he had a crush on me, which when turned out to be unrequited, he started telling everyone he was aromantic and asexual.   
We stayed friends until march of this year, when it was found out that he had been talking shit about my (at the time) relationship with my boyfriend. It was abusive, and he was victim blaming me, almost saying I deserved it, this of course made me stop talking to him.   
I only contacted him again in July, and after being friends again, he told me, right before we went back to school, that he didn't want us to see each other anymore, as he still had a crush on me. I told him off and the only interactions we had since was him trying to manipulate me into feeling bad for him.   


Here is the problem, this man, who was still in love with me, spent a lot of time at my house, is above all in the same class as me. He's almost constantly near me, and always staring at me while I look for a seating place. 

It all makes me very uncomfortable, I feel very scared of him but no one around me seems to believe or take me seriously. My own mother brushes it off, and the school staff is already agaisnt me considering I'm trans and need special changes to school for me to be able to attend it.

The present I got last year is a keyboard(of the musical kind), but I have no place to practice with it. If I want to play, I need to place it on my lap, which makes it hard to play, or by carrying it downstairs to the living room, where the rest of my family is (and they will then complain about the noise.). The present for this year is a 'holder' (I don't know the word in English) for the keyboard so I can stand and play.

Lately I have been practicing with the piano at school and have become much more interested in playing, but have no way to play at home, and can at most play 30 minutes every few days at school.

The question now is, do I ask my parents if I can just get the present instead of waiting for the 'ceremony' of my birthday. My parents used to care about it, but lately it has been getting less and less attention, so they'll most likely allow it.

My MIL has an aneurysm that is fairly serious and complicated. The doctor recommended an experimental procedure to increase the chances of long-term success but MIL decided it was not worth the risk and went with a stent and coil procedure. She had the stent placed about two weeks ago and needs to go back in for the more complicated coil procedure in a few weeks. She is also overweight and a chain smoker. My SO has mentioned to her that she needs to stop smoking in the past but I've never seen any effort made. She now just tries not to smoke in front of us, but she is a fairly aggressive smoker. If we're with her and her husband for more than say an hour they'll ask us if they can step out and smoke and any time we go over there, they're smoking and quickly trying to put it out before we see.

Her surgery and build up to has been hard on everyone, of course mainly her, but I know my SO is emotionally drained from the worry, risks, and doctor's consultations. I also imagine that a doctor must have told her to stop smoking, especially now, but in case the doctor hasn't, there is so much literature online about the health-risks of aneurysms in smokers, especially those going through stent procedures and their chances of success. I feel unjustifiably upset with her for putting her family through all of this. I had hoped that prior to or if not then maybe even just between the procedures she would try to quit, but alas we went over the other day, and there she was smoking. I know that she is an adult and will do what she wants to do and that I cannot change that. On the other hand, I am starting to feel resentful that she is putting everyone through this when she isn't going to give herself the best chance for survival and long-term success that she can. I have never been a smoker, so I can't speak to or even sympathize with how hard it is to quit. On the other hand, I have to believe that your children repeatedly asking you to quit, and then seeing their pain as you go through brain surgery has to be some form of motivation to give yourself a chance?

601,"Hi Reddit. So my roommate and I moved into our apartment in June and things were great until August when our new neighbors moved into the apartment next door. We are the only two apartments on our floor. Immediately things weren't great because they would be playing their very very loud music (bumping bass) at all times of the day. I work from home and this was extremely distracting and upsetting. Our previous neighbors were quiet as a mouse. So I texted our building manager and told him about the issue. The next day the new neighbors confronted me and said that I shouldn't go to the building manager to complain I should tell them directly. They knew we had reported them since we are the only other apartment on the floor. They gave me their phone number and said text them if there is an issue. Since then I have texted them three times asking them to turn their music down, but truthfully many more texts would have been warranted. The weekends are also so loud and they have parties Thurs-Sun. I am a homebody and a quiet person so this has been causing me so much frustration, disappointment, and anxiety. There is also a very very strong smell of marijuana that takes over our hallway and apartment whenever they smoke. They also have a little yappy barking dog that barks NON STOP for HOURS after they leave. This is extremely annoying as well. But I come to reddit today with this post because this morning I heard them having a MASSIVE argument with a lot of violent words. There was slamming doors and cursing and was definitely a domestic dispute. I because scared because I thought that they were going to come slam on my door and try to confront me for complaining about their noise again last night. I had a moment of fearing for my own safety. I am afraid to report all of this because they know I am the one who reported given I'm the only other apartment on their floor. This is scary because I think there is some no-so-good happenings next door but I am also afraid for my own safety if I report. I requested to my building for an additional lock to be put on my door.

604,"So this just occurred maybe about 20 minutes ago (since making this post). My wife, my 6 year old and I are currently at my parents house and his school is offering for him to be on their ""Microsoft Teams"" recorded meeting (it's live, but they record it).

As a quick back story, I recently started a new job that while I enjoy it, it's been extremely stressful on me, because it's a completely remote and this job is expecting the world from me, so my stress and anxiety levels have been at an all time high. (I know the easy answer to leave this job to find something better, but I'm unfortunately not in that position). I'm trying my best, when I officially shut down my computer, to take out a bad work day on my family (getting upset at small things, annoyed by everything, etc.), but I've noticed that my default reaction is telling my wife some dark (and sometimes morbid) humor. 

Example: ""What a day. I'm gonna go take the car and probably drive off a cliff now"" 

Please note: I'm, in no way, suicidal or plan on acting out anything I say. It's just my unfortunate sense of stress-humor (if that's a thing)

&amp;#x200B;

Back to 20 minutes ago... I came downstairs after an extremely stressful morning meeting and my wife, who's sitting with our 6 year old, looks up at me and shakes her head, because she's exhausted from sitting next to him (he tends to get antsy just sitting an listening). So because I see my wife's reaction and I'm also slowly coming down from stress, I immediately raise my hand and do the ""gun to my head"" gesture and pretend to pull the trigger. Her mouth immediately drops and she goes beet red, to which I'm immediately confused (I've done this gesture to her before). She mutes our childs mic and says ""you do realize he's live on camera and they're recording this entire session?!?!?!?"" And I immediately panic and try to tell her ""they probably didn't see me"" or ""I was probably too far away"" and she immediately freaks out.

I go back upstairs because I have another meeting and she proceeds to text me things like ""I'm so embarrassed and I'm so terrified that you did that. What if a parent re-watches, see's it and reports us?"" 

Sidenote: My wife has VERY high anxiety levels, which she's seeing a doctor for.

I try to tell her how sorry I am and that I had just finished a stressful meeting, to which she ignores and says ""now I have to sit through this entire video to see how bad it is."" I'm currently sitting upstairs, pretending to be in a meeting that won't start for another 15 minutes, only because my anxiety levels are through the roof.

Here’s another example of the same day; we were all swimming and I had intention of getting in the water, I’m not afraid of swimming lol but it was cold so I was only up to my waist, joe starts up again by constantly repeating “get in the water don’t be a pussy, it’s not cold, get in” and he just kept saying it over and over again so at this point I decided not to get in because he was pissing me off.....how do I act and what do I do to take control of these situations? How can I be the assertive one for once? I lack assertiveness and I think that’s my problem. My friends also think joe is annoying but don’t care because he doesn’t do to them what he does to me. I have a feeling in my gut that he behaves this way because he is intimidated by me in a way as I am much better off than he is and in a more public setting people (usually girls) but also people in general tend to gravitate to me more than him at bars and parties and stuff.",29Sep2020,1
607,"So I have recently moved to a new town to start a job. I’ve met all my co workers and have been working for about 2 months now. They’re all very nice but are at a different part of life than I am. They have wives/husbands, buying houses, etc. my roommate and I are civil but don’t get along well. I’m in my young 20s and have no interest in starting a family any time soon or settling down. With COVID, my normal ways of meeting people my age (bars, community sport groups, clubs, etc) are all closed. I’m starting to feel lonely and really want to meet a group of people around my age I can text/hang out with after work. College made it easy with classes and events but COVID is kind of ruining any ideas I have for meeting new people. Any ideas?

TL;DR - moved to a new town after college to start a job. Coworkers are great but not in my age group. How should I meet new people during COVID?",29Sep2020,1
608,"Early on in the relationship my bf shared a video of a porn star Jessie Rodgers last porno where he said she quit after doing the video. He said he wanted to watch the video together with me so we could critique it. He sent this in May. I watched it tonight and felt absolutely sick as I've seen rap* fantasy stuff before which is nothing new but this video was NOTHING like that. Everytime she said no and covered her privates they choked her and held her limbs back and it was horrifying to watch. I don't know what to do. He said she knew she quit after the video so that to me shows he knows it was messed up. any advice especially a male perspective would be appericated

609,"I'll try my best to keep this brief.  My boss is retiring.  I've been sort of verbally promised her position which would be a modest promotion for me.  I met with my boss's boss yesterday and I tried to ask her about it and she sort of beat around the bush about the whole thing because of ""the budget climate."" And we never really got to address it.                    
Really what I want to know is am I 1.) going to get the job and the salary that goes with it and if so what sort of timeline am I looking at for that, or 2.) expected to do both my job and my boss's job and get no raise at all.

610,"I (26) have been together with my husband (26)for 9 years and married for 3. I never noticed anything before, but he used to always complain about his fathers behavior. I thought he was over reating until we were moving to a new house and I moved in with my in laws for a month till the house was ready. I understand now why my husband was complaining, my FIL is emotionally abusive towards my MIL. He fought with her family and even before that they were always not good enough for him. Now he wants her to cut contract with them all together. After a while when she protested that and would go against his will, he would stop taking to her the day before and after the day of the visit. She would cry herself to sleep because of that. He also would throw a fit if something didn't go his way,like if she chose another doctor than the one he did not like. He is also very hard to please, once when she was younger and was still recovering from  a cesarean section after birth the fireplace started  smoking  and he was at work, she had to clean it herself with a crying newborn in the next room and in pain. When he came home he was angre because she wasn't as pretty as it should be,he said that a wife should be dressed up nice and with full makeup when her husband comes home. He never touchs her and never kiss her anymore, it's been like this for years. So I think all of you get it now. I understand that this is emotional abuse, but she always cry and say she hates her life with him and wants to leave. But never do it because she is afraid she would hurt her children (she only have two my husband 26 and my BIL 23).i tried to tell her it's okay just leave him he is a jerk, but she never listens. My mom was angry at me for even step
stepping in and telling her to divorce him saying it's not my place and to let her be. But it pains me to see her like this.

611,"I’m 18f. My sister is 15f and she’s been having horrible body image issues. I don’t know for sure when it started but it’s only gotten worse over quarantine. 

She tells me constantly how she thinks she’s fat or “obese” which is simply not the case. She can point out so many flaws in her appearance that is genuinely scares me. I’ll help her pick out an outfit and she’ll turn around and say she’s too fat for it or how she wants to just “cut off her stomach.”

I’m scared, I don’t know how to help her. The worst part is I’m so convinced that her feeling this way is my fault. She mentions all the time how much smaller I am then her (which is hardly the case). She’ll complain all the time about how I look in comparison to her. 

I try and wear oversized clothing so I don’t upset her or hunch over when I’m changing just in case she happens to walk in. I’ve tried talking to her and saying that she looks the same as me, but she want listen. She tells me how me being even the slightest bit smaller than her “keeps her up at night.” I’ve also tried to explain to her that my slightly smaller stature has a lot to do with the medication I’ve been on since I was a child, but she doesn’t listen.

I feel so much pressure over this situation and how to deal with it. I’ve just started university as well, so the anxiety I feel for that is not helping. I’m starting to feel so drained because all I want to do is help someone who doesn’t want to be helped. My parents wouldn’t be able to help the situation either, since my sister “doesn’t like them” and wouldn’t want to seek help from them. 

To make matters worse she wants to be a model and it’s the only thing “keeping her going.” I’m terrified. I’m so afraid that I’m at fault for how she’s feeling and, like I’ve mentioned a lot, I don’t know how to help.

I’m sorry for the longer post, but I hope it gives some context to my situation. If someone is able to give me even a bit of advice on how to help her, I would appreciate it so much.",29Sep2020,1

They got mad and told me they’d cut me off and there was a lot of animosity from them. My boyfriend has two weekends off a month and I go home the other two weekends. Their grievances included the fact that I stayed the night there (they’re old school) and that I don’t see my family often enough. My boyfriend says that I do have more freedom now as an adult and I should be able to do that since I’m not living over there and I keep up with my schoolwork. My friends offered to start dropping me off there, but sometimes my family pops by to visit him and it would be weird if I’m there and my car isn’t. I’m looking for any advice here, for the situation itself or how to see him without “getting caught.” Or if it’s just a case of what happens in college as part of growing up.

613,"I suppose another question is, should I try to help her? Basically, my sister is about 30 yrs old, and this isn't her first time acting the way she is right now. For days, she has been hearing voices and seeing things that nobody else does. She's been convinced that people are talking about her and hiding around the house, but in the most bizarre places; yesterday, she made me watch as she poured boiling water on her mattress to demonstrate that someone was definitely in there. Obviously, nothing happened except that her mattress was wet.

After that, she asked me not to leave her alone, and then proceeded to take a pocket knife and cut the mattress in half. Then she jumped on it, trying to attack it for about an hour. It was very hard to watch. I, along with a friend of hers, convinced her to seek psychiatric help and to go in for a voluntary hold, which she agreed to. However, she then got drunk, took a 2 hour bath, throughout which I could hear her sobbing through the walls, and whenever I would check on her, she would never tell me what was going on.

After her bath, she went into her closet to cry for about another 30 minutes or so before she decided to go sleep on the couch (recall that she destroyed her mattress). She continued to sob on and off for about another hour before she passed out. I knew it was a rough night, but I thought it would be okay when we took her to get help today, but I was awakened by her ringing our front doorbell this morning at 7:20 AM. Upon letting her in, she informed me she had been out trying to ""catch a 4 AM train,"" and I don't know if she was literally trying to board a train at 4 AM or if she meant she was trying to die by standing in front of one. Honestly, at this point, I don't think I want to know what she meant.  

When she came in, she told me she needed to pay somebody, and so took her wallet and went outside for a moment before returning and telling me she was on heroin. We talked for a moment, then she told me she lied about the heroin because she ""wanted to be interesting for a moment."" She then detailed a new plan she had for herself to pack a singular bag and go live in the woods. When I asked her if she was still going to try getting psychiatric help, she said no and a whole bunch of stuff about how nobody is ever there for her and so on and so forth about how bad she feels for herself (stuff I tried listening to and talking through with her for over 6 years, which is why I now believe she just feels more comfortable with the familiar feelings of loneliness and self-pity).

At this point, I feel tired from dealing with her behavior, and I already know that talking with her about all of this is pointless. If I was a professional in this field, I think I would probably call a 5150 on her due to her erratic behavior, but I'm just her brother. I feel like, if I'm this tired of dealing with her disorders and shitty person behavior, I probably don't have the right to decide whether she should be made to try and get better. Maybe she will be happier living in the woods without modern conveniences, or maybe she'll just realize that her survival skills aren't as suited to the wilderness as she thinks, but either way, I feel so distant from her that I shouldn't have a say in what happens to her life. I know that I want her to be happy, or at the very least not miserable, but I feel like I've done everything I can short of literally forcing her to get better.",29Sep2020,1

About 15 minutes later, the same car returned, pulled up a little further up from me, and a dude with a black mask that covered most his face came out, all dressed in khaki but with no bearings of a company or anything. The dude comes out, pops open the trunk, takes out a package (can’t remember if he wore gloves fuck) and walks a block further down from the one we’re on to deliver the package. I didn’t get the exact house he went down, just the direction. But why not just pull up in front of the house if you’re going to deliver something???

Then she continued to ask me if I wanted to be her sugar baby, that she has 9 clients. I told her I was straight and she said I know. Honestly I was very uncomfortable but she told me all I would have to do is talk to her. She wouldn’t expect me to send her anything sexual. We would talk like we are friends. Anyway my boyfriend and I agreed we should take the risk because we are in need of money. At first I didn’t believe what she was offering but then she screen-shotted a conversation between her and a male and posted it on her story. It showed her saying to him that she sent money to his account. I agree since she said I wouldn’t have to do anything but talk to her. So basically I’m being paid to be her friend. She told me she sent me a payment of $3000 and showed me a cashapp screenshot saying the $3000 will be deployed until I send her $100. She said I had to pay her the $100 so she knows I won’t run off with her money. Anyway last night at 1am I asked her if she could send me $5 just to prove this is legit and she says her “company” won’t allow that. Does this sound like a scam to you? Could she scam me via cashapp even though I have no credit or debit card linked to it and just a cashapp card? I need advice. Thank you guys.",29Sep2020,1

624,"Hello,

I lived with this friend last year in college. We had an apartment together, but I’ve moved out and am now living with people on my rugby team. I moved out for a number of reasons. He would get very angry if I ever mentioned having girls over and he said it would “really piss him off”. He hung up weird art all over our apartment, such as prints of baphomet, demons, and other weird things. The final straw that led to me moving out was when I was in the shower he would text me to get out of the shower so he could pee before his class, even though there were bathrooms on the 1st and 2nd floor. He then unlocked the door to the bathroom and thought it was perfectly fine. He was surprised that I was a little angry that he did this, and expected me to have my phone while I was in the shower. He would also never go out with me anywhere (which is completely fine I understand everyone is different), but he would try to dictate who I was “allowed” to have over. If I did anything that was “not how he liked it” he would grow extremely angry. But whenever I grew upset with anything he blew it off and would blame me.

Fast forward to this semester I am living with guys on my rugby team. The only time my other friend texts me is when he wants me to buy him alcohol. He never asks me to hangout, never asks how I am doing. He texted me a few days ago and I told him I would go to the corner store with him. I took 7 minutes to reply to his message after this and he blocked my number. He then messaged me on Twitter saying he would still want the alcohol, and I said “are you serious? You just blocked my number for no reason .” And he proceeded to beg me to buy him alcohol for like 30 minutes, then he blocked me on Twitter. 

He has blocked me on Twitter, Snapchat, and my cellphone number around 7-8 times over the course of spring semester last year —&gt; to right now. I have known him since high school, but am not sure if I should just stop talking to him? Whenever we talk, whether it is in private or in a group message, the only topic he really talks about is “how much he hates women” and “how men have it unfair”. 

It is honestly draining and I am really considering just cutting him off completely. I am unsure of how to go about this without hurting him or his feelings? I have known him for a long time and am one of his only friends.",29Sep2020,1

626,"I'm expecting absurd responses, but it's been 2 months and I'm strong enough to deal with it...but honest answers would be appreciated.

A brief back story...over the years, my family added cats through marriage, loss and discovery at a shelter, and an inability to leave furballs behind at shelters. At the peak, we had 7 in house, which was just enough for all of us. The youngest was named Otis. At the shelter, he chose me when I walked into the room of stacked cages full of kittens. When I looked at him, he literally pushed his head and body through the bars of the top cage and attached himself to my head.

He was ugly. My wife hates it when I say that, but when he was young, he had a werewolf face and weird colorings but his attitude was beautiful. He took ownership of our full-sized German Shepard and could herd the dog until he got the attention he wanted from her. He had no fear, and he shared himself with every member of the family.

Otis was my Thunder Buddy, and as an IT guy that works from home, he spent hours each day on my lap. It was our routine. He had his spots around the house, and he would rotate through them to make sure he spent enough time with each family member. Morning with Son 1 as he wakes up. Mid-morning with the wife. Mid-day on my lap at work. Afternoon in the public area. Evening above my head as I gamed. And nighttime with Son 2 as he fell asleep.

As years progressed, we lost our cats to illness and age...over the course of 9 years. We told ourselves that 5 cats was probably the sweet spot for cats in our house. Maybe 6...but 7 is probably too many. After 9 years of intense companionship, Otis broke his routine, began to hobble around the house and squeak when we picked him up. He spent his days in the basement. After being diagnosed with cancer and struggling to breathe, we made the difficult decision to help him to the rainbow bridge.

It was that day that I realized how substantial Otis was in our lives. We loved all our cats, but over the years, we were able to find comfort in the rest of the furry family. It hurt to lose one, but the pain could be eased. The loss of Otis was devastating...because we realized that we only had 1 cat left in the house, and that one didn't really engage much.

For a family that had 7 cats, and felt that 5-6 would be a good number to maintain, we found that one Otis was capable of satisfying the furball needs of every member of our family...for years. Otis was our rock. Otis was who greeted me after business trips. Otis was there during trauma, and played in the wrapping paper on Christmas.

In short, I've had many cats in my life, but in the short 9 years of his life, Otis turned out to be legendary. I would never diminish the love or value of our other furry mates who've passed on, but for decades we've been a family of animals, and somehow Otis dominated the entire feline category and filled our hearts to the point where we never felt the need to ""restock"".

&amp;#x200B;

I shared that story because, I'm staring at a box of his ashes, and a ceramic imprint of his pawprint on my desk. Writing the story above was more painful than I'd planned, so I guess it's still a little raw. I am looking for a way to do something special to honor him. We aren't looking to bury him at our current house as we may be moving. We don't want to scatter the ashes somewhere, as he was a housecat and I can't think of a special place that would be fitting. I've searched the Internet, but it's not easy to come up with a proper search for honoring a deceased house pet.

Money isn't a problem. My son plans to cast the pawprint in aluminum as we have a backyard forge and extra foundry sand. When it stops hurting, we'll certainly get a nice picture up on the wall. And yet, I've struggled to figure out some way really bring closure to such a substantial life. Seriously, I now understand the concept behind the viking funeral. I don't want some sort of statue around the house, as that will never be Otis. I already donate to the shelter and ASPCA. 

I want to memorialize a friggan legendary cat, that effectively filled our hearts with 7 cats of love. We'll have more cats in the future...probably getting 5-6 in the next few years...but I don't think we'll be fortunate enough to get another Otis. I'm turning to the Internet because I'm not exactly a creative person, and I feel like I'm failing miserably at this task.

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: I had an epic, legendary, amazing cat that passed away in his prime. He burned the candle at both ends, and is irreplaceable. I'm looking for realistic-yet-creative ways to honor and memorialize the cat, because I can't seem to come up with anything epic enough. Seriously, if he wasn't scared of water, a viking funeral wouldn't have been out of the picture. If I lived in a big city, I'd probably pay for a month of his picture as an advertisement on a building.

I ordered prescription glasses online and when I received them the prescription was off so I took them to my local opticians for assessment and they confirmed that the prescription wasn’t correct (cost me). 

Emailed the shop to inform them and they said send them back to them...so I did. Now they are saying they checked them with their supplier and the prescription is correct and they won’t refund me. 

Obviously I knew their was something wrong when I put the glasses on, so I’m 100% sure they are not the correct prescription I sent them plus I sent the same prescription to a different shop who delivered no problems. So I know the prescription should be correct for my eyes.

I talked to the to the head of the Department I would work in and he told me and promised me that everything would be manageable and flexible regarding the time I have to work in order to put my focus at studying and not working. Now they made a work contract for me which isn't as he told me, the contract says that I need to work a minimum of 20hrs a week and by law in my country it's only allowed to work 20hrs max as a student or you lose your student status.

Know I need to decide if I should do that or not? The advantages for me are that I would be earning money and I'm going to be a full-time employee at that company. The downsides are that I wouldn't have any free time under the week and I don't know how I would handle bigger projects that take more time to do... 

Plan B would be to search another job which wouldn't take up so much time. But everyone is already counting on me to work at that company but I for myself prioritize making it through university.

Currently my plan is to contact the head of my department and tell them my situation and hope for the best. While at the same time I don't think there's a lot of room for negotiation...

And all of that brings me here :/ has somebody had the same situation or has any advice which could help me?",29Sep2020,1

634,"I [16F] have been trying to find a part time job for months. The only place I applied to that had me come in had some weird stuff going on with miscommunication so I decided that I didn’t want to work there. I don’t think what I was doing there technically counted as an interview anyway. All the assistant manager asked was my preferred position and contact information.

A couple of weeks ago I applied to a pretty popular grocery chain through their website (Hy-vee; might know it if you’re from the Midwest). I didn’t get any response back after a couple weeks past the closing date so I sent the hiring manager a follow-up email a couple days ago. I just now got an email from her saying that she’ll be in contact soon about setting up an interview. 

Given that my first experience with an “interview” was very casual and sort of lackluster, I’m looking for any advice on how to actually have a first interview. Especially if they ask me why I want to work there or why they should hire me. I don’t have commercial experience in anything, but I’ve done a lot of volunteering (which I indicated on my resume). I’ve also been shopping at that hyvee since I was at least 5 years old, so I’m familiar with the layout.

However, I have no idea what to say and I don’t want to go into it unprepared. If you’ve got any tips I’d be happy to hear them. Thanks!",29Sep2020,1

 Unfortunately, I've got one in my classes (university level, no minors here, chill with the banhammer). This tall, slender, soft-spoken doe-eyed bastard who is irritatingly perfect and pretty in every single way up to his fucking handwriting. And before anyone asks if I'm sure I don't just have a big gay crush on him, I am sure, because I really am gay and can easily tell the difference between being attracted to someone and being repulsed with myself for failing to measure up.

 And I do take care of myself, I'm reasonably fit, have good hygiene and take care of my skin and teeth, I wear neat clothes that fit and I've got what I'd call my own style (and I know I'd just look like a fucking clown trying to copy his), but everything I've ever done, I'm still just fucking ugly, because of features that are genetic.

 My mother was an ugly woman and thanks to murphy's law, I got her exact goddamn face. Now that I'm an adult I've got all the traits and features she always complained about and I'm considering plastic surgery, though I know that can only fix one of them, the rest are more or less unfixable.

 And this isn't about getting women (or men, because frankly as you probably know, one really can't be so fucking ugly there isn't a guy desperate enough). I know nobody else gives a shit about my face, nobody else looks at people the same way people look at themselves in the mirror. Nobody else will ever look at my face as much and as often as I see my own reflection, and I fucking hate it.

 You wouldn't wear uncomfortable clothes that you hate alone in your own home just because nobody's looking at you. You'd take them off and put on something you like.

So, my second job is Friday-Monday from 1600-0030 and it works perfectly because my primary job is working with disabled students at a public high school. 

I’ve never made any qualms that my District job is my primary. That’s my retirement, it’s a State job, but it doesn’t always cover the gaps like I need it to hence the second gig. I’ve been able to work like this for years without a conflict. Until recently. 

I took a job in my town and it’s been amazing. Truly amazing. The job involves working with disabled adults in a facility. It’s a LOT of work, but it’s manageable once you get used to it. 

The conflict is coming from the fact that my second job is increasingly demanding trainings on short notice that is requiring me to pull away from my duties at my first job, to the point where it’s affecting my students’ education. 

What should I do? How do I politely tell my second job that I can’t attend these trainings with no notice, without losing the position?

She has quickly become a member of my family and I absolutely adore her. Her quirks, her spirit, her giant dark eyeballs. The past two months with her have been a dream.
I thought I'd have more time to enjoy that.
Aside from a little injury that had to be stitched up from her life before us, Ray appeared to be in good health. She was quick, fast and full spirit. She loved going on adventures, Loved being a couch potato, Loved every second she had to spend with My fiance and me. However, yesterday after our ritual morning walk and breakfast, she fell asleep and to continue to loaf the entire afternoon. This was was not typical of her- I work from home so around 2:00 she usually bothers me for a quick walk outside. 2:00 came and went and I checked on her and she seemed to merely be extra tired that day. I gave her a few pads and went back to work. By 4:00 at the end of my work day I began to get her ready for her afternoon walk and noticed that she was walking crooked. She appeared confused and could not stand for a long. Concerned, I picked her up and placed her on the bed beside me only to watch and horror as her knees would not support her and she sank down into the mattress. I quickly went downstairs with her in my arms and was greeted by my fiance just coming home from work. After showing him her sudden confusion and clumsiness, we consulted with her vet who demanded that we go to an emergency vet. We were horrified, but we immediately drove her 30 minutes to the closest e-vet and waited in the parking lot as they did every test under the sun to her. 5 hours and 500 bucks later they had nothing. Her blood work is normal, heart is normal, no bones broken- all together they've ruled her as healthy. But as I sit here today and watch her struggle to sit up and huff and frustration and exhaustion, unable to do anything I'm completely lost. I don't know what to do. I don't know whether to continue to watch her and just hope that it's a fluke- or too again call my vet in a panic. Her lethargy and weakness scares me so bad. She ate a good breakfast this morning but she's still not feeling good. I am absolutely beside myself. 
I'm sorry if this is rambling, but I am terrified. I don't want to lose my dog. I've only had her 2 months and she's my entire world. Please if you have any advice or any thoughts, or any good vibes send them my way.",29Sep2020,1

There have been a few times where we would be out in public and people would automatically flock to her and adore her. People have boldly told her that she’s the prettier friend.

She’s constantly taking jabs at me (small but noticeable ones) Whenever she posts online, I get into this terrible mood. Literally everything she does is grander. She has to have more friends, she has to talk to more people, she had to be the center of attention. And I can’t stand it but I’m not sure if it’s a her thing or a me thing. A part of me wants to be like her. I feel so inadequate in her presence. She’s a constant reminder of everything I want but for some reason cannot achiever. What can I do?

There were times when he would constantly tell me what a failure I'd be and comparing me to more ""accomplishing"" children of other parents. I spent most of my years growing up being at odds with him and having to just deal with it because what choice do I have. It wasn't always bad but there's not really any high moment I can try to think about. I went to college away from home for 5 years and was doing fine on my own. I graduated and moved back home for a year to work and save money until I find a stable means of income and living arrangement. I figured I'm an adult now and my dad won't be nagging at me so much. It quickly turned into a frustrating living situation where I had no privacy or personal space because my dad treats me like I'm his full time helper and would constantly barged into my room whenever he needed assistance with techonology or other various things. He'd barged in while I'm sleeping, text and call me while I'm at work or when I'm out doing other things, and telling me to come home because he needs help. Then I would help him and no matter how many times I show him how to do something, he just can't remember. Anytime he talks to me, it's because he needs help with something. Whenever I was unable to help, he got mad and start going on about how I just don't want to help him with anything. He also took out a $4000 loan on the car I'm driving because he needed money and didn't tell me about it until after it was done. He was able to do it with his bank because he had the title and loan for it even though I was giving him $300 every month for payment. Anyway, I managed to move out after a year and he still won't stop calling and texting asking me to come home so i can help him.

School has always made me miserable and I can’t stand it anymore. It is just so brain-numbing and seemingly never-ending, and it’s taking its toll on me. I can feel myself falling into old, depressed habits again. Is this what I want my life to be like? 

I have been wanting some actual change in my life for a long time now. I was hopeful since I just entered Highschool which many would think of as a big event, but it’s the exact same thing as before. The same teachers, the same lessons, the same assignments, only in a different setting. A setting I wasn’t made for.  

The only thing that has hindered me from already running away is my parents and friends. They’re far from perfect but I still love them and appreciate them and don’t want to inflict any pain on them. I know that me running away would impact them a lot. (Especially my parents, at least.)

I’ve always loved adventure of any kind. All of my happiest memories are in challenging moments where I have struggled and overcame a challenge. It’s in moments like these when I truly thrive and feel alive. I just truly believe that the immense planning and struggle that it would take to survive on the road would make me so much happier.

657,"Sorry if this is a long one. 
Background: Me, my bf (of over a year), my ""friend"" (X) and a known gossiper but close friend (T).
I have been friends with X for a while, now he is known for gossiping and bad relationship history as well as loosing friends a lot. Though I had only had a few issues with him telling the wrong people the wrong things and didn't really see the big deal most of the time. We hang out quite a bit and gossip a little, mainly about our love lives but everything said is kept between us only unless we check first. This is a strict rules!
My friend group is very tight for a high school bunch and a mix of people, as much as there's a lot of trust, there are certain people who are known to spread stuff so you don't tell everyone everything. 
We were hanging out the other day and he became fixated on knowing a piece of personal information about bf. He goes on about it until I give in and ask if he wants me to just ask bf. It's very sensitive info and really not something to be shared. So I made sure my bf knew exactly what was happening when I asked and made sure he knew X was finding out. He was happy to say so long as it was kept private. 
Now, here's the main story. X has a crush on this person (they're not well liked and aren't a great person, I know them better than a lot since they're a family friend but then X tends to go for not the best people). On the same day I agreed to tell the info I also gave in and gave X the crush's number. I helped him work out how to start a conversation, what to say etc etc. 
T(gossip) eventually found out about the crush and while confronting X about it said he'd tell crush unless X told him some other piece of gossip. Soo X told him the exact piece of private information, in detail.
Later on X told me what he'd done though lied about what he'd told T (I worked this out because I later asked T what he'd been told and be gave me exact detail that he couldn't know otherwise). I was really upset at the breach of trust and immediately told bf too. X then begged for my forgiveness later on eventually resorting to trying to turn it on me or guilt trip me saying he didn't want to loose more friends etc. 
Now here's where I could be an AH: I've explained to a few of my closest friends what's happened and X had also gone begging to them before I managed to tell them anything, all of them are on my side. Because of this X hasn't sat at our table, has avoided us at all times and won't look anyone in the eye. He does have other places and people to go to so he's not alone. Everyone is angry at what he's done since trust with information is one of the biggest things for my friends and I. I'm starting to feel bad since he isn't very close to anyone except us and everyone that's heard what happened has sided with me, effectively leaving him with no one once they each find out why we aren't talking to him. I just don't want to ruin his relationships with people and leave him with no one to go to(I've always been there and listened to whatever he wanted to say at all hours of the day).

He said he was evil and Jesus came to him in a vision and told him he was one sin away from an eternity in hell so he would pray over and over when he got scared he did something bad.

Our parents never sent him to therapy. My dad just laughed at him and said God isn't real.

He told people he was evil and from hell, and that Satan could take over his body at any time. He wanted to go to church for a while but then avoided churches because he said he would destroy it. He said Satan made him a psychic and commanded him to find out whether people were good or evil.

My dad still thought he was hilarious and drinking the kool aid when it's obviously more than just being religious. My other brother has always enabled his mental illness and validated his false beliefs.

My brother grew out of the possession thing, but he picked up new beliefs that are even worse that our dad still doesn't care to do anything about.

So, he rarely talks to anyone apart from my other brother who enables his mental illness, so who the hell knows what his thought process is. He thinks that people are trying to control him and signaling him death threats because they know about his calling. He tried to leave home at night to go on a mission with nothing but the clothes on his back, and our dad punched him in the face and handcuffed him to the wall in the basement so he wouldn't go out and harm himself. He goes to visit my enabler brother at his apartment where strangers are just sitting around talking, and he rambles to them about how people are being murdered for their thoughts. He refuses to shower and use the bathroom sometimes and has to be forced by our dad after several days of being disgusting and peeing out the window. He gets really scared at night and starts talking like a little kid as he cries and wanders around, and he has to be dragged back to bed.

My dad thinks he's a rebellious teen, and he can't wait until he can send him away to boot camp or kick him out when he's 18. My mom is just an alcoholic who never talks to us kids at all, so her opinion is whatever. I think my brother's mentally ill and should go to a psych ward immediately. Drugs aren't an issue. His room gets searched a lot. My dad thinka discipline is the only answer, and my other brother indulges and enables his delusions all the time. My dad's called the police on my brother twice when he was acting insane, and he couldn't get them to jail him for anything because they didn't find drugs.",29Sep2020,1

665,"Backstory is that my gf and I bought a small shed we plan on turning into a tiny home. The problem is, of course, money. I don't have a job due to me being in college (last semester) and my gf is having a rough time getting money at her job. 

Recently someone has been messaging her offering to pay her money. Apparently he is a ""sugar daddy"" and wants her to spend his money. I did not really think people like this existed. She has talked to me about it and she said shes 50/50 but if I was uncomfortable she wouldn't do it. All hes asking of her is to spend money he sends her and for her to talk to him over text. 

I don't know if I'd be comfortable with this. I trust her 100% but it feels weird that someone would be sending money to her like that. We don't necessarily need the money but it would help speed the process up.

666,"Hey every one! First of all, I'm really sorry if I make mistakes. I'm French and not really good at English.
I need to talk to someone about my problem, it will be really personal but I need advices. It will be sexual honestly. I'm sorry if I bother anyone. 
Well, where to begin?
When I was 10, a group of girls took nudes pictures of me and shared them to all the school. It was during a school trip in England. So during 4 days, they took pictures of me, threatened me, and caused my fall to hell. I began to have a depression at this age.
I was bullied since I was 8, but it became worst after that.
When I was 14, my bullies began to sexually harassed me. They touched me, told really bad things about women. One thing that really traumatised me was one of the guy. Darwinn. He was one of my bullies and he was a friend when I was 8. He has a girlfriend, Mathilde (I was friend with her when I was 13).
One day, in the bus, he started to touch me again. But his girlfriend was watching. I looked a her, I was literally begging her to stop him with my eyes. She looked at me and laughed.
After telling my psychologist my plan to kill myself, he managed to tell the whole story to my parents and a psychiatrist. I changed of school.
In the first days, I saw a girl. The prettiest I have ever seen. Within a week I learn that she was lesbian.
I suddenly starting to have a big interest in her.
We kissed and started dating.
I really loved her. Sometimes, she was the only reason I couldn't kill myself. She was the reason why I continued to go to school.
But the thing was, I was really traumatised by all the bad events I had in my past life. No one could look at me or even touch me.
But I loved her so much, I forced myself to kiss her, hug her. Even though I couldn't look at her in the eyes. One day, she broke up with me.
I was devastated and I told her that I would be better, and try my best to satisfy her needs. She accepted. Two weeks later, I invited her and some of my friends to hang out. She stayed with me that night. And she raped me. I couldn't talk. I couldn't stop her because I was so afraid of losing her. So I let her touch me. But when she tried to ""do the thing"", my whole body stood up and I told her to go to bed. She tried to continued to touch me, but my body was just... A cold wall.


I have a lot of issues, I won't deny it. But there is one that really make me suffer.
Every time I'm with someone I think they are gonna rape me or touch me. The only person with I don't feel this way is with my brothers and sisters and my mom. But my father? He never did anything but I still have those thoughts. 
I really feel insecure.
Yesterday, I was with a childhood friend and his friends. We all have a lot of fun. (it was one of the funniest day in my life). But when it was time to go home, me and my friends were walking together.
But I couldn't help but thinking of him raping me. He is a really kind guy, one of the kindest I know.
I am really worried. I only talk of it slightly with my mom.
A lot of people took advantage of my weaknesses. In  real life, on the internet, some people of my own family (my uncle always touched my legs or ass when I was younger. And my cousin raped my 5 years old sister.). 
A 40 years old friend of my mom, told me he wanted to marry me and have children with me. I'm 17. I can't even be around his store. I'm really scared of him now. 

If someone look at me more than 3 seconds, I'll become really scared and aggressive.
I don't know if it counts like a trauma, but I really think something is wrong with me.
I just wanted someone to hear me. If anyone could give me any advice... I'll be really happy.
I really need help. I have a lot of struggles in my life, but this one, is one of the biggest.
Please, help me.",29Sep2020,1
667,"My fiancé of a couple years made a secret Instagram account while being with me. 

He has posted 76 pictures and videos of him parting with other women since April 2020. Which indicates he was posting these photos while being engaged with me. 

The photos and videos he posted include women from his past in their thongs and he slaps their asses and what not... I know these pictures were from the past but he created this account this April 2020 while we were engaged. 

I should also mention he doesn’t allow anyone to follow this account so the videos and pictures were just for him to see... 

He also follows alot of women from his past and MY girl friends on this account which he is not aloud to because it bothers me since he always likes their bikini pictures and what not which I told him this upsets me so he stopped...  

I now find this new secret Instagram and he replied/messaged one of my drop dead gorgeous girl friend from high school “😍” and “🔥” to two of her pictures that she posted on her story. 

I’m unbelievably hurt by this because he knows I’m insecure. I even originally had brown hair and I asked him what hair color he prefers or is more attracted to. And he straight up told me blonde. So I died my hair blonde..... 
My girl friend that he replied to has beautiful blonde hair and I’m not joking when I say drop dead gorgeous! I feel like he likes her and not me.

I abruptly end the interview so I can call 911. The interviewer texted me saying my connection must have dropped.

669,"Hey everyone,
Every year for the past 7 or so years, 4-8 of my friends all take a trip in the winter to North Carolina (from FL) to hike, eat, hang out, and relax. My friend and I are usually the ring leaders of the trip organization.
This year, COVID-19 took over. My girlfriend whom I love with has asthma, and her mother had a mild heart attack in March, so we are considering all of us to be “high risk” and so we take every available precaution. We don’t touch our faces, we don’t go to public places without masks on, we sanitize everything. This is a trip we all would drive together for, and then share an AirBnB. This year there are 6-8 attendees. With covid going on, planning for the trip, aside from date/location basically stopped happening and I kind of put it in limbo.
Now, my good friend has asked me if it’s still happening, to which I responded that we should try for March, as a “spring break” type trip, hoping covid will be in smaller effect by then. He told me that I’d “just do this again in March” so we should just go in December anyways, and I said we should see who’s going, and then as covid changes or more info comes out, I can decide later if I’m going. He then went and posted in the event page that I was no longer going, and suggested changing the date since I picked it.

One problem is that I am ALREADY not attending his sisters November wedding due to Covid, but now he seems to be upset with me. I see on social media photos of him and his sister out for brunch or at breweries ALL THE TIME with no mask on, and it’s impossible for me to determine if he, or the other 6 attendees are being responsible. Maybe they take them off for pics, maybe they don’t.

What do you think? This trip is something I look forward to all year, and would hate to miss it, but covid impact and risks cannot be denied. I don’t want to catch it, let alone pass it to my gf, parents, or hers.
On the other hand, am I overreacting? Is it safe? Should I be mad at his word choices?",29Sep2020,1
670,"I'm a college student working directly for my university, and I'm having some issues with my direct supervisor that I don't know how to deal with. For context, I'm 20 and she's in her early thirties. This is my first 'professional' job.

For context: I worked under this supervisor last year as well, and I had a very challenging mental health crisis that they knew the details of. Ever since then I've felt like she's treated me differently, like we have a more 'personal' relationship than my coworkers have with her. At first, I was glad that we had this relationship, but now it's complicating our work environment.

Last year she frequently criticized me for the way I talk in meetings, which I accepted as fair, as I have ADHD and I do talk a lot. I can come across as brash, and ever since she brought up those criticisms I've worked very hard to make sure I'm always expressing myself as professionally and calmly as possible. It's been a work in progress, but I do think I've made some progress. I stay quiet a lot longer in meetings, and I specifically pay attention to how I'm speaking to try and be calm and clear in what I'm expressing. However I know that I still do talk a lot, and I am continuing to work on that.

Since the beginning of this school year, she's been encouraging me to be a leader among our staff because I'm the only staff member that's worked here for two years. I've tried to do that, but now I'm afraid that's what's caused what's going on.

The actual issues started in our most recent meeting. We had planned to do a group event with all members of our staff, and one member of our staff wanted to change the event from a one-day event to a week long series of events. I said that I would rather have a daily event, because the idea of doing a week's worth of events really stressed me out. Some of the other staff started to back me up. Our supervisor started making really pointed criticisms of a daily event, and began to pick apart all the elements of a daily event that we had previously begun to plan. It was really confusing, and we spent like an hour on this specific issue. 

It started to become clear that only one staff member wanted to do a weekly event, but our supervisor had decided that would be better for us in some capacity to do a weekly event. I tried to gently say this by saying something along the lines of ""hey, if the real issue here is that \[supervisor\] wants us to do a weekly event, we can totally talk about that, I think we shouldn't keep dissecting potential issues with a daily event if the real issue is that we should just be planning a weekly event."" She immediately snapped at me and said ""when have I EVER mentioned a weekly event in the last half hour?""

She was right, we hadn't been specifically talking about a weekly event, but the way she said it caught me really off guard. It seemed clear to me that we were only talking about this issues with a daily event because we were still deciding whether we wanted to do a daily or a weekly event.

Eventually, we moved on from that issue, and we moved onto an issue that I was actually passionate about. We were discussing opening common spaces in some dorms, as they've been closed because of COVID. I started to outline how our dorm is one of the only ones that hasn't had cases this semester, while other dorms on campus are currently developing clusters or having 3-5 cases every day. I also said that our facilities team would be even more overworked if we opened common spaces, and I asked her how often the spaces would be able to be used.

With every point I brought up, she began to shoot back really aggressive questions. It got to the point where I was on the verge of tears and she was still going after me in this meeting with the rest of the staff. When we finally got off the call, I couldn't help but cry about it, even though honestly I feel like these aren't issues worth crying over. The way she was talking to me just really impacted me, and I don't know if it's because she thinks we have a more personal relationship. It was so noticeable that she was singling me out and being quite vicious that one of the other staff members messaged me one-on-one to see if I was okay. We talked about it, and that staff member told me she'd noticed our supervisor always talks more rudely to me than to any other staff member, and this was just more of that in a more obvious way. I haven't noticed that, but now I'm thinking back on other interactions we've had and I think maybe that's true.

I think that after what happened last year, she now views me as the 'problem child' of her staff. I also think every time I talk she still has this idea of 'you talk too much' in her head, so it makes her angry whenever I do say something, even if it's less than I have talked in the past. I also think I've been trying to be this 'leader' that she's been encouraging me to be (I'll speak up during the awkward silences in zoom calls, I've been teaching other members of staff things their training missed) but I think this has only contributed further to her idea of me and now she thinks I drown out other voices on staff.

I do think I have a problem with talking a lot, but I am working on it, and now I just feel horrible about the whole situation. Whenever I try to bring up that she's making me feel bad, she'll bring up the way that my words (usually she'll say something about the 'way' I say things, but won't detail exactly what I need to fix about what I'm saying, or I would work on that) have impacted her, and that her feelings are hurt. I usually don't know what to say to that. Sometimes she'll say something like 'maybe I shouldn't be burdening you with my feelings, but I need support from my staff like you need support from me'.

Again, this is my first 'professional' job, and I'm still in college, so I'm really not sure if this is just what being in a workplace is like and I need to be navigating the social situation better. I can try better in meetings and staff settings, I'm just not sure if the only right answer is to drastically cut down on what I'm saying. But if that's the answer, I don't know how to also be the leader she's asking me to be. Does anyone have any ideas on how to work better in this situation?",29Sep2020,1

673,"I recently found about this game and downloaded it from the playstore and got hooked. Played it for some hours over the course of last two days and had a lot of fun. 

Today I tried to join lobbies but the game just didn't let me in and said something about ping problems so I switched servers to North America and joined a lobby. 

First game we caught the imposter fairly easily and I thought to myself, "" This is a nice lobby"" as everyone was playing and no one leaving. Next game I got to be the imposter and got happy because it rarely happens. I started doing my thing but as soon as the green task bar thingy filled upto 5-10% they called a meeting, before I could say anything someone apparently had used my character to text ""I'm the imposter vote me out"", I thought maybe it is the game that has done that for some rule that I didn't know ( I'm very new to this game, so I thought maybe I had my sabotage ""map"" opened up in front of other players so the game did that) but before I could type ""What is that?"" someone again used my name to say ""lol"" I freaked out and then everyone voted me out. I closed the game and uninstalled it in shock. 

I know people cheat in this game but mostly they use their own character to do that or do things like God mode, skip meeting, skip vote, etc but this some another level thing. I tried to look this up on Google but nothing showed up, reddit has some fairly new posts but no one has shared anything useful. 

Ever since this happened I can't think or do anything, I feel like I'm being watched or hacked. I feel like throwing my phone away, my mind is racing. I'm so confused. I'm too poor and afford a new phone. What should I do? Am at a risk? Has this happened to you? I am so FREAKED OUT! Please, if you have something to say don't hesitate.",29Sep2020,1
674,"This sounds ridiculous I know but help me out here haha 
So my apartment complex has been overrun with raccoons for a long time now. They used to put a ladder in the dumpster everyday for raccoons to crawl out of because they would accidentally pick up like 10 raccoons in the garbage truck. It’s right next to a park and creek so it’s a good spot for them to live and snag some food. They aren’t really scared of people which is fine because they usually keep to themselves. I have never had a problem with them. They grab their trash and go. Residents keep their trash locked in a box outside so they can only get it from the dumpster. There is a little hole in the chain link fence that leads to the park right down the side walk of my apartment. Last night I was taking me two dogs out (big dogs-border collie/Aussie) and some ran ahead of us from the parking lot and through the hole. One of my dogs barked so I paused and once the raccoons were through the hole I kept walking. One of the raccoons ran back through the hole after he was already a bit away and literally charged us. One of my dogs was snapping and barking so aggressively but the raccoon was not even a little bit phased. I started backing up to give it space and get my dogs away but it would not stop coming. It was hissing and making a really loud noise. My dogs were freaking out and I started retreating as fast as I could while getting my dogs under control and keeping an eye on it. My dogs are up to date on rabies but I didn’t want to take chances. I started running and I was screaming a bit. It wasn’t the raccoon itself but they carry very deadly diseases. It chased me a really long ways. People came out to their balcony because of the commotion and were yelling. The raccoon was sticking to the fence which is covered in a thick bushy vine and would randomly jump out and try to bite. It chased me all the way to the base of my stairs until I was up the first flight (it was a really long distance). When I got to the top where the staircase is open the people on the balconies were talking to me and my friend who had watched the whole thing go down from my balcony. She said that everyone thought it was a mountain lion because it was hissing so loud and was banging through the vine against the fence so it seemed bigger than it was. I felt so silly but everyone said it was really terrifying to watch. I thought it had to be diseased because it chased me such a far distance and so aggressively. It was not trapped in a corner and it wasn’t defensive it was literally on the offense. I called my apartment complex the next morning because I didn’t want it to happen to anyone else and they seemed to take me seriously and told me they would look into the fence. They asked me to call animal control and have animal control call them. So I did but AC said they can’t do anything until it bites someone. They said they weren’t going to go around banging bushes to find it and testing them for rabies was a really long process. He said raccoons in the area just aren’t scared of people and I probably got near it’s territory (it’s the sidewalk of my apartment so the raccoons shouldn’t have territory there??) I called the apartment complex back and told them what AC said and I asked them if they wanted me to send them a picture of the hole because it’s hard to find or if I could show it to them in person. She got really condescending and started calling me “sweetie” (I am a 25yr old woman so that was offensive) she said she would go find the hole later but they would have to find a way to secure a chain link fence and the raccoons could climb over it anyways. I said that I understood that but maybe getting rid of the easy access would discourage them from being directly in that area. I now hate the raccoons in the area which is fair and I don’t want someone to get bit before they take action (what if a child got bit?). Either way no one is going to do anything at this point. I still have to take my dogs out at night. I would never suggest a gun and I’m scared if I used pepper spray it would just blow in me or my dog’s faces and then we wouldn’t be able  to see to get away from the raccoon. They are small and I know my dogs could take it and I would probably just get scratched and bit if I tried to kick it or something. I’m not trying to get me or my dogs bit because they are such high carriers of disease. it’s so silly to be scared of such a small cute animal but the potential for deadly diseases is serious when they are attacking. Does anyone have any advice on a weapon to use in defense against a raccoon when I take my dogs out at night? 😂",29Sep2020,1

679,"Alright, my girlfriend (25) and I (27) have been together for 5 years. We currently live together, and will be moving to a new city soon for her job. I work from home. I also earn roughly double what she makes, and as a result, I pay a larger portion of rent. We've had some issues with our current apartment...it's small, lots of noise from neighbors, and so forth. 

So I've basically said that since I work from home, I want a place that I can spend all day in comfortably. I will ensure she does not pay more than the upper limit of what she can afford on rent, and I will take on the rest. She says she wants to get a cheap place because she wants to be able to afford it on her own in the worst case scenario that we break up. I've told her that if we break up, I will pay my part through the rest of the lease. She says that while she believes me, the issue is that if we break up, she wants to be able to stay in the same apartment as opposed to having to get up and search for a new place that she can afford alone.

Would love some outside perspectives. The way I see it, she is asking me to sacrifice my comfort to protect her in the ""worst case scenario"". What I am proposing adds little-to-no financial burden on her. The only ""burden"" it may cause is if we break up, and she has to look for a new place she can afford alone (which I would likely have to do as well).

Yesterday, there was another spider on the couch that already had a spider on it. I literally do not know what to do. 

Ive always had afear of spiders, not this extreme, i would just feel a bit scared, and go on with my day. Everytime i go to sit on my bed, i get nervous and cry.

Due to this and some mental health issues I had my mother is completly against alchol. I'm only allowed to drink a few cans on a Friday and Saturday night and she freaks out If I drink any more than that threatening to kick me out.

I like having drinks with friends, and have to tell them I can't go out thursday or Tuesdays on occasion becuase my mother wont let me or is shaming me for it. The funny thing is she drinks more than I do going out last night and having a whole bottle of wine.

I understand she has her concerns but I want to have fun and be social and be allowed fo drink when I want. I'm a young man and I want to have fun and relax. I feel like I'm being treated like I'm an alcholic when I just want to have a few drinks more often.

I dont use alcohol to cope with anything and I dont need it, I just enjoy it and like watching movies or drinking with friends. 

I dont know how to talk to my mother or tell her anything as she just shouts me down or just flat out says no.",29Sep2020,1
683,"Aged 17, I began speaking to this girl at my college. We had acquainted several times before we were close. One day while waiting for a bus, she unexpectedly started touching and pinching my bum while I was talking to another friend. I asked for her to stop in a joking, nervous tone, but she didn’t. Despite this, I don’t perceive this incident as harmful; rather she’s was just being overly playful and a little inappropriate. Once we got on the bus, we began touching one and another subtly. And — I don’t know how things escalated to this — I ended up putting my hands down her trousers and, subsequently, touching her bum. Eventually, her bus-stop came up, and she departed. After this things were as usual; in fact, we got even closer. And on another occasion while in an almost identical situation, I did the same thing. On both occasions, she didn’t seem reluctant, nor did she tell me to stop. Furthermore, I’m confident we spoke of it positively after the first time; but I cannot confirm, as I deleted my Snapchat account soon after. Nonetheless, she never explicitly asked me, nor said I could do it from what I can recall. The memory is very vague. Soon after all of this, we grew distant which was due to me. I lost interest in her. She was — and I know this may sound hypocritical — overly sexual. She would routinely send me unsolicited pictures of herself, and frequently tell me how she wants to have sex with me. Also, I found out she had just recently ended a long-distance relationship. I grew cold, I began not reciprocating her affection for me. And, ultimately, cut ties completely. 

After all this, she began hating me — which is understandable. We would sometimes see one and another around college but no words were said. And I didn’t think much of it. Until one day, one of her friends who I spoke to regularly said she felt uncomfortable and nervous why being in my vicinity; but she didn’t explicitly state why. This had me panicking, thinking retrospectively if I had harmed her in someway — and the thought of the sexual encounter of the bus resurfaced. Subsequently, a wave of shame and disgust flooded over me. I started questioning whether or not what I did was, in fact, sexual assault. I eventually built up the courage to contact her through a mutual friend, apologising for anytime I could have hurt her and for my cold, distant ending. In response, she basically said that she rarely thinks back on our past, and that nothing I said or did hurts her. Additionally, she took partial blame and apologised for being overly sexual and sometimes forcing it onto me. 

After reading this message, I was met with some closure. But, eventually, the thoughts came back. Everyday, I perceive myself as a predator who once hurt someone. The general consensus is that sex offenders desire a slow, painful death; yet, here I am — living freely. I considered messaging her again, but that would be a form of harassment, constantly perusing the topic — seeking reassurance. I’m contemplating turning myself in or killing myself.

I’m sorry.",29Sep2020,1

This is my first real relationship I guess you can say.  I had never had a girlfriend before her and she is my first and only sex partner.  I guess I’m a late bloomer as they like to phase it.  We’ve been together for almost a year now.  However, I recently learned that she had been with 9 guys before me including a few ONS’s.  This may seem like nothing to most of you and that I’m overreacting by making a mountain out of a molehill but considering my circumstances and experiences or lack thereof, it seems like alot to me.  Ever since learning this I’ve been taken aback from the relationship as a whole.  I’ve always thought of sex as something intimate and done between people in a relationship and thought she felt the same.  At first my anxiety started to take over about her being with all those guys and me being with only one woman.  I tried to let the past be the past but that didn’t help and only caused further internal conflict.  I’ve always tried to use my emotions logically but I’m having a really tough time in this scenario. Now it feels as if I’m emotionally withdrawn from it all and honestly don’t even really care anymore.  I know that this is my problem so no need to respond stating the obvious. I’ve always held myself to a high standard and feel as if I’m disrespecting myself by staying.  I’m aware this may come across as being judgemental or me being an asshole/drama king but this is how I honestly feel about the matter.  It’s almost as if I don’t want to break up but don’t want to say either.  Confusing I know but I really don’t know how to explain to get my point across. I still care for her and like her just not as much as I did before.  Honestly don’t know what to do about this.  If you have any sound, constructive advice, please share.  Thanks and take care.",29Sep2020,1

687,"For context, I was browsing the web on some psycology shit and came across this. Fit the profile absolutely. I've always known I did this, but I attributed it to anxiety and overthinking, both of which I have in bucket loads.

Have had harm OCD on and off for a while as well, for about year and a half, wasn't formally diagnosed. I actually didn't know it was Harm OCD until four months ago, when I finally found the fit on another reddit post actually. I thought I was going insane.

For another bit of context, I'm extremely introverted and sorta emotionally closed off ever since I ost my best friend to cancer when I was 13. You could say I'm a lonely kid. I crave emotional connect but I'm scared of it at the same time.

Anyway I'm an Indian teenager living in a family where mental illness is as real as a unicorn. It's not that they don't care, it's just that the concept in itself is so new that they haven't paid attention to its existence. My parents haven't had an easy life and I don't want to do anything to make it worse. 

That being said, I'm a little worried about this purely because this is the latest in a long line of weird mental illnesses and I don't wanna end up going insane. If it helps, I've had to clear two really big exams in the last two years and the stress and anxiety coupled with the whole harm OCD enchilada has made my life living hell. I'm slowly recovering from it now.

What I'm worried about is what it's going to take to fix me and make me normal again. I feel like I lose a lot of living just dealing with things like this and I'm so tired.

688,"For example yesterday there was a bleach cleaning spray bottle in my work bathroom and long story short I touched the bottle with my bare hands then accidentally touched my earphone wire with the same hands.

I begin to think, the bleach bottle is used to clean toilets, and so the janitor must have cleaned the toilet, then touched the bottle with dirty hands to put it back or even for extra sprays. Which means there could be feces or urine on the bottle, which could have been transferred to my earphones from my hands.

If this affected **just me**, I could let it go. But what if I hug someone while wearing my earphones? **Then the feces would be transferred to that person’s shirt!** Or I could wear the same shirt that my earphone wires touched one day, touch the spot on my shirt, then open a door. Then everyone who touches that doorknob would get poop on their hands from my shirt! If I sit on a chair and the earphone wire dangles onto it, everyone who sits in that chair will be contaminated.

I don’t like thinking like this, but I feel like this thought is reasonable right??? I don’t want to contaminate people so I should throw out my earphones right? Even though I might be overthinking, isn’t it worth the hassle if it means my friends and coworkers don’t get poop on them?

694,"Hello everyone, and thank you for reading my post.

In  short: I am 28 years old and I don't feel like I belong anywhere in  life, and as such feel like I have to start over. I currently live in  Egypt and I don't feel like I am able to handle the stress that comes  with it, so I come to you to ask for advice on where would be a good  place to, well, start over, given little to none work experience and a  low stress resistance. Some place that would be safe, forgiving and  provide a healthy environment to recover from post grief depression and  grow.

Allow me to give a little context:

I  studied Management abroad (BA) and moved back to Egypt last October.  Throughout my life, I've lost a lot of opportunities and attempts due to  family issues, which cultivated a belief in me that ""none of my plans  ever work"". Every time I tried to step on my own path, something major  happened that chained me to problems that weren't mine in origin, but I  had to deal with no less. I had a very sheltered upbringing, which  didn't exactly help with facing the harsh realities of life, so I never  had the needed resilience to overcome issues. I developed a mentality  that my life isn't my own.

The  latest tragedy was the long and harsh sickness and passing away of my  mother 2 years ago, something I haven't quite recovered from yet. It  split our family up and I spent a long time alone finishing her affairs,  with some still being undone, which weighs down on me tremendously.

So  with all that in mind, I came back to Egypt to live with my dad, at his  promise that he and some family members will help me get on my feet,  help me find a flat and a job to get started with. None of this  happened, everyone bailed on their promises and the next 5 months I just  spent home, slipping back into a hopeless state and getting sick.

Towards  that time, a lot of acquaintances advised me to leave and ""recover""  somewhere else, since I was largely unhappy. Some people even chastised  me for coming back to Egypt, given the poor and depressing situation in  the country. No one gave advice as to where to go, though, but at some  point it became the only thought that I could bear: I need to leave, at  least for a while, to get my mind right.

In  February, I met a person who promised to find me a job - and they  actually delivered. It was a job abroad as well. I got my first job  interview that went well, and was supposed to start paperwork the week  after.

The week after was the  announcement of a global COVID shutdown. I lost the job, the opportunity  to travel and with it my last bit of hope was crushed. I got stuck in a  place that made me unhappy, and became a huge burden to my father,  being a 28 years old fuck up who plays games all day. He doesn't feel  that way and is very empathetic towards me, but I feel that way every  day nonetheless.

My father is a great comfort, but he is unable to help me get on my feet.

All  that being said: I don't see myself in Egypt at all, since I never felt  compatible with the local mentality to begin with. My untreated  depression prevents me from being more proactive and able to weigh my  options with a clear mind.

So I  don't know... where would a good place be to start over? I have some  friends across Europe who invite me to come study there. I'm torn  between studying (not even sure what), or finally starting a career at  28 (but my lack of work experience and age haunt me).

Or  maybe it would be best to just go somewhere for a few months to recover  and come back healthy and able to work? Covid would be a huge hurdle  there, though... I am so lost.

TLDR:  As a depressed and hopeless 28 years old guy with little work  experience, which country could I move to finally start living a secure,  peaceful life where I can build my life up and work and be happy..?",29Sep2020,1

697,"I have a real issue and I would love some advice. I am trying be nice because I don’t want issues with my neighbors but I also don’t want these people to continually overstep their boundaries. I just have NO IDEA what to say or do. 

Background: I live in a very small 1 bedroom apartment in Southern California. The apartment is very old and small. It was built in the 1950s, it has about 40 units in total, all of them are 1 bedroom under 600 sq ft. All units have metal screen doors. 

I live upstairs, so all upstairs tenants use the same walkway that runs along the front of side of the unit in order to reach the main staircase. For the many years I have lived her (almost 10 years now), the assumed ‘culture’ of my apartment has been to not look directly into anyone’s windows or through their screen doors out of general respect for privacy. The norm is that when people walk by, they make a point to either look straight ahead or they look away from your windows as they walk by. All of the units have long vertical blinds on the windows, I keep my turned open for sunlight during the day and I always close them at night. Same goes for my screen door. 

It is important to note that I have a large boxer dog who can be protective/aggressive when people linger too long outside my apartment door, or act odd, so this is my main concern. 


*The issue I am having* :

Last month, a new couple (trans female ~40 years old, and 75 year old female) moved into an upstairs unit that is two doors away from mine. 

In my opinion- they will go out of their way to stare into my unit. I have seen them stop walking in order to look back into my living room window to do double-takes before they make eye contact with me and hurry away. 

Yesterday morning, the elderly woman stopped at my screen door, said nothing and looked all around inside my unit before she started barking at my dog. Yes, she literally barked first...like, “Bark! Bark! Bark! You’re a scary dog aren’t you!” My dog was quietly laying on the carpet before she barked..This made my dog go absolutely insane, he of course started barking at the screen. The whole situation makes me very uncomfortable. I ran to the door to grab my dog and in the moment, I tried my best to politely tell her that “strangers standing outside of our unit gives us both anxiety” but she seemed oblivious and continued to make small talk with me. I tried as quickly as possible to end the encounter.

I am the kind of person who gets a lot of anxiety when people stare into my home. I absolutely hate it, I feel like it’s an invasion of my personal space and I always respect others as I walk by their open windows. 

This morning while I was washing dishes in my kitchen, the same new elderly neighbor stops at my screen to engage with my dog again. I had to run to my front door in order to stop him from attacking the screen door. I have no idea why someone who sit there while a large dog is going ballistic. After this second encounter, My dog now starts growling as soon as he sees them walking towards our door and it’s become a real issue. 

This afternoon, the trans female neighbor stopped at my kitchen widow as said “hey good afternoon!” and it absolutely scared me because I did not see her and I was also wearing my pajamas so I felt a little violated by the experience. They are trying to be nice and neighborly but I really don’t want anyone treating my living room window, screen door, or kitchen window as a Drive-Thru... for all of these experiences, I was not encouraging them or interacting first. I feel like I cannot relax in my home...I am worried I’m being watched by my new neighbors.

I discovered my 16 year old friend dated a 9 year old sexually online, as well as find out he guilt tripped multiple people (upwards of possibly 15 people, including myself.) He told me in around June that he had sexual feelings for his girlfriend, and in the past week I was informed by a friend of his that they were only 9 years old. I'm concerned about this age gap for sure.

He lied about abuse at home, his parents being homophobic, as well as faking suicide and overall faking depression for clout and attention.

I've been holding this in my head from a year or so, and I figured I should ask for advice on the internet to get a fair view point because everyone thinks what my husband said is right up to a certain extent.

That being said, I've never been to my husbands office. One day he forgot his phone so I drove to his office to give it to him, and that's when I saw how his company was full of male employees.

I was speechless, so I confronted him then and there. He told me not to make a scene, and that he would explain it to me later that day.

Later that night, he told me how ""Women never work, just sit and gossip, throw fake accusations at men, complain about wage gap, take more leaves than men, use their advantage of being a female to get ahead in their careers, always complain about something or the other, not fit for the job, mess stuff up, are annoying, do drama and yada yada yada"".

This pushed me into deep shock of why my husband thinks about women this way. I couldn't believe it.

I told him not all of them are true, and that he should change his way of thinking about certain gender.

He told me to mind my own business, and his business is his business and not mine. He also said that hiring women always comes with issues, and that he rather did not hire them.

He said all of us together are happy working individuals who are having the time of their lives without women sabotaging everything.

I asked who came up with his idea of not hiring women, and he told me all of them did.

I don't know how to feel about this. This is just messing with my head.

Although, I agree with a few points that he said because it's true. I work at a Fortune 500 company and nobody wants to deal with women. Hell, sometimes I look at the drama of other women working on the same floor as me, and say to myself that women are better off being SAHM.

I tried calling his bestfriend to get the full picture, and he said exactly the same thing.

I just can't get my head straight. I think we both of us need therapy.

711,"Hi everyone! I'm in a weird situation. Some guy I dated ten years ago just emailed me, out of the blue. I haven't communicated with him since 2011. Honestly, I moved on with my life and completely forgot about him. I'm in a very happy relationship that's been going on for three years. So I have no interest in dating him again. And he doesn't want to date me either. We're not even friends, so this is very sudden. Anyway, first you need some context for my situation. Here it is:

Back in 2011, I was poor and my ex-boyfriend Michael was financially supporting me. I was living with Michael, while openly dating other guys. I was 27 years old at the time. I found a 23 year old guy on Plenty of Fish named Alex, who was very cute. We went on about three dates. After our first date, it was obvious to me that Alex was rich. He worked as a carpenter, and yet he drove a Lexus and a Ferrari. By date two, I found out that he lived with his parents between two homes, one in Mississauga (Toronto) and the other in the Haliburton Highlands, a rural area in Ontario, Canada were a lot of rich people have country mansions.

On date three, I spent a weekend at the mansion of Alex's family in the Haliburton Highlands. His mom was some sort of Bay Street portfolio manager and his dad was an insurance industry executive. THAT'S how a 23 year old carpenter drives a Lexus and a Ferrari! When he lives with his multimillionaire parents and they buy everything for him!

His family had a lot of boats on their lakefront Haliburton Highlands property. No yachts, but four power boats with a seating capacity of 6-20 people each, and a sailboat. We took a couple of boat rides across the lake during that weekend. Alex's parents were watching me very closely, and apparently I looked awkward while boarding and getting off of their boats. Plus Alex made me smoke far into the bush on their property so that his parents wouldn't see that I was a cigarette smoker.

At the end of our Haliburton Highlands weekend date with his family, his mom insisted that Alex drive me back home to Toronto. Apparently his parents decided I wasn't ""good enough"" for their son and didn't want him to date me ever again. They made a class judgment based on my awkwardness with boating. Meanwhile, Alex couldn't follow his parents' footsteps in high finance and insurance apparently because of his dyslexia. So his parents kind of encouraged his pursuit of carpentry, but at the same time, I think a part of them was ashamed that he was doing real work for a career.

I was very hurt by the experience and I also thought Alex was pathetic if his parents were making his dating decisions at age 23. I concluded that rich people were assholes and decided to never date a rich kid ever again.

Alex was exploring his bisexuality and he felt like being a bit rebellious behind his parents' back. We had sex a couple of times while we dated and I'm female. We secretly emailed each other a couple of times after his parents rejected me. My ex-boyfriend I was living with, Michael, is also bisexual. We all agreed to have a threesome at Michael's house.

After that threesome, I never heard from Alex ever again. Until that email I got from him yesterday!

Without revealing any specifc identities, here it is:

""I hope you are doing well. And I hope you and anyone you know is safe  from Covid . I saw your twitter account, and it looks like your doing  well. I wanted to apologize for how I was . It was not a good part of my  life. And I was very drunk and not happy. And I’m sorry if I hurt you.  Anywho. I was also wondering if you could share contact info for Michael &lt;lastname&gt; with me. I was hoping to talk to him about a few things as I  actually have a lot in common with him these days than ever. And if you  have Instagram you could see why. In any case. Wishing you the best and  hope your happy.""

Actually no, I don't have an Instgram account, and I have largely forgotten about Alex since 2011. Here's what happened in my life between 2011 and now! I moved out of Michael's house near the end of the year. I fell in love with a poor guy named Sean, and we were in a serious relationship from the end of 2011 to the middle of 2016. During my five years with Sean, we were homeless for a lot of that time. When we weren't homeless, we were living in the slums of Toronto, in deep poverty.

During that time, I gradually built a career researching and writing about cybersecurity. I just kept posting my cybersecurity/computer technology related writing online until it turned into a viable career. I broke up with Sean in September 2016 because I realized that living with him was going to doom me to a life of poverty and horrible luck. 

I started dating an eccentric musician named Rob later that month. I moved in with Rob by October 2016. We lived together as boyfriend/girlfriend until we broke up in February 2018. By the end of 2016, my career had EXPLODED. I got my first big break. I got offers to write for a lot of tech company blogs. Between 2016 and now, I've written for these tech companies: AT&amp;T, BlackBerry, Venafi, Sophos, Kaspersky, and many others you may not have heard of. By early 2017, I started making enough money from my writing to live pretty well!

So by the time Rob and I broke up in February 2018, I was able to fully support myself and maintain a middle class lifestyle. I eventually started renting a luxury condo on the Toronto waterfront. I'm not RICH, I'm still probably ""middle class"" at best. But given the years of poverty I have lived, ""middle class"" seems like being rich to me. I don't care about money when I go grocery shopping! I was eating in nice restaurants once or twice a week until COVID hit! I have all the clothes and shoes that I want. My writing income hasn't made me a millionaire, but it's nice to be able to live well without worrying about how I'm going to pay my bills. And for pretty much the first time in my life, I'm financially independent. I even have a book that'll be published by a major publisher this December. I'm 36 years old, and I think I can just keep writing books for the rest of my life.

I've been with my boyfriend Jason since March 2018. We don't live together, and we're both financially independent. And we're not going to ever have kids. I think the fact that we stay over at each other's apartments once per week and we don't need financial support from each other is really one of the keys to the success of our relationship. We're also very candid with each other. I tell Jason everything, and I've told him everything I've written in this post. I've also shown Jason the email Alex sent me.

I don't speak to Michael very often, but we still have each other's email addresses and we're on generally good terms. 

Honestly, an evil side to me is wondering if there's some way I can exploit Alex in this situation. ""I can give you Michael's email address if you send me $50,000!"" Heheheheheheh. Obviously Alex wants to have sex with Michael again.

I haven't responded to Alex's email yet. I don't need any money from Alex, but I'd be as happy to receive a few thousand bucks from a desperate rich kid (well now, a desperate 32 year old rich MAN) as anyone else would be. There's also an insecure part of me that wants to show Alex that I'm a VERY RESPECTABLE WOMAN WITH A VERY RESPECTABLE CAREER NOW. lol

713,"Hello, everyone.

I am a nonbinary teen and for a few months now, I've been dealing with someone who is obsessed with me in a very unhealthy way. I met this person when I got out of class in my local community college. I was just minding my own business when this man walked up to me and started talking to me. He seemed pretty kind and I didn't want to seem rude in anyway. I'm a very shy and introverted person. I really don't like it when strangers talk to me. We were just introducing ourselves to each other. At one point, I mentioned how I wanted to transition as the opposite sex. Yes, I am nonbinary, but I want to have a body where I feel like I belong. I look like a girl, but I'm not. Anyway, he wanted my phone number, so I just gave it to him. Anyway, he leaves and no more than 2 minutes later, I get a call from him and he goes something along the lines of he doesn't want me to transition. For the next few weeks, I was getting nonstop calls and messages from him. I swear, he was everywhere. He called me when I was in class, at work, out with my family, etc. If didn't take too long for him to admit that he wanted to be in a romantic relationship with me. Now, for context, I don't want to be in a relationship with anyone because I dealt with an abusive ex in the past. I told him this and he always says along the lines of I promise I won't hurt you, I care about you, etc. Keep this in mind that he started saying all of this the very day we met, so it's not like he actually knew me. I didn't even say much to him. What I feel uncomfortable is the age difference. He's much older than I am and he doesn't respect that I don't feel comfortable dating someone much older than me. For context, we are both over the age of consent where I live. So, it's not technically illegal, but that doesn't mean I'm okay with it. If I were to be in a relationship, I'd rather date someone my own age. He always said that he would be there for me, but the second I need help, he bails out on me. This has been going on for several months and I don't know what to do about it. I've tried to block him multiple times, but he just comes back. He'll try anything to get in contact with me if I block his number. Sometimes, he would try multiple numbers just so he can talk to me. I've told him to leave me alone, but that only causes him to repeatedly text my number. He even called the police to check my home because I wasn't answering his calls. I don't have any friends to help me out and I don't feel comfortable telling any of my family members this whole story. I haven't spoken to him in a few days now since I've been ignoring his calls.

718,"Hello. So, let me get right to the point. I have the opportunity to graduate early as a junior this year if I add on two extra classes.

My original plan was to graduate as usual, go to community college to get my average classes out of the way &amp; transfer to a four year college. This is mostly my plan because of lack of financial support.

If i graduate early, I plan on taking a gap year (I would go to college at the same time as my original graduating year) to work and maybe travel. I would still follow the original plan.

I just don’t think I am mentally prepared to go to college next september. I have no work experience so getting a job would be a smart idea while I take the gap year? I also don’t have my drivers license yet and the process is long so I would have extra time to finish that out.

the only big con of graduating early:
mom works with my high school but her title only allows her to stay if I am still in school so she would have to quit a year early. I genuinely feel terrible that she would have to quit because of me. she loves doing it.

I know this post is kinda a mess so if you have any questions let me know.

here’s the final question:
Looking at my situation (and maybe from your personal experience), what do you think is the smartest choice? Stay for senior year or graduate early with a gap year?",29Sep2020,1
719," HI,

&amp;#x200B;

So I did a freud test and it came back with the below:

### Oral-receptive

Being inherently passive and acquiescent, you often feel tense at the prospect of having responsibility placed on your shoulders and having to fend for yourself. Chances are that you resort to biting your nails and smothering yourself in comfort foods (such as ice cream and milky beverages) in order to relieve this tension. Inwardly, you are afraid that if you don't accommodate others and give in to their wishes, they will get angry and withdraw from you, leaving you with no one in your corner to fend for you. This prospect is inherently terrifying to you, because you feel that you cannot trust your own judgment or ""make it on your own."" Hence, you worry a lot about pleasing people and obtaining their approval, internalizing their ideas as your own and going to great lengths in order to avoid confrontation. Metaphorically, your personality style may be described as an overweaned infant smothered in breast milk. Due to the overavailability of nurture and care early in life, you learned that you could get by simply by passively sucking down the milk instead of developing your own skills.

I do agree with it. How can I change? I spend all my time in bed. I dont care about developing myself or reading or becoming a better person. What can I do??

728,"So I’m 21f Indian background, from Australia and yes I still live with my parents as I’m still in uni right now. I don’t finish until 23 almost 24. But I’ll probably move out when I’m like 25 or married lol. But tbh i don’t mind as I’ve actually been saving allot.
But it’s weird I sometimes feel guilty, there’s allot they don’t know about me. They were more stricter in high school in a way they would keep an eye on me constantly however now it’s less and I’m able to get away with things more.
They don’t know I drink, go out and basically what most my age do.

They know I’ve been to “events “ which I would say are “uni parties” but really I’m just going to my friends parties with uni mates or I’m staying over at a friends which I am but they don’t know what happens or where we go. 
But I feel guilty I would have to make up some stuff. It’s like their strict but not which makes it worse. I feel guilty cause sometimes my dad would leave $10-20 pocket money on the table but I would secretly slip it back in his jacket. 
I’m doing well at uni and I work ! However there was a period of time I had to repeat a sem due to anxiety but I told my mum it was just a “few “ units for the sem. (I guess I’m saying half the truth but keeping quiet of the rest). I couldn’t really tell them about the anxiety as they won’t understand. But that was a short period of time and I’m back on track. Surprisingly in covid I was able to do accelerate subjects! My grades are distinction and A levels. I have a good gpa,
 however back in high school they were bad. With dating I rather tell only them until I’m sure I find the “ one “ since I ain’t trying to get arranged married lol. 

Like I don’t mind living with them cause I feel some sane, I feel like no matter my second life I always love coming back home in comfort. I help out at home. 

Another problem is with my parents is even tho they strict they lowkey kinda spoil us not literally but in a sense they do allot same as they would as you were younger. I feel bad when they get me stuff but like I wanna do this same but they never take it!! 
At the same time my household is a bit dysfunctional. My parents technically only get along cause of me. I can’t really tell them my second life things cause my mum would blame my dad (she has certain mental health stuff she won’t get help for, Long story). But the fights are sometimes really bad and honestly I rather the home stays at peace. There are some things I know I wouldn’t take from my parents but Other than that I love them so much and it’s something I realise as I get older. 

After I graduate I’m hoping to finally rent my own apartment at 25 or whatever is suitable. I have planned out my savings for the future.

729,"Some context: when I was 15 I was raped by a female classmate. Nothing was really done due to the laws in my country and the attitudes to female/female rape. 

So I (17f) do A level drama. I used to love drama until my teacher left and I got a new one. He's very different from our old one, but that's good in some ways however I am not comfortable enough with him to tell him about my experiences (normally the school sends an email around to my teachers to let them know about my PTSD, etc). 

Well, yesterday he comes into lesson and says we're going to be adapting A Clockwork Orange to the stage. He gives us our roles and surprise, I play Mrs Mary Alexander (the woman from the infamous rape scene in the movie). 

Naturally I'm like 'fuck no' but I don't want to say it in front of everyone so I stay back and explain in admittedly a very awkward manner (I don't actually get to my point). He kind of shrugs it off and tells me not to worry because I'm a good actress. 

I didn't have drama today, but I've been avoiding him and I'm dreading tomorrow's lesson.

It feels like if I try to actually achieve a goal, then I would fail horribly, because other people are making it look much easier than it is, even if it isn't easy. It feels like I am destined to fail at the slightest task, from getting good grades, to even writing this right now. It doesn't have much effect in the short run, but with many other happenings like it, it tends to have an effect on my mental health, making me feel even worse than I already do, physically and emotionally. Despite feeling this way, I am not suicidal, because I've tried before, and I decided that I wasn't going out that way. ""When I go out, I'm gonna be happy,"" I told myself. But I struggle instead with living happily, because I'm not miserable, and I'm not truly happy. It feels like being able to be happy would require me to not be in school, because it feels like just people trying to make me miserable through pile after pile of work, social problem after social problem, day after day. It feels like a meaningless struggle, and I'm someone who is to damned ornery to stop trying to get better, but I'm also too f\*cking stubborn to die.

731,"What'up reddit!

I'm a 27M Brazilian guy. At the beginning of the year I got fired from a prestigious consulting job at an american management consulting firm in Brazil's \~Wall Street equivalent. I hated the job. Long long hours, waay to much pressure and a toxic corporate environment that's just not for me. 

It was my second corporate job and I've realized how much I dislike the 9 to 5 setup (in my case, 9 to 9 hehe). I don't enjoy going to work in an office without seeing sunlight, getting stressed as f\*\*\* and working at projects that don't resonate with me and that don't spark my passions. Even if I made a lot of money, I couldn't stop thinking about quitting and venturing in something new, more related to the things I love.

As soon as I got sacked this whole coronavirus pandemic shit started, so I kind of halted. I moved back with my parents, which are nice supportive people, but very close-minded with regards to career, job stability etc. I was now selling the idea to friends and family of doing a master's degree in France at a prestigious university but I really don't feel like it. I just put this facade so people would stop asking questions. I think somehow I sometimes have the urge to show others I'm doing something great, stable, prestigious and noteworthy, but that has only led me to feeling blue.

Having studied and worked a lot during my early twenties, I feel like I need to go out there, get lost, get to know myself, try different things...I don't wanna fall in the corporate-academic-normal life vortex again.

I've an International Relations degree and I'm really passionate about travelling, music, playing guitar, being on the outdoors, arts, craft, DIY shit, culture, etc...nothing of the sorts of corporate finance or management consulting.

I made a lot of money there at the company I worked for (for brazilian standards, something like 25k USD) so I have ""gas"" to withstand some difficulty for 1 or 2 years, but I'm having a hard time finding a direction and getting the balls to actually go for it.

740," I am in my mid 20s and I  work as an applications engineer for a small industrial company. Many of the salesman I work with are boomers and Trump supporters and the resulting work environment is extremely toxic. Change is scorned, process improvements are shunned, and my input and experience is largely ignored. On top of that, COVID precautions are minimal and there are several members of management who fly in and out on a weekly basis and I am currently one of the only people I know who actually goes into an office to work a job that can easily be done from home, and was done from home for nearly 3 months. I have worked here for over two years. 

I have been interviewing for other positions semi-casually and expected little but got an interview with a company in a similar field in a job that would be a little different. Instead of handling a lot of numbers and working internally, I would be more customer focused and be on the phone most of the time. The pay would be higher (although I’m not sure of the amount more), benefits and vacation are better, and I would be WFH for the foreseeable future. On top of that, it’s a much larger company that I imagine would be stricter about employee behavior.

The only  “problem” is I am planning a move to Europe with my SO in August of next year. There exists (or existed) a small chance my current company would be able to get me a job in Austria come next August but it is by no means a sure thing. Additionally, that country would not be our first choice when it comes to a move. My SO would like to be somewhere where she can work with more Russian or Ukrainian speakers. We have been leaning to Czechia as a choice because of its intersection of our interests and concerns. The new company I’d work at definitely wouldn’t have an overseas opportunity for me so I would be leaving in August, after only 10 months. The hiring manager specifically mentioned they wanted someone who would be there a long time, which I absolutely do not plan on.

Is this shitty? Does it look bad for my job history? Should I risk going through all the training for a new work environment that could be just as toxic (though likely isn’t)? Should I just stick out the job I have and hope for at least a WFH part of the winter? I would appreciate anyone’s input or similar experiences.",29Sep2020,1

742,"Yes I know, this sounds like the same shit you hear from all those middle school kids that need attention, but it is something that I genuinely struggle with.
It’s not that I wish I was part of all those cool things throughout history, but more the problem with this current time.
There is a very specific way I have always wanted to live my life, not just in terms of what I wanted as a career, but also my perspective, interests, everything I have always felt that I was meant to be in my heart is impossible to accomplish in this current world.
While I am still young (19) I constantly feel like I was robbed of any chance to make myself happy in life, and things just keep getting worse.
Yes obviously I know that other time periods had their problems as well, but that’s not why I’m here.
I’m looking for ways to cope with this terrible disconnect I feel with my life and my goals, it has always been one of the underlying ideas I have faced while in therapy, but It was always the thing we could never make progress on.

If anyone has faced a similar situation, I’ll take any advice you can offer. I feel that I can’t truly be happy in life if I can’t accept the fact that this is the time that I’m alive, I can’t change that. I want to be able to move forward with my life, without constantly wondering why I feel like I don’t belong here. I know that I have to put in work, but the problem is, I have absolutely no idea where to start. I was in therapy regularly until quarantine hit, then switched to random phone appointments. My therapist and I have approached this problem, but she never understood what I meant, taking it as simple teen angst and nothing else.

743,"So, to be quite frank, there wasn’t anything wrong with my girlfriend and I. I have lived my life kind of like a bachelor in ways, I like to travel, explore, focus on myself, meet new people, see multiple people at a time, etc.

I met this girl (21F) about a year ago while in the middle of doing my normal day-to-day life, and it seemed as though the gods handed me a gift. She was perfect. Absolute wife material. She was gorgeous, we got along like best friends, we were always there for each other, we connected well intimately, and even though we recently broke up, there wasn’t ever really a dull moment between us. Even the day after we broke up, we still decided to spend the day as friends and we both had a great time. There were times we both got emotional because it was the end, but all in all, we were just both compatible and had excellent chemistry. 

The thing that crushed me throughout the relationship is when I wasn’t with her, I felt pretty bad anxiety. I kept thinking about another girl, and it got to a point where it was becoming obsessive. It got so bad at one point that I checked myself into a hospital to see if I could get help. What I learned from that experience, is that I do have some anxiety, but I felt as though I checked myself in because I had a problem, when really I think I was just at my wits beating myself up for why I wasn’t able to fully give into being with my girlfriend. I’ve been really hard on myself emotionally these last couple months because I feel like I’ve let go of something so perfect. But every time I try to go back, I start wishing I was single and on my own again, which causes me anxiety. 

I’m down pretty bad right now. I try looking up stuff on google to see if anyone has ever been in my situation before, and some have, and the advice I’ve been getting is good about moving on and choosing my happiness, but I just wish at times that I could have been happy with her. I hate that I couldn’t fully be happy with her. It makes me feel like something is wrong with me, and that I wasn’t good enough. I only ever wanted to give her my heart, but I couldn’t, and after realizing that I was being too hard on myself and driving myself crazy, I had to be honest with her and let her go. I really hope that one day she finds someone who will love her in the ways that I couldn’t. I wish it could have been me. I hope one day I can find someone who will love me as much as she loved me. I know I’m young and have a lot of time, but it just sucks. I guess I just need to focus on myself. 

Any advice on how to get through this? Thanks.",29Sep2020,1

I am 18 in my last year of high school and I am almost at the top of my year when it comes to grades, that has to do with a fact that I have to study almost all day. My dad makes me study but also says that he will not let me go to college and that I will have to work after I finish this year. 

I am asking this because today he crossed the line. I was given an opportunity to study game developing from a guy that finished my school and landed a good job in high paying company, and he wanted to try online tutoring and he gave my teacher a list of programs and stuff I need to be a part of it. It's free and only 30 students can join there is also a prize for the best game at the end. My dad asked me (knowing that this is my dream) Wtf are you going to do with this and how are you going to make money, while telling me that I should just finish school and start working in construction or on a farm for minimum wage. 

While telling my younger brother who barely passes his classes how to land a government job and basically do nothing. I am pissed but quite frankly can't do anything about it he is my dad and I have to listen to him or I wont have a roof over my head.

751,"Lengthy post! So here we go: 

Background: I suffered a divorce when I was 9. I have younger siblings so I basically became a second “mother” very young. I’ve always helped with taking care of them. My father and I have not spoken in 6-7 years due to how he treats my mother. I’ve learned that he’s very selfish and just toxic. When 16 rolled around, he didn’t offer to help pay for a car (a car at 16 for me was necessary to help my mom out with errands and the kids). College rolled around, and I found that he claimed me on his taxes throughout high school so I got no money from FAFSA. Luckily my mother was able to pay for it because we were forced to sell our home when I was 15 (also because of my father), and we had to move in with my grandparents. My mother and siblings still live there, and I don’t because of college and because I just got a full-time job so I’m living in my own house now. My father is present (halfway if we are being honest) in my siblings lives, but I’ve found that it’s best to not have any interaction with him as it’s better for my mental health. I will say that I’ve come to peace with this and all of the terrible things he has done. When I landed my really awesome full-time job, it was like the ultimate relief for me knowing that I did it without him, and I’m proud of myself. Like despite all the hell he caused, I still came out strong and successful. When I was 15, I began dating this guy, and we were together almost 4 years. It was extremely toxic. (Trigger Warning: Suicide) He would threaten to kill himself often if we argued or if I made him upset. I became so incredibly frustrated with EVERYONE due to this. No one knew what I was struggling with because I couldn’t tell them in fear that he would do it. He said he would blame it on me so I could live with the guilt and hate from everyone else. I have two extremely traumatic experiences from this relationship... one with me bawling my eyes out while he has a gun in his hand threatening to do it in front of me and another with him sending me a text saying, “Goodbye, this is the end,” and not answering my calls for hours. When he finally answered, he said, “I want you to remember how this feels. If I do this, you’ll feel like this forever.” Ya know, being 15-18.... you have no idea what to do. There were times that I thought, “Maybe if I just beat him to it, I can escape that way.” When I moved off to college, we finally broke up, but it doesn’t stop there. I found out four months later that he had been cheating on me a whole year. I found a new relationship a few months after we broke up which I think it’s mainly because I just wanted someone to be there for me (???). I mean my current boyfriend and I are still together so I guess it all worked out. But anyway, when my current boyfriend and I started dating, he made comments like “yeah I taught her everything she knows, but she still isn’t that great.” At first when I heard these comments, they didn’t affect me much, but after hearing that he cheated, it really affected my self esteem...... for the majority, I’ve recovered from it because I’m doing much better in life without him and realized that, but it still kind of sticks in the back of your head. I could really go on and on about what’s happened in my life, but those are the major events. 

I’m someone who does not express my feelings... mainly because I think my father and ex bf ruined my ability to be vulnerable or completely open to anyone. I wear a very hard shell when it comes to my feelings. Not to brag, but I am like the queen of hiding my feelings if something is wrong. I have had anxiety attacks since high school, but I never did anything about it because I’ve always been taught to “tough it out” and “you’re fine.” Recently though, they have been getting much worse because my mother has recently been diagnosed with MS (multiple sclerosis) which I will not get into... it’s another can of worms. Finally, I went to see a doctor, and she stated that I have chronic depression... that I hide it very well too. She prescribed me medication, and honestly, I have never seen the sun shine this bright. I don’t get near as frustrated anymore with little things, and all around, I just feel like I appreciate the small stuff more. 

My only issue is that everyone has been saying, “I’ve noticed a difference in you.” My boyfriend called it first when we started arguing incredibly less, and he said something along the lines of, “Lately, you’ve been seeming more like your true self.” I know he means this in a “hey I’m proud of you” type way, but deep down, I felt so bad..... Previous arguments with him are a blur, but maybe I was the one instigating them due to my previous experiences (he knows about them). I would never ever want him to feel the way I felt from 15-18. I just hate the feeling that I might’ve been making him miserable at one point in time &amp; didnt realize it. Same situation with my mom. We argued like crazy when I was 15-18 because I was just so angry at everything..... I hate the feeling that I treated her badly in those years.... there’s honestly no telling how many other people’s feelings I’ve hurt because of how I was feeling and just didn’t realize it. It makes me extremely sad. 

So yes, my medicine is working, and my life has truly never been better. I’m more positive, happy, and I just genuinely enjoy life. But my questions are.... how can I get over being sad about my previous actions? I’ve apologized to both my mom and boyfriend, and of course they said I had no need to. I still get frustrated every now and then, and I would like some advice on how to handle that as well. I know someone will mention therapy, but I don’t want to go until after the new year. Honestly I’m just extremely busy right now, and I can’t make the time... after the new year though, I will be able to. I guess I’m mainly just looking for some short term remedies to deal with my frustration and sadness until I can go to therapy (if it’s necessary).

754,"There will be a TLDR but i’m making this as detailed as I can to avoid answering questions🧡 

We have been renting from my boyfriend’s aunt who recently discovered some unsavory things on her boyfriend’s phone which caused her to leave(i cannot expand on this at the moment but i will say that the situation is serious and I fully support her decision to leave his home). She has no backup plan and no job and “nowhere else to go”, so she needs her house back. We were planning on renting from her for another 2/3 years, and now we unexpectedly have to find a new place to live when our savings are almost burnt out from drastically reduced work hours (thx covid, i never thought a chef position could be so compromised) and an unexpected pregnancy that turned out to be ectopic(they charge you $22k to save your life and remove some organs) I’m STRESSED. 
On top of this, she really thinks she’s about to move herself, her daughter, and her 3 cats into our TINY 2-bedroom house that already has 3 people, 3 cats, and 2 ferrets within the next month. 
I understand that her situation is serious but it beyond upsets me that she doesn’t seem to care that she’s literally ruining our lives and uprooting my son’s life. I get that she’s going through it but I literally feel like I’m about to  e x p l o d e  from the massive stress that I’m under. I sell blacklight art as a sort of sidehustle(it’s my passion but it’s not paying all my bills yet)and I’ve been told by three people(my dad, my son’s dad, and a close family friend) to stop doing art, find a second job, and stack money until I have enough money to buy a house and move. This upsets me because I truly believe that art is my purpose and my future. But I also see their point, when I make around $400 a month off of my art but could be making that in a weekly paycheck at a second job. I don’t want to give up or stop working on my art, but I also know I need to buckle down and get hella money within 5 months and I don’t know what to do. Should I quit art or naw  ? 

TLDR; My landlady is kicking us out and I’m poor asf. I need to make $20k in 5 months to put a downpayment on a house and a few people close to me have told me to quit art and get a second job but i think that idea sucks because I love my art. Should I quit art or naw  ?",29Sep2020,1

---

There's this friend (let's call her Anna (25F)) who at one point earlier this year, I was very close to. We went on one date before we decided to just be friends because I was moving away to another state. After 4-5 months, I started dating someone else (let's call her Clare (25F)).

Although we had mutually agreed that we should be friends, Anna had a hard time when I was dating Clare. Anna didn't want to tell me at the time, but over the summer (after Clare and I broke up) she told me that it did bother her at the time. From what I understand, admitting that it did bother her brought back some old feelings and she started avoiding me. It's been 4 months and I've apologized for hurting her feelings (I should have waited longer after we dated), given her space, and we talked about how we both want to try to be friends again. She wants us to call over the phone every week, and it's been nice because she really was one of my closest friends. 

Sometimes though, it's kinda hard because understandably, it's been hard for her to feel as friendly with me as she was and it feels like there's this barrier in our friendship. I'm sad about losing this person I really cared about. We've talked about our feelings and how it's kind of hard right now to be super close, but that we still want to be friends and try to heal.

767,"Within the past year or so my thoughts of harming others have become increasingly more intrusive; so much so that I haven’t been able to go even a day without imagining graphic scenarios in my mind. It started out as a coping mechanism when I was unable to leave highly uncomfortable social situations, but now the thoughts have turned into something more elaborate. I never saw anything wrong with it, and it is still hard for me to feel that it is “wrong” which I believe could be due to my inability to empathize with others; probably as a result of my rather extreme social isolation. I’m not sure how my therapist would react to it, and I don’t want to be hospitalized when I feel that I am not an imminent threat — not at this time, at least — so I’m conflicted as to whether or not it would even be a good idea to bring it up. I know that if I don’t somehow get this under control, there is a good chance that it will escalate into something more serious, but there is also a part of me that wants it to and sees it as my only option.

First off, I’m sorry for this being such a bummer post.

Recently I can’t stop thinking about dying and all the various ways I could die. I’ve been very stressed lately and it’s effecting my sleep. Global warming and world ending scenarios are always on my mind along with chronic diseases and such. I recently heard about fatal insomnia and now I’m scared of having that, and it’s not a fun way to die. 
Any advice is appreciated.",29Sep2020,1
769,"About a year and a half ago, my father took his own life. It completely blindsided me and resulted in crippling depression for a while. During this whole grieving process, I learned I have a very good poker-face. I managed to suppress my emotions whenever around others and I feel like this has resulted in me bottling up my emotions and inner struggles.

Prior to my father's death, I had immense confidence in my self and felt like I was on top of the world. I transferred to my dream university, had ""success"" with girls I never thought I could and in general felt like my life was on a great trajectory for success and happiness.

At my home, I live with my mother, step father and half brother. I felt as if I had a good support system at home, though that quickly expired a month or so after my father's death. For the first few weeks, my mom and step father were very understanding and helpful but as time went on they expected me to return to my old self and participate in the household as I did before. Obviously, at that point I was still a emotional mess and this somewhat caused a rift between my family and I. Eventually school started back up and I moved back into my home near campus and everything went further down hill. I developed a really bad cannabis and nicotine habit, lost all interest and motivation for school and completely lost my sex drive to the point where I questioned my own sexuality. I didn't even have the courage to explain the situation to my housemates out of embarrassment about the situation (Yes I understand these are some weird mental gymnastics). This caused my housemates and I to slowly fall apart which further fueled my depression. I somehow managed to pass all my courses that year and moved back home when Covid started up.

Once I moved back in, I felt as if I was getting better and my relationship with my parents got better. Fast forward 6 months later and I'm starting my final year of my engineering degree. I'm attending classes from my parents' home and everything seems to be going well. Then I turned 21 a week ago and everything went downhill again. It felt as if my crippling depression came back. It started on my birthday when I got upset thinking about all the good times I had with my father on my birthdays. A day later I continued my post-grad job search and that day ended with me getting my 28th consecutive job rejection and I just broke down sobbing. In my mind, the realization of my life goals being unattainable became overwhelming atop of grieving over my father. My mother heard me crying and came to comfort me. She said ""It's okay, its going to get better"" and I just snapped at her. Started cussing her out and told her to get out after saying something along the lines of ""That's all you ever say but it doesn't mean shit. Its clearly not getting better."" I don't know why I snapped at her like that and understand I am in the wrong but my mother also understands where I'm coming from. It's now been about a week since my birthday and I have cried more times than I can count on my hand.

I feel as if I don't know who I am anymore. My own mental state confuses me so much. I will go from reminiscing about my father by looking at old photo albums to telling my mother that my father is a piece of shit for leaving me like that. I really do not know how to continue from here. It feels like I am working three full time jobs: school, job search and crippling depression.

Reading my post over makes me realize I am just venting and rambling on but any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.",29Sep2020,1

773,"I gave my 12th boards this year and have been browsing for colleges. My mom had promised me ever since I was in 8th grade that I could go to Delhi University. Now getting into any of the colleges under DU is tough, but I managed to scrape a 95% in my boards which barely meets the requirement of the top tier colleges but would probably get me into an above average one. My mom however has backed up on her promise, raising arguments about how Delhi is unsafe and I’m too young to be living alone so far from home. I have lived alone for two years, but it was near to my home. My mom is a single mother, and we live with my grandma. I just feel like I’d be miserable here. Because the backup college i took admission in has people that i do not relate with at all. They take in everybody, and don’t have a merit based admission criteria. Every day I show up for online class and listen to what my peers say, I get a suffocating feeling. I don’t know what I should do. The cutoff list comes out on 12th October and however grateful I am for what my mother has done for me, I feel betrayed because I brought her the marks she wanted me to bring, and yet I don’t get to go where I want. I don’t want to break her heart. Money is not an issue as DU colleges are government funded. I took admission in a private college so I’d be paying here more comparatively.

775,"I (20F), sufficiently responsible and greatly depressed and anxious adult, have been on meds for a good few months. Because they were my last resort.

I exercise daily, have many hobbies, many friends, I study and work hard. From the outside looking in, everything is perfect. But even still, I would experience debilitating anxiety attacks three times a week minimum and struggle with suicidal thoughts and tendencies. 

Ever since taking medication though, it’s been uphill. I have the strength to try and pull myself together. On medication, I haven’t experienced ONE anxiety attack. Not a single suicidal thought. I feel amazing, like a blank slate. It doesn’t make me overly happy or numb, it makes me feel normal, neutral?

Both of my parents are psychologists. Just now, we fought over dinner when I casually asked them about seeing someone to get a prescription (I recently moved back in with them because college is closed). They kept saying that I shouldn’t take it, that it’s side effects are bad, that I’ll end up like their patients (that’s mean to their patients??), that I should “find better coping mechanisms” (as if I haven’t tried). Overall judging me about it, mostly saying that I don’t know what medication does to people and that I’ll regret it when I’m 40.

First of all, thanks to this medication, I for once believe I’ll actually live to that age.

The me I am now is better than the me before, no thanks to them. 

I don’t know how to talk to them about this without exploding. They’re partially the reason I was the way I was. They’re shaming me for taking these meds that have helped me save myself. And if I stop, that weaning process will be so painful and then I’ll ?? be depressed and anxious again I guess ?? 

Any advice?

I’m obviously not going to stop the medication, I trust my doctor who has told me to at least take it for a year to a year and a half before considering weaning off it.

781,"So I have been approached by a recruiter for a job in the field I’ve been dying to get into, in a state I’ve been dying to return back to (NH). 

Now, I would try to find a job in the same field where I current live (NC) but it’s very competitive and they tend to require much more education and skill for lower pay. 

BUT, the big issue is, I’m currently in a relationship where my partner does not have any desire to move to NH unless his friend moves there as well. That is the only circumstance where he would move there. I can understand wanting to have some support system and being around familiar people, but my entire family is up there (cousins, aunts, uncles, my sister and eventually my parents). I understand that’s not the same as having his family and friends around, but he does not care for his family. He has no desire to speak to them or spend time with them. What is strange is, that if that is the reason he won’t move to NH, it doesn’t make any sense because he wants to move to states where we would have 0 support and 0 opportunities for jobs. (Colorado/Wyoming/Utah/Oregon) Both of is have never been to any of those states either so I would have no idea what to expect, nor would I know if we would actually enjoy it. I’ve lived in New Hampshire for the first 8 years of my life and visit every year and it’s where I picture raising my kids if I have any, growing as a person and retiring. It is literally my dream. 

He has not been to New Hampshire, so I do understand his reluctance to move, but he also wants to move to states he has never visited either... I’m not quite sure what the difference to him would be moving to NH vs. Colorado or any of the other states we have never visited/researched. At least with NH, we have a FULL support system, job opportunities and an environment I have a feeling he would learn to love. (Him and I are very outdoorsy people, he just isn’t adjusted to the cold) 

SO essentially my question is, if I do receive this job offer, do I take it and hope he decides to join me or do I leave well enough alone?

I love him very much, but I am not at all happy in the state I’m currently in. NC is too hot, not my crowd of people, not appeasing to the activities I enjoy and lastly, it’s TOO HOT lol. Moving back to NH has been my dream since the day I left, but he has made it clear it’s not really where he wants to be (sort of, he goes back and forth). We would have nothing left to lose if we left here, but he is so against it because it’s “New Hampshire”, whatever that means. I know I can’t force him, but I don’t want to throw away our relationship over something that seems somewhat trivial.

782,"Yup, exactly what the title says, except the thing escaped from what I thought was impossible to escape from the enclosure. I caught him outside in my backyard, and when I caught him he was already pretty plump, and if something is moving he will go after it. (he's a savage little hunter)

We have so many things in common and never run out of things to say to each other. We talk endlessly til 6am and it never feels forced..

I’m used to asking guys I date if they’re seeing other people, especially if we’ve known each other beforehand. Anywho. He told me that yes he’s seeing someone, but not sleeping with them. 

This part left me a bit confused. So a few hours ago he declared me his girlfriend, but then went on to say he’s also seeing someone? Isn’t that a bit of a player behaviour? 

It’s important to note that before this date, something happened between us where I broke his trust and basically ignored for a few weeks. I was in the wrong.

Knowing that our baby would arrive the first week of December, I spoke with my husband about inviting his parents over to our home to celebrate Christmas instead of us going to their home. I did not want to be a house guest during those initial weeks right after giving birth. My recovery with our first two babies was horrible, to put it lightly. I reminded my husband that I would be trying to breastfeed (which in the early months has previously been a really rough experience and is for many mothers), we’d all be on little sleep, and that postpartum recovery, particularly those first few weeks is really hard (I’ll spare you the details, but if you know, it really can be extremely painful depending on how your pregnancy and labor went). I told him it would not be very enjoyable spending a week in someone else’s home with a three week old newborn for one whole week—particularly for me since I was the primary caretake for the baby, and my mental health was never at its best postpartum. 

He went ballistic and claimed I was being unfair. After a rather extensive argument, he begrudgingly agreed to invite his parents over to our home instead of having us travel to their house over Christmas. I actually thought I was being pretty cooperative in even having guests over after just giving birth.

807,"So basically, it’s my 4th week in a new school, and I’ve started to get a crush on this girl. Problem is, she’s kinda introverted, and we don’t talk, so starting a conversation without it being weird woudl he kinda difficult. We have like 2 mutual friends and she walks home the same way as me for the most part, but she’s quite work focused, like a nerd ig, so she never goes to town or whatever so i can’t like, see her out there and talk or some shit. 

But then there’s this other girl, who I am friends with, and kind of like, we walk to town together with other people in a group a fair bit, and we hold hands when we do it. It’s not like a relationship or whatever, it just started as a bit and now it’s just normal. We joke and shit about us being a fake couple all the time, and like, I guess I’ve just started to get feelings for her. But she’s my friend and we’re both in the same friend group so if I say I have feelings for her and she rejects me then it’s gonna be awkward af yk.

But it gets even more difficult cause like, for some reason I told one of my other friends that I have a crush on someone at school, and I have her hints as to who it was, that being she’s a brunette and has glasses, which describes the first girl. The second girl is a brunette and wears glasses at home tho, so It’s like, difficult. More and more friends are finding out about it as well which just makes it even more difficult to hide cause I don’t wanna say I don’t have feelings for the second girl in case she has feelings for me and it ruins the chances, but I also don’t wanna make things awkward like I said. But the first girl is also just, really sweet, and from the outside considering idk her very much if at all, seems like a nice person, but idk if it would work is the thing and I don’t wanna go through that.

I just dk what to do so any help on how to approach the situation would be very much appreciated, thanks",29Sep2020,1

810,"Hi, im 17 and I've felt pretty off lately. 
I kinda had ""a depressive phase"", but I think that problem is gone now, instead I am under pressure every second, and dont have control over myself and am super emotional, its like i am on too much caffeine? 

And I just want to relax and shut off all those emotions, but I feel like if i do, then my grades are going to fall again, and I am going to turn into that dumb slob, that isolates himself, and is not able to do anything, and that hates himself so much again. 
 Also I am losing a close friend right now, and I dont know if I can handle that. 

Both my parents are not very well emotionally atm (bc of a loss in the family). And on the one hand, I want them to be fine, but tbh mostly, bc their behavior affects me. And they both seem to want me to comfort them and be close to them, but I really just dont have the energy to do that. 

Has anyone ever been in a similar situation, and knows what to do? How can I keep being productive wo making it eat me?

811,"Hello everyone, I would really appreciate if someone could give me advice about how to handle this situation.

Short backstory: I was sexually and phisically abused by my three years older brother when I was 10. We never spoke of it, I don't know if he even remembers (it was a difficult time for him). 
I never got over it, so now I find it really difficult to open myself up to new people and old friends. I got as far away from my family as possible as soon as I was able to, so I moved to another country, thinking it would solve the problem, which by no surprise, it didn't, instead it made more alone than ever.

Now to the question: I don't want to ruin the relationship between my parents and my brother, since I don't really know how they'd react (my father would probably cast him out), but I feel bad, in this last year I cried at least once a week and had anger management issues at work. I would really like to start working on myself to try and feel better, since I've been in this state for a decade now, where I'm unable to build lasting relationships with no one (I always close myself up). So I thought that maybe starting, by telling my parents would be a good idea, even tho I'm scared, like a lot... (I don't want to destroy my family) What advice would you give me?

P.s. Thanks in advance for reading this and for any kind advices you might give!",29Sep2020,1
813,"I've been chatting with this guy for like 2 months. Not in a dating or relationship - seeking kinda way but just as friends. In real life I have very few friends and I was very glad that the guy and I connected.

During the first month of our friendship, we chatted and Skyped a lot and we always seemed to have something to talk about. We'd send each other memes and stuff and it was just great.

Lately tho he's started being distant. ( I'm not even sure of this coz I'm very insecure and I tend to over - analyze stuff). He no longer sends memes and I tend to be the first one to reach out most of the time. Also, the answers seem to be shorter I think he uses fillers a lot. If I don't reach out forst, he rarely reaches out to me although he's online.

814,"Everyone in my house fell ill, one right after the other, about 4 to 5 days ago. We thought it was alergies, until it got worse. My daughter(almost 2years old) was the first to start coughing a lot, then my bf, then me. My bf got tested yesterday and my test is tomorrow. We are waiting on his results still but we have almost every symptom. Each day my chest feels heavier and heavier, and my daughters cough is getting bad. I know what to look for in an adult, because they can say what is hurting or how they're feeling, but I have no idea what to watch out for when it comes to my daughter. How will I know if she needs to go to the ER? If you have even a symptom of COVID, the Dr's office we go to won't let you in without you being tested first. Should I take her to a different Dr? I'm really at a loss of what I should be watching out for or doing to help her. She can't have any medications without dr approval, but they won't let us in. Anyone know the answer?",29Sep2020,1
815,"So I’m really upset and confused here, my bf parents just moved to the same country as us, and they only live an hour and a half away at their daughters apartment, my bf visits them often, maybe twice or thrice a month, his sister and I are pretty close she uses to live in the same city but she moved for grad school but she’s always visiting us as well. 
Now I live with my parents, and my parents are very strict and religious that if I tell them I have a bf they’re gonna tell me to either get engaged to him or leave him. See I don’t mind getting engaged to my bf. As a matter of fact I want to!!! But I understand that he’s not ready and he needs his time so I don’t really expect anything from him. That’s why I haven’t told my parents yet. 
Now here’s where it gets a little complicated, his sister is dating someone from a different religion/background, and she had the balls to bring him to meet her parents, even tho her parents wouldn’t approve the marriage if he doesn’t convert to their religion, but she still managed to make them accept that they’re dating each other and they love each other. And that’s a huge step!! After I saw what happened, I asked to meet his parents but he keeps refusing, he says it will only bring headaches and problems to him, but seeing what his sister did to her bf, it just makes me feel like I’m not worth the trouble, even though me and him are same religion and background, so I don’t see why his parents would even be mildly upset about our relationship, if anything they should be proud of their son that he scored a girl like me. (Not trying to be mean but everyone knows I’m out of his league, but I never really cared since I love him so much)
So here’s me being upset and disappointed how he doesn’t even want me to meet his parents even though his sister introduced her bf to them and nothing happened. 
Do I have the right to be upset? Do I deserve someone who’s not afraid to put more effort in making our relationship more legit?

Side note: we’ve been dating for more than 2 years now(more than his sister and her bf)",29Sep2020,1

818,"So, probably I should speak to my therapist about this but I need advice

I worked in a job a year ago, and then I left to move out of the country for a post-grad personal gap year type thing.

A month ago, I returned, I started looking for a job on my own and it just so presented itself that my old boss reached out and offered me my position back - without me putting in an ounce of effort. Because I had been home only two weeks, but two weeks of panicking because of being jobless and the whole covid climate, and everyone telling me just take what you can get - I jumped on it and said yes.

Ok so the truth is, I don't want to work this job **at all** . For many personal reasons I don't feel are comfortable or necessary to post here. I've been working remote for them for the past month, but now that covid rates are going down, I'm back this week. 

On the side, I've been looking for other jobs (just cause-no good reason) and I just had an interview/zoom call with a company I'm very interested in. Now, they want me to come in for an in person interview. If it works out with this other potential job, I want to leave the job I just started. But I feel terrible leaving the job.

The worst part is, I have a really close relationship with the people I'm working for now. I'm very respected, valued, etc. But I don't want to be here long term, there isn't any growth, among many personal reasons. 

How do I tell my boss that I'm thinking about leaving (after I just started)? he isn't just my boss, I have close relationship with his family, community etc. It's not so simple.

821,"So, I've struggled with my depression for the better part of 4 years now. When I was younger i put it off as just being tired from schooling, but since my graduation last year, it's just got worse and worse. Part of it can be attributed to just life stuffs, but a large part is caused by my mother. 

Since I was young she's always had an the attitude ""my way or the highway"", and it's caused me and my siblings a lot of harm. Whenever she gets mad, especially when I was younger, she starts to yell. She never gave me a chance to actually speak and constantly yelled over me, to the point where my brain starts to shut down and I lose the ability to speak whenever I'm in an argument or a discussion with someone.

Since around August now both my mum and stepdad have said that they want me out of the house by January and I've tried to explain to them that I'm not able to yet since my job doesn't pay enough and despite asking for more hours, I have yet to receive any more. My mum doesn't see it this way and instead thinks I'm just being lazy and shy. She doesn't understand that I make $900 a month, which isn't enough to even afford rent where I live.

Yesterday finally broke me though. After her yelling at me to get out of bed to get to work in the morning, even though I was working later than she thought I was, and her telling me that there's a new internet limiter in the house and that I'm not allowed to complain about it, she finally stopped me on my way back to my room from the bathroom to give me a monologue saying that ""if you want to waste your worthless life playing video games all day, you can go do it somewhere else"". I nearly started crying right then and there. All of my fight left me. I waited for her to finish, went back to my room, and just cried. At one point I had a knife in my hand with the blade hovering above my wrists. I cried myself to sleep last night. I haven't left my room today, I can barely type my hands are so shaky.

828,"I have a Associates Degree in Applied Science for Chemical Dependency Counseling (CDC for short). The whole point of my field is to counsel people who have a Chemical Addiction (crack, meth, etc), and help motivate them into kicking their addictions to change their lives. My whole goal I wanted was to use my skills with helping others, and to put it to a very productive way to help change lives for the better. 

When I first got into my college courses, it became very clear that this field is very heavily centered on a prison environment, and helping those who are incarcerated to kick their addictions. At least, at the school I went to. 80% of my classes involved learning about the prison environment, how to file paperwork, and different ideas and techniques to counsel those who are incarcerated.  The other 20% involved family counseling, actually learning body language, and the ethics involved. I even did my Practicum internship at a Juvenile prison, where I worked with groups of kids who were in prison for gang and drug activity. 

Well, when I interned at the prison, I was so caught up in how the other counselors worked. My mentor (bless her) did everything she could to teach me, but the other counselors didn't like me for some reason. Any time my classmates worked with them, they loved how they worked and praised them all the time. When it came to me, they threw their work at me and left me to fend for myself. They were rude, mocked how I looked at approaching counseling kids by telling me I needed to be very rough with them (like yelling matches and hurtful language), and overall did everything they could to make me feel stupid and inadequate. One morning, I even overheard them talking about me before the kids came in, saying I was 'too soft' and that my counseling skills were pathetic. My mentor defended me, and when we talked in private later, she told me that it was because I was so young going into my field, and that they had become bitter and spiteful of their own work. ""Burnout"" is very common in this field of work.

 I really began to doubt myself and if I could really do this, despite the positive results I got with my kids in the stage of recovery I was counseling in. Yes the kids were rough and they always had their fights and drama, but working with them made me feel like I might make a difference.

After I graduated, I hesitated to file for my state paperwork to get started in my field, and now when I think about working in a prison environment again... I feel physically sick and I cant stand the thought of going back into a prison environment. In fact, my drive to do this field in a prison system has been shattered, and I would rather do something else with my degree if possible.

Anyone have advice for what I can do? Please... I want to get out of low income jobs, but I dont have the heart to go into the prison system to counsel people anymore.",29Sep2020,1
829,"Hi all,   

&amp;#x200B;

Let's use initial's for this, so you can keep them straight, without identifying anyone involved.  

B = me  

L = my girlfriend/fiancée (she knows all this and is fine with it)  

J = my regular SW  

K = J's best friend, Also a SW    

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in Canada.  L is in the United States.  The border is closed and we can't be together, so that's the background and why L is cool with all this. 

&amp;#x200B;

I posted the story on reddit previously, just to give you some background on the situation.   

\[[https://www.reddit.com/r/SexWorkers/comments/ib4py8/thank\\\_you\\\_to\\\_someone\\\_for\\\_a\\\_great\\\_time/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SexWorkers/comments/ib4py8/thank\_you\_to\_someone\_for\_a\_great\_time/)\]([https://www.reddit.com/r/SexWorkers/comments/ib4py8/thank\_you\_to\_someone\_for\_a\_great\_time/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SexWorkers/comments/ib4py8/thank_you_to_someone_for_a_great_time/))  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

After this happened, a lot changed. I saw the regular girl I talked about above 1 more time in august. At that point she moved into a new condo, so she took a break from work for a bit.  That was fine. I offered to help her move, but she didn't take me up on it, that's fine. 

&amp;#x200B;

\&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Then she pencilled me in for an appointment, but cancelled in advance, saying she needed more time to settle in. Again, I said, that's fine.  Take all the time you need. Let me know if you need anything. In the meantime I'll just wait for you to be ready to see me again.   

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In the meantime, we've been talking.  She told me she is taking some time off, not just cause the move but because she wants to work on her mental health and she wants to be sober.  While she is not addicted to anything, she says she experimented with Cocaine a few times while working in strip clubs, at the spa, and while working with a friend doing incalls at the hotel in the visit i mentioned before. She wants to quit that and be sober. She has seen too many strippers and spa girls ruin lives over drugs.  I responded, I'm very supportive of this. Take all the time you need. I will see you when you're ready. Your growth is sexy to me, it makes you more defined as a person. If you are in crisis and need help, feel free to call me to talk at any time of day.   We've continued to talk on DMs every three or four days since then.  She's doing well, and while she's been tempted from time to time, is not even using weed now for 6 weeks, and of course no cocaine.   

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Eventually, I still felt horny, so I booked a different provider.  Let's just call it a disaster (she was really high on something, fell asleep at one point), and leave it at that.   

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Not satisfied with that, I went to the spa a few days later. I had an appointment booked in advance, with a new girl. That girl had to leave before I arrived, family emergency I was told.  The only girl available was K.  I figured... what the heck, she doesn't know who I am, never met me before... she won't know its me. I even used a different first name.  We had a really good session, fun time.  Afterwards we had some small talk, but K called me out.  You know my friend J? I said, yes.  She said, wait a second, you are B, aren't you.  You're the B... who lives in \_\_\_\_\_, and works as a \_\_\_\_\_\_\_.  I said yes, knowing then that I was busted. 

&amp;#x200B;

K tells me, you know something... J adores you. She can't stop talking about you. You're her absolute favourite client. When she quit the spa, I helped her set herself up to go independent. Her first outcall was with you. She said it had to be you and no one else. I recognized your face cause I helped her screen you. She really likes you. She is very fond of you. 

&amp;#x200B;

I say, you know what. She's my favourite too.  If she wasn't on hiatus, I wouldn't even be here. I'd be with her. She's the best I've ever been with. She's special to me.   

&amp;#x200B;

K says also I'm glad to finally meet you. Did you know that J wanted to introduce you to me (K). She wanted to propose a threesome before her hiatus, but things never quite worked out timing wise. I take K's number and say I will see her again for an incall if J stays on Hiatus, or I will talk to J and we can set up that threesome.   

&amp;#x200B;

I keep talking to K. I learn that J is no longer talking to K and K doesn't know why. I talk to J about it. She talks to K and patches things up, She tells her she can't hang out because she is not talking to any of the spa girls. She just doesn't want to be around any of drugs she sees in the Spa. She has nothing against K, and knows K is not a user, but K hangs out with the other girls who are. So she's cut off everyone so she is not hanging around the drugs.  

&amp;#x200B;

What I didn't realize this whole time was that K was hinting that J sees me as more than a client, I just thought favourite client meant favorite client (more on this later).... where I see J as a friend and provider but I'm totally in love with L.  I've always been clear with J about how I see her. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

About ten days ago I propose to L over zoom. No, its not how I originally planned, but its a pandemic and here we are. If we are married, we can be together. She can cross the border for a wedding. L says Yes. We are working with immigration. Looks like she can come to Canada and we can get married in February/March.  L sets new ground rules... she says that I can see ONE girl until L gets into Canada, but she wants me to stop sampling. I say of course.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

I tell K, look I'm engaged. My girl said I can only see one SW til the wedding. I'm out of seeing you. I'm done with SWs except for J.  She wishes me luck and thanks me for setting her back up with J. She cares for J and even though they aren't meeting in person, they are talking now, so that's good. K says she just wants to look out for J and make sure she is being safe as an independent. She reminds me, J adores you, she still doesn't shut up about you. She is very fond of you. You be sure to treat her well. I tell her that I will. 

&amp;#x200B;

I tell J the story, I tell her that I'm engaged.  L is coming to the country in February, once she is here, our arrangement is done. Until then, she says I can keep seeing you. She wants me to see one girl and only one girl though. And I'm fine with that. In choosing one girl, it is no choice at all, it can only be you J, I wouldn't want anyone else for my last experiences as a bachelor.  When you are ready to come off hiatus, lets set something us.   

&amp;#x200B;

J takes a few days before she responds to the messages.   

&amp;#x200B;

I'm going to quote with some edits for privacy.  

&amp;#x200B;

""Right now my sobriety and mental health are fragile and very important. I'm still spending my time healing and working on myself. This is the first time in my life I've done this, and its been challenging but also rewarding. 

&amp;#x200B;

I miss you dearly, and you know that. You know how I feel, you heard it from K, and what she told you is true. I care about you. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't promise you a date because I want to be prepared and be my best self. I don't want to cancel on you. I don't want to give you a bad time.   

&amp;#x200B;

You are the only person i’ve even considered seeing during this time because I’m actually planning to  not see clients anymore. I'm going to take things all online with onlyfans due to the second wave coming and continuing to work on myself. However i do want to work this out and find something that we’re both comfortable with. I am so happy for you and your engagement, you deserve all the happiness in the world and every time you talk about L she just sounds like the most amazing girl.  

&amp;#x200B;

Also thank you for always being so understanding and patient with me. a lot of people have been pressuring me to come back and it’s just so difficult to explain to them why i’ve been gone because it’s personal to me and i don’t think any of them genuinely care.   

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think would be your ideal date? are you thinking like a few days together? your place or a romantic getaway? i wouldn’t want to make you feel like a regular “client” and charge you by the hour either, that is just tasteless. Let's just get together, a date and not paid.    

&amp;#x200B;

Also i am sober but by this i mean not smoking weed or doing anything else by the way, i still indulge in wine! i’ve never had an issue with anything but i just get worried seeing those girls from the spas. you know this though. but yes maybe we can hash out the details and from there we will pick a date for october and make this one to remember! of course i want to see you as much as possible before this happens though. but i would love to start with something incredible because it’s been  so long. and you are really just the only person i feel comfortable and excited about seeing right now B.  

&amp;#x200B;

Love youuu, J""  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So here we are, thank you all for reading this.   

&amp;#x200B;

I need to know, how should I respond to that. Should I even see J again.  I really like her as a friend (with benefits), but not more than that.  I've made that clear to her. I've told her that I'm in love with L, and while we can have fun, it's just fun.    

&amp;#x200B;

The part that confuses me is she wants to date for free.  If it wasn't for that, I'd be like oh, this is just our same old arrangement and keep going forward, maybe the dates are overnights and such now instead of a 2 or 3 hour session, but its still just business and friends.  But the no paying thing and K's words, and the Love you sign off, it's all in my head.  Do I end this now cause it will be harder in February and March if she has feelings for me? Or do I go ahead and have this affair until my fiancée arrives.  L is fine with us being open until she gets to Canada, so I'm not worried about her.   

&amp;#x200B;

I do care about J.  I know its not love.  It's pure lust cause J is a smokeshow and incredible in bed. It's also caring like I care about my friends though. I want her to stay sober, I want her to get out of strip clubs and spas if that is not healthy for her (her own words not mine) and to continue to be on this healthy path. I want to help her stay improving herself and her life.  I worry if she has feelings for me and I break it off, I break her heart and she turns back to the spa or the drugs or whatever.   

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously, thinking with my lust wants to just wait for her to be ready. Do this date in October, and do a number of dates until L is here.  But is that the right decision.  What do you all think, does J have feelings for me? or is there something I'm not seeing?",29Sep2020,1
830,"So I am a 17 year old incel from India.Have been given a rating of around 4-6 by users here and have been rated as a 5 on r/truerateme.I am not necessarily ugly but not attractive either.I am 6’1 with an above average frame.I am still in puberty,so I am still growing projected height is around 6’3(I started puberty latej and I am planning to pursue my higher education overseas and here are my options

1.Go to Germany.I have been accepted in Technische Universität München(TUM) amongst the Top 5 universities in Europe with priceless name tag and reputation associated with it and in Germany education is free so I wouldn’t spend  a qpenny and wouldn’t have a student debt a sweet deal on paper but while I am there I am guaranteed to be an incel.I am pretty sure that I can forget about sex and romance for the time I am there.I simply would be a ethnic dog trying to ascend in the land of the giants.The average height in Germany is 6ft and is filled with guy’s who are probably way better looking than me and by going there and trying dating apps I am pretty much getting a knife to a gun fight.

2.Go to the US.I have also been selected in the UNC(University of North Carolina) and few other good universities in the Bay Area.I probably have a decent chance of finding a gf there since there are many curry women with whom I could get along with but I would have to compromise on the quality of education and going to this uni would leave me with a small student debt.

3.Going to the UK.I haven’t sent my application yet but would probably get selected in a few tier 1 unis there.From what I heard online,UK is pretty hypergamous so I don’t have high hopes but definitely got s better chance of than in Germany 

I am currently trying to looksmax as much as I can,getting rid of the bloat,get jacked up,skincare etc etc.So,it’s either going to Germany get the best education for free but be doomed to 4 years of inceldom or compromise on the university and have a small debt with a decent chance of finding love.So it’s a fight between instincts and common sense.What should I do?What would you do if you were in my shoes?Any other suggestions?Any other countries I can try to go to?",29Sep2020,1

The thing is, she's been working the night shift, which has led to me being barely able to contact her.
She won't even dicuss the issue with me, and I'm thinking that it would be better to replace her, as I'd rather have roommates that I'd get along with, but that would require calling up the landlord, having the new person apply, and more lease signings.

So after I earned my Bachelor's degree I dive straight into my my Master's in hopes that it would help me find a better job, as even with my Bachelor's I still couldn't find a job that paid more than $7.25/hour. Six months into my program and I began getting really sick, I muscled through it but by February 2020 I struggled to attend both work and my classes, things became a bit easier when classes were moved online and I was able to catch up and received an extension for my Spring 2020 classes, but I've run into the same issue this Fall. I'll finish my shift at work and just pass out on the couch. However, unlike last semester where I had the desire and drive to be in class, now I don't and I don't know if it's because I'm really not a big fan of the material (It's American and British Lit, I've taken these same genre classes over and over and they never get any better) or what. In addition to this I'm supposed to be working on my Master's thesis, but I can't seem to get started and am worried that I'll disappoint my thesis supervisor. I'm at the point where I'd really just like to drop and find a full-time job but I'm worried I won't be able to support myself. And at the same time, I really don't want to drop because one, I need to be able to make a living wage, and two, I really want to teach at a post-secondary level which requires a minimum of a Master's degree.

842,"I don’t know what’s wrong with me, I’m really trying. I worked at a call center when covid initially hit, I was getting sick frequently at work and had a false scare after being possibly exposed to someone with covid. At this first job there was a different set of expectations set by my team leader and site director, my team leader sent me home after uncontrollably vomiting on a shift. Next week the site director called me into work and demeaned me for every attendance slip-up since I began working at the company, and when I was at the point of tears they demanded I justify why I should remain on the workforce, I walked away because I couldn’t take it anymore. Later that week I received a call from HR saying I should’ve been in the first wave of work from home due to my health issues and as a result of throwing up multiple times on the job, should have been sent home to work a week prior to being demeaned by my site director. But at that point they said I had just walked away in the middle of what I thought was a regular shift, and told them I had quit, so I could not continue with that job.

Through my mom’s boyfriend, I found a work from home medicare job that earned good checks for a few months, and then turned out to be a scam, our employer laid us off and didn’t pay me over $1100 in unpaid wages, completely disappeared, taking legal action to get something done here.

Then I got a seasonal job at a Halloween store, at first it seemed great until my shift actually devolved into me unloading trucks and boxes for full multiple day shifts and not doing any actual retail work, at this point the call center reached out to me and promised to increase my pay, I was desperate and tired of warehouse work and decided I wanted to go back.

Showed up to the interview only to be told I actually could not return due to not putting in a two weeks notice last time i quit.

Now I’ve been working customer support for about a month, I had a pre-employment drug screening that explicitly mentioned that THC would not be tested, today I have been informed I failed my drug test for marijuana and have been terminated immediately.

847,"Hi Reddit!

I've struggled with depression and anxiety - both clinically diagnosed - for a lot of my life. For about a year I thought it was getting better. This is mostly because a lot of my depression was linked to school and when I started university/college I finally felt like that chapter had closed.

Throughout the pandemic I was actually pretty stable. I have a family member who was severely 'at risk' so I felt really safe having to stay in the house. 

Things have been growing worse and worse for the past month or so because things have started to ease up. Where I live the restrictions have eased almost entirely while the cases continue to rise and the second wave is on its way. This is also around the time that I need to start back at university, which is in the hot spot of infections. 

My university has been very unhelpful in so many ways. The worst was that I asked if I could join the classes on an online ONLY basis (because they will be operating on a rotational rota with half the class always online anyways) based on the fact that I have an at risk family member who i live with, and they rejected it. I have to go in go my first in person class tomorrow an I am terrified- I understand that the university has been taking precaution but I am more concerned about my travel into the uni. I'm terrified that I will pick up the virus and infect my family (who will likely die). 

This fear that I have been feeling has been worsened by a lot of family deaths and sicknesses. I am also feeling a bit of imposter syndrome in my university course.

I'm really worried that I am going to go back into a really dark place. 

And, before anyone says it, I can't really speak to my family about how I am feeling because this has notoriously made me feel even worse.",29Sep2020,1
848," 

Sooooo here is the story :

2 years ago, I met this girl online while playing video games (we'll call her J). We started playing the game together as gaming buddies. I didn't bother thinking about romance since we lived in separate countries and just thought of J as a really good friend. We started playing on a daily basis, and became really close in a matter of days. We added each other on social medias and continued talking over the phone before going to bed.

A few weeks after I met J, she introduced me to her best friend (we'll call her W) and we all started playing together. We all had a blast playing and talked about anything and everything.

Slowly, J became more and more distant. We would call each other only once a week and we would only play twice a week. On the other hand, I started talking and playing with W more and more. Because I met W after J we would have more things to talk.

But even if I talked more and more with W, we were all really good friends and there wasn't any kind of tension between us. I didn't overthink our relationship and just considered both of them as really good friends (didn't want to make it complicated with romance and take the risk to lose what we had).

Then came the day they told me about their trip to a country close to mine. They asked me if I wanted to join them for a week. We had already face timed so I knew it would be safe to meet them in real life. On the other hand, I was nervous... Our relationship that I tried to protect at all cost could change and maybe even be ruined if we met in real life. People tend to act differently in real life situations and I didn't want to be disappointed in them and didn't want to disappoint them. I knew it was a gamble but I felt like it would be an experience to really get to know them.

We thus travelled and met in that foreign country.

It.was.a.mistake.

In one word, bad. There was no decisive moment that made the trip bad, but from day one I knew things wouldn't go as I had hoped. They talked more and more in their native tong and I just wished to disappear. They weren't rude or anything but I could just feel the distance widening between us. It is true that I could have tried harder to integrate myself to the conversations but I just felt like I didn't belong.

Anyway, long story short things went South from then on. After the trip, we talked less and less. I thought that in the worst case scenario, we would just stop talking to each other and that would be it.

But what happened just destroyed me. One day, I was scrolling through my social media and I noticed that I got removed from the group we had created. Slowly, I got removed from everything, every group, everything that connected us. They blocked me simultaneously on everything. BLOCKED. What even is blocking ??? I thought blocking was for creeps. Was I a creep to them ? What did I do wrong ? Why did they feel the need to sever our relationship in such a brutal way. They were my friends... did they just not care about me ?

Anyway, a part of me broke that day. (for your information : they hadn't blocked me on the initial game we played together and didn't block me on snapchat but I just assumed they forgot to block me there and didn't think much of it.).

I kept thinking about them for the next few months. Everyday, I wanted to contact them, ask them why, apologise ? do anything to find what went wrong and fix it. But I didn't want to be insistent so I refrained and tried to move on. If you block someone, you've made your mind.

A year later, J contacts me and tells me it would make W extremely happy if I wished her happy birthday. What ??? After 1 year of blocking me she just contacts me like we talked to each other yesterday. I was fuming inside. Was I just her plaything, something to use when bored and then tossed aside ? Did she really just contact me with no explanation ? Just why would she open my wound again ? Was in not enough to stab me in the back, did she also need to pierce my heart ?

Obviously, I didn't say any of that, but answered politely and told her that I would comply with her request. I wished W a happy birthday, she said that ""I made her day"" but that only left me more confused.

If she didn't want any contact with me, why block me ? If they contact me again why not confront me about blocking me ? Why did they use a heart emoji and why did they act like they were overwhelmed with joy when they contacted me again ? I didn't block them, THEY BLOCKED ME...

It has been 2 months since I've wished her a happy birthday and I still think about them. I just want to forget them but at the same time I miss our late night talks, I miss they way we could share anything we wanted, I miss them. But.it.still.hurts. Being blocked for the first time in my life hurts, and being blocked by people I considered to be precious friends hurts even more.

On one hand I want to talk to them, just like it used to be. On the other hand, I don't want to suffer. I hate being emotionally attached and at the same time I crave for it. I'm afraid of caring for people because I know I'll get hurt at some point. I DON T WANT TO FEEL THAT WAY. I WANT TO FORGET. I WANT TO MOVE ON.

But I can't... I'm lost on an island waiting for the people who left me there to rescue me.

I’m also good at interviewing and getting hired. Of course I have flaws and do struggle with depression and anxiety from time to time. I’m also lazy and I drink too much lol. Just trying paint a picture here and not make myself sound arrogant by listing only good qualities.

Anyways, I’ve always been confident in my abilities but since I’ve been out of work, I fell into a bad bad depression. My girlfriend of 3 years left me and I haven’t been able to find a job. 
I thought it would be easy like the other times but due to covid, so many people are out of work that’s hundreds of people are applying at the same job as me so it’s near impossible to stand out. I had an interview with a mortgage company and I absolutely sold myself. I was confident with how it went and they said they would call me in a day or two but never did. I reached out to them after 4 days and they said they stopped hiring due to covid and told me to call back in two weeks. I called back and they kept giving me this weird run around and two weeks later I get vague email from them telling me they wish me the best in my future endeavors.

I’ve applied for 20 jobs in the last month and FINALLY get a call back from one yesterday. It’s the perfect fit at a mortgage company. The phone interview went well and today I had the official interview but it was on zoom with 5 other candidates. I did my thing but for some reason I don’t feel confident anymore. Being rejected by my girlfriend, being rejected by that job I thought was going to hire me, it’s really taking a toll on my overall confidence in life.

I’m already anticipating getting rejected by this job too. Just when I thought everything was going smooth in my life everything is just an unsure mess. Feels like I’ll never get into this industry and start this career. Feels like I’ll never find love again. I thought I was going to marry this person and it doesn’t help that she’s a super model. We had a good relationship but there was a lot of toxic behavior on her end and some on mine as well but I’m understanding and willing to work out issues but she isn’t. I feel pretty helpless and unwanted in life.
I’m running out of my savings and might have to move back with my parents. I’ve never been this low before and my motivation is at an all time low. If I don’t get this job, it’s really gonna be a finishing blow. The worst part is, I’m not even passionate about fucking mortgage. I’m only doing it because it pays good and my resume has jobs on it that will help get me into this industry.

My question would be, does anyone have any advise for a young man dealing with constant rejection?",29Sep2020,1
862,"So I have this problem with my mother: she is extremely stressful to me.
(Please pardon if I do anything wrong, I am very new to reddit!)


So for the past few years or so my mom is slowly gotten for stressful for me. I honestly feel like she doesn’t care. Why you may ask? For starters, I am a very sensitive person. For example if the class is getting yelled at and I know I didn’t do anything wrong I will still get upset and most likely cry. My girlfriend and close friends know this and try their best to not upset me on accident. My mother on the other hand p, even though I’ve told her for YEARS that I am sensitive she still yells at me.

So a bit of backstory before we get deep into this.
My mother has married 3 people, soon to be four. My dad, her 3rd husband, left when I was 5. This has had lasting affects on me, but I won’t get into that. I love my dad, even though he has an addiction to alcohol. (This runs in both sides of my family.) Although, I haven’t spoken to him in about 5-6 years, I still love him with all my heart. My mom grew up in a terrible household, her sibling treated her like she was a toy. She actually raised my aunt’s daughter when she was around 10. She’s had it hard ever since. Time skip to me, a bisexual depressed girl.


My mother has always been hard and ‘wanted the best for us’ more like wanted the best for my brother. My brother is extremely smart, he could graduate high-school when he was freshman. I however have a learning disability. Basically I just learn a lot slower. So being put in special classes did not raise my self esteem at all. I do believe she did love me before my brother started soaring in classes. She started giving him more support. At first I did mind, I mean he’s my brother after all and I love him. After a few years I just felt she didn’t care. Recently, she found out about my depression. Instead of supporting me and trying to stop me from self harming, she just doesn’t do anything. I don’t really care though, since I still believe she does not love, nor care about me. Like I said before, she knows I’m sensitive but still yells at me and calls me names. Usually any interaction with her either makes me uncomfortable or I start quietly crying even when we’re just having a conversation. She doesn’t yell at me too often though because I usually hide away in my room. I am an artist and deeply in love with Undertale AUs. (Go ahead and attack me now &gt;;( ) She has gone through my sketchbooks without permission which has led me to go to digital so she can’t get her nasty hands on my art. She has commented on ‘Why do you always draw skeletons?’ And ‘Why won’t you draw something else?’
I perfectly fine with drawing other things, but I love drawing the AUs because I’m completely comfortable with it and I love doing it. 

As you can see, she’s not that supportive. Like I said earlier, I have not talked to my dad in years, so I feel alone. 

One thing that pisses me off to no end is that she KNOWS I’m bisexual but always talks how I’ll marry a man some day. Sorry mom, I already taken.

So.. does anybody have any advice how I can talk to my mom about she’s stressing me? I don’t know what to do and I sometimes think resorting to- not alive- is my only way out..!",29Sep2020,1

865,"My girlfriend works all the time. There was a wave of people who quit because they got better offers and her job is taking forever to hire new people and it’s been 5 months since everyone quit. She usually goes to work at 9 am comes back around 3 or 4pm for lunch. Then leaves again at 4:30 and isn’t home until 11:30 pm. 

The job has her standing all day long and when she comes home she’s too exhausted to do anything. Often times, she just starts staring into space or mindlessly scrolling through her phone when she comes home and doesn’t have the ability to listen attentively when I talk to her. 

Since she works all day long, I end up getting stuck with most of the chores. She’ll pick up the dog poop and do a load or two of laundry on her days off but that’s it. 

She usually gets two days off and she only is productive in the evening of the second day off. She has her first day off as a day to recharge. 

I’m tired of working, doing school work, and doing all the chores. I miss my girlfriend. She’s overworked and I barely get to see her. She can’t even eat the meals I make when they’re fresh because I don’t want to eat dinner at midnight, right before I go to bed. 

I want her to quit her job and find one that pays more and she works less. 

She graduated college last year and hasn’t even tried to apply to new jobs. She’s lost and confused on where she wants to go in life. She thinks she’s worthless as a human being and that she’s never going to amount to anything and is just a waste of a human being. 

I told her I’d apply for jobs for her if she helps me build a resume for her. All she says is “I already have one” and when I ask her to email it to me then she says “nah. Nobody would hire me anyways” 

She has so much experience in many different fields. She’d easily get a job if she tried. She thinks she’s under qualified for most jobs unless they’re at a restaurant. She feels hopeless and idk how to fix that or help her through it. 

I constantly tell her that I applied to every job under the sun and now I get paid more than most college students and I’m basically just sitting on my ass all day and working on homework or art commissions. 

She’s also an INCREDIBLY hard worker. Whenever her manager calls and asks if she can cover a shift, she rarely says no. 

I also have to work on the days my girlfriend has off and I can’t switch them because we’re kennel training our dog right now. He’s not comfortable being left alone and locked in the kennel yet and we want someone to be home with him while we train him. 

So I basically get to see my girlfriend 2-3 hours a day. I want her to quit and find a job less intense. I want to be able to see her. I don’t want her to be a zombie when she gets home. I want to help her feel better and actually be home for once.",29Sep2020,1
866,"So I have been talking to this guy.. so far it’s amazing. We text again each other back if not 10 minutes sometimes an hour later because he works and I study.

He works weekdays.

Lately I notice his replies are long, he would reply after 4 hours to 8 hours sometimes he would reply the next day.

I’m trying so try not to think too much and keep my mind off it.

But he doesn’t text back around the times he normally would text and we would be texting.

He was free to text then and he worked too so he would text while working.

Today he texted me after he finished work which was at 4pm but ever since then he hasn’t texted back.

I don’t think too much about something unless I feel like the shift or the vibe is off.

It’s not like how he was when we first meet.

I don’t care about us not texting everyday.

It’s about how he takes hours and hours to reply.


He finishes work everyday at 4.pm And on weekends he doesn’t work so he’s free so why can’t he text back?",29Sep2020,1
867,"I’m a teacher and feel very mixed about it. I find the job really stressful and often come home exhausted and sometimes emotional. I feel like I don’t have time to clean my flat, run, read at the weekends or do anything for myself as a result of my job - it is life consuming and making me miserable. Every so often I have a brilliant day and find it immensely rewarding when this happens. I love working with children. Before covid and lockdown I decided I wanted to leave and had even told my headteacher, but after seeing the devastating effects of covid I decided that it would be silly to leave a stable career and signed a contract for another year. I was thankful for the “time off” (still planning and delivering lessons from home, but nowhere near as intense) during lockdown and then the summer holidays were blissful, but I have been back at work full time for 4 weeks now and feel that same anxiety and dread creeping back. I am hoping to buy a house with my husband early next year and the teachers salary will help with that, and I don’t know what other job I would do if I left teaching.

Do I...

a.) hand in my notice, leave at Christmas time and just hope that I can find something else during this pandemic to earn money in order to afford a house deposit

Or

b.) stick it out and leave at the end of the academic year, possibly at the detriment of my mental health and work life balance, BUT have that tasty money to potentially buy a house.

868,"I’m 26 years old and live a decent life. I have a good job which I enjoy and I’m in a long term relationship. However, something has recently turned my mood sour. 

I grew up in a town that was huge on high school athletics. Pretty much every boy was expected to play something or else they were treated as weird. I’ll be the first to admit I was a ‘jock’. I played 3 sports and was the ladies man throughout my teen years. 

Each year, my school would hold a massive pep rally a month into the school year. The pep rallys were an all day thing that would feature multiple events. The biggest event of them all was the athletic competition. Hundreds of students would compete in multiple activities and would be eliminated one by on

I had won the competition during my freshman, sophomore, and junior year. In the 50+ year history of the event, I was the only student who had ever won three straight competitions. I was fully prepared to win a fourth straight and complete the ‘dynasty’. The athletic director had told me the school would gift me a scholarship fund if I was able to win it all one more time. 

As usual, I breezed through the competition early and comfortably secured my spot in the final round yet again. This time my finals opponent would, for the first time, be a girl who just happened to be a freshman. She was tall and lanky and posed no real threat to me off the naked eye. The final round would consist of a basketball shootout, first to 10 wins. Basketball is my best sport and I felt as if they were almost gifting the championship to me. I took an early 5-0 lead but she ended up getting into a lucky hot streak and won 10-7. She defeated me and became the champion. I was humiliated and went into a massive depression. I know that I deserved to be the one holding that trophy and seeing her hoist it up killed me. The rest of my senior year remains a blur to me. To put even more salt in the wound, the same girl that defeated me would go on to win the competition in her 10th/11th/12th grade years. She got the dynasty that she denied me of. 

Last week, I came across the Instagram account of the girl who defeated me. I found out that she came out as gay and is now married to a beautiful woman who’s pregnant with their first child. Both of them have a ton of followers and she appears to have a high paying job that allows them to live a luxurious lifestyle. I thought I had it good but she’s really living an amazing life. 

I’m extremely jealous of this woman and I can’t help but to think what my life could have been if I had just beaten her in that high school competition 9 years ago. I know it’s silly because I’m 26 and she’s 23 now but I just can’t seem to let go of the past. I know it’s unhealthy to be this envious of a person, but I can’t help but think about it each night. I toss and turn thinking about how she’s better at life than me in pretty much everything and how it could have been prevented had I just won.",29Sep2020,1
869,Hey guys I am in desperate need of some advice. I’m fairly new to reddit and I am not quite sure how it works just yet but i need advice. As i feel like i can’t talk to anyone in my personal life because the judgement and toxic behavior. I live at home with my mother i am 22yrs old and a female. I use to have my own place but unfortunately had to move back in with my mom because of issues regarding my safety with the person i was living with before. I originally moved out of my moms house because it got so bad. She would wake up screaming for no reason at us and constantly say we need to get out of her house that she herself does not pay for. Of course while living there growing  up we helped out with groceries and all that stuff but she was never satisfied. It got to the point where I had to move out or i would have done something drastic to myself just to get away from her. It was that bad. My mother is a huge narcissist and is verbally very abusive towards her kids ( me and my siblings) for some reason. I thought she would have changed once i moved out and gave her space but i now feel like she’s worst now. She’s constantly belittling everyone and recently she has threatened me yet again with saying that i can get out of her house knowing i don’t have enough saved up to move out just yet on my own again. With corona going and me just getting a new job and so much stress from this toxic environment i don’t know what to do. Usually i am a strong person and can handle things but yet again i am drained and going back to the dark place where i thought i had escaped. I just need someone to talk to about this. I am at my breaking point and i don’t really think i can take it much longer. It has been going on for so long and has progressively gotten worse. 😢 someone please just talk to me.,29Sep2020,1
870,"My(20m) dad’s best friend calls him about once a week. He called last Saturday wanting my dad and myself to come visit this Saturday.

I don’t hate this guy or anything, but visiting over there is a tiring 4-6 hour affair. I’ll end up shooting guns or walking up 2 miles in the woods if I don’t have to talk about guns, hunting, fishing, or old people I don’t know for hours. I have been going through some bad anxiety recently, and being around people all day in a social situation drains me. Plus I feel like I have to put up a persona to act like I enjoy doing the things they do even though I can’t wait until we leave. I’ve told my dad that I don’t like doing these things, but I guess he assumes that if he keeps trying to get me to do them then I’ll enjoy it. I’ve been fishing about 4 times recently just to make my dad feel good. Nothing against my dad, but I don’t like wading up a river for 5 hours.

872,"Alright, so I’m 19, and downloaded tinder recently and I matched with someone and I thought we really connected. We exchanged snaps and texted for hours. We talked about so many things and I was glad that we clicked. Have you ever met someone and wondered “where have you been all my life?” Yeah, that’s how I felt. After a few days, I snap them and all is good, our convo was great. And then I asked if they’d like to hang out sometime and they said yes, and they’ll tell me the next day when they’ll be free. I said ok and said goodnight. The next day, no reply. No big deal, they’re probably just busy. The day after, no reply, and the day after that, still no reply. I was slightly annoyed, but whatever. After an entire week, I was telling my friends about this person I matched with and told them I was planning on hanging out my tinder match soon. They were super excited for me and I decided to snap my tinder match and they were super slow to reply, I was annoyed (again) but I forgot about it and focused my entire attention on hanging with my friends. I asked if they figured when they were free and they said they’ll tell me when they have the time to hangout with me. They used a smiley face so I thought we were good. After that convo, I decided that I’ll wait for them to hmu first next time, since the last 3 times I’ve been the one texting first. Well, fast forward a couple days later, I woke up and I check snapchat and I noticed it said ‘pending’ and had a gray arrow by their bitmoji. I was pretty upset and tbh I still am, but not as much. I thought they were a cool person and I was looking forward to spending an hour or two talking and laughing with them. The weird thing is, they didn’t unmatch me from tinder. So, what did I do?

Okay, I’m not entirely sure what im looking for- some advice mainly- and a place to vent because I don’t know many people who can understand my situation, and I get very emotional discussing it with my siblings since they are very against my father. Okay, some back story- my father has always been pretty shitty and in and out partially because he was in prison but also because he clearly made the decision to choose the drugs over us. I often thought of him and how guilty I felt so when I moved out when I was 20 i decided to contact him, we met up and talked and discussed forming a relationship however we stopped contact when I missed my grandmothers birthday for a midterm test- he began calling me and telling me to block him, that he wanted no contact with me since “we all treat his mother horribly” ( his mother is extremely abusive to him and his sister and we have never had a good relationship with her even before- reminder none of my siblings communicate with his side of family) So, after that I didn’t hear from him for about a year or two. Fast forward again I get a call from him saying he and my grandmother are stuck in a hotel and have no money and that they’re kicking them out all this shit which basically translates to “I spent all my moms Money and life insurance on drugs and now we’re homeless and drug addicts are looking for me” pretty much just asking for money no apology or I love yous. I tried to ask what happened, I know the truth but I wanted to know what he said. Eventually I find out he was BEATING my grandmother and using her money for meth and my grandma escaped him and now lives in a facility for senior citizens. OKAY NOW he has began showing ip at my families house where my step dad has to tell him he is no longer welcome here. I am having an extremely difficult time knowing he is homeless and alone and without resources. My heart aches- I don’t want the father daughter relationship I just I guess what to do something? my soul hurts so badly for addicts - they still deserve love and care... but I am worried if I find him he will keep coming back into my life and trying to bother my family. My siblings hate him and get kind of upset with me for feeling guilt but I cannot help it. I feel like I want to just keep tabs on him and find him once a month and give him a care package. If this is the life he wants I can’t help him there but I can atleast show that I still will be there even if he wasn’t I don’t know...

We had one class together at the end of the day and then we spent the rest of the afternoon together at our practices. Well I spent the summer if quarantine with her and she’s told me all about her recently diagnosed mental illnesses (anxiety, ocd, etc) and I had no issues listening to her    talk from 10 pm to 4 am and then 9am to 2pm. Well now schools opened up and I have all my classes except for band with her. And she talks non stop.  She recently got moved to my science class and my teacher is having me show her the ropes cuz she’s new and he said if she fails this  week I FAIL??? but other than that the science class is really chill and it’s really   talkative in there but we all get our work done in a timely manner. Well she came in and I told her to read a quick passage and answer four questions and finish the work yesterday that she didn’t do. She talked the entire time and that’s fine except she didn’t get past the first paragraph of the passage at all in TWO HOURS! Even though I consistently reminded her. It doesn’t help that after that class she told me I could have told her to stop talking in a nicer way so she could respond better and actually listen to me. Next class she’s still talking nonstop and I try to tell her to be quite in the nicest way possible about 30 to forty times but I’m very certain it didn’t even register in her brain what that meant. So 45 min into the next class I just tell her to shut up and she said because I didn’t say it nicely that she’d keep talking and then proceeded to speak for another 15 minutes. She got nothing done and it was so hard for me to drown her out. Two hours later I’m still annoyed and trying to ignore her when she comes to me and says “I HAVE AN IDEA” and she proceeded to say that I should tell her politely that I have to work and then told me “ WAIT!!! WHAT IF I DONT TALK AS MUCH DURING CLASS AND WORK MORE  BUT STILL TALK A LITTLE” in those exact words. At this point I felt like throwing her through a window but that’s not important. I then told her that this was EXACLTY what I had been saying for the past nine hours and then she was like “I KNOW... BUT WHAT IF I SPOKE LESS”. So I pointed back to her seat and told her to go. And then she went in for about ten minutes about how she already said sorry and asking why I’m still annoyed and mad at her. At this point I turned away and started talking to this group about a show. She then went over to her seat and started sobbing. Moving seats isn’t a option because the classrooms are crammed despite covid and if I ignore her she’ll start tapping me or get louder or closer. How do I politely tell her to shut up so that she responds and comprehends and listens, while also not telling her directly to shut up so her feelings stay intact. Honestly normally I’d keep telling her to shut up but before me she was really sheltered.

882,"Okay, I’m sure weight loss posts are pretty common here, but before writing this off as “burn more calories than you eat” hear me out. 

I have always been u happy with my weight. I would say I’m in this awkward thing where if you saw me you wouldn’t cal me fat but you also wouldn’t call me skinny. So I don’t have a lot I want to lose maybe 30-40 pounds. So in April I was ready to really take it seriously and do it. And I did. I got up early every morning to exercise and I counted my calories and only ate 1500 a day. I was really proud and it worked the first few weeks I dropped a couple pounds. But then it stopped. I kept doing the same but with no weight loss. 

I was discouraged but my amazing and supportive husband invited me to do his weight workout every morning because he says the more muscle you have the higher your metabolism so it could jump start the weight loss again. I gladly accepted the invite and it worked! The next few weeks I lost a few more pounds, but then it stopped again. 

Feeling so frustrated I googled healthy long lasting ways of losing weight and came upon intermittent fasting. It seemed simple enough so I gave it a try. And it worked! I lost a few more pounds, but now it has stopped. I plan on adding an hour of cardio after work now. I added it up and with the fasting I’m eating about 1000 calories a day. 

I’m honestly just really baffled as to why this isn’t working. I knew that losing weight was hard, but straightforward. Burn more calories than you eat. I even work on my feet. I’m relatively active. I’m only 24 so my metabolism should not be so horrible. I am 8 months in and have only lost 8 pounds and that fluctuates. I would appreciate any advice people have.

886,"I was at the mall and had my hands full of bags, my drink, my vest, and my purse. I threw a shirt over my shoulder while I looked at some jeans and ended up not liking the jeans. I forgot I had the shirt over my shoulder and left the store. It was the same colour as the sweater I’m wearing currently so I guess that’s why I didn’t notice. The security alarm went off but I didn’t even think of anything and the girl at the door didn’t notice either and said I was free to go. 

After I had gotten into my car and driven 2.5 hours home (that mall is 4 hours from my rural house), the shirt fell off my shoulder onto the centre armrest in my car. I absolutely broke down sobbing I’ve never stolen anything before in my life and the mall would be closed by the time I turned around to bring it back. 

I don’t know what to do. Should I drive back tomorrow and explain it is that suspicious? I’ve never stolen anything in my life before and this was an honest mistake. I just forgot it was there - it’s such a light shirt and I’m used to having burp cloths on my shoulder so I didn’t feel anything out of place. I have no idea whT to do.

890,"So, I was working away, enjoying my new laptop when my GF spilled about a half a cup of tea on the keyboard. Now, it wasn't a lot, and I sprang into action immediately.  I turned it off, flipped it upside down, unconnected the power cable, sprayed compressed air, and used an air dryer (low/cool settings) on it, to get any liquid out. I'm gonna wait 48 hours before I even think about turning it on again.

Now, that said, what would you do in my shoes? It might work fine when I turn it on again, but I have no idea on how to check if it's at the performance that it should be. Similarly I have no idea how to check if it's the life of certain parts have been cut in half.  Should I try and take it to a repair shop, or should I try and return it and get a new one?

893,"So I work for Company A which is a home security company. My team worked in a department that helped with general account maintenance, billing, and assisting with the creation of new customer accounts. We'll call this department ""department x"". We have a partnership with a big box store we'll call Company B that has kiosks set up to help bring in new customers. My team was a specialty team withing Department X that helped with scheduling consultation appointments for the customers introduced to us through Company B.


Earlier this month my team was involuntarily transferred from Department X to Company A's sales department. We'll call this ""Department Y."" We were given no choice as to whether or not we wanted to transfer to Department Y or just  go back to a normal team in Department X. We were told ""you guys are being transferred on Monday, good luck."" We also were not given any reason for the transfer. 

Well its been a few weeks now and everything is a complete mess. Department Y has given us almost 0 training for our new positions within their department and we still do not have access to all of the tools we need to do our jobs properly in Department Y. We also are not in the scheduling system correctly. Departments X and Y use two completely different scheduling systems. We do not have access to the scheduling system for Department Y so we have to take our supervisors word for when we are supposed to be scheduled to work. However, we are still in the scheduling system for Department X. This means when our Department Y schedule does not line up with Department X it causes problems. 

Last week I was initially on the schedule for Department X on a certain day before the transfer took place, but was told by Department Y that I was not to come in that day. So I did not work that day and was marked as No Call No Show for that day. On a different day I was scheduled to work, but at different times. I worked what I was told to work by Department Y but was then marked as having left early by Department X. Then just today I was marked as tardy by Department X because I was logged into the systems for Department Y instead.

I have emailed my new supervisors in department Y to try and get all of these issues resolved. My requests for additional training and full access to the department tools have been ignored entirely. The response I got to my scheduling concerns was essentially ""don't worry about it"" even though I am racking up attendance occurrences from department X. I can't even go to my previous manager for assistance because he no longer works for Department X, he took a higher position in a completely different department.

So now I'm here trying to do a job that I'm not trained for, that I don't have access to the tools to do properly and I've got attendance occurrences piling up from my original department. At this point I am completely terrified that I'm going to get fired by Department X because of attendance, and at the same time I'm afraid that I'm going to get fired from Department Y for doing a piss poor job in the new position. I'm not in a good enough spot financially that I can just walk away from this mess while I seek other employment, but I'm also not getting any responses from the applications I've been putting out.

I'm not sure if I'd be eligible for unemployment if I left this job or got fired from it (I'm in Utah if that helps any) so I have no idea what to do or what I can do. Does anyone have any suggestions?",29Sep2020,1
894,"okay, so im 15, and i need to know about something regarding a kid's privacy. so a long time ago i got the lock on my door taken away. it was understandable; i'd been spending too much time upstairs in my room with my phone. but that was a long time ago, when quarantine had first started. so i've asked multiple times for my door lock back (i've asked nicely) and my mom and dad have always said no. if i want to close my door for privacy i have to push a stool up to it to close the door in the doorframe. if the stool isnt pushed up against the door then the door is always open. my mom usually knocks, but doesnt wait for a response and just comes in as she pleases - which kinda defeats the purpose of knocking. my dad does the same thing, except he doesnt bother knocking and just pushes open the door (btw, my stool is a swivel stool so it kinda just gets pushed to the side when u push open the door). so here's the thing : i like closing my door. i dont know why. i just feel like i have more privacy. i feel comfortable and safe. but for some reason my parents hardly ever let me close my bedroom door. just now, actually, i had it closed and my mom came up here and said ""your dad isnt home (his office is right across from my bedroom; btw my bedroom is upstairs), im downstairs on the phone (shes talking to someone idk), and no one is coming in here and bothering you. the door can stay open."" she said that after she pushed it open without asking. which, btw, may i add that it was already open? there was a medium sized crack in the door so it would count as being open but apparently that wasnt good enough, because my mom came upstairs and pushed it all the way open. also! my bathroom doesnt have a lock either. if i want it to shut it i have to open one of my cabinet drawers to block the door from being pushed open. i have literally no privacy. also, my dad recently forced me to let him look through my laptop (at literally everything) and he also looked through my twitter dms (i have twitter connected to my laptop) and looked through my conversation with my partner (they're non binary) and thats how he found out we were dating. he also got mad at me for swearing in the dms. is this right?? sometimes i'll have breakdowns because i feel like i can never get a break and i feel like i have zero privacy. i can never talk to them about it calmly either because my parents will just both get pissed and start yelling at me. is this okay?? i deserve privacy, right??

edit : about an hour ago my mom made me take the password off of my phone and leave it on the counter downstairs - i didnt want to but she said ""i won't do anything!"" defensively when i told her i didnt want her to look through my phone - while i went up to my room to do hw on my laptop. i just want back downstairs real quick for a snack and found out that my mom had been looking through my phone at everything. i put my password back on it; i'll probably get in trouble for it later but im just upset and pissed rn.",29Sep2020,1

They were in bags and then transferred to a box from there I brought them home. All girls! 

2 twin TABBYS GINGER &amp; WENDY
1 CALICO ANDREA
1 GREY ROO
1 BLACK OPAL

I immediately noticed OPAL was the runt and had severe ringworm. I have been using apple cider vinegar as a home treatment. I asked several of my friends in different clinics how to treat it and they all had great ideas.

I fostered out OPAL under contract to one of the vets. (She's doing absolutely amazing!)

Andrea went with my coworker Andre. He brought her back today. She is covered in ringworm and I have her quarantined in the bathroom poor thing...

Roo was fostered out but passed away after 3 days.

The twins are making a steady recovery from the ringworm with the applecider vinegar. They love my cat Anastasia!

I've contacted several shelters for help on getting the ringworm cleared up each cat is $55 for spay then there's the other fees for vaccines...

I am asking for advice on how I can get them care, and possibly finding a safe home for them to go to. I wouldn't mind them going to a car farm or No Kill shelter. I just want them back to good health.

But, I need to take the photos of the pet with one of their products, which are extremely expensive. 

So I need to buy something from their store (they will give me a 50% lifetime discount), then they will link my pet’s account, where I will put their website in my bio. My followers will have 25% off and for anything bought via the link in my bio, I will get 15% of the money. The products can cost $10-20 but the shipment costs may be as high as $40 so I don’t want to risk it. 

While doing my research I stumbled upon a post on r/scam which said that akioka is basically a company which buys products from amazon then resells them with x4 the price and they target small accounts to make money from them, which makes a lot of sense as I was so confused why a 300k account would contact someone with only 50 followers.

902,"Ok here goes - read til the end please 

Im married 6 years now
My wife and I are living apart for 3 years now because of a huge fight which was my fault. While we were still together back in end 2016 a new lady (married still with husband) started work at the place i work and at this point my wife and i drifted apart. So the new lady and I started talking (2017) and ended up making out etc, not sex yet... She confessed love etc and things were okay. I knew i didnt love her and i knew she didnt love me. 3 months passed n my feelings started to grow for her at this point and started to believe her stories. so there was another guy (single) that was interested in her and he made a move and hooked up with her. They had sex. So he never told me nor did she which was fine cos myself and her were hiding our thing in any case. So anyways he decides to torture me with it by playing songs that makes me feel horrible and telling my friends things like ""your friend loves her but i fucked her""... etc and i ended up being depressed and it really really fucked my brains up for a few months and i became extremely paranoid and should always see them online on whatsapp at the same times etc. I couldnt sleep nor could i eat.
So after a few months he dumped her and she made a move on me. I always asked her what was going on with them and she always denied anything happened. So i decided to hook up with her with the intention of solely having sex with her for revenge.... so things happened pretty fast and we did it a few times. At this point he decides to get involved again but she was too attached to me but was being horrible at the same time. She used to kinda force us to hook up to prove she loves me etc . At this point the other dude gets fired. So the one day i knew she was gna see him the next day So i decided at this point that i will completely fuck her brains up and basically went the full way during sex and ejaculated inside her twice that night.
Remember now we're both married. At this point my wife and i had the huge fight and she left. So 2 weeks pass and the lady shows me her positive pregnancy test and says its not mine. So i agreed. We still hooked up while she was pregnant though for the next 3 months. Her baby was born in 2018 and looks exactly like the other colleague dude she was hooking up with. Does not look like me or her husband at all. (The guy has distinct features). At this point we just moved on. She got back to work and i asked her if the kid is mine and she says no. So we just carried on with life as normal and never hooked up again.. now for the second part.....

In September 2018 another new girl started work at my company. This is the most beautiful woman ( married to the most gorgeous man) i saw in my entire life. I really cant describe her beauty . At this point i am almost 32 years old and the new girl is 22. I fell head over heels immediately. We hardly spoke and she never showed interest in me at all. She used to message me occasionally for a lift to work etc and for songs and fashion advice etc but i never thought anything of it. So at the end of last year ( from October until December 2019) she started messaging me daily throughout the day . Only innocent chats. The night of our closing party for December she stops messaging. I was a little sad but realised she must have felt guilty and decided to stop. I never questioned her. In March of this year(2020) she decides to ask me for a lift almost daily which i was more than happy to do as i secretly had a huge crush on her. She starts messaging daily and every chance she gets. So we get to May and heres where things get hot. She starts calling and chatting alot and one night decides to ask me if i have a crush on her and i tried to avoid the convo but she kept persisting. I finally admit and she says she always knew that i had a crush on her and she has a thing for me and she wants to ""test the water"" with me, which basically means have fun on the side while living a normal life. We started off very slow but but june we almost had sex. In July we had sex for the first time then again in August and again on September 2. The sex was bland and not good but at this point this woman is all i think about and dont even care about the sex. So there were days during these months were she just didnt feel me and days when i didnt feel her but we always spoke daily and never be weird towards each other. So come to the creepy part of the story. Few days into September she stops chatting as much and our convos are very different as if we are just colleagues. Which she hasnt done ever.
Sometimes we dont talk at all. She becomes very evasive and gets spooked for absolutely no reason while on her phone. Shes always hiding her phone and messages. So this week the guy that was in the first half of the story decided to call me regarding some work that we do with them at his new company. And he takes my number to send me messages. He doesnt normally speak to me but i felt it odd. Now this is were the paranoia kicks in and where i need your help. I immediately check her last seen time and his last seen and its always around the same time and also they both go online together and offline together. (He does not work with us but does communicate with her over the work tele regarding invoices etc) so now I became very paranoid and i was checking it constantly. Its only been on week. And i virtually starting breaking down as i keep seeing them online together and i feel like he came between me and the first girl and he is doing it again. I even asked to use her phone and dialled his number from it but no contact record came up. I then asked her straight out if she is talking to him and she says no. But how do i constantly see them online together and when they are offline its at the same times. The moment she goes offline after leaving work he goes offline and only comes on when she goes home and goes back online. I told her yesterday that its not working out for us and she agreed in an attempt to get away from her cos for the last 2 weeks i wanted to work things out with my wife which i decided to talk to my wife about and she wants it too. But the paranoia of this guy doing this the second time is affecting me. I also told her after about getting back with my wife at which point she lost it on the phone with me but and accused me of being a liar and using her for sex.( Which you may decide on. ) i felt weak and had to leave work early yesterday because i haven't slept in 2 days and was planning how i could catch her out. ( for reasons which i dont understand). I know i was actually having a breakdown possibly and needed to leave work. (This happened with the previous lady also) i know i cant be with this girl because things are just freaking weird and off now and i really dont want to. Its only the paranoia part which is affecting me cos im constantly seeing them online at the same times and off at the same times. 
Nows is the part where you guys hate me if you didnt start already
I have a 7 year old daughter with my wife and she is the most beautiful soul ever. She is always happy and always loving. 
I know inside that i can't love another woman as much as i love my wife (6but i still cheated???)
I never saw myself as a cheater but my wife constantly rejected me because of bad behaviour and not showing her the love that she deserves. So instead of being a good man i decided it was easier to find attention in other women.
I was selfish about it and felt guilty at first but them became used to it and the guilt stopped affecting me. 
I know im being paranoid and im having trouble sleeping and constantly having cold sweats and waking up in a shock at night and keep pacing around.

They then throw this back at me and say I should have done this anyway.

I also bought food shopping and refused to let them pay me for it, I funded whole, multiple nights out at the pub so they didn't have to pay for themselves, the last time i did it I spent more money on them than they're asking for the bills.

Might be worth mentioning that ex has me blocked and in order to communicate with them I have to go through a mutual friend.

The love becomes unhealthy in that I crave attention from her and am an extremely jealous person and she is the only reason I want to live, she is the only person I feel anything for and I only feel about her like this, she could make me feel worthless or like a prince in a matter of seconds and I want to detach and be less clingy whilst still being able to like her and have a relationship type thing with her.

911,"I’ll appreciate all advice in general around this topic (all my friends have at least a few major issues that they don’t take seriously) but one case I need help with in particular is eating disorders.

One of my best friends wants to be skinnier so he straight up starves himself and he feels like a terrible person whenever he actually does eat. He jokes about it all the time, which I guess is good for coping with it but I kinda wish he took his own health seriously. I basically just want to convince him to lose weight more healthily but he isn’t going to listen to me since he’s actually seeing results from undereating. Plus I guess it’s none of my business, but I worry about him (he often feels faint, sometimes struggles to concentrate, is also a frequent drinker and party goer which is fine but having better health would definitely make him safer). A big issue with him is that he just doesn’t care about bringing harm to himself.

Do I just tell him to be serious about it and just kinda...not starve himself?

Or should I be more light-hearted about it? Maybe joke with him too but subtly encourage better health??

Should I congratulate him when he’s lost weight even thought I know it’s from starving himself? Will that encourage him or make him feel like he doesn’t need to do it anymore?

Or should I just deadass completely ignore it since it’s nothing to do with me??? Maybe he’ll get worse if he gets more attention for it?? 

Does offering advice actually help or is it annoying to them?

917,"Im just gonna be concise with this. Im a 13 yr old female in Eastern States. I was born in a very prosperous background. I excel at school, and my instrument(violin), and have several other abilities as well. I have friends at school, and my classmates admire me.(Not bragging) My mom is mostly nice. Ik its pretty illogical for me to be unhappy at this point, but I have an ed, and when my mom found out, she began to force-feed me excessive amounts. She force-fed me, and skinny-shamed me, becoming obsessed with my eating habits, weights, etc. and its rlly stressful. Sometimes, she emotionally abuses me and acts as if she knows everything even though she knows nothing(i think she's a bit narciccistic).Im starting to think whether I should run away or not Ik that if I just bear through this, I would become a succesful person once I grow up instead of taking the harder road by runnning away. I think I sound pretty pathetic when 99% of the people who ran away had no choice but this while I was given everything, but is complaining.

This is the first message he sent me. He is not American, mind you. For future reference, what should I do if someone randomly DMs me something similar? Should I engage and try to educate or ignore if they've gone down the QAnon or racist rabbit hole? 

""#blm are a communist organization who want to destroy capitalsm to take control of it themselves. I don't support hooligans and thugs who want to make things worse rather than better. No sense going around making simple peoples lives hell just to make a point. The military is the only answer to that problem, that's what they're there for. To maintain order. The people at the head of this organization are being as oppressive as any other group, people are being fired if they don't say #blm and forced to wear the badge. It's bullshit. White people are shot by cops all the time in America... but when it happens to black person we parade around. Maybe a good idea would be to stop commiting crimes? Or help change ones that are unjust. The #blm movement is offensive to every black person who has done something with their lives. They act as evidence that's its not the system that's the problem, it's the individual. I think we are slowly helping people come out of poverty and create for them na opportunity, #blm is a threat to everything we have been working for.""

Key points I took from this:

He thinks people fighting for civil rights are ""hooligans and thugs who want to make things worse rather than better.""

The only answer to the current unrest where people are demanding civil rights is ""The military is the only answer to that problem, that's what they're there for""

""White people are shot by cops all the time in America... but when it happens to black person we parade around."" He thinks black people are not killed by police more than white people?

He thinks black people deserve the treatment they are receiving ""Maybe a good idea would be to stop commiting crimes?""

He thinks white people are trying to help black people and that ""we are slowly helping people come out of poverty and create for them an opportunity, **#blm** is a threat to everything we have been working for.""",29Sep2020,1
920,"Ok this is a weird one but I don't know how to go about it. I'm going to sound ridiculous but basically I just moved into my own place (I'm loving it lol) and before covid I used to do pole fitness. Well due to covid, our lessons are shorter and more expensive due to cleaning time and reduced class numbers etc so I decided to get my own pole for home so I can stay fit and do my hobby without it costing me so much. 

The problem is the only place I had enough room for it is right behind my desk and I now work from home. I have a setup with multiple monitors as I'm a graphic designer so I cant just move them and I have no other place that my desk or pole could go.

So when I take video calls (never with clients, I only ever have calls with my boss and colleagues) the pole would be visible in the background. I just thought I would turn the screen but now I'm worrying that I will sometimes forget to move the monitor each time for a call. 

I dont want people to think I'm a stripper (not that there's anything wrong with them) as I only use my pole for fitness. What would you do...? Just have it in the background and see if someone says anything or what... I don't know what to do.

She drives with her driving instructor in a Toyota corolla that is much longer than her Chevy sonic which is quite small.

The driving test only allows her to turn the wheel when her side mirros match with the person's tail light and then she can turn it the opposite direction, turning any earlier is deemed as incorrect.

The only problem is that she constantly has company over without my notice, and because I’m a lot younger than her I feel like I have no power in saying anything. I told her it’s odd for her to have him over almost every night and she told me that’s normal for her age. I was under the impression that it was normal when living alone, but not with a roommate, especially one who is a minor.

We both agreed to live with eachother under specific conditions before the lease was signed and her mother even told me that if I wanted to
bring anyone to the apartment she would have to meet them first. I assumed it would be the same for her but the very first night we moved in her boyfriend stayed the night.

She’s been refining her resume and CV and using services like Indeed to job search; so far she’s only received one job offer and it only offered to pay a third of what she used to earn and would not cover many expenses. We’ve thought about canceling services that aren’t important for us (like Netflix) but at this rate we’re very likely to lose our house anyway. I’ve offered to cover more household bills (since I am living with them rent free), but they’ve been trying to minimize it on me and have only had me pay for car insurance and expenses, student loans, and a quarter of the mortgage; I’ll keep asking to cover for more and help my mom with her resume and CV. With the insurance packages my parents have, it would be cheaper for me to stay under their insurance plans until next year (when I turn 25).

From what I’ve learned about this job market (even pre COVID), though, my mom would be highly unemployable: she’s near the age of retirement (mid 50s), has not worked with any other companies in 30 years, and she doesn’t have a bachelor’s degree. She’s been slowly sinking back into depression; she has been seeing a psychiatrist and psychologist this whole time, but she has to restrict her going out (aside from groceries and certain volunteering opportunities) because she has preexisting health conditions that could worsen her health should she contract COVID or the flu.

So, lately, I’ve been increasingly getting more and more argumentative and irritable with anyone who doesn’t agree with me, specifically those on the right and those who’re planning on voting for Trump. 

For awhile, I was confident that I was centrist or, at least, center-left. I used to disagree, yet also understand, *why* people like Trump were first voted in. Whenever I’d vote, I tried to see what the candidates’ histories were like and tried to completely ignore their party affiliation.

 Now, every time I watch a Trump ad, I don’t just feel slightly annoyed, I actually get a little angry and aggressive at the people in said ads who say “Oh, well I’d be afraid if Biden wins”. I’m even starting to hate my family a little, as they’ve started to bitch and moan about people on welfare or the BLM movement. I’ve started to be a sheer Biden supporter and blindly think that he’ll fix all of our problems not because of his qualities, but because he’s blue and, therefore, on my side.

I guess my question is if I was to drop out of college and start working at McDonald's full time or like atleast 3-4 shifts a week, would I then just be completely screwed if I wanted a different kind of job or just something that pays better?

945,"This died in r/relationship_advice so I thought I'd try somewhere more general.

TLDR: Years ago I had alcohol/substance issues (not an excuse but relevant. I'm now sober) and ended up being sexually inappropriate with 3+ friends of mine over the course of years. The full extent of the problem wasn't clear to me until relatively recently and I'm not sure if/how I can help the people I've hurt. It's a little complicated so if you've got the time, please read the full thing. All names changed. 

Between 2012 and 2017 (my age 24-29) I was engaged in a pattern of behaviour which resulted in me being sexually inappropriate with a number of female friends of mine. To the best of my knowledge that number is 3, however I’m told that it could be higher. Each of the three incidents that I’m aware of only became known to me after the fact, as I was unconscious and highly intoxicated for each of them. In all three cases that I know about (with some minor variations), I was asleep and intoxicated in the same bed as a friend of mine, and in my sleep, I touched her inappropriately. I am aware of how the 'I was asleep' excuse sounds. It is, however, the truth.

In my biggest friend group, parties with lots of drugs and drink were (and somewhat remain) the norm. It's also been somewhat normalised that as parties wind down, sleeping arrangements can get a little hodge-podge. Here is as detailed an account of each incident as I can manage:

\--------

Incident 1 (2012): It’s early morning, and I’m done at the party. I’ve had an awful lot to drink, and most likely some molly, possibly some other stuff. I know my girlfriend Emma is in one of the beds upstairs so I go looking for her. I find her in a bed having crashed with David and Lucy (a couple). I take a look at the already cramped situation and rather than look for some place else, I decide to just squeeze in on the end, next to Emma, and fall asleep. I wake up spooning someone. As I come to, I realise I’m not spooning Emma, but Lucy. I mutter ‘wrong person’ (or maybe just think it, I’m not sure), and look around to see Emma has presumably got too hot and bothered in the bed and moved to the floor. I go to join her, cringing at myself for spooning the wrong person.

That is my full memory, nothing more, nothing less, of incident 1. For years this was filed in my brain under ‘throwratowel cringe 2012’. It remained completely dormant (completely dead, in my mind) and David, Lucy and I were all totally cordial right up until 2018. More on this later.

\--------

Incident 2 (\~2014): This one’s actually with a different friend group, but with a similar dynamic. By now, I’ve split with Emma, but I’m still good friends with her and everyone else in the main group. Me and my friends from college, Paul and Rachel, are hanging out at Rachel’s place. We get drunk, and all fall asleep in the same room. Paul in one bed, me and Rachel in hers. In the night I wake up to Rachel trying to kiss me. That's not what I want, so I ask her to stop, she does, and we fall back to sleep. The next day, we’re at college, and Rachel is being very sheepish and avoidant around me. I assume she’s just remembering the fact that she tried to kiss me. I’m not one to try to embarrass anyone though, so I tried to put her at ease by just being normal around her, making regular jokes etc. I get a text from her later telling me we need to talk. We talk on the phone that evening, and she asks me if I remember last night. I say yeah, but it’s ok, don’t worry about it. She says she thinks maybe I don’t remember everything. She tells me that in the middle of the night she woke up and my hand was down the front of her underwear. Hearing this, I feel like I’ve been hit over the head. I have literally zero recollection of this happening. I instantly believe it, however, because of how Emma and I used to sleep together. We’d been together for 2 ½ years, and I had only recently broken up with her, and the way we used to sleep together was spooning, with my hand either on her breast or on her privates. It was non-sexual, non-invasive, and completely normalised between us. I don’t know how it started but it just became one of those comfort habits you develop as a couple. As in, if my hand was not there, she’d put it there, and that’s how we slept. So the idea that my hand ended up there when I was asleep next to Rachel, while beyond horrifying to me, was completely believable. I was instantly apologetic, and did my best to explain to her that there’s no way I’d ever have done that intentionally, and that I couldn’t be more sorry about it. She was very understanding and forgave me. Some time later we actually ended up dating, split up, and were friends for a good few years. Only recently have we fallen out of contact. That’s incident 2.

Incident 3 (2017):

Same friend group as in incident 1. Around this time, most of those guys had moved to a different city, and I’d been gradually seeing far less of them in person. This incident takes place during a local festival in my city / their old city. We’d been out for a rager with lots of drink and drugs, and we eventually went back to Donna’s place for the afterparty. More drink and drugs. Again, there’s limited bedspace and it gets decided that I’ll be sleeping in the same bed as Claire. Claire goes to bed, and at some point I go to join. I remember sleeping kind of fitfully. Some days later a memory pops into my head of having a weird, possibly semi-sexual encounter with someone recently, but the memory is so hazy that it feels more like the recollection of a dream than of something that actually happened, so I forget about it. It does not even occur to me that I could have done something untoward with Claire. This is my full memory of the night of incident 3. More on this shortly.

\--------

In other news, in September 2017, for unrelated reasons, I decided to get sober. I kicked booze completely, and am still dry today. As for drugs, I’ve had molly once since then (xmas ‘17). I’ve also smoked weed a few times (always either by myself or just with my current gf Fiona, and have even kicked that as of earlier this year) and have taken psychedelics a couple of times too (again, either alone or just with my gf). I plan on maybe continuing to take psychedelics for the purpose of dealing with depression and anxiety; rarely if ever in ‘macro’ doses, and never at parties. The strongest I’ll have at a party now is peppermint tea, and it’s been that way since xmas ‘17. I mention this because I feel like my relationship with substances is totally relevant here. These incidents aren’t why I got sober, but they are a massive factor in why I stay sober.

\-------

Spring 2018. Everyone’s planning a trip to a theme park. One day however, I notice that David (Lucy’s bf from incident 1) has removed me from the group chat and unfriended me on fb. That’s weird, I think, so I drop him a message asking what gives. He doesn’t respond, but re-adds me on messenger (but not fb), and re-adds me to the group chat. I’m scratching my head as to what’s happened, and having not received a reply from him, I figure I’ll message Lucy to ask what’s up with him. No response. At this point I’m starting to get really concerned, so I message our friend Sam. He says that he noticed David removing me from the group and, also thinking it was weird, had privately asked David about it but David said to just forget it, and had even got quite abrupt with Sam. So Sam and I put some thought into what I could have done to piss David off. I wrack my brains but come up blank. Some days pass. I get a call from Sam. He says that I really need to think about what I might have done, because it’s looking like it’s serious. Knowing David better than I do, Sam suggests that maybe I shouldn’t be focusing on David but on Lucy. He asks me if there’s anything I’ve done, maybe even from a long time ago, that might have upset Lucy. The memory of incident 1 does enter my mind, but my first response there is to think ‘nah, no way is he mad at me about some goof with his girlfriend from 6 years ago’, so I don’t say anything about it right away. (Plus, at this point I’m really hoping that it’s not that because it’ll embarrass me to talk about it. Bear in mind, I haven’t yet begun to think of that incident as anything more than a clumsy, hungover blunder). After some more talk and a real struggle to think of anything that could even remotely have upset Lucy, I eventually tell Sam that well, ok, so there was this one time in 2012, but surely that can’t be it. We both hmm about it and don’t necessarily feel like we’re any closer to the heart of the issue yet.

A couple of months later, maybe a week or so after we’ve all been on a trip to Amsterdam, and I’m talking with Sam in a bar. We get onto the subject of Lucy and David and he drops a bombshell on me. He’s found out that yes, it is the time from 2012 that’s the problem, but that’s not the only problem. It turns out that in Summer ‘17, I had done something with Claire while we were asleep in the same bed. Apparently that night I had touched her and essentially dry-humped her until she had to shove me off and tell me to get lost. A horrific sinking feeling, and no memory of it having happened. In that moment a piece fell into place for me; what if what had happened with Rachel had also happened with Lucy? I had been living my whole life with incidents 1 &amp; 2 filed in completely different places in my mind, but now that it turned out that incident 1 was in fact a big problem, I began to see it differently. Rather than just me spooning Lucy, what if I’d done something even worse in my sleep and touched her like I’d done with Rachel?

It’s easy to make sense of the timing of Lucy and David’s actions here. After the first incident in 2012, it seems Lucy decided to just ‘let it go’. (As I’ve said, we’d been at several parties and been totally cool around each other right up to 2018.) When she found out (before I did) about the incident with Claire, however, Lucy re-evaluated her experience, probably even thinking of my actions as predatory, and so decided at that point to take small action by unfriending and blocking me. Meanwhile I was trying to get a response from David about what was up (I’d sent a total of about 5 messages privately to the both of them over the space of a few weeks after the group chat incident). I eventually got worried that I was pestering David (I wasn’t blocked on his whatsapp) and had said to him that if he didn’t want anything more to be said on the matter that he should just not respond. I got left on read, and so took the message as clear; leave Lucy and David alone.

Back to Claire, who I apologised profusely to. If anything she expressed more concern for me than anything else, and she accepted my apology and forgave me. We’ve always been good and we still are today.

Every few months now I’ll drop David a message. Over 2 years I think I’ve sent 4 messages to him, always taking a gentle approach and trying to make it clear that I only want to do the right thing. I’d message Lucy directly but I don’t have a contact for her. Plus I don't know how bad the incident with her was, or if it's triggering for her. In my messages to David, I’ve said that I know what the problem is, and that I don’t want to convince them of anything, I just want to listen to how Lucy feels. I’ve said that I’m sorry, and that I’m not going to do or say anything that either of them are uncomfortable with. I’ve tried to make it clear that the ball is in their court, and that I am there to talk under whatever circumstances they’re most comfortable with.

Ok so that’s the 3 ‘known’ incidents pretty much covered, but you’ll remember at the beginning of the post I mentioned that that number could be higher. So Sam, who is very close with David, occasionally brings this subject up with him, only to be quickly shut down. David is very protective of Lucy, and has been tight-lipped with Sam on this subject. But a couple of months ago he did mention something which heavily implies that there is another person I have been inappropriate with. So I went down my fb friends list and came up with 3 names that I might have slept in the same bed as over the years. I contacted them all individually and asked them (without breaching anyone else's privacy) if I’d ever been inappropriate with them, and they all said no, and were surprised that I’d have to ask that question. At this moment I’m at square one as to who this potential 4th person is, and I’m not sure where to go from here. I'd be interested to hear your thoughts and advice on how to approach this.

I should say that throughout this, Sam has been an incredible friend to me, and I really feel for his situation, because his friendship with me is beginning to cause strain on his friendship with David. At no point have I asked him to do any asking around, he just sees the difficulty of the situation and wants what’s best for the group. Recently, however, him and David have had some conflict over this situation, with David expressing anger at Sam that he could still be friends with me. What’s more, yesterday, Sam told me that recently David had said that nothing I say can be trusted, and that I am a liar. That's incredibly hard to hear. We were walking as Sam told me this and I had to stop in my tracks to take a moment. I'm honestly devastated that a friend of mine could think that about me. Not just because I know it’s not true (I have no idea what it is I’m meant to have lied about), but also because I genuinely care about Lucy and David, and just want to help. I do understand though. I don’t want to come across as oblivious to why David would feel negatively towards me. Of course he does. But to hear that it’s to quite that degree hurts deeply. I figured the reason I hadn't been contacted was that they just didn't want to, or maybe because it was difficult for Lucy, not that they thought I was a liar and not to be trusted. My ability to deal with all this has taken a big hit since hearing that.

Mine and Sam’s conversation yesterday ended with me pretty much breaking down on him, because the idea of him losing his friendship with David because of me isn’t something I think I’d be able to deal with, so I told him that he shouldn’t feel like he needs to speak up for me with David.

What can I do? I’ve spoken with Claire (she knows about what happened with Lucy), and she says I need to find a way to just move on from it. That's going to be hard, though. For one thing, all this occupies so much of my thoughts every day that I've no idea how I can go about 'moving on'. I feel like if there's one person who can help this situation for Lucy, it's me.

But I do think that I should just not message David any more. I feel like he's now viewing all my actions as the actions of some kind of manipulator, and so there wouldn't be anything I can say to him that would help. But if he’s saying I can’t be trusted to Sam then maybe he’s saying it to other friends of mine? I can’t just strike this conversation up with just anyone however, because I'm not going to breach anyone's privacy.

Another thing I want to be totally clear on is that I am not looking for, nor have I ever asked anyone for forgiveness. I have nothing that I want to convince anyone of. Most of all I just want to hear Lucy’s side of things and to do what’s right by the people I care most about. Despite having made some mistakes, I am ultimately just someone who wants to help and can't bear the idea that I've hurt anyone, particularly my friends, all of whom I love to bits. I’d really appreciate any insights or advice you might have on what the right way to proceed is here. I've tried to make this as easy to follow as possible but if you need me to clarify any timeline details just ask. Thanks again.",29Sep2020,1

950,"Hey guys! I started a new job a week after lockdowns in my state happened in March. I interviewed in person but that’s it. 
Basic info in case this helps: I’m a male in my mid 30’s. I work at a university but not as a professor. 

I would love any advice about the following;::

I work as a very large and known university in the US. I started in March and have felt something kind off since about a month in. I feel insanely disconnected from my “team”. I feel more like an outside vendor who has to sit in on staff meetings. 

I’m unsure what to do cause I don’t mind most of the actual work, but do not even closely get along with my co workers. I know almost nothing about them after 6 months and they know very little about me. We all are mostly working from home but everyone is local. I often am excluded from most things - like group discussions. One time after me and others worked on a huge project that was successful my boss drove to everyone’s house to deliver celebratory champagne to all... except... me. I’ve also asked for help in certain areas and am told to google it (this was for me getting security clearance to go into certain buildings to do my job). 

This might sound insignificant to you, but to me it’s important, for the most part i have the opposite sense of humor as my team. It’s bizarre cause I’ve never been in this situation. I’ve always gotten along with people and humor has always been a big part of that. 

Anyway - really unsure what to do here. I took a pay cut to come work for a public university so having it be a wet blanket isn’t ideal. Any advice??",29Sep2020,1
951,"(Im on a phone, so sorry for the format and grammar)
So, ive never been a super jealous person to much of anything or anyone. 
To start of, by brother is 16, while in 13. Making me the youngest out of 3 (we have an older brother who is 22)

Everything has always come easy to my brother, drawing, cooking, video games, ect. When i was younger and discovered my love for drawing, my parents were so happy their daughter was creative. But my brother showed my parents something he drew and our parents started to think it wasnt so special, so i grew hatred towards it. I grew a love for cooking, and he started to aswell, so I stopped cooking as often. I'd show my parents things i did and was proud of and my brother would come along and show them something better. My parents push harder standards on me because I am a grade above in certain subjects at my school. Me getting a C in a class gets me grounded and not being able to do stuff for a week. While with my brother, its just a slap on the wrist and a ""just get your grade up"" and he gets to go on his marry way. Im expected to keep my room clean, or else i cant have friends over but if his room is messy, hes allowed to have friends over.  
He got a job offer today to go and be an assistant mechanic which is his dream job, but cant figure out what i want to do, because my parents want me to go and be a veterinarian and make good money or go be an actress and buy them a house apon a hill. But i dont know what i want to do yet, but they keep pushing me to choose. Because the earlier i choose, the earlier i can start pursuing it. And i just dont know what to do anymore.
Hes never suffered from a mental illness but i do and when i tell him im sad he says i have nothing to be sad about.

I just dont know what to do anymore. Ive grown hatred towards the things ive once loved because my brother is 100 times better at them. What should i do.",29Sep2020,1

954,"This guy from my school walked out in front of me while I was biking home, and took out my jacket from the basket. He ran a couple of meters away from me, but stopped when my phone fell out. He told me that nothing happened to it, and ran a little further away, probably expecting me to run after him. All I did was walk over and pick up my phone(I know they'll stop when they get bored). I put it back in my basket and he gave me my jacket back. I went back up on my bike and drove away, until I heard him behind me. Honestly it scared me so much. I had to stop when I was at my apartment complex, and he was just sanding there, next to me. I could feel that I was gonna cry, so I walked another way into the building, but before I could get on my way, I saw them, **him and his friend**. I live in the same apartment complex as his friend and now my heart is beating. I can't let them see me with a crying face like this, so I just ran all the way down again. I just started walking, even though I had no where to go, and ended up trying to call my sister, so she can come help me get home without being scared. But then I see a black line in the side off my phone and my just drops. It's broken. I can't even emergency call her. I start full-on crying, and realize that I have to go home. So carefully walk through the apartment complex without seeing them, and then I get home. 

My mom is talking loudly on the phone when I get home, so I just quietly walk to my sisters room and knock. She comes out after a while and hugs me. My mom hangs up the phone and walks down the stairs to see me crying my eyes out. She takes me into the living room and sits down with me on the couch to comfort me. After a while of struggling to breathe and speak I finally calm down enough to tell her what happened. But I don't tell her who did it.

Fast forward to before started writing this, she tells me that if I don't tell her who did it, she's gonna go to my school and make a massive scene until she finds out who did it. But, I honesty feel like I overreacted and that I was kind of in the wrong. So for me it's either ""I can never look him in the eyes again"" or ""I can never look anyone in the eyes again"", and I can't handle it. 

Do I tell her who did it and try to resole it peacefully, though I kinda think I overreacted, or do I NOT tell her, and never dare to go back to school? Or do you guys thin I should do something else?",29Sep2020,1
955,"My boyfriend is gone for 3 months on work. We have been dating for a few months and are strictly LD, met in a community and plan to meet when he's back. One of my friends, also from the community, has been hanging out with me more and more. I'm an avid gamer and spend most of my time gaming. We play games most of the day ( used to with my bf ) and I sometimes play with other friends. Recently, he's started wanting to watch lots of movies and shows, which was fine at first, I do that with friends sometimes and it's nice, however it's nearly daily that he's asking now. He seems upset when we don't spend all day together and I'm starting to get uncomfortable. He also makes a lot of sexual jokes. Some of those include jokes about swallowing ( at one point he kept making the joke and it got to the point where I felt like he was basically asking me if I do ), I met some cool dudes on COD and tried to join them on discord, he seemed upset and asked for just us to play still so I left, he said he wished he could find a girlfriend like me. This guy was one of my bfs best friends and I'm starting to get uncomfortable being around him. Recently I've been kind of avoiding him, making excuses. I don't want to ghost him but I also don't want to really talk to him anymore. ( Also I'm not sure if this is a red flag but he will ask if I wanna watch something, I'll say eh or not really, he asks what I want to do, I say idk, he says ok then we will watch something ). It's stressing me out more and more. One friend says she's noticed his jokes around other people and it seems a little over the line ( I thought it was okay because they're more intense one on one ), one says I should just talk to him ( I'm very very nonconfrontational and anxious. I really want to avoid this if possible. This friend offered to talk to him for me ), and one says I just read too much into everything and he's acting like a friend. I really really just want it to stop and honestly I don't want to spend much one on one time with him anymore. It's causing me some stress and I'm scared my boyfriend will accuse me of cheating.

958,"Tl;Dr My brother refuses to clean even his own messes which are so gross I can hardly stomach it. Blames me when I confront him about it. Telling mom hasn't helped. He's about to turn 16. 

He's pretty lax about cleaning.. Or rather, he just doesn't. When he moved down to my floor of the house, we agreed that I'd clean one weekend, then he'd clean the next since I've got full days at work those weeks. However, in the beginning, I took his weekends as well due to certain events happening in the home which meant a lot of guests and he couldn't do it well yet. Once I stopped doing that, we again agreed to the week switcheroo.

It's been five months. He has MAYBE poorly vaccumed four times, and even that's being generous. There are two times I remember. He hasn't cleaned even once.

This summer I was left to clean every week again.. Now after myself and three other guys, none who even once took the initiative to some house chores even though they were staying with us for six weeks. 

Now again, it's worse, as the past two months, my brother is just plain gross. He'll leave the sink full of stubble. He absolutely refuses to use the toilet brush after leaving shit in the darn bowl, and won't even bother to pick up the shower head from the bottom after shaving his pubes. Yes, it'll just lay in there getting marinated in pubic hair and used soap. 

Don't even get me started on our shared lounge. Every time he uses it, he leaves it full of dirty dishes, trash, his spare duvet and messed up blankets. He won't clean up his mess for days, sometimes weeks. Just a week ago, he'd broken a glass, which naturally I stepped hard on. It wasn't anything serious, but it easily could've been. All because of a mess he couldn't be bothered to take care of even days after he'd broken the damn thing. 

I've confronted him about it several times. He does a 180 and tries to blame me, claiming I'm making a mess too. Thing is, I VERY rarely use the lounge, I never leave a mess in the bathroom, and I certainly don't leave it for him to live with. He tries to lie his way out of it, and involving our mom hasn't helped one bit. 

So what do I do? He's about to turn 16, and I'm sick of him ignoring his part. I don't care what he does to his own room, that's HIS space, but this can't go on in the common areas.",29Sep2020,1

My brother just tested positive for COVID and they have a whole farm to run and a 5 year old son to care for. They just don’t have time to care for this dog or train her and she’s getting too big to be untrained. 

So what I need advice with is how to talk to them about getting rid of her. I kept telling them for months to train her and offered to do it myself but they kept pushing it off and pushing it off. So I don’t want to come off as a bitch or that I know more than them since my dog is well behaved and trained. What’s a good way to bring this up to them without causing tension?

Also they are not abusing her aside from her being left all alone. She’s fed and has shelter and water but she needs training and interaction",29Sep2020,1

Bf got me a jacket a size too large and the store must be out of smalls so I cannot return it. I dont want to return it for store credit because I think that would really hurt his feelings.

964,"I quit my job in March because my manager sexually assaulted me after getting me drunk after my shift (he broke many laws). I quit the very next day. The owners also weren’t paying me, but I wrote to them after I quit and they eventually paid me everything owed plus penalties. I live in California and the unemployment page says that they’d call to discuss eligibility. I don’t want to tell them about the assault because I don’t want to escalate the situation. Is there a way I can still be eligible? Any advice? Thanks!",29Sep2020,1
965,"I have been offered a job doing, essentially, what I already do for a slight improvement in pay (about a 10% boost in takehome pay) and substantially better benefits. I would also be leaving behind certain key aspects of my current position that aren't related to my primary job title and bring me a lot of stress, and probably overall have a much lighter and more enjoyable workload. On paper, this seems like an obvious step up.

However, I would be moving from a very large, well funded lab with a lot of equipment to a much smaller, more poorly funded lab. The company itself is much, much smaller scale and the range of products as well as their rolodex of customers is also considerably smaller. I feel like I'm taking a big step down in a lot of ways by accepting this position.

Due to the general amateur feeling I get from this company and the fact that the pay increase was not as substantial as I expected, I fully intend to continue looking for better work from day 1, even if I accept the position, and I'm still waiting on a few offers so it's possible (though not necessarily likely) that I ""quit"" before I even really start. I'm not sure how this would reflect on my resume or my future job opportunities if I'm obviously looking for new work within weeks of accepting a position. So, in that sense, there may be a major opportunity cost involved here.

I'd like to hear any thoughts anybody has.",29Sep2020,1
966,"My room mate has recently become very hostile towards myself and several others in our social group. It reached a head when we went on a getaway over the weekend and he tried to fight  3 people (myself included) and got into a screaming argument with one other person.  He was obviously clearly intoxicated but I can't help but feel that  it was a desperate cry for help.  

Without divulging too much about his life, I will try to explain his situation. He's a 26 year old single male who has only had 1 actual relationship in his life and she was a gold digger who used him until he had nothing left to give. His financial situation has suffered since this relationship and he's been struggling with addiction (alcohol, cocaine, and weed) to cope with his reality. On top of this, he's currently working a low paying dead-end job that he hates while a lot of our friends are moving on to bigger and better careers. I recently started a new career as well and I feel this has been a trigger for him. Prior to this, I was always the one guy that he could count on to be in a similar situation to him.  We were always two peas in a pod so to speak. ""Two little shits."" When I told him about my new job, he was less than enthusiastic but he tried to put on a smile. Around this same time I also met a wonderfully beautiful and intelligent woman. Rather than being happy for me, he constantly makes snarky remarks like 'She's probably talking to 100 guys'. 

Over the past several weeks I could feel that he was getting more and more upset with his situation in life but I figured that he'd be able to unwind over the trip. The opposite happened when he tried to make an advance on one of the other girls and was denied. As he gradually became more drunk, the yelling increased and eventually the violence began. Despite his obviously ill-placed malice towards us, we tried to be there for him and tried to understand why he was attacking us. He just kept saying ""You fuckers wouldn't understand, I work so hard and I don't have shit"".  When he woke up the next day, he didn't remember a thing. When we told him about it, he didn't try to explain himself or apologize. Instead, he just kept saying that the alcohol makes him demonic. 

That might've been the end of it had he left it there but something else happened that night when he started drinking again. I was hanging out on the couch with the girl I'm talking to and a couple of her friends. We were just chilling, minding our own business, when he came over and ripped the blanket from off of us and said "" Don't touch my fucking blanket"", when it had literally been sitting on the couch for 3 days now.  At this point, it's become blatantly clear that he's either resentful/jealous of us because of our jobs or the women that we date. 

 He's been a friend of mine for a looooong time and I want to see him do well. But I'm beginning to wonder if I should cut my losses. How do you help/confront someone when they are hostile and unwilling to talk about their deepest, darkest issues? How do you help someone who is openly resentful/jealous of you for moving to a better place in life?",29Sep2020,1
967,"I have been on like an emotional roller coaster for months since my best friend took my virginity

For like the past 4 months since my best friend took my virginity I’ve been on an emotional roller coaster I guess and I don’t know what the hell to make of it. I was working on opening upto her more and working on being a better best friend with her and after like a week or so of working that and everything she just decided that she wanted to have sex with me and I was fine with it. I thought with us being more intimate and me opening upto her and some other things like oh she wanted to date but I was wrong. After we did it she didn’t make it clear like we were only doing this as best friends and I caught feelings and she asked if I did and I refused to tell her the truth because I didn’t want to ruin our friendship since she didn’t wanna date me because I atleast wanted to work on our friendship still and so did she because we were the best of friends to eachother. 

I had to try and deal with losing the feelings I had for her in some unhealthy ways like sleeping with some of my other friends after that even if it sounds messed up and I still struggle with it here and there but have gotten better. She’s known for years I’ve had a soft spot for her and she knows I hate seeing her sad or struggling because I care for her, she does care about me as well in the sense that she will push me to constantly better myself and I do the same for her and she doesn’t like seeing me in pain or upset. We still do with one another after that, but recently she started to get into a relationship or is working on it and part of me just got annoyed and I told myself I’m leaning off of a lot of things I’m doing for her but will still do them here and there just not as often because we’re best friends like buying her food or getting her lunch at work, getting her little things I know she needs or when she’s upset, or whatever.

I did come out and admit to her one night when we went on vacation and we were both in our hotel room drunk because I went over and wanted a hug from her and she asked how drunk I was I told her not that much and she told me to sit down, and she asked me while I was drunk because she knows I’ll be honest with her if I did actually catch feelings for her and I was nervous for months to admit it but I told her I did but I’m pretty much over it with dealing with it in unhealthy manors, and she just said I knew it. She came over and hugged me and asked me to never catch feelings for her again and I just told her alright.

We’re fine now and we’re still best friends and we still do everything we’ve been doing but with her moving into getting into a relationship I’ve backed off with a lot that I’m doing and not talking to her as much as we were anymore. Here and there however I just struggle with some of the emotions still and I don’t know why, and she tells me she loves me as a best friend whenever we hang up from a call or I leave her work or house, and I struggled with emotional availability for years till I opened upto her and I can be a baby around her at times and I tell her like I hate getting emotional around her with certain subjects and I don’t know why and she’s just told me it’s because I’ve learned to finally love another human being after how many years again. 

I guess what do you guys think of this and how can I better deal with this emotional roller coaster if i struggle with it still. We love one another as best friends well I may a little more but we want the other to just be happy in life",29Sep2020,1
968,"I'm 18 and in my first semester of college and i've made a point to try be really inviting and open to meeting new people because I have always been very quiet and usually kept to myself.  In the first few months of school i've become pretty close with two separate groups of people.  I've been labeled as the ""social"" friend who knows a lot of people so i've mostly been the one to introduce and connect various people I know, which I love to do because I want everyone to get to know people and make friends. 

Recently one of my friends (lets call them friend A) from one group has started hanging out with (socially distanced of course) the other group of friends.  I'm happy that they're all becoming friends but when I talked to friend A they were telling me about everything they’ve been doing as a group, and I hadn’t been invited to any of it.  I started to get a little hurt and i'm now feeling a little insecure about my friendship with that other group.  I can't help but feel like a terrible person because i'm getting upset and a bit jealous over friend A making friends which really was the whole point of introducing everyone to each other.  I know I can't possibly be invited to everything and it's my fault that I have been more distant because i've been caught up with class and homework among other things but this also isn’t the first time i've been insecure about my place in a friend group.  In the past there have been multiple friend groups I have been a part of where I felt really out of place and left out even though I have no real reason to.

I thought about becoming a paramedic but my anxiety is a huge problem for me (even tho I take meds for it). I don’t have any hobbies or passions, nothing that could become an income. I thought about going to nursing school after I graduate or getting a masters in psychology, but I’m not sure and I’m completely losing my mind over it, the thought that I’ll be 28 years old in 5 years and don’t know what I want is very scary.

I guess my moms old fashioned way of thinking that you need to decide right after high school is still affecting me even tho I don’t believe it. I feel so lost for not knowing, I feel like it’s almost too late to start new, like getting another degree, and it’s stressful. I never really knew what would happen after college and always thought “I can’t figure it out when the time comes” but the time IS HERE, I’ll be graduating in July 2021, and I have no idea what I want to do, I have no idea what I like or what I enjoy.

I know for a fact that she is engaging on bing drinking nightly. When we met she wasn’t like this. 

Recently however she started hanging out with an old friend of hers who is a bad influence. She is staying over night and there during the day. There are a few occasions which I know of that has started drinking at 10 am. She has also been staying up all night. 

I know these things because in the past I was spying on her. The person she is with was feeding me information on drinking and when she went to bed.

I am no longer doing this. I feel terrible about doing it in the past and will never again. However now that I know these facts they are impossible to forget. In fact she has actually been causing me severe anxiety attacks due to my worrying. 


The worst part is that she was recently diagnosed with a seizure disorder. I have epilepsy so I know that lack of sleep and drinking greatly reduces the effectiveness of those drugs.

982,"I would like some advice or feedback as this is killing me.

I opened up to a friend a few weeks back about being depressed and suicidal and although she reassured me she had my back, I felt she was becoming distant after telling her. Our mutual friend found out and reached out to me to talk. She asked if she could see me in person to talk about my feelings. I said of course. I probably shouldn’t have agreed as I was feeling very depressed and suicidal at that point.

We are a group of 3 so the original friend and the mutual friend came together to hang out and talk to me. When they came over they told me that they were setting boundaries until I get help and that they would like to reconnect with me once I’m better. I accepted but it really hurt hearing that. After they left after talking to me I got into a really scary headspace and was adamant on killing myself that night. I reached out to all of my loved ones and reached out to the same friends that asked for space, telling everyone I was scared out of my mind and that I loved them. My two friends didn’t reply to me. Instead, they called 911 on me and then promptly blocked me. The cops pulled a gun on me and the whole thing just turned into a fiasco. I started blowing my friends phones up telling them I almost got shot and none of my messages were going through and all of my calls were getting hung up on. 

The very next day after trying to reach my friends by texting through my email address, I received a long message to never contact them again and that spamming them was emotionally abusive. It may have been excessive but they had called the cops on me, I was having a full blown panic attack and I wasn’t able to reach them to find out what was going on.

984,"I’m 26 years old and live a decent life. I have a good job which I enjoy and I’m in a long term relationship. However, something has recently turned my mood sour. 

I grew up in a town that was huge on high school athletics. Pretty much every boy was expected to play something or else they were treated as weird. I’ll be the first to admit I was a ‘jock’. I played 3 sports and was the ladies man throughout my teen years. 

Each year, my school would hold a massive pep rally a month into the school year. The pep rallys were an all day thing that would feature multiple events. The biggest event of them all was the athletic competition. Hundreds of students would compete in multiple activities and would be eliminated one by on

I had won the competition during my freshman, sophomore, and junior year. In the 50+ year history of the event, I was the only student who had ever won three straight competitions. I was fully prepared to win a fourth straight and complete the ‘dynasty’. The athletic director had told me the school would gift me a scholarship fund if I was able to win it all one more time. 

As usual, I breezed through the competition early and comfortably secured my spot in the final round yet again. This time my finals opponent would, for the first time, be a girl who just happened to be a freshman. She was tall and lanky and posed no real threat to me off the naked eye. The final round would consist of a basketball shootout, first to 10 wins. Basketball is my best sport and I felt as if they were almost gifting the championship to me. I took an early 5-0 lead but she ended up getting into a lucky hot streak and won 10-7. She defeated me and became the champion. I was humiliated and went into a massive depression. I know that I deserved to be the one holding that trophy and seeing her hoist it up killed me. The rest of my senior year remains a blur to me. To put even more salt in the wound, the same girl that defeated me would go on to win the competition in her 10th/11th/12th grade years. She got the dynasty that she denied me of. 

Last week, I came across the Instagram account of the girl who defeated me. I found out that she came out as gay and is now married to a beautiful woman who’s pregnant with their first child. Both of them have a ton of followers and she appears to have a high paying job that allows them to live a luxurious lifestyle. I thought I had it good but she’s really living an amazing life. 

I’m extremely jealous of this woman and I can’t help but to think what my life could have been if I had just beaten her in that high school competition 9 years ago. I know it’s silly because I’m 26 and she’s 23 now but I just can’t seem to let go of the past. I know it’s unhealthy to be this envious of a person, but I can’t help but think about it each night.

987,"I know I am very young still, but it's nice to have an idea of what you want to do in life, especially if you are considering not going to college. I (16f) don't have a plan or goal in life after high school, or should I say I don't know what to do. It sucks when all your life you've expected to go to college, but then you start to become more hesitant. 

I still have a 4.0 gpa just in case, and I intend on keeping it that way. But, I feel like college isn't going to make me happy, nor will going to school 4 more years just to get a degree, especially after school for the past decade has mentally drained you and taken away all of my desire to be creative. I want to fix that myself now by thinking of a future for myself, but the life I want seems impossible to get. 

All I really know I want out of life are these things: 

Being able to travel freely

Learning some languages

Being financially well-off, as I've always had a hunger to be more than poor. Being ""my own"" boss is appealing (customers technically are your bosses though, but pretty much I want to be an entrepreneur). As long as I have the money to travel and live comfortably, I should be fine in life. 

The more I look at these things, the more I worry myself. I feel like I am setting myself up for failure, since I don't know how to work towards that life. Travelling in my 20s sounds amazing, but I doubt I can achieve it. This is why I still have college as an option, although I am 99.99% it will make me unhappy, but apparently you have to do things in life that make you unhappy in order to survive, or at least according to my mother I do.

988,"So I’ve been dating my girlfriend for just over a year and couldn’t be happier with her. We’re currently on holiday with her family and extended family, and they’ve always seemed like the nicest people, however after spending this much time with them I’ve come to realise that they’re incredibly racist. To the point where sometimes it shocks me. 

For example my girlfriends dad played a clip from a Monty Python sketch about Chinese people that I’m sure at the time was considered very funny, but now it possibly hasn’t aged well. This sort of thing I can deal with, it’s a product of a different era. But then this progressed to my girlfriends aunt saying that as a country we should “bomb the Chinese”. I asked my girlfriend later if she knew why her Aunt was quite so prejudice against Chinese people and she explained that it’s because she blames them for Covid, and also they mistreat animals. I explained to her pretty quickly that although there are likely cases of Chinese individuals mistreating animals, to blame an entire nation for this was idiotic, and my girlfriend agreed; but then asked me not to say anything about this to her aunt. 

A previous night there has been a news story in the UK currently about a policeman who was killed by someone being held in custody. Another of her aunts immediately assumed the skin colour of the killer was brown (which in this instance was actually the case), but then when she found out the the policeman was shot dead she made a remark about the killer “hiding a gun under his turban”. Again I pointed out that this was idiotic as 1. He didn’t wear a turban, and 2. Even if he did, what are the chances that someone would smuggle a weapon under one into a police custody detainee centre. In this instance the Aunt admitted that this did sound far fetched (not that this excused the comments). 

My issue is my girlfriend has never shown to me that she’s as racist as her family, so I don’t believe this to be the case with her, and I really care about her a lot, to the point where I’ve been considering our future, things like marriage and kids etc. But could I really bring a child into this world with her knowing full well that she has a strong relationship with her family, and my child would be exposed to this level of unconscious racist behaviour? Or could I really introduce the rest of my family to her family and expect them to approve of me marrying someone whose family are clearly so backwards when it comes to matters such as racial equality. Is this going to ruin our relationship further down the line?

Any input is appreciated. I’m confident that sadly I can’t be the only person that’s been in this situation.

https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/Lot/wayne-thiebaud-b-1920-mickey-mouse-6233929-details.aspx

I thought i would sell it listed as a “master copy” on etsy, but my classmates said that I cannot since the image is copyrighted by Wayne Thiebaud. I was a bit confused, because a painting is your interpretation of that image, as long as you’re not trying to pass it off as an original I thought it was allowed? 

By extension, how was the original painter allowed to sell a painting of Mickey Mouse? I see these all over - artists doing “pop art” of iconic character like the Simpsons, Mickey Mouse, etc, how are these allowed if the images are protected?

A few weeks ago one of my best friends messaged me saying that he was developing feelings for her and it kinda hurt me but I didn't really think anything of it. He calls me yesterday and tells me that he ended up admitting his feelings for her a few days ago and it turns out that she also has feelings for him and they're going to be going on a few dates soon.

I'm just so conflicted because I know neither of them didn't do anything wrong and I know they're not doing this to hurt me, and I want nothing more but to be happy for them and to see them work out because they're both great people.

But I can't help but almost feel ""betrayed."" Her and I have been close friends for a while and have done a lot together and I've always felt like we could talk about anything and everything so for her to develop feelings for someone else just bothered me. It's like I just want some explanation for all of this and my brain just can't accept the fact that people can't control what they feel and who they have feelings for.

I still love both of them as my friends, and I think this is what it'll finally take for me to truly get over her. I want to remain friends with her because we have such a good friendship but I just don't know what to do. I haven't been in this much emotional pain in a long time and I really want to just stop feeling this way and to just be happy about myself and be happy for them.

992,"I always wondered this, but can schools see what you are doing at home? I don't mean a college or university though. I mean can a high school or middle school somehow see what you do at home if you are using a laptop issued to you by them. Also a follow up question. What if you have that laptop issued to you by the school and don't use it, but it is connected to your internet, and you use a different laptop (not issued by the school)? Is there any way for a school to see what you are doing? Also one final question. What is the most legal thing a school can do when monitoring your activity without breaking the law?

993,"I’m really not sure what to do about this. like the title says, she’s just been sitting there with some luggage and a blanket for a month. i drive past her nearly every day on the way to work, but it only occurred to me recently how strange the situation actually was. i never see her move from the one spot and she looks to be very dirty at this point. some times she sleeping, sometimes she’s just talking to herself. i never see her eat either. i kept thinking about her when i got home. i was considering giving her money for a hotel room when i got paid so she could at least shower and sleep in a bed, but then i thought what would happen after that? she just goes back to the bus stop? 

so i guess the advice i’m looking for is just, what should i do to help her? i looked up homeless shelters around my area but i live in a city where it’s a large issue so most have waiting lists. i’m just really not sure what i’m supposed to do in this situation, but idk what’s gonna happen to her if she just keeps sitting there.",29Sep2020,1

She had a rough childhood, her dad died when she was young, and she has an abusive mom. I've been friends with her for 8 years, and I'm getting increasingly worried for her. She's wanted to get help, but her mom just abuses her more whenever she talks to her. I can tell we've built up a lot of trust over the years, so I'm one of the few people she'll open up to about her mental health. I've been trying to help her for a while, but it's not going too well. I've always been open to her and always allow her to rant, and I've made it clear that I'm there for her. I've tried to give her advice, but honestly I'm not sure if it's too great. The point is, I've been trying as hard as I can to help, but things are going downhill. Is there anything else I can do to help?

999,"I'm a finance/economics major. I decided to take an introductory Python coding class just due to general interest and because I've heard it's good to know Python as a coding language. It's an elective and I don't need the class to graduate.

Well, my first test went terribly and I failed. I only have a large final project (worth 20% of my total grade) and two exams (worth 50% of my total grade) left.

On the homework assignments, I take 5-10 hours whereas other peers of mine in the course take 2-3 hours. I feel like I'm constantly playing catch-up to try and get to everyone else's level.

My grandpa died of COVID-19 this semester. It's been rough on me. 5 of my other family members have gotten COVID-19 too. My father now wants to go overseas to see my grandmother (his mother) and take care of her. This has been freaking me out because he's essentially going to travel on a disease tube for 17 hours before heading to a third-world country and staying there. 

If I drop the class now, I can get 20% of my money/credit back. I can spend more time on classes I actually *need* to pass. I can use that time to look for an internship and work on other projects.

My parents don't care if I take the class or drop it. They want me to continue taking it, but I'm worried how a bad grade will look on my transcript and impact my GPA. This would be the only class I've ever dropped with a ""W"" (withdrawal) grade. My advisor/counselor says one ""W"" withdrawal doesn't usually cause concern because there are plenty of valid reasons to drop a class.

I need advice. Should I drop this course?",29Sep2020,1
1000,"We’ve had my dog for about six years now.
 He is a nice breed and could honestly be in a dog show if he was trained properly. Im not much of a dog person and I’m usually always busy but I try to tend to him whenever I can. I’m mostly the one that feeds him and I practically have to beg my dad to groom him. I’ve tried to talk him into taking the dog to pet smart once a month to be groomed but he tells me not to because he’ll groom him instead. This ends up taking him at least 2-3 weeks to actually accomplish. My dog probably gets 3-4 baths a year. 
My parents mostly see him as a guard dog which means they want him outside most of the time. Of course, I try to bring him in during the day when it’s hot, when it’s raining and whenever it is cold. I had to beg them a few years ago to bring the dog in whenever it was cold outside because dogs can not handle the cold. They tried to convince me that his coat would protect him from the cold. 

My dad has always been a bird lover. He practices falconry and has been doing so for the past 30 years. He has a falcon right now that he treats like royalty. He even lets the falcon stay in their room at night sometimes, which I think is weird but whatever. It’s like he makes an effort to make sure his bird (who has loyalty to him whatever) is okay but barely makes an effort to clean the dog. 

Today, my dad got frustrated with our dog because he was running in the backyard and my dad wanted him to come in. Whenever the dog came in, I witnessed my dad try to kick him. I could’ve punched him in his face. I confronted him about it and he almost laughed it off.

I’m now at the point where, I would love to try to sell my dog behind their backs. They don’t really care about him and I plan to leave in a few months and won’t be able to take him with him. I think it’s honestly best if I find him a home, with people who will really take good care of him. I know I’ll be sad when it’s all said and done but I know he will have a much better home.

1001,"In December of 2019, I graduated with a bachelor's degree in Business Administration and because of scholarships I'm completely debt free. My plan for after graduation was do a second Disney College Program (Spring 2019 was my first) in Spring 2020 and stay with the company after to take advantage of their employee education program to get an MBA. But then Covid happed, Disney World closed, and  I was on my way home without any idea on if Disney would invite us back or not. 

Fast-forward to now were I know Disney is not inviting us back, Covid is not ending anytime soon, and our economy (in the states) is permanently f\*\*ked. I have no idea what to do next. I'm so scared of  working just to live like my parents do and not having a career that I enjoy. I live in a small town so jobs that require my level of education are not out there. I am willing to relocate but every opening  I can find requires years of experience that I don't have. I have a strong feeling that I need to get out the US (most of you will understand) so I was thinking about doing an MBA program abroad but I don't know if there will be jobs available when I graduate.

I really don't know what to do, Idk if advice would even help the situation.. Using a throwaway

So my boyfriend was house sitting his buddies apartment for a week because they have a dog. His buddy comes back home, and he is sick. Apparently a lot of people the guy was with while he was hone got very sick. When he got back he didn't tell my boyfriend he was sick. Just came back from BEING ON A PLANE late at night so my bf stayed there another night since his friend was his ride back home. Their interaction that afternoon was very short and late at night so he didn't pick up on him being sick at first. The next day he finds out that his buddy has been sick along with all the other people he was around. Same symptoms as Covid. My boyfriend wanted to go get tested, but to test around here you have to go through a drive through setup, and his friend didn't want too. I cant take him because I cant risk the people im living with. So its been a week not, they are still sick, Bf is staying in his friends apartment because he doesnt want to get his family sick....

And the worst part. HIS FRIEND IS GOING OUT EVERYDAY. He goes to the store, gets pizza, goes to a coffee stand, all while being sick. ( BF stays home in the apartment )

Frankly idk if they have covid since he just didnt want to get tested, but its still bugging me. My BF feels like garbage. and I dont know what to do. Im at a loss.

has anyone else been through something like this???

I dont know what specific advice im asking for here, and im sorry if the post is messy, I just dont know what to do

To get straight into it, I work in a nursing home and actively fuck some of the elderly men who live there. I just need a second opinion because I am conflicted here. I love helping people and making them better, so I decided to go into medicine. The thing is I applied for a job at a nursing home I noticed after a while that quite a few of the men there were flirting with me. I should have noticed sooner, but I’m somewhat of a socially dense moron at times. After I found this out it I kinda had a non stop field day from there and have been fucking them since. I find old men super sexy and attractive and I seem to pick them up easily because I come off as gay. I have a typical gay accent and have a bit of feminine mannerisms. I’m very muscular, 6’3, black and a bit above average in the looks department. As an added bonus, since they’re old and are seen as less desirable, they don’t have a chance of getting laid, let alone with a smoking hot young guy like me. It’s a huge win for me because they’re desperate for sex and will do whatever I want so I will come back and fuck their brains out.

However, I kinda feel bad about it. On one hand,  I have the most amazing sex with them practically worshiping me, but on the other I feel like I take a bit advantage of them. I get I will get some judgement here, but it’s absolutely amazing to have such attractive people practically groveling for me to fuck them. It makes me feel like a god. I’m not worried about being caught because I don’t feel like they would want to rat me out and lose a chance with me but I still kinda feel bad. What should I do here?",29Sep2020,1

OH AND he has been paying for sex. the cherry on top is that he hasn’t wanted to have sex for a while now. i got pregnant and then had a miscarriage and ever since when i tried to initiate it he’ll be like “no i don’t want to” so in conclusion he’d rather have sex with 40 yr old women and pay other girls than to even touch me lol. we’ve been together for a year and he never wanted to go down on me and it’s not like i’m dirty or something lol i mean i shower 2 times a day and my diet isn’t bad and i never had any other guys NOT wanna eat me out and i saw messages between him and some girl and she was like “the way you ate my pussy😩” so it’s like why dude what is so wrong with me that you have to PAY other girls and would literally fuck anyone else but me.   i’m sorry if this post is all over the place. i’m just so confused and i don’t have any one to talk to about this.,29Sep2020,1
