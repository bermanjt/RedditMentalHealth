0,"I don’t know how to not make this long because there are lots of details that I think are important, and this is also kind of a vent, so please forgive me and PLEASE be nice. 

I(29F)have this friend(30F, we’ll call her Jamie), whom I’ve been very close with for about 9 years. Her and I were inseparable in college, spending nearly every day and night together, in classes, her staying over at my house, etc. During this time, she introduced me to her very best friend(31F, we’ll call her Maria)that she knew for years before me. This friend and her and I all began to spend more time together. Then, about six years ago, she moved out of town but in the same state, and Maria and I became extremely close and the three of us over the years have made ourselves into a little group of sorts, with Maria and I often traveling to visit Jamie. 

Now, if I’m being honest, my friendship with Jamie has slowly dissipated over the years. Nothing necessarily caused it, but the distance and our busy lives made the both of us often forget to prioritize each other. It hasn’t been anyone’s fault, as we’ve both done this. However, Jamie and Maria have remained the same, partially because Maria is excellent with communication and staying in touch. Still, I have always felt like a bit of an outsider with the two of them, because they have been friends for so long and I came in so late. They never out right made me feel that way, especially not Maria, but Jamie has always sort of placed their friendship on a pedestal. This is all fine, but with them seeming to try to bring me into their group, it’s been hard not to compare my friendship with Jamie to Jamie’s friendship with Maria.

Anyway, Jamie got engaged in August 2017. Maria was her maid of honor which we all always knew would be the case. She started planning pretty quickly but hired a wedding planner, so when we would reach out to see what she needed, she didn’t really need much. I was then engaged in March 2018, and because I knew she was getting married in June 2019, I purposefully set my wedding for 2020 so I could dedicate time to her day, even though 2019 was my first choice. 

Then there’s this point in early 2018 when Maria goes to stay with Jamie for a weekend. Before she goes, I ask Jamie if it’s alright if I come too, since we’re all always saying that it’s better with the 3 of us. She says that it won’t work because her fiancé gets overly stressed with excessive people, etc, so I accept and move on. Then when Maria is out there, Jamie takes her on this special tour that the three of us always talked about going on together. This situation guts me and makes me feel all of the insecurities I’ve felt throughout our friendship all at once. I talk to her about it and we move on.

Fast forward to late 2018/early 2019. I’m fired from my job, then start at a new place with a massive cut in pay and hours both, my fiancé starts a new job that we find will literally risk his life so we both decide it’s okay for him to quit because we have savings, then that same week I’m told I’ll be laid off at the end of the school year(I work at a school). All this happens after I experience a really difficult end to another friendship, but because we’re starting to really do some planning for Jamie’s wedding, I try to only talk about things going on with me minimally. 

Maria and I do Jamie’s bridal shower in April which costs a lot of money to both of us because of travel and other expenses, but I was full of joy to be a part of it and do that for her because I love her. Then her bachelorette comes in early May in Vegas which I’m sure most of you know is unbelievably expensive but again, I keep my concerns/complaints to myself. However, Maria and I have to fly out because we live too far while Jamie and her other bridesmaids live close enough to drive so we have trouble finding flights that don’t cost a ridiculous amount until the last minute, despite looking well in advance. So when we find flights, it requires us to leave from the bachelorette a day early, so we ask the bridesman who’s planning the bachelorette if we can pay for one less night since we won’t be there. This causes an issue among the other bridesmaids and in the process, despite my intention to not let the bride know, she is somehow left to figure it all out. Still, we go on the bachelorette and have a great time with no issues. 

This leads to the week after the bachelorette, less than a month away from the wedding and Jamie talks to Maria and basically tells her that she thinks I’m not being supportive and she is getting this feeling from me that I’m not happy for her. Maria, being the friend that she is with great intentions for our friendship of three, sets up a 3 way call so that Jamie and I can talk it out and Maria will be a sort of mediator(we are both more than okay with this). Jamie begins the conversation by telling me what she told Maria, goes on to tell me all about her struggles financially with planning her wedding since she had a pay cut from her chosen transition from one job to another, mentions the issue with the flights without even mentioning the fact that Maria was also part of that conversation, and just continuously talked about money and how much she's been struggling(her wedding ended up being around 24k and she received 5k from her dad, her mom paid for her wedding dress, her aunt paid for all her accessories, and her in laws paid for her honeymoon. I know all these numbers don't really matter, but when she was saying all these things to me in a state of my fiance not working and my assumption that I wasn't going to be working in a month, on top of literally not knowing how to pay our next bills, it was really frustrating). She even mentioned one situation from earlier in the year when I was trying to go down to stay with her for a few days while we went somewhere before a ticket I had to go there expired but I didn't end up going because of money, but Maria went during that time and Jamie had nothing to say about it. 

I allowed her to say her peace and didn't tell her how I truly felt because I knew she was really stressed about her wedding and needed to vent, and I knew that time wasn't right for me to unload on her and get upset back. I went to her wedding, had a wonderful time, and(hopefully) supported her in the best way I could. But since then, I have been left with a bad taste in my mouth and have had the hardest time letting go of it. This conversation was in May, I saw her at her wedding in June, and her and I don't talk much outside of our group chat with Maria. I often pull myself back from expressing my sadness or frustration in our group chat because I feel like she doesn't want to know, as she mentioned in our conversation several times that she felt like I was taking away from conversations about her wedding by bringing up all the issues that I was facing.

Part of the reason I haven't said anything is because I let so much time go that it felt silly to bring it up. I've tried and tried to let it go and move on but I feel constant bitterness, hurt, and inadequacy over it, even while still feeling silly about saying something after this long. 

To clarify, she is an excellent friend normally. She is like a sister to me and I want to resolve things but I think I really need to say how I feel. I just don't know how to do it without exploding on her because I've been harboring these feelings for a long time. 

TL;DR: I've been needing to express my feelings to my best friend since May of last year but I feel like I've let too much time go by. How should I approach this?",22Feb2020,1

Although I do remember a time when I was just happy living in the moment, for the past 2 years (since I became 15) I can’t remember ever truly being relaxed. I guess I need advice on how to live in peace, but I mainly want to know if this is just the normal human experience or if I’m doing something wrong.",22Feb2020,1

Hi, I feel terrible about posting this, but I saw an interesting post on r/rant about dogs so I feel like I need guidance. Lately, I've been feeling like I'm drowning and I'm not a good dog parent. I go to college full time and work full time, and I have a strong family life and have a new dating partner/developing relationship. During the work week, I go to work for about 9-10 hours. I come home, walk my dog, play frisbee with her, and cuddle with her on the couch for a bit. Then it's errand time. Grocery shopping, laundry, cleaning, cooking, etc. Then, I take her out for another shorter walk because she has night anxiety on nightly walks and only wants to pee before pulling me back in the house. 

On weekends, I take her to the dog park in the morning, but then I'm off to a coffee shop for around 6 hours because that's the only place where i can focus to do my school work (I go online). I come back home, walk her, and go to bed. 

Sometimes, I go out on the weekends with my boyfriend and don't come home until late. She never has accidents, she's 7 or 8 years old, but at night, I can see her pacing sometimes on the camera. When I see her pacing, I start to head home, but the person I'm seeing lives 30 minutes away so it takes me a bit to get to her. I feel like it's a burden to ask them if I can bring her over, because she is so clingy towards me and has to be in the bed with me and it takes away the attention of sexy times. It's just weird and I'd rather just go home when I see her. I live with a roommate that doesn't let me have people over, so inviting them over is a no-go.

I got her when I was in a different relationship with someone who also wanted a dog, we lived together and had alternating schedules. I also wasn't going to school and wasn't planning on going back. I thought I would marry that person. I had no idea I would be taking care of her on my own. That breakup changed my entire life. That was over a year ago. 

I saw a post with a bunch of comments that said people who don't have a lot of time for dogs shouldn't have them. I feel like she's happy.....she sleeps a lot on the camera....but I don't know. I'm considering rehoming her. I refuse to put her back in a shelter. What should I do???",22Feb2020,1

7,"On mobile so I apologize in advance. Long post so sorry for that too. 
My (23F) fiancé (29M) and I have been together for almost 8 years and engaged for 3. We have been to hell and back together. I moved in with him when I was 17 and haven’t been without him since. My parents and I did not get along at all when we lived together and we are only just beginning to rebuild a decent relationship. 
Well my fiancé is a great guy in a lot of ways. He’s had a hard life but he’s one of those people that makes friends everywhere. Everyone loves him. Well about 6 months ago he found out I’d been texting another guy and he freaked out, broke my phone threw me out of the house in the middle of a ice storm without shoes or anything. When that happened I called my mom and she set up a friend of hers to pick me up and bring me to their place (my parents live 3 hours away so I couldn’t get to them) well as soon as I got out all I wanted was to come back I knew I’d screwed up and wanted to make things right. But everyone told me no matter what I did he shouldn’t have thrown me out without anything or even a phone to contact anyone. But all I could think about was getting back. So I came back 3 days later after he promised he’d change and he would go to couples counselling with me. Well that was almost 4 months ago. We have not once been to counselling and he yells at me daily. The other day I got him the wrong shirt when he was getting ready for work and when I went looking for the right one he started flipping out. Telling me how lazy and useless I am. Telling me he doesn’t know why I can’t do anything right and lots more nasty hurtful things. Well I found the shirt he wanted and he then ripped the shirt from his chest completely ripping it in half bc he was so mad that I didn’t just have the one he needed hanging up. (It was in the basket as I’d just done laundry the night before) he does things like this on a daily basis I’m now at the point of just trying to guess what he will flip out about today. He tells me I better kiss his ass and do everything to make him happy bc of what I did. And that I need to just be okay with it. He’s told me I can’t go back to school until we pay his $7000 in debt so he can get his license back. I can’t have friends or go out bc he doesn’t trust me. He has punched holes in the wall right behind my head he’s accidentally hit me when trying to hit a wall or something else. He’s knocked me to the ground and screamed in my face. I could keep going and give you lots of other details of the things he’s freaked out about or done or said but then this would be even longer then it already is. 
So now I’m at the point I can’t do it anymore. I need out I know I messed up but I’m not a slave I’m a person with feelings and I need someone that will love and support me. I need to go to school and get myself a career so I’m not stuck as a server for the rest of my life. The problem is though I can’t do it. All I think about is leaving but I can’t make myself do it. I can’t afford a place of my own. My parents have offered for me to move back home but I’m terrified to ruin the relationship we have only just started to rebuild. And I’m terrified to be alone. I’ve never been alone and it’s so so scary to think about. 
I want to leave, I need to leave. But I have no idea where to start. I have no idea what to do. 
So if you’ve been in my situation and where able to get out how did you do it? How did you get the courage ? Where did you start?",22Feb2020,1

10,"Hi everyone. I live in a student hall and share a kitchen with 12 people and we’ve been dealing with a mice problem for a few months now. When the pest control people came, they said it would take a few weeks of heavy work in the kitchen to get the problem completely settled but the student hall managers weren’t too keen on engaging in such a process and we can’t really do anything about it. Lately it has improved (at least from what we see). We set up a few traps and haven’t seen any in the last 2 weeks and even before that we never saw more than 2 or three. 

Today I had to use a chemical product to clean my shower drain because it wasn’t working too well in the past weeks and I figured it wasn’t just clumps of hair, there was something bigger clogging the pipes. I had the pleasure of finding a mouse tail floating around at the end of the process.... now i guess the little thing died in the pipes, but i was wondering how common this type of incident was ? This happened in London. I’ll talk to the management about it but i was thinking maybe some of you know if this indicates a pretty serious mice situation or if there is not so much too worry about. Some tips would also be welcome !",22Feb2020,1
11,"So I have an interview coming up to be arborist. Sounds like a cool job and I really want it. 
The thing is, I’ve been trying to become a postman for a while and the hiring process takes quite a long time (3 months maybe longer). 

Should I mention this at the interview on Monday? 
I think I should mention it just out of respect so he knows that when I do get the offer at the post office in the coming months I’ll be taking it. Although, I think mentioning it will mean that I won’t get the arborist job because they spend all that money to train me and then I take the PO job.

13,"So one of my friends just posted a status saying the Democratic Party is from hell (ok no big deal), that he’s voting for Trump (that’s cool too, we’re a democracy), and that the Democratic Party glorified homosexuality. Politics don’t bother, but being hateful does. 

This is out of character for him, but I need to provide some context:

So we used to be in a band together. He’s originally from small town Florida, not the sharpest tool in the shed, but a very friendly guy. Never heard him say anything racist or homophobic. When we met, he wasn’t particularly religious either. His wife on the hand comes from a very religious family (they complained about it a lot. I mean old school women are property types). I met him when they were engaged. Eventually he started working for her dad. He used to complain about her dad preaching to him. Fast forward a couple years later to their marriage and I guess he’s gone native.

Him and his wife are nice people, but since their marriage, she’s become more like her family. In turn, he’s also become like that. He doesn’t listen to the punk or metal bands anymore (his passion) since they’ve had a child. I think this is because they think their child will grow up to be awful if they listen to that stuff. We watched a comedy movie a few months back and it felt incredibly uncomfortable (like watching a sex scene with your parents except this was Just Friends a PG-13 movie).

I feel really bad because he’s so isolated. He really only spends time with his wife and her family. I see him a couple times a year but he’s moved far away.

I’m not sure what to do. This isn’t really him. I can confront him on it, but what good will it do? He doesn’t have anyone except for his wife and her family. I’ll probably end up saying something and see how he responds.",22Feb2020,1

17,"I am 17 years old, I dropped out because I found school education not based on life, I also didn’t regret it even tho I was gonna loose all my friends and the girl with I ever felt love and company with.

I really enjoy this lifestyle but it’s clearly wrong, I barely socialize and I can say now I have 0 irl friends and every time I go outside it’s because I wanna buy something to eat. My mom keeps on asking what I wanna do and I just tell her I will finish ged and study by 18, even tho I think I am insecure about even passing the tests since I haven’t studied and I have no clue which topics are there even, but atleast she’s relaxed for now. After all that been said, what would be advice for me to get to have friends in real life again, quit my addiction to LoL and twitch streams, I feel like it’s hard since I was never a normie, I was always pretty different to my friends when it came to music tastes and games, also how I even weared my self, I was edgy but still could relate because I was funny and pretty smart, also bilingual so I pulled out a bunch of girls. Everytime I’m off LoL or streams chats and the culture, specially almost before going to sleep, I get this thoughts on my mind that I have to do something and I just feel confused, I am so lost. I also so cold and I hate this, I feel ungrateful because I don’t even do anything at home while having so much to offer even tho I am not being force to do so. I literally just want to cry but I would have to force it and then I wouldn’t even find a solution. I really need advices and choices from people that are actually willing to help someone else’s life.

19," I’ll start off by saying I’m 15 years old, in the 9th grade. All through school, starting in Middle school, I’ve had excellent grades, and have been in the honors program including skipping pre algebra in the 8th grade, getting one of my math credits waived basically. Sure, I had great grades but that still doesn’t make me feel good about myself. I feel like I constantly do average work, and I get rewarded for it, so why should I go further and try harder? It’s a bad mindset to have, and a bad habit of doing just what’s expected of me. This year I worked for one of grades, for the first time ever I busted my ass in biology to achieve an A by the end of the trimester. It felt great seeing as I struggle in science the most, so it was a great feeling achieving a good grade in the class, thing is, now I’m back to the norm, doing average work in all my classes, and barely being bothered to do any extra credit, or work harder on anything and things alike. Right now I have the worst grade I’ve ever had in my 2nd biology class, which is a C-, and I’m afraid I’m not going to be able to bring it up in time simply because of my poor work ethic. I understand that highschool is the foundation for my future basically, but no matter how much I try, I mainly procrastinate assignments and turn them in at the last second possible, and regretting it, even if I get a good grade on the assignment.

This goes out of school as well. I barely put any effort into things that won’t affect me personally, and I have no drive to do anything new or anything like that. I don’t like trying new things or anything outside of my comfort zone. I’d rather be at home by myself or with a few friends just chilling doing nothing pretty much.

I fear for my future academic success if I keep up this habit, and I’m wondering is there truly anything to fix work ethic, or is it just something that will always stick with me. This can harm me in many ways including my GPA, my job in the future, my personal life.

Thank you if you read this, this is kind of like venting for me.

28,"So I just want some opinions/advice/sounding boards I guess. 
I recently saw someone I dated several years ago on a dating app, their bio said they were in (another nearby area, not where we both currently live) for a few weeks and that they are looking for some “fun”. Which normally would be fine, but I happen to know this person is currently married. 
Relevant backstory - when this person and I dated they were extremely toxic and manipulative. I found out after we broke up that they cheated several times, one of the people they cheated with is their current spouse - whose previous marriage was ruined by the same person I dated WHILE we were still together. (I know!!!! Horrible!). So this person was very manipulative and I was a mess after we broke up from basically constant psychological and emotional manipulation. But I worked through it and washed my hands of them completely and moved on to a much better place in my life - I haven’t forgiven them but I’ve moved on and know that people like that get their comeuppance eventually. 
So I was and I wasn’t shocked to see them trolling for hookups based on my experience with them. The petty side of me was immediately filled with righteous, revenge fantasies of throwing them under the bus and stomping on their metaphorical life. However, after I calmed down and thought about it - it’s always better to be the bigger person. But a part of me is tempted to anonymously tell their spouse, who I don’t know personally, and who may not deserve it based on their previous behaviour (cheating on their previous spouse with my (now) ex), but from the perspective of if it were my spouse out there doing this I would want someone/anyone to tell me. 
So I don’t know what to do. Do I just forget I saw this and leave them to their hot toxic mess of a relationship? Anonymously tell the spouse? Or is there a course of action I haven’t thought of?",22Feb2020,1

Hey guys, so I'm writing this post because I used to feel so lost about what I wanted exactly. It was driving me crazy. I dropped out of school and still had no idea what to do

I did some research online and became obsessed with law of attraction, astrology, numerology, the secret, etc.

I have to say, my biggest source of clarity was getting a numerology reading done. Someone on Reddit recommended it and I CAN'T BELIEVE how accurate it was!

Now I want to recommend it to everyone, in case you also might not know what to with your life, or you're unsure of what your passion is. Since having my reading done, I feel like I've had more clarity on what I need to do exactly.

anyway,

35,"Apologies as this is all over the place. 

I'm 27 (F) , still trying to get a BA in art.. I'm not so sure how important it is to have a BA to get any art job that isn't sitting in an office but whatever, my parents will be disappointed if I don't get it (I failed before in part because of learning difficulties and problems with time management). My parents are funding me through this time around which I am soo grateful for but I'm incredibly burnt out and tired all the time. 
I'm undiagnosed autistic and dyslexic, which obviously makes things harder. I self medicate for depression and the general concensus among most authority figures throughout my life is that I'm willfully lazy. 
Can't get a decent part time job as I've been abroad for years and my cv is all over the place so I've been modelling and thinking about cam work. The money is just so much better than bar work. Just found out I have herpes which is a financial disaster for me. I'm really loosing hope. I also clean to earn money but its not enough. The last few years of my life,, In fact all of my life, have been very isolating. After escaping an abusive relationship abroad Ive found someone I love who is kind and supportive (we are in an open relationship which is how I got the herp, not ideal but no ones fault) . Only he lives far away, so I'm completely on my own here where I study. It's impossible to make friends with no money and no time. My classmates are much older, and anyone who wants to be my friend outside of uni is just looking to dip their d :/
I'm so lonely here and want to quit before I fail,, at least I could return to studying when I'm less burned out?
Wtf should I do? I feel like I'm drowning.",22Feb2020,1
36,"I made a throwaway account for this. I'm kinda all over the place, so sorry if my stream of consciousness doesn't make much sense. I realize this might just get buried, but I need to let it out. 

&amp;#x200B;

It started a few weeks ago, when my best friend of six years and I got into a fight. It was an argument about dumb stuff(as it usually is) and it escalated. We were truly best friends and went out everywhere. Every outing was made fun by us befriending random people and causing mischief. Now we cut ties and went our own ways. I tried making it better after a party we were both at, but she just walked off. The thing is, she was sort of my social line and I feel like a lost a big chunk of my life with this.

Now I feel quite lonesome, and a depression episode kicking in. Just the thought of doing anything(including even writing this) makes me feel tired and sad. Yeah I know, cheery topic.

It's not that I'm anti-social, quite the opposite, but I have trouble actually meeting new people unprompted. I work from home, and most of my closer friends live out of town, so I don't get a real chance to go out and meet new people. The closest I get to independent outing is when I go on a date with someone, but I realized I might be using these hookups for self validation. I'm having more and more trouble reading people. When I think they want a relationship, they just want sex and vice versa. Even going out with someone new makes me feel nervous now. So chalk that one up to another reason for my confused mood.

I feel that I'm slowly isolating myself from the world, and I don't like it. It's a pretty small town, so having new experiences with new people is a bit limiting. I still would like to go out there and be social. People recharge my energy, but I don't even know where to start anymore. I'm doing all the self help advice there is. Working out, reading, volunteering at a kids hospital, meditating, taking time for myself, all of it; but I still feel all messed up inside. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel I could go on for a while with this. I just need some help on how to deal and what to do. So I don't spill all my guts ask away if you'd like some more information to contextualize. Thank you for anyone reading this and giving your input.

37,"So I’ve been married for 2 years now. My wife and I found out we are going to have our first child. I’m a sophomore in college, and we live pretty far away from our families. 

I’m studying business management and agriculture. 

My wife wants to move closer to her parents when I’m done with school. The fact of the matter is that there aren’t any good paying jobs in my degree field where our parents live. I also want to pursue a graduate degree so that I will be able to provide for our family because it will increase my earning after college by 50%.

She hates the university town we live in, and wants me to finish as soon as I can, but she also wants me to be earning enough money to sustain a comfortable living. I am feeling more and more discouraged each day and I feel like I might not be able to ever please her.

41,"I apologise in advance if this starts to drag out a little...

To paint the picture a little, I live on a pretty normal public street (not overly busy or quiet, just normal) with houses running down each side. But because the road isn’t the widest, there’s only parking available on one side. Parking is a bit of a pain but everyone makes do and because there are other streets branching off our street, there can sometimes be people parking in our street if there isn’t any room in theirs. Now, I’ve lived in this street my whole life and I’ve been driving for about 7 years or so now. In this time I can’t really say anyone’s gotten shitty with each other over the parking situation because we’ve pretty much just accepted it and gotten on with things. Now a couple of people have garages at the back of their houses and one or two have a drive (including me), so parking sometimes isn’t massively difficult. The unfortunate thing with the drive we have is that it can only fit one car comfortably and one more with difficultly. Now, this was fine when my sister and I were younger and our parents only had the one car, but now that we’re older and both my sister and I also have a car, then it means that one of us is always having to park on the road (usually me, which quite frankly it doesn’t bother me). 

Nooowwwww then... A family moved in down the street probably about 6 months ago or something, haven’t really seen or heard anything about them, only seen the daughters shite parking (I’ll admit I’m not the best either, but at least I know when I’m taking up two spaces lol). So this afternoon my girlfriend was leaving mine and I was heading out somewhere too, so I walked with her to her car before walking to mine further down the street (I’d have parked closer to my house if there were spaces closer etc...). When we were getting closer to her car I could see the bloke who moved in 6 months ago bringing his rubbish bins back up to his house and could faintly hear him grumbling about something. I didn’t really think anything of it until I was talking/saying goodbye to my girlfriend when I could hear him shouting something. When I looked up towards his house he started shouting “are they gonna be there all weekend” and pointed to a couple of work vans (owned by people in the street and usually park there) parked outside the gate leading up to his house. Naturally I was a bit like “well I don’t fucking know” y’know, since they’re not my fucking vans. So once I’d said goodbye and headed to my car, he saw me putting stuff in my boot as he was walking back towards his house (in the time I’d said goodbye, he’d gone down to his car at the end of the street for some unknown reason... probably to just be a prick in a different spot lol) and stopped, asking “is this your car?!”, which in retrospect was a fucking stupid question considering I had the keys in my hand and I was loading up the car....
Now, we’d only been home for about 5 minutes before heading back out, so my car really wasn’t parked where it was for long. Anyway, once he’d found out that was my car and that I lived up the street and wasn’t parked up there, he started giving me loads of shit about how he can never park outside his own house (amen to that, sista) and how his 17 year old daughter has to park ages away (again, in retrospect I don’t have a single clue how the age of his daughter is supposed to determine where she should get to park....). And for some reason he was adamant that one of the work vans was my dads, to which I had to repeatedly tell him that we don’t own a fucking van. He felt the need to inform me of the colours of the cars my family have, which I find slightly concerning that he’s tracking everyone and their cars (especially their colour!) in the street. He rumbled on about some other shit whilst I zoned out but then started walking off and muttered about how he can never park because people are too lazy to park on their drive (baring in mind my sister was parked on the drive at this point...) and that we don’t have any respect. 

Now all of this could’ve just been a case of someone having a bad day and I was in the wrong place at the wrong time and he just took out some frustration on the only person available. 
Now basically, this whole thing has been on my mind all evening and I’ve just been sat here dwelling on things. I could just do with some advice on what to do about the whole situation, like do I just take it on the chin and ignore the cunt if I see him and ignore everything he said? (Which is likely, since were in the same street haha) Or do I take the petty approach and spray paint a reserved parking spot outside his house for him? Lol

If you managed to read through the whole shamble of shite I’ve written above, I apologise again for it dragging on and a mighty big thank you to you!",22Feb2020,1

43,"so I recently moved into a house with a friend of mine and it’s a 3bed/2bath. Her little girl has a room there and she has the master. Rent is $1000/month and the original agreement was to split it 50/50. I’m terrible at negotiating and so I agreed because it’s a nice house and at the time, I felt it was a fair deal. A couple of weeks ago, her boyfriend became her fiancé and now he’s living there as well. So essentially, she’s got two of the three bedrooms, one being the master, and I guess she’s splitting her part of rent with her man.

46," I' m a car guy but my knowledge of buying cars is quite limited as my family only leased cars. So here I am looking for advice. I am going into university next year and I look to get my first car probably driving until I graduate (4 to 6 years). I live in a decently well off middle class family on the higher side of the middle class spectrum. I am looking for a nice car to drive during my years of studying and something that I am not proud of is that, I do care about my appearance (so no lower end cars).

Option 1: Leasing

My parents can afford to buy a new lower end luxury car (ex. Mercedes C class, 3 series) but I find these cars quite boring (only buying for the logo or brand) as they don't offer much performance nor luxury and I can't really finance them because they have poor reliability, so my only options is to lease (paying for depreciation for 4 to 5 years). I don't mind it but I also don't like the fact that I am losing so much money to basically rent a car for 4 to 5 years.

Option 2: Buying used (2 or 3 years old) \*Please give some car recommendations as well

I am not sure but from looking at Autotrader, people tend to overprice their used cars in Canada?

My other option is to a buy a nice used luxury car that is 2 or 3 years old (ex. Mercedes E class, 5 series, A6) that has gone through the greatest of the depreciation curve. The car will still be relatively new but like I mentioned before I can't really keep them long term because of reliability issues but I am going to sell it for a new car anyways after graduating. I really like the luxury and performance these cars offer. This seems like my most preferred option but I am not sure if I will be able sell the used luxury cars (from looking at depreciation data, the percentage depreciation per year decrease quite a lot, potential savings?).

Option 3: Buying used \*keeping for long term

I also like some off-road cars such as the Toyota 4Runner and Lexus GX460. Their performance is garbage but I like their off-road capabilities, big, tall designs and their presence on the road. Though, much of interior is very outdated, which I don't like. Because of their rugged design, they seem like cars that would age very well (also cause Toyota). So, if I go this route, I would keep these cars longer, probably for another 5 or 6 years after buying used.

Any sort of information or guidance would be appreciated. &lt;3",22Feb2020,1

48,"My girlfriend has felt extreme fatigue, constantly sleeping, and generally not able to care for herself. We've been to a plethora of doctors, had her thyroid checked, Endo, Primary, ENT, and she feels no better.

She does have a history with depression and such, but she says that any mental issues are a result from having to feel like this day in and day out. I suffered from severe headaches for years and can understand that, personally.

She's literally at the end of her rope. She can't live like this anymore. She is starting to talk about certain...topics. She WANTS to live though. She WANTS to be able to go to work and do all the things she knows she's capable of.

I've been taking care of her for some time now, and I've always had more ideas. We still have more medical routes to explore, but she is literally at the point where she can't do this anymore, no matter how much I am there for her or help medically and daily.

51,"Hi,

Quick backstory here so you can understand the situation. I have been in the field I am in for about 4 years now, and my career has been on a quick rise ever since. I'm very lucky to have the capacities I have with my short experience.

I'm a lighting designer/board operator and master electrician on live shows. Until October, I was freelance, and a company came at me and offered me a full time job with them. They made a lot of promises, saying they were hiring me because new gear was on the way, and they needed someone with my skills to manage the gear and run their shows. I accepted a lower salary and doing some things that are less interesting to me because I believed in a future with said company.

Well, four months later, not only did the gear never come in, I still don't have the tools to do my job. I have to use my personal laptop, because they won't buy one for me, I'm paying for my licenses for the software I use. Now when I was freelance, this was not a problem, as I was hired with my equipment and would invoice customers with that in mind. When they hired me, they were very clear that things needed a lot of TLC. The lighting department was not doing well, and I was to clean that up. Well, nothing changes, things don't seem to be happening, and I now feel like my career is stagnating.

So far, the part I don't like about the job takes a lot more space than the part I like. I still hope things will change (they've been saying everything should move by the end of March).

I don't want to quit just when things get better, but I also don't want to be stuck there if things do not get better. I kinda feel like dusting off my resume and going to other companies because I want to keep learning and keep being challenged, and at the moment, I'm not challenged and not learning.

Open to any advice!",22Feb2020,1

We had some issues at the end of last year that I won’t get into. I started a new job, and one of my coworkers seemed to be going through something similar in his relationship. We confided in each other and talked a lot. He caught feelings for me and he tried to kiss me twice, but I never let anything happen. He kept telling me he wanted to be with me for the rest of his life, have kids, get married... the whole thing. I was really taken back and tried to shut it down because we only knew each other a month. I didn’t tell my fiancé because I was felt guilty for confiding in this guy.

I have this friend, Kyle (not his real name). He's 13 (I'm 14) and I have him added on Roblox. I don't play often but about a month ago I randomly joined him on Roblox to hang out a bit. Then I saw the girl he was talking to. We'll call her Megan. I joined in the game, and quickly realized that I shouldn't be seeing this. It got a bit more than normal Roblox roleplaying, and eventually Kyle told her to join a discord call. 

Fast forward to earlier today. I joined his game and he was playing in a private server with his roleplaying name as ""\[name\] / 18"". Obviously he wasn't 18, and I switched to a separate Xbox account to join their party. I quickly got kicked but I heard her talking, and it sounds more like a college student than a 13/14 year old like I assumed. 

I think this is highly wrong and I don't know what to think about it. I don't really want to confront him in real life about it unless it's 100% necessary, because this could be potentially embarrassing for him and me. I still don't want to ignore it though, as this could potentially be shady in the legal sense.

60,"Made a lot of mistakes in the last few years and I'm just trying to avoid another. Also I would normally ask irl friends but they're all out of state and I don't really want to burden them with a phonecall about this. Anyway: 

Graduated college in may last year with an art related degree. There are no jobs available in my location involving my skill set, so for the first few months of the job hunt I was looking at remote positions. Got 2 interviews, accepted 1freelance job and turned the other down because I realized moving was unrealistic. 

Over the holidays I picked up a retail job to make some extra $$, since I was starting from scratch. This was supposed to be temporary, but at the end of the season they informed me I would be kept on. At first I was ok with it but the nature of the job changed and now I absolutely hate it.

It's wearing me down mentally. Whenever I'm not there, I'm thinking about the next time I have to go in. I know I work too slow for them and it makes me feel like shit when I can't get everything done. Truthfully I wanted to turn them down when they said I could stay, but my mom convinced me it was a good idea to have an extra income. Also probably important: hours are low and despite me being available all week, I only ever work 6hrs per day fri-sat-sun (I told them I'm unavailable Sundays but they still schedule me). 

Truth is I could probably land an art job in my area if I had time to update my portfolio. However, I'm so depressed from retail (and other shit) that I don't have the energy to work on any personal projects. I'm supposed to be applying to jobs right now but I can't because of my outdated work. 

I tried explaining all this to my mom and she said I was being stupid. ""Some people have to work 3 jobs, you can manage"". Part of me thinks that's a shit mentality, because people shouldn't have to work 3 jobs and I personally don't have the strength/motivation for that. Yet part of me thinks maybe she's right, I need to grow up and realize this is just what being an adult is about.

Some more context: I'm in a privileged situation rn, I don't pay for rent/groceries/gas and my loan payments don't start until next year. There are a few upcoming expenses but I've saved enough to cover them, and other than that there's nothing I would buy. So in my mind I'd be ok until December, and if by that point I still haven't landed a full-time gig I'd get another retail position. Do you think it's ok for me to quit, or do I need to grow up and deal with it? 

TLDR; Got a temporary retail job turned permanent, and I fucking hate it. I want to quit retail to focus on finding a local, full-time position while still bringing in some $$ through a freelance gig. Mom thinks I'm an idiot and I should just suck it up, and part of me agrees which is why I'm conflicted.

67,"First some backstory: We live 16 people at my dorm with a pretty even split of guys and gals and all share a kitchen with a couch and a TV. Since I’ve lived here a long time, I have ended up taking charge of a bunch of things in the past and recently found myself doing it again, as new people moved in and dishes have been piling up in the kitchen. Also, the guy who said he wanted to be responsible (Bob) wasn’t taking charge and doing anything about it. Because of this I called a kitchen meeting which I wanted to host in two weeks.

Now, because we were arguing in the group chat, a girl decided to move it up. She posted a poll on Facebook and the meeting ended up being held the day after. Now, I didn’t really have time to prepare, so I figured there wasn’t much point in figuring out if Bob or the girl who called the meeting were going to host, but this kind of confusion is sort of symptomatic of the mostly flat structure we have. I guess nobody really wants to be responsible.

Now to the meat of the story: on Saturday I went and partied with some colleagues and I discovered from Facebook that my dorm-mates were partying at home. As I was the one with the kitchen duty that week, which means I have to clean during the week, but also before passing the duty (a physical piece of paper, pinned to your door-frame) to the next person on Sunday - that made me a little worried. As it turns out there was reason to worry, because when I stepped into the kitchen on Sunday utterly hungover and still a bit drunk, I notice the floor looking horrible. I mean the whole place looked like shit, but the floor was what jumped out at me. Probably also because I really don’t like washing it. That’s also why the first thing out of my mouth, directed at two of my friends out there who attended the party was: “would you please clean the floor?” A confused conversation follows, all parties hungover, but I leave the conversation believing I have convinced these guys to wash the floor, so I don’t have to.

Two days later I end up pinning the kitchen duty on my neighbor's door without doing the rest, because the floor still hasn’t been cleaned and I didn’t see a reason to really get into it before I knew I could give the duty to the next person with a somewhat clean kitchen. But since I kind of got scolded for not just giving the duty to the next person last time, I decided to turn it over now and do my part of the cleaning later (as my sleep schedule is fucked anyway, I wanted to do it at night). I of course forget to clean, and all hell breaks loose on the public chat-group. My neighbor who I passed the duty to (Amy) has no idea it came from me. She’s publicly complaining and posting pictures of the places in the kitchen she thinks should have been cleaned before passing the duty to her. Another girl (Mary) who really has no business pointing fingers at other people, start mocking the person (me) who should have cleaned. Me being flustered but keeping a level head apologize and defend myself by saying I forgot and was waiting for people to clean the floor but decided to pass the duty on anyway.

Now things get even worse. Bob basically just says that it’s tough luck I get the duty on a “party week” and the party goers must clean the kitchen when they’re done partying but leave the floor. Also, according to him: “let’s be honest you didn’t really do a good job cleaning during the week”. I mean… I think he’s wrong. Some things are added that are neither here nor there and I just end up concluding the conversation with: “I just disagree about the floor. I left on Saturday to go party and the floor was dirty but not bad. When I came home again it looked like shit :) plain and simple. There are still a couple of cans and a shot glass under the table. Just clean up after yourselves.” Some guy adds that he agrees with me, and that’s it before the meeting is called on the next day.

Surprise, surprise - I get to host the meeting. 13 people out of 16 turn up, so that’s amazing. The meeting goes great for about an hour. I feel like we’re being productive, all the heavy issues are handled. Bob is visibly high, but I’m still kind of surprised that he isn’t taking charge, which leaves it up to me.

Before the very end of the meeting I try to bring up the floor issue. I stumble my way through some kind of intro, saying something like: “for the last thing we have the floor issue, which I admit, I’m not sure if it’s making to much of a deal out of it. I thought about it and I guess I wouldn’t mind cleaning it. But we still need to decide whether the floor needs to be cleaned after a party by the party goers.”

Now Bob takes over and starts talking about how we all need to pitch in (I agree), but if you can’t clean the kitchen at least once during your duty, you’re a lazy asshole…” I cut him off and state that I clean up all the time… Which I do every day, not thoroughly, but little things. Mary now interjects that I should clean the floor because during our movie nights in December she had to clean up after us leaving popcorn in the couch. At first, I have no idea what she’s referring to and it takes some guesses before it comes out that she means in December, not recently. I state that it seems she agrees with me then – people should clean up after themselves. She just keeps going on about how the floor isn’t even that dirty in a mocking tone, obviously miffed and that she’s had to clean up after other people all the time. I’m still confused. Amy chimes in with something I didn’t quite get but sounded like the issue being ""you just EXPECT people to clean up after themselves"". I mean, yeah kinda? Now Bob and another guy start pouring shots, yelling and effectively ruining the meeting. People start rummaging around, making too much noise for me to carry on a conversation with Mary. After some yelling a vote is cast that the kitchen duty is not responsible for the floor.

I'm actually upset after talking to Bob, Amy and Mary, so I stay quiet while everybody agrees that we should be nice to each other and thanks for the meeting. Bob is jumping around all excited. I'm thinking that I have to put my foot down about how they treated me, but how? Should I just go up to them and tell them how I feel? I end up going up to Mary who's sitting alone in the couch now, intending to make a joke of picking up those couple of cans under the table/couch which are still there. Instead my voice sounds hostile when I say: ""See I clean up too..."" she answers with: ""is that supposed to make you seem smart? Or are you doing it because you couldn't handle the truth?"" Unfortunately I go on: ""You calling me out like that, Mary, is fucked up"". I would agree with anyone calling this exchange childish and I regret it. She storms out of the kitchen.

Now what bothers me, is that after this, Bob is pretending like we’re friends and I’m honestly so disappointed and angry at the guy calling me out like that. I always try to treat people with respect, I would never call someone out in public and shame them for doing a bad job or being neglectful. I try to foster an atmosphere of understanding, respect and conflict de-escalation. I avoid bad-mouthing people, all that jazz. I’m also studying to be a teacher, so I have some knowledge about leading, but not much experience.

I realize the problem here is communication and I’m supposed to deal with these things in a level-headed manner, but I don’t know what to do with this anger. I’m effectively still in a conflict with Mary and paranoid thoughts are telling me that Bob is just being nice outwardly and Amy I’m worried about as well. I want to put my foot down, but I also want to be constructive. Anger tells me to be destructive. What should I do?",22Feb2020,1

So, now I'm not sure what to do. Last Thursday, I sent her a simple valentine day's gift (a candy bag with a card saying that I'm hoping that everything is going well and that she is doing alright). Immediately she messaged me asking if I wanted to go to see a show with her family. I agreed to it and we ended up chatting a lot on Friday. Saturday came and I met her whole family for once. We ended up having even more conversation mainly about how we loved the show so much and that we couldn't wait to see it. I was having probably the best time that I had in a while, since I was never treated to go out to go anywhere.

Later after we gotten back to our dorm, we hung out for couple more hours with her family and by the time her family was about to leave, she said she needed to sleep so she could be up for work, so we said our good nights and all of that. I messaged her later that night saying that I had a lot of fun and I really enjoyed the day with her and her family. She never responded back and on daily basis whenever I see her in the lobby of the dorm or in the hallway between classes, she barely glanced at me or even say anything. It's almost as if she's ghosting me or something and it threw my feelings all over the place. 

I've recently decided to leave her alone for a time being and let her come to me on her own, but my friend said that I'm giving her too many chances since she has been avoiding me entirely before the valentine day and after the show. I'm working on trying to pull my shit together but I really would like to have some sort of advices. I want to get a straight answer from her without beating the bushes, but I am trying so hard to not to get in touch with her so she would have the space that she needs. 

Anything would helps even a little.

69,"So I met this girl and we went out on a date. Feelings were there, everything was going good.i asked for what she was looking for the first date and she said ""I dont want a bf rn but if it happens it happens"". We kept going on dates bc I felt the same way, I dont want a relationship tomorrow , i just want to see where it goes.
However, we started to flirt a lot and I met her around valentine's day so I got her something, to keep my intentions alive. My intentions are ""I see you as a friend, but i have interest in you that can lead to potential bf and gf but when were both ready"". She felt the same way. 
Now this week she starts to distant herself, and I feel different vibes coming from her. She tells me long story short... it's not you it's me. I like you and I think you're a very good person. You're so nice to me but I dont think I'm ready to date someone. I'd like to be friends still that way I know theres no rush"". I mean it's not like I asked her to be my gf so idk where this came from. I'm stuck now she basically told me to back off with being so loving. Even though all I did was give her thoughtful presents, help her when she needs it, compliment her, pay when we eat, hold the door. 
I feel like nice guys really finish last. What do I do? Should I take all the special things I do for her away and treat her like a normal person and not a priority just so she can see what she has in front of her?",22Feb2020,1
70,"Accepted a new job at a fantastic company in my industry that pays very well and has an excellent all around reputation. I was brought on as one of the younger (if not youngest) ones at my level which was exhilarating at first, but now it’s becoming stressful trying to acclimate to the culture and experience of everyone around me. Used to be a rockstar at my last company... now I’m on the bottom of the totem pole for sure as everyone is extremely high functioning process driven savants 

There was minimal onboarding as I was expected to just accept the workload and jump right into things. That was fine by me for the most part, but now it’s becoming stressful as more projects are being assigned. I’m trying to slow things down and just breathe every once in a while, but with so many meetings and then so little time to get things done, I find myself blinking and then the days over. I don’t even have time to glance at my phone or pee during the day because I am so consumed with work.

I guess I am just trying to find a way to be more efficient, as there are times when I’m anxious and stressed where I have brain fog and cannot concentrate. Coupled with recent voice hoarseness I have been experiencing (no idea where it’s coming from but it’s been off and on for a year now), I have become extremely anxious during meetings. It’s common around here to be asked to assemble something and present the next day (whereas there were virtually no surprises at my last company).

Propranolol helps the anxiety, especially since I am expected to present or talk at nearly every meeting, but the voice weakness still remains. This in turn revamps anxiety. I also am prescribed Vyvanse which helps me get motivated and tackle the many projects I have going on and clears the brain fog, but it drains my energy when it wears off and carries to the next day.

I’m in a niche field and love what I do and get paid incredibly well. It just feels as if all the stress is piling up at one time so I’m wondering how to be more relaxed in my day to day activities.",22Feb2020,1

81,"I *\[27M\]* currently live at the family house (*including my mother \[62F\] and siblings \[29F, 25F, 23M\], house currently owned by eldest sister*). I used to be independent since I was 21 but due to many issues, I had no other option until I'm back on my feet again (I don't know when I will).

I am an atheist and my family is pretty religious, from a Muslim background. I haven't come out because the outcome could be disastrous, and you can say that I also want to avoid being thrown out. Anyway, our mindset isn't the same. I used to refuse to talk about certain topics all together because of how much superstition and ignorance my family throws into the discussion, especially when I lived by my own, but now I'm stuck with them, and I am tired of constantly hearing it. I'll try report what I feel while not breaking rule 5.

To give you a gist of what I'm talking about, I can't but listen to so many superstitions, like being lectured not to stay in the bathroom for too long at night because of supernatural harmful beings lurking in there. If I'm not lectured, then I'm not supposed to object to things I find too superstitious, because their argument is that ""people are saying this stuff"", or ""clerics lecture about that stuff"", or ""this is mentioned in our religion"" (most often it's not). When the topic of religion or sexuality is brought up (I am also gay and in the closet), I try not to talk as much as possible, but if I'm not reminded about saying religious ""charms"" in certain situations, and then getting lectured about not saying them in past situations where I was stuck/harmed/sad, then I have to listen to a lot of religious self-serving arguments which annoy the shit out of me, especially when it's factually incorrect, or discriminatory, or just plain stupid. 

I called them ""a stupid lot"" on two occasions, because I felt cornered, and got accused of being a know-it-all (which they always say while interrupting me for trying to correct something). Once we were talking about curses and ghosts, and another when watching Interstellar (and hearing stuff like you wouldn't believe).

They know that I am too rational for stuff that doesn't require reason, such as faith, and sometimes they try to warn me of not going that ""path"" (the one that leads to atheism, and hell). If you were me, how would you deal with this? anyone is/has been in a similar situation?",22Feb2020,1

My best friend ever and I have “lost our spark.” She did something within her relationship that  has nothing to do with me, but was something that made me think of her totally different and like I had no idea who she was.

93,"This is a long long ass story. Life was in fact flipped turned upside down.

Summary at the bottom if you dont want to read my rant. Sorry I have a lot of spent up s hj it  and also I'm hiding the fact my dad lives with me other than a few people.

So for the last 6 years, my dad (M61) was dating a woman, who me and my sister hated because she was in our opinion overly controlling and definitely in the mental/emotional abuse realm. She also had a lot of control over him because she has money, and he doesnt really have money. My dad works at a grocery store, and is also a musician. He started feeling like he wasnt wanted anymore and lots of other problems with her. He has been debating on leaving but has no money or anywhere to go.

More backstory, my dad owns a house, but didnt pay the mortgage for many years. After some time he got a deal for a lower monthly mortgage payment, and started renting it out to be able to pay the mortgage. Without these renters he would not be able to afford living in his own house, which is from 1912 and hasn't been well taken care of in the last 30 years because no money. He has been debating finishing the basement so he can still rent out the rest of the house and have a place to live. He started clearing out all of the old items and taking down some walls. Again, this doesn't go far because no money. 

In September, my dad said that his girlfriend didnt want him anymore and needed somewhere to go. I (F24) just recently (july) bought my own house with my boyfriend. He said he only needed a little bit more time to work on the basement to be able to live in it, so I let him stay on our couch for a few days. My boyfriend was absolutely not okay with this, but it's my dad, what else can I do. You can see where this goes. He works on the house all day after work and comes home, and I'm thinking hes getting places with this basement. Not so much and it started to slow down. While this first chunk of time went on, he was miserable. Crying a lot, trying desperately to get her back so he can move back in. I tried to help as much as I can both with the basement and emotionally, but theres only so much I can do. At one point he just stopped going to the basement to work on it because he didnt have the energy or the mindset to work on it. And I get it, he's an older man that was living with his girlfriend who he loved and his life is now a mess. Its just not gonna get him anywhere. At this point we move him into the room that is full of boxes (again we just moved in) and a futon. 

October hits. He had stage 1 aggressive prostate cancer. And he has to start hormone therapy treatment and get radiation. The hormone therapy was really messing with him noth physically and emotionally, making his mindset even worse. I spoke to him in December to tell him that January 31st was going to be the day he needs to move out by which was decided by both my boyfriend and I (I'm crying during this whole time speaking with my dad). He asks if it can wait  until the radiation is over which should be in mid february. I say okay. 


At some point in all this, we moved him into a spare room in my basement so I can start unpacking the room he was staying in, working on it, and moving into my house. It's just a bedroom, so were sharing a kitchen and a bathroom with him, which isnt easy. He wasnt a perfect guest. Would be on phone calls on speaker for hours, play loud videos on his phone, sulk and cry in the livingroom, which made it uncomfortable for both me and my boyfriend. My boyfriend hated every second of this, but just kept dealing with it. 

Late January, my boyfriend is kind of sick of my dad, and has a conversation with him that he needs to leave by mid february (since that's when radiation was supposed to be done) and that's it. My dad doesnt take this well and they get into a bit of an argument. All while I'm at work. They both call and text me. My dad hasn't even started radiation yet. I agree with my boyfriend that well make February 29th the deadline, which would be 6 months since he moved in. I text my dad  a long message about how 6 months is as long as we can and that this timing is hard, but he has a month and this will be the (not great) source of motivation to get his basement done since he hasn't worked on it since early October. He said okay. 

Here we are at a week before hes supposed to leave. And I dont know the status of his basement. I am scared to speak to him because I am a child with no backbone towards my dad and hates confrontation. I feel like shit kicking him out right before hes supposed to start radiation (he starts the first week of march), but it needed to be done or else my boyfriend might lose his shit plus this has been very taxing on me and my boyfriend and our relationship. I dont know how to tell him he needs to leave. I dont want him to live in his car, and he doesnt really have another place to move into. 

**Summary**
My dad was in a bad relationship. Wants to leave but nowhere to go. Wants to fix basement in his house, needs time so he move into my new house supposedly for a few days. Days, week, months. He finds out he has stage 1 prostate cancer. No more work on basement. Sadness and not a great person to live with. Boyfriend hates my dad living with us. Gave him a deadline, deadline extended for after radiation ends. Boyfriend tells dad to leave when radiation was supposed to end, but he hadn't started yet. We give him until feb 29, which would be 6 months of him living with us, radiation starts right after the kick out would be. I dont know how to kick him out and feel like garbage about all of this.

94,"Reposted from r/getstudying as I figured it fits better here. I am in need for some support and tips to tackle my study situation. I recently started my master's degree after a year studying abroad with basically just taking simple courses that were not very relevant for my degree. Now I discover that I'm lacking some background knowledge and my academic confidence is at the bottom. I took some master courses last semester: one went fine, one better than expected and the last one, although such a great course with excellent professors, went terrible for me, mostly due to an extremely low academic self confidence. It got to the point where on the last day I got so anxious in class that I had to run out of the room so no one would see me crying. I ended up not finishing the course. I also notice, that I'm very anxious when I'm working on my master thesis or talking with my supervisors (despite my supervisors are the best I could hope for). It makes it impossible to concentrate and actually get work done. 

I have tried figuring out how I act and feel and why I act and feel this way. This is what I've found so far:
- I am very insecure of my knowledge.
- I have dificulties expressing my knowledge.
- I am lacking knowledge, but so are my peers! 
- I don't like asking for help.
- I don't like showing I don't understand things.
- I want to be one of the mass. I don't mind asking questions in a large class, but I have trouble doing the same in smaller classes or one on one.
- I have a harder time asking people that know me (such as my supervisors), than strangers (general professors).
- I feel like I should be an expert on my project, even though I have just started and I depend on help from supervisors.
-When I study thesis-related stuff I become sad and unfocused and feel like a failure. Which makes it difficult to actually learn more, creating a bad spiral and making me feel like I will never be able to do this master, and if I do, come out of the other end with a life-lasting depression. 

I am currently taking new courses and I'm terrified I will have a mental breakdown in class. Even worse, some classes are weeks of fieldwork, meaning program from 8 am to 8 pm and shared bedrooms. So there's really no space to calm down if hell breaks loose. Like wtf do I do if I start crying on the first day and I have two weeks more with the same people and zero confidence? If I start crying I know it will be hard to stop, it's plausible I end up crying for two weeks, which will make it utterly pointless being in the course as I will not be able to concentrate on anything, not to mention extremely humiliating. 

I would love some insights on this. Thanks for reading! Hugs!",22Feb2020,1

Anyway, I’ve had a HUUUUUUUGE crush on this girl for quite some time now, and it’s not just my hormones getting the best of me. She’s sweet, smart, and reeeaaallly cute. The only problem is, she’s waaaayy out of my league. 

Don’t get me wrong. I used to talk to her a bit. But things just sorta... changed. I don’t know what happened, but it’s like I hardly exist to her anymore. Seeing her around and remembering how things used to be just makes me feel as if my heart is breaking into a million pieces. 

I’ve tried approaching her on multiple occasions, but the people around just see me as some desperate loser. She’s this really popular girl with TOOONNS of dudes going after her, and I’m just some quiet background character that everyone couldn’t care less about, which I never really understood. As far as I know, I’m a pretty cool dude. I’m fairly attractive, and have a good build as well.

It’s not that I’m just trying to get noticed by her again, but I just wish that she’d come back into my life, and maybe even play a bigger role. It was really nice having her for that short period of time, and it’s something that I feel I don’t have to let go of.

I can’t give up. There’s not many others like her, nowadays. I want to reignite that spark without coming across as desperate. I need some help. Any ideas?",22Feb2020,1
98,"Here’s the scoop. Married for close to a decade, not super happy. Couple kids I’m nuts about. An employee who reports to me is about 10 years apart in age, not a big deal, and is in a relationship. We get along great, joke around constantly, have great conversations, and overall mesh really well; I’m thinking about her constantly and haven’t felt this way in years- pretty sure I’m falling for her. Like.. hard. 

Neither of us have ever spoke about feelings. Although I’ve been a tiny bit flirty, probably not enough to tip myself off. I know she respects the hell out of me, enjoys being around me, likes to chat/joke with me, but I’m also her boss- so she’s probably supposed to be doing all that. 

What the heck do I do? Feels like without mutual feelings, it’s a career killer. Family killer. Ugh. But how do I find out where her heads at?

She constantly vapes and Juuls despite me telling her it’s bad and illegal bcus of her age. She tells me to fuck off and always talks back to my mom and is just so naughty. She leaves a mess in the kitchen, throws her things everywhere and is basically acting like she’s 3. She is also seeing this older guy (I think 18?) who she sees and has sex with. He also has cheated on her and I always voice to my mom and her how disgusting that is. My other sister (16) came home from school to them fucking bcus 14yo didnt go to school and brought him to ours..She lies to my mom and says she’s with her girl friends, but I have caught her lying multiple times. I always get mad at her and tell her off, and my mom usually doesn’t believe me because she was a really welk behaved kid before, but now she sees Im right and calls my sister out.

102,"I used to love playing League of Legends (LoL) a lot when I used to have lots of uninterrupted free time for a maximum of one hour. That was 4 years ago, which means I don't play LoL anymore because I got tired from being interrupted mid-game and getting an AFK warning.

Now unto the main problem; I befriended a Japanese, which means that we could have similar interests because both of us enjoy video games, anime stuff, random Japan stuff, and she also likes LoL and plays the game daily, but I quit the game 2 years ago even though I still follow their Instagram updates, champion releases and important events (Well, MVs and Worlds concerts). Everyday, in school, almost all what she likes talking about is LoL, from what was her experience the day before, buffs/nerfs, animations, music covers, etc, and I am a person who gets easily bored from repitition, and no matter how many times I said I don't follow up with gameplay stuff nor do I play the game anymore, she will still persist on talking about it, even if I am showing subtle disinterest in listening about LoL.

I have been concealing my bottle and its contents with humor, positivity and general goofiness. But I have noticed a few cracks (symptoms) on my proverbial bottle.

We have only been together in person over two separate trips. The first time was me visiting a friend and the second was when he bought us concert tickets out where he lived. Halfway through the year and a half he ghosted me because he started dating some girl. We still sometimes conversed but pretty much barely. The relationship didn't last long and he actually talked to me about her acting shady and asking me advice on how to end it. After that we got back into our thing of being pretty much in love with each other. That is when the second trip came along. During that 2nd trip things have never felt more serious before. He confessed to me on how much I mean to him and that he doesn't usually feel this way about others. During the concert he would serenade me with all the lyrics that had anything to do with loving someone else. We couldn't stop being obsessed with each other. Even when talking to his mom she wouldn't stop going on about how much he talks about me and how excited he was for me to visit when I was with just her. After leaving then the fire was like nothing else. I thought this time it could actually become serious. Though the distance was threatening and I think that is what kept him from actually making something out of us. I almost went to continue school out west partly for him but it was way to expensive and the best decision was to stay over where I lived. A couple months after the trip he started talking to me a bit less. I bought him concert tickets so he could visit me this time but he wasn't able to get off work. After that it just died. A couple weeks after I went to that concert with a friend instead of him it was just silent. He stopped talking to me. This was the time I was finally going to get over him. This was over a year ago. Though, I still dream about him, and a part of me has never had any closure. I am happily in a relationship with someone I love. I have no interest in going back to him but a part of me still wants to know why. I thought about going to his hometown to events I know he goes to every year just to see if we would run into each other to see if I can get the closure I need. What do you guys think? I feel terrible for still having this part of me long for closure when I should have been completely moved on pretty early. It bothers my consciousness more than it should. No person has ever stuck in my head this long where I still wonder about them today. I do not know what to do. I can not contact him in any way so that is not an option. (He did not block me but I have blocked him and also deleted his number so whoops) I have had this stuck in my own mind for the longest time and I couldn't bring myself to tell any of my friends even though they have been there with me through all of it.

115,"I’m F21 and she is F23. 

Short version: she has a history of poor mental health and is currently wasting her youth away taking ket with her rich boyfriend in the hopes to one day make millions with him. 

Long version: She has been depressed forever, as far back as I can remember. She had/has serious anxiety, bulimia from ages 15-20, has multiple cosmetic surgery (despite being extremely beautiful naturally), used to cut herself as a young teenager. She started taking drugs at 15 when she started going to raves and has since been on and off drug addiction. She took out her anger at life by using me as a punching bag and screaming at my parents throughout my teenage life. Surprisingly (based on the atmosphere my sister carried during that decade), I’m a generally very happy person.

She had a series of boyfriends, but all were just ‘sugar daddies’ who loved my sister because she is beautiful and she only wanted their money. 

My sister has difficulty sustaining any relationship. She never really had any friends... all eventually become ‘bitches’ according to her. And romantic relationships turning somewhat abusive (as in my sister treats her bfs like trash). 

Currently she is dating an extremely wealthy Chinese guy, but he is extremely stingy with his/his parents money, and my sister doesn’t like that. But moreover his level of education is appalling... he proudly says he slept through school and whilst studying bussiness at university, he paid for other people to do his work and take his exams. 
My sister finished a masters in chemical engineering last year, but since then has not been doing anything. 

My sister and her current boyfriend moved into my parents home last autumn only to achieve absolutely nothing. Their day goes like this: they wake up at mid day. Have some breakfast. Maybe go to the gym. And then in the evening they take ket or smoke weed. She keeps telling me about her grand plans to make her millions, but then they never do anything. She is relying on the hope that she will get access to his family fortune (I’m convinced this will not happen since his Chinese family don’t even accept his white gf as remotely serious.). 

whenever I come home, I can just see her depression and I’m very worried. She wants to break up with him but then is scared at the thought of having to work like a normal person, which to some extent I understand since she really has been surrounded by wealthy people since 17. She has become completely unmotivated, with sporadic business plans without any execution. 

In my opinion having such a lazy bf who completely relies on their parents for money is a really bad influence on my sister and is stopping her from reaching her full potential as she’s basically hoping on him for work opportunities with his family (I am doubtful this will genuinely happen, especially with Corina virus now making it impossible for her to travel to China any time in near future) 

However, despite my sisters rudeness/bullying (she constantly belittles him and calls him stupid) he’s able to keep a smile on his face and just waves it off. My parents, for this reason, really want them to stay together as they believe it’s very difficult to find someone who is able to deal with my sister’s attitude. 

I don’t know what to do. I already told her multiple times that I think she should leave him, and she herself wants to leave. But nothing of it. She has hinted that she is sinking into a depression, and frankly it’s obvious. 

What can I do?",22Feb2020,1

I’ve had a crush on this guy for 2 years. It started in 8th grade in art when we used to flirt and touch and stuff like that. One day he snap chatted me and told me I was cute. Me, a dumbass, didn’t say anything back. When I got back to school later, he had left to be admitted into a psychiatric hospital for about 2-3 weeks. I didn’t see him. When he came back, we continued to flirt and stuff. He always flirted with other girls, that was his personality. Then, he left again for the hospital, and I didn’t see him at all. When he got back, he talked a little bit then began to ignore me slowly. We completely stopped talking around April/May. I never saw him that summer. 9TH GRADE. We have not talked at all. BUT I have seen him around the hallways. Every time I see him I always catch his eyes and his stare. My (sorta) friend is close with him and his friends so I started to hang out with her. I would literally always catching him looking at me. But it kinda looks like a death stare. But to be fair, he always looks mad. I saw him at theatre after school painting something (because his sister is a leader), and all he did was stare. And he didn’t look away when I returned his stare. Anyways, today, I saw him hugging a girl that my friend (the one that is friends with him and I’m sorta friends with) said he liked 2 months ago BUT she never liked him. It looked very personal and couple-like. Ngl, it hit me hard. He’s always first to see my stories, too. I really want to talk to him again, because I miss him a lot. But I can never tell if he ACTUALLY likes me or hates me? I’m so confused..",22Feb2020,1
125,"Hello all. For context, over the past 10 years I’ve struggled on and off with intense feelings of depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation. Throughout my life I’ve had to overcome some difficult circumstances, through which I’ve noticed a pattern of: have problem, struggle through problem, aim towards and eventually achieve happiness.

As of the past month, these feelings have returned. In the past, no matter what, things have always been tangible for me - as if there was a clear path of ‘do x, y and z and all will be well eventually’, whereas now there’s...nothing. I just feel so incredibly low, anxious and hopeless for no real reason.

I’m not a stagnant person. I go to the gym 4 times a week, I work weekends, and I talk to at least one of my friends every day. I see family constantly and have several positive major life events coming up. My sleep pattern is average and I eat clean. Because of all this, I feel as though I have zero reason to feel as I do.

Recently I’ve begun to feel anywhere between empty and intensely self destructive. I’ve held off on any major self harm, though the urge to harm myself is definitely there. I haven’t been able to get out of bed until the afternoon and haven’t left the house in over a week for anything but the gym. For the first time in over a year I’ve started to have regular panic attacks out of the blue, too. I feel as though I’m alone, even when I’m around people. I feel as though friendly teasing is genuine and that everyone around me hates me. It doesn’t help that, due to work/school obligations I don’t get to see many of my friends regularly anymore. I’m left in the house alone a lot and the silence is almost painful sometimes. When friends turn me down when I try to ‘fill’ my house, even for valid reasons, it leaves me feeling completely abandoned/unwanted (through no fault of theirs’).

It doesn’t help that, in the past, I’ve caused my mum a lot of grief over my mental health. I’ll never forget the sound of her crying down the phone to me after I wound up in hospital over my most serious attempt. I dread to put her through that again but I can feel myself slowly spiralling into the same patterns I’ve been in before. I don’t want to burden my friends with this, as I’ve put them through enough. 

I suppose I’m asking for advice as to what to do now. Do I wait for things to pass/clear up enough to for me to figure them out on my own? Or do I go down the medical route once more? (Though I feel as though I’m not deserving of it, at least this time around.)

Thank you for reading, I’m sorry if this isn’t the right place to post - if there’s somewhere better suited please let me know.",22Feb2020,1
126,"What would you think if you were me? (Long post warning, sorry!)

24(F) living on my own. I have lived in a couple places throughout the downtown area of my city for a while now, and have never been overly concerned about my safety even in the sketchier parts of town. I should also say that I’m not paranoid in the least. I often have friends reminding me to be careful on my own, as I tend to give everyone the benefit of the doubt. Anyway, I moved 6 months ago to a better part of town, on a quiet street with mostly elderly folks. 
The beginning:
My next door neighbor 65(M) was doing yard work the day I moved in, and I went over to introduce myself. We chatted for over an hour (well, he chatted and I listened) and he never looked me in the eye. He told me all about his past and his wife’s past (from being raised in foster homes and experiencing abuse to a long list of personal achievements). I figured he was just a bit socially awkward but I was happy to meet him.
Months 1 - 4:
My job requires that I’m able to leave at any hour on a moments notice. Neighborguy looks out his window (each time requires pulling back curtains and opening blinds) and watches me leave/return. Figured he was just a bored retired guy. By month 3 I am looking back at him to make sure he knows I see him watching, and he quickly closes blinds. Month 4 when I look back at him, he just continues staring.
He also began cutting my grass every two days (?!) and shoveling snow off my back porch (I live in a single family home and the back porch has a full staircase to the top of it). I have thanked him and let him know that it isn’t necessary, but he keeps doing it. It wouldn’t creep me out so much normally, but while he’s doing those things, he’s obviously straining to look up at my windows.
Month 5 - present
Neighborguy’s mother passed away and he left a note on my back door (not front door or mailbox, but all the way up on my back porch) two pages long detailing his mom’s life/death and upcoming services. I walked over a sympathy card and again he would not make eye contact. Since the sympathy card, on top of everything previously listed, he has been continuing to walk notes over to my back door (he waits until I leave) every two or three days. Each one details something random and seems relatively harmless but he is so persistent.

Anyway. There’s pretty much all of it. For the sake of giving me some peace of mind, could y’all let me know what you would think if you were in my situation? Thanks in advance!",22Feb2020,1

My mentor set up an invite to meet with 5 people while I am there, and they are all managers of the group. I plan on taking resumes because I feel like this is basically an interview. What I don't know, however is how to ask about transferring. Do I ask if there is a job already posted? Do I ask when I should apply? I cannot move until June so its not like I can just ""jump.""

137,"Throwaway because I don’t wanna this to be linked to my main. Also, english is not my language so pardon my mistakes.

I’ll be 26 in march and I have no college degree. I have no networking, and I have zero experience in the job market, I’d never had a “real” job in my life. I have zero marketable skills, honestly I have zero skills at all, marketable or not. I have no social skills, (and yes, I have Friends, but I ghosted them all because I am really ashamed to be a college dropo ut) Also I have zero discipline and I give up really easy. Like, for example, I was getting excited to learn english so maybe I could work as a translator or teacher or something related but my excitement for it went away and without that excitement I couldn’t concentrate in study. I am a mess and I have zero control over my life because I am 100% dependant on my parents. Currently I work in the family bussines, which is basically retail, and they paid me my salary, but they don’t allow me to spend my money in the things I want, just the things they want. I haven’t learn to drive yet, and my mom made a light hearted comment about how she doubted I could ever learn, it was just once but it has been stuck with me till today, so my mind is really weak. I see no point on learning anything because I know I will drop out and never be able to master anything. I’m super sad with my situation, but I feel like I’m gonna be like this forever because I lack discipline and passion and I am really sleepy and tired all the time. 

Yes, I went to the phychiatrist 5 times on 2019, he didn’t diagnose me (well he actually kind of did? But he said it was depression, but I’m not sure if his diagnosis was real because I only went 5 sessions with him, and also I pretty much vented about suicidal thoughs back then, so I feel like depression is the pretty obvious thing anyone would say). He gave me antidepressants and sleep pills and that he would often change, some of them worked, some of them didn’t. The last sesión he gave me a medicine that is for ADHD, but he never told me if I had ADHD or not, he just told me that those ADHD pills would help me to concentrate, and well, those pills worked for a while and then suddenly didn’t. My mother got pissed that the phychiatrist was just giving me medication without any sort of “talk” or something like that, so she forbide me to come to him again (and since she was the one who was paying for it I didn't had a say on the matter)

Idk what to do, I really want to go to a psycologist this time but idk if my “problems” are worthy or not, I am super ashamed of myself, and super ashamed to open up to people. 

I wish I could be independent, working in a place that don’t belongs to my family, I wish I could socialize again and have peers (the family bussines is so small I’m the only employee, so I’m all by myself from 8am to 5pm, and then I just go home to sleep). I want to be a real adult, I want to drive, have or rent my own place and spend my salary in things I want. But I honestly don’t feel capable, I’m so tired and I’m so afraid to fail. Which makes me so sad because I see my old friends, people my age or younger living normal lifes while I got stucked in adolescence.

(Btw, I’m a woman and I live in a 3 world country, idk if this info is relevant but I’m putting it in case your curious)

Any advice or insight you could give me would be very much apreciated, since I have no one I can confide all of this, and this situation is eating me alive. Thank you and sorry for the crappy english.",22Feb2020,1
138,"I love both sets of grandparents but like my maternal grandparents are kind of difficult to be around for long periods of time. One grandma is a retired social worker and the other grandma is an r/iamreallysmart type but in old lady form so they like to try to get into these deep conversations and overanalyze everything I say and read things into it that aren't there. Like they're fine for short periods of time, but after a few days of staying with them it's exhausting.

To contrast, my paternal grandparents are warm and loving but don't get as deep. As a result hanging out with them is a lot more relaxing and I feel like I can have a nice conversation with them without them trying to read between the lines and figure out the hidden meaning in what I'm saying.

As a result of this as I've gotten older I've naturally gravitated to my paternal grandparents more-so than my other ones. I still try to keep in touch and go visit my other grandparents sometimes but I just can't stand to be there too much.

I have a compensation review coming up and I’d more or less decided that if they won’t give me close to the “a lot” I plan to ask for, I’ll quit.

Well, my best friend at the company - and someone with whom I’ve done my most valuable and meaningful work here - got fired today. I’m so angry for her I want to flip the table and leave...but I also know that losing her makes it much more likely I’ll get the promotion and raise I ask for, because I’m the only person left who can fill the knowledge gap she’ll leave. This isn’t hypothetical, either: I outright asked the CEO for the title I want today, and we sketched out a plan to get me exactly that. 

(Of course, now I know he was planning to fire my friend today, so he was probably relieved to hear I wanted a role in that department.)

So what do I do? Do I support my friend, quit in protest, and be a much happier person, even if I have to dig into my savings for a while? Or do I keep fighting for that promotion, knowing that I’m taking over my friend’s role and that my job will get twice as hard because of it, but making the kind of money that could let me get out for good in a few years?

I am a 23 year old college student in the US. I’ve been a full time student up until this last semester started (January). I’ve gone to part time student, and got a part time job as a hostess at a chain restaurant. 

I do legitimately like the job. It’s easy, close to where I live, and pays enough to have some extra spending money. However, they started giving me FULL TIME hours after only 2 weeks there. I admit I freaked out a little bit. So I asked for 2 days off in a row (it’s uncommon to get those) which I was granted last week. 

I had Saturday and Sunday off, was supposed to show up for a shift on Monday. I didn’t. I legitimately started having a panic attack while getting ready and I chickened out of even calling them. They called me asking where I was, never returned the call. Next day, same thing. Missed my shift, I got a call from my manager on his personal cell asking if I was okay. Didn’t respond.

That leads to today, my third No Call No Show, I figured they would’ve just fired me by now tbh. But the manager who called seemed legitimately concerned, asked if I was coming back, and to please give him a call as soon as I can.

I feel like shit. I feel like a human garbage bin. I’ve abandoned a job I liked because of stupid fucking anxiety, and I don’t even have the guts to call and tell them.

I guess as of me typing this I’m not fired, since they asked if I was coming back.

162,"I am in college and work as a private tutor. My clients always seem to short-change me by giving me less than what I asked for in the beginning. Example: I charge $50 (2nd lesson) and they give me $40 (20th lesson). This sounds pretty stupid and it probably is. Like why shouldn't I ask for the other $10, it doesn't hurt anyone. But as a tutor, it feels weird and awkard talking about money because people see you as a teacher and expect education to be your first priority. Teachers in the industry are almost always funded indirectly. You never really pay the teacher directly. You pay taxes - teacher gets paid through taxes (public). You pay tuition to school - teacher gets paid through school. As much as I would like education to be the focus, I got bills to pay. So, what do you think is the best way to politely ask for that $10 without getting remarks or death stares.  I could just be blunt and sincere but it might come off harshly and I might lose them - I kinda need money. Please help!",22Feb2020,1

I’m going to be an OT and i’m naturally very empathetic and understanding of others. I always put myself in their shoes and try to see things from every angle. I have a passion for helping others and seeing the good in everyone. 
I get annoyed when my boyfriend isn’t kind about people with disabilities. he is very quick to make fun of them, say derogatory words and comments, and just not be understanding of them at all. 
Today I told him that I feel like a fraud going to school all day, working at a daycare with children with disabilities, and going to fieldwork sites where I see these people as the beautiful individuals that they are and he can be so quick to say the meanest things. I told them that if he didn’t make an attempt to be nicer and more understanding of others I can’t see a future with him because that’s selling both of us short of happiness because it’s such a deal breaker for me. I felt like I was doing him a favor by informing him this but he said he sees being sensitive as a weakness and that’s something he can’t really see changing because he doesn’t know any real benefits of being sensitive. He thinks being sensitive automatically equals being taken advantage of.

167,"Hi all,

So my story is long.

I had a bad job that paid a lot and was working from home 100% of the time. Bad boss, bad hours and boring. I was so desperate to leave so I looked for work. 3 months ago I started a job at a property management startup and I'm the first employee. I make an okay in a very expensive city (less than my old job) and no equity nor benefits not even health care through my partner. My manager is smart and I like working with her. The company's annual income is enough to cover my salary, taxes and office space so my boss is living off her partner's income. In my contract there is a conditional bonus that will happen when we hire two people. Upon joining I realized this won't happen in the first year, I was basically tricked and again I just didn't know. I see potential but not great potential since the company doesn't really offer an outstanding service.

On top of that, I'm starting a part time mba that will cost me 2 years of my current salary after tax.

Thinking about everything, I feel I rushed into this job because I wanted to run away from my old job and made a not so good decision. Since this is a startup, if I leave just shortly after I started I would be screwing over my new manager especially that she told me it took her 5 months to find the right hire.

I want to start looking for other work since I now have a better mental situation outside of my old toxic job. In the meantime, I feel sorry for my manager to leave that fast. What should I do?",22Feb2020,1

So Im currently going to a small private school and im a freshman in highschool. The place where I live is very cliquey and its hard to make friends. I came to the school 2 years ago and I just started to mkae friends when I started my freshman year. The grade im in is pretty small and theres really nobody that drinks or smokes. Nothing against them but theres a select few people who do but theyre cliquey and idk how to explain it. On weekends I know theres parties that the select few go to and Ive tried to be like ""lets hang out"", or ""lets link"" but they always say theyre busy or theres too much people over. And its not like its a party that anyone can come to, its like they have an ""invite list"". Anyways I'm friends withpretty much everyone in the grade and they dont do shit on the weekends, usually I just sit in my room and smoke, and then i get sad because I see people out there having fun and doing shit that they wont let other people come to.

180," i signed up and made this account. This happened around 6 weeks ago i am 15 M. If you think its fake, i dont care im just asking for genuine help.

So this happened a few weeks ago, 6 weeks is an estimation. I had invited my friend of over 7 years over for the weekend, and we were planning on just having a sleepover, the usual. Nothing out of the ordinary we play video games except he was on his laptop alot for work, which is all reasonable. We watch key and peele then go to bed. I wake up, still usual stuff, and i go ahead and play games with him. All of the sudden get a call from my dad, my friend (we'll call him jack) picks up, hands the phone to me and my dad tells me to go somewhere where nobody can hear me. I get somewhere private, and he tells me that jack needs to leave now. Odd, but ok tell jack he has to go, he calls his dad his dad asks if we fought, jack says no, i say hi for conformation. I wait for jack to gather his things then i look for jack but i cant find him, call my mom twice to ask what happened she doesnt pickup. Weird, but okay, find him in my room, which i ask him how hes getting home, (this is the area that i dont remember super well) jack says that his dad ordered an uber home. (his dad is super busy really often and he lives a 20 minute drive away so he usually got an uber home) we head outside wait on the porch and the uber ""gets here"" in 3 minutes. Jack makes a comment on how its faster than usual. I agree. I see him get in the car and go off. I go home and on my way upstairs, i call dad for an update on the situation. No pickup. Really strange. I get to my bed. He calls me and i say jack has left, and he tells me that jack tried to film my mom in the shower. I say ""what?"" And he says yes. Im not joking. I say ""no..no..no"" to myself and my dad says ""im so sorry, but what you need to do is comfort your mom and hug her"" he says some other things i think but im just crying and confused and in denial somewhat. I hang up on him the moment i realized my moms situation. I scream out for her several times sprinting around the house. I see her im my houses ""mud room"" ( room between garage door and main floor) and shes crying i go up to her and shes backing away, i do my best to hug her and through tears, shes asking numerous times ""is jack still here?!?!"" And i say ""No! I saw him go away in an uber!"" And im just saying ""sorry! sorry! sorry!"". This goes on for 10-25 minutes im not sure. Then i hear the door knock. Out of shock my mom yelps, i go to it and my mom and dads neighborhood friends the mom specifically, says ""OP let me through i need to talk to your mom"" i say sure and she goes to the kitchen counter where me and my mom slowly migrated to. And my mom is talking to my moms friend while i just stand there slamming my fists into the granite table out of rage and theyre hugging and my mom is being comforted. I start bleeding from my hands, and  my moms friend tells me to go sit on the stairs. I do. I dont know what to do. My mom says that she doesnt know what to do. My moms friend tells me to text jack and his dad to come over right now. I text his dad this, and i scream-text jack multiple times. I go upstairs and cry for hours before getting online and acting comepletely normal my mom tells me not to tell anyone. I dont. The next few days go by, nothing important. I have to swap classes, because i swapped classes to be with him. I tell my counselor, he swaps jacks classes instead(love my counselor, and me and jack go to same school.) I dont go to school monday or tuesday, and i pick up early on wensday and friday. I accidentally tell my friend ""stuarf"", then ""aigden"", then. Zach. Zach is almost as good friends with jack as i am. (almost) he says that sucks. I wait a few weeks. Doing good, vibin as usual, when stuarf talks of jack, as in, them two joking around, in a game party, and i just leave and call him an asshole. So the people that tell me that they dont pick sidead are liars in this situation, because either A: theres literally a sexual predator. Or B: im lying about some serious shit. So theres sides to pick. Zach likes jack more than me so he picks jack obviously, even de-inviting me from a hangout with him. Prick. Anyways, stuarf just pissed me off, i apologize, hes pissed, and i tell a friend named owen about the situation, he says fuck jack. Which is...nice. weeks go by and eventually i hangout with stuarf and aigden, i HEAVILY consider swapping schools, and i get counseling, and i love the counselor. And i havent stopped thinking about jack. I just am so confused. And my mom and me go to court ywice with my dad to get a house restraining order against jack idk why but 1st time its a 90 day, 2nd time, the application got approved for a permanent. Both times jack nor his dad show up. Also, 2 weeks after the incident weekend i make an insta post while zach and jack are hanging out and i blocked and privated my account, only zach was following me, and jacks dad texted my parents that these are lies, it was only a social media post, and he threatened harassment charges and sueing. Now back to the current day. Its friday, hanging out with aigden, stuarf, and dallas. I cant stop thinking about forgiving jack, and i want to befriend him again. I feel so sad so often it fucking sucks. I was told by aigden that zach doesnt believe me and that he ASKED jack for the fucking videos. Fuck zach. I snapchatted jack, asking to resolve things several days ago, and he responded 3 days later, saying its bad and stuff. I say i want to end on good terms, he says that he shouldnt be rewarded. I agree. I post this now after heavy debate because my dad recently brought me with him to see his college best friend and his family.and i want a new best friend but zach and aigden are perfect candidates. Except theyre friends with jack. My mom is fine with me telling other about it, this could be a strech but there isnt evidence to link this to being me irl. I dont know what to do i just want everything to end im so depressed. Please give me advice for situation i dont know what to do or who to trust my grades are tanking and im putting on a lot more weight than usual

I've always been the type to worry myself about everything, but my entire life I've always done what I had to do. Faked it til I made it. How do you get ahead in life if everything you've had to earn and felt proud about is taken away. Losing job after job because they say you werent good enough, losing your vehicles because you were fired, being almost homeless(having to sleep on the floor in someones iving room), having failed relationships because you knew you deserved better, not having anyone to help besides your mom who isnt well off herself, low credit score, student loans. For me to have been through so much in my life, I NEVER SHOWED IT, I always cried myself to sleep, prayed to God for a way out. I'm not being ungrateful , because I always did find a way.

In April of 2019 I crashed my motorcycle while riding on the freeway. I broke my scapula and my clavicle on my left side, and several ribs. But the real damage is the nerves. The nerves that control my ability to lift or move anything but the fingers on my left arm were ripped out or severed completely, leaving my left arm paralyzed, (I’ve been in a sling since). I was having the craziest pain in my arm as well, it 
literally felt like my arm was full of acid. I wanted to cut it off. Pain pills were not even cutting it. After several months I met with a neurosurgeon at UCLA. I ended up having two ‘nerve transfers’ in October and November. And in December I had a ‘DREZ procedure’ through back of neck to spinal column to finally address the pain. It’s now 2/21/20,  the pain is much better but far from gone, my arm is in a constant state of burning numbness. I have not regained any movement in my arm and I am told it could be up to a year before I may see results, if I am fortunate enough to see any.

What I find disturbing is the amount of people who post anonymously about having feelings for someone else outside of their relationship.

L = Little brother 

S = Little Sister 

C = Littlest Brother 

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory: My mom and dad divorced when I was four to five. Their divorce wasn't pleasant, to say the least, and I actually witnessed the fight that 'officially' ended their marriage. Both of my parents feel awful that I saw it, and I only recently told them that seeing their fight messed me up for years. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, during this time, my dad met my stepmom at the dropzone he worked at (he's a skydiver, pilot, nurse, and karate instructor). Long story short, they fell in love and got married. I was seven when they had my half brother (L), who is a little turd, but I adore him, and they got married when I was eight. It was around this time that my mom and dad finally started to put their differences behind them.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to now: I have three half-siblings, who can be hellions at times but are usually very sweet. Since my dad got a job as an airline pilot, things have been chaotic. He had to move across the East coast while my mom stayed on the West coast. We've been staying with my stepmom's mom since she grew up on the East coast. I fly back and forth between the two every other month. Because I'm homeschooled, it doesn't affect anything in my schoolwork or anything like that. But the one month on one month off is where my problem lies. 

&amp;#x200B;

We love that I homeschool, it makes things very convenient for my family. However, my mom used to think I should go back to public school. It was very rare that she actually said that, but there were some moments that she wished I could experience high school as she did. We've finally stopped fighting about it because homeschooling has brought me opportunities that couldn't have happened if I was in public school. I'm able to travel the world and have my job because I homeschool. 

&amp;#x200B;

But when she used to make her arguments, there is one thing I always agreed on but never said aloud: sports. For over five years, I did karate, and I trained at the school my dad owned. I became a black belt and helped teach a few classes. I wouldn't say I liked teaching since I get anxious speaking in front of crowds. My therapist has helped with that, so while I still get anxious, it's not nearly as bad as it used to be. But my dad had to close the school because of the move, and he won't be able to open it, so I am currently without a sport. 

&amp;#x200B;

I want to do hockey, and I've been playing around with the idea for a while. Both L and G do it. I've been to a couple of their practices/done some research, and I want to do it. My stepmom used to do it too, and I've talked to her about it. 

&amp;#x200B;

But because of the one month on one month off thing, I can't truly commit to a sport. I was supposed to be a staffer at the camp I've been going to since I was nine (I'm sixteen now), but I missed the chance to sign up, and even if I made it, I would have to leave. There's training every other week from January until the week of camp. I was then going to go as a camper since this would've been the last year I would've been able to go as one, but my Spanish class is taking to trip to Spain the same week, so I can't go. 

 

I can't really sign up for any activities because of my schedule. I won't admit it out loud, but I'm jealous that C, L, and G are getting to do all these activities while I can't. I want to sign up for more writing and history classes that aren't online, but I know I can't. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been thinking about wanting to join hockey for a while, but that would mean having to choose between families. I don't want to have to choose because I don't know who I'll have to pick, and I refuse to do that L, G, and C. I don't know what to do. If I want to do anything, I will have to pick which family to live full time, and I don't think I can make that decision. I'm currently at my dad's, and I won't be able to asl my therapist about her opinions until the end of March. So, Reddit, you're the next best thing. What do I do?",22Feb2020,1

200,"So to start this off, a bit of a back story. First, This isn't life or death, but rather uncomfortable for me non- the-less.
I've got 3 friends and myself and we're supposed to go to a concert together. One friend bought the tickets to the concert (friend A). One friend is the reason we're all going due to his birthday being the reason we're all going (friend B). I'm friend C. And the last friend was sort of on the fence about going to this concert due to work obligations and life's general situations (friend D). Without really discussing with all the friends, friend A and friend B sort of made a decision that friends' D ticket will be given to friend A's coworker as a payment for getting him into a show the year before. This was done due to friend D at the time, being on the fence about being able to go but also not having had a chance to ask about going to the show. Friend C wasnt asked about any of this, it all came at friend C very quickly as well as friend D. 
So now here's the part I need help on. How do I approach friend A and friend B that, what was done was not cool, and a bit of douche move on their parts. I am torn as they are all my friends, but I was given the opportunity to go because that was also my birthday present that was given to me by my spouse. I want to say something that sticks up for friends D, but I'm not sure I should go to this concert in protest and this is grounds for a friend divorce (mostly from friends A,B &amp; D). I am the most likely to remain friends with all of them, but don't know what to say or how to say it.

202,"Alright, I would like to mainly focus on the short time planning of my life, but I will also list some of other ""small"" things I would like to work on eventually in life. About myself, I am a 20 year old biracial (white dad and black mother) heterosexual male. I have been in foster care since I was 10 years old, and I have been very fortunate to have relatively great (although pretty strict) foster guardians. They were contracted to have only kids live with them, so once I turned 18 and after I graduated high school I moved to another foster guardian. I have been living with him for the past year. Once I turn 21 (January 1st, 2021) then I will be required to leave foster care. Luckily, I am a pretty chill dude, and so is my current foster guardian, so he will allow me to stay until I am able to move out on my own. The deal was I would rent the room I sleep in (we haven't talked about how much yet, but the foster care gives him $700 per month for stuff, so I assume it would be that), and as long as I am consistently saving and maintaining employment then he doesn't mind.  I currently work at Walmart (part-time currently, but I have been approved to start working Full-time in March). I have attempted to go to college twice and become an electrician (ask for details) all three have failed so far. I have got accepted into another four-year university, but my social workers and others have told me to attempt to go to community college first. 

Basically, I am trying to decide whether to go to community college first and live with my foster guardian until I can move out, or should I just enroll in the University and ""enjoy the college experience"". I know the answer is obvious, but the thing is I would like to start getting involved romantically with girls (which is one of the ""small things"" I was talking about earlier). Unfortunately, I have social anxiety, am over weight (6 ft 1 inches, 242 lbs, 32% body fat), I have never been on a date, never even kissed a girl. I know I sound like a little bitch, and that these two particular things don't seem to be entirely related. But idk...

204,"I’m 19 years old and a sophomore in college. So I’m taking 16 credit hours for school and I was offered a job toward the end of winter break to start when school started up again. Simple job for a small tax company, just scanning and filing papers and helping out with whatever needs to be done around the office. Pays well, $12/hour for 9 hours a week. Not the most interesting, but keeps my bank account alive. 

About a week or so into that job, I got offered another job for work that’s actually related to my major and future career. Hours are flexible, just log them myself and turn it in every 2 weeks for $15/hour + free computer to borrow to do this work on (boss said I can use it for personal use too, it’s just best for this work since I have sucky laptop and he had an extra). It’s just learning this but it’s very time consuming. Since it’s not set hours and it depends on the workload given to me for each project, it can cut deeply into my personal time and it’s started affecting my relationship. 

Here’s my issue:

Fun boss is my neighbor. He helped me get into my major when I was interested in it and has taught me a lot. Tax boss is fun boss’s father in law. Both are incredibly sweet people and they’ve both offered me good opportunities.

I could quit tax job, but fun job is very unpredictable and unpredictable is difficult to manage in my college experience. BUT, I could get good experience for my future. Tax job is very small company with 5 people including me. Last person I replaced worked there for 2 years and I feel like if I quit it would be very sudden and they’d struggle to find new person. 

I could quit fun job, but tax job is mundane and pays less and is a drive away rather than working form home. BUT, it’s stable and pays consistently same paycheck every 2 weeks. Fun job is also small company but I’m not main person for my task. I basically do grunt work for someone else to make their job easier but this grunt work is technically an essential part of the projects we do... so I wouldn’t be missed for my position but it is a good foot in the door for my future. 

I’m leaning toward quitting fun job because it’s more unpredictable and my leaving would be less of an impact on them as they’ve been doing great without me (neighbor just offered me because it could help my experience). I’m hoping in my head that if I went to my neighbor I could ask that after this current project I could hold off continuing until summer? Then 2 jobs would be more manageable. But I’m also missing out on college experience but maybe that’s not good enough reason...",22Feb2020,1
205,"Sorry in advance i know this is long. 

For about 5+ years I’ve dealt with my depression on my own; normally by using distractions like getting really involved with interests and such. I tried therapy but couldn’t bear the getting to know me stage plus it wasn’t affordable for me. I haven’t been suicidal much in the last two years which I think is good but it’s coming back. Lately it’s gotten a lot worse for me even tho my “breakdowns”, which I guess are like panic attacks, aren’t as frequent as they used to be. Tonight it’s gotten worse than it has in a very long time and I was genuinely scared I might fuck up and do something drastic in the spur of the moment (I was driving) but once I got closer to home to kept it down and got inside. I’m not going to kill myself but I’m the farthest I’ve been from okay in a long while. I’ve always tried to keep my depression from stopping me from getting things done, mainly due to my not wanting to draw attention since no one really knows how bad it is. I think I need antidepressants or something so I can remain functional at least but I’m scared of what other effects might result.

Okay so I was very angry. My dad was screaming at me for another dumb reason and treating me poorly like always. I was fed up and he told me to go take out the trash so I did. I slammed the door shut behind me before proceeding to say loudly “fuck you!” at the door. To my dismay, I shut the door so hard that it bounced back open just as I went for a louder “fuck—“ and stopped myself as to my horror it was wide open. I ran away, fearing for my life as my dad has no idea I curse... he literally yells at me for saying Jesus Christ and “fuck” is a HUGE jump from that obviously. He heard, and yelled “how about you shut the door before you curse at me??” Now I don’t know if he heard me say fuck you, or just a slightly inaudible “FUCK!”  But he definitely heard one or the other... or both :(

I’m seriously so scared he’s gonna just demolish me. I’m hiding in my room and awaiting my fate. He’s rarely physically aggressive, but emotionally aggressive—all the time. I called my brother an idiot two years ago and he yelled things at me that made me cry for a week.

And here are my main goals:

I want to basically be as fit as a gymnast, by doing parkour, running, some break dancing and also I want to get good at surfing, skating, climbing and even ballet.

I love art, especially movies and music, every week I'm finding better movies or better music, recently I found out The Strokes, and days ago Philippe Jaroussky, and it's amazing. In the future I want to get into paintings and sculptures and other types of art

I don't ever want to drink alcohol or smoke tobacco. I'm not against psychedlics but probably I shouldn't try them since I have family history with psycosis. 

\-------

And one of my biggest goals is to form a family, to have a relationship with a girl, whether you call it girlfriend or wife, i don't care, and I want to have kids with her in the future, and the rest of what a lot of people want too.

And the problem I have is that nothing I do seems to attract girls, I really don't get it, at least someone should like me I suppose, but not even close, and I see people around me, guys that suck get girlfriends that are not actually so bad, and I feel it's all becuase of partying, drinking and doing stupid shit, like having no personality. But I know or I hope there have to be girls that actually are looking for that, someone honest, with solid opinions on things, etc.

I also feel it's a money issue, becuase if I had more money I could go have dinner with someone, right now I wouldn't, I rather eat at home and save money, I'm a broke college student, I can't go to the cinema either, or to a concert, even a museum is hard, and I think perhaps in those places is where I can find love.

&amp;#x200B;

So my question is, do I need to just have more money to do those things? Do I need to party? Do I need to lose the focus on my other goals, and for example, waste hours talking to people, being more social, about things that don't matter, using up the time I have to play the guitar or the piano?

215,"My best friend of many years passed away a couple weeks ago. His memorial is tomorrow morning and I am not sure if my presence there will be met positively.

Some back story My friend (whom I will refer to as J from here on) and I unfortunately got pretty deep into the drug scene together. We had already both done drugs before we met, but our influence on each other greatly increased this. I am not proud of any of it, but it's the truth. Anyways, we had a pretty bad falling out about a year ago. We recently had started hanging out again because I had reached out to him. Well about a week into the rekindleing of our friendship, we had decided to pick up some oxy 30s from a friend of ours. That day J also got his prescription of kolonopin filled. After picking up the 30s, he traded me some of his kpins for a couple more of the 30s that I had, because I had more of them than he did. He dropped me off at home, and that was the last I ever saw him. I hadn't heard from him for a few days, so jokingly I sent him a message saying, ""you alive"" A few days later right after work I found out he had died in his mom's driveway the previous Sunday, the same night we got the 30s, the same night I gave him a couple extra. He died from mixing alcohol with an overdose of oxy with kpins. Because of this I feel partly responsible for his death and it's been killing me. If I never would have reached back out to him and made him aware of the oxys we could get, maybe he would still be around. Or maybe if I didn't make that trade, he wouldn't have had enough of it to OD. We had been doing the oxys ever since we started hanging out again.

So his memorial is tomorrow, and I am sort of afraid to attend. The day he died, he had accidentally butt dialed me. I overheard his mom tell him, ""you better not come back here all fucked up, you always let OP talk you into stupid shit."" I also sent him msgs on Facebook saying I regretted trading him the oxys for kpins, because I had less than I thought. Someone in his family (I'm assuming his mom) ended up seeing those msgs after gaining access to his phone after he died, along with my ""you alive"" message. So all of this makes me feel like his mom might majorly blame me for her son dying, and I don't want to cause any drama at the memorial. Do you guys think I should attend? Me and him were extremely close, he lived with my family twice. I can't stop feeling like I am at least partially responsible for his death, and I really just don't know if I will be welcome at his memorial. What do you guys think? Thank you

Last year he was diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed vyvanse. After taking it for a month or 2 he quit because he felt it made him depressed. Since then, he is failing all of his classes and seems very unhappy. When i was home over winter break he made himself a cast complaining his arm was bothering him. Since i left ive learned he has done the same for his other arm as well, now wearing a makeshift cast on each arm. I believe its a cry for attention but hes going to an orthopedist this week to make sure there isnt actually anything wrong. 

I love my baby brother more than anything but i dont know how to help him from so far away. Ive been texting him and calling him, making sure he knows I love him, and he can discuss anything with me. Im very close with him, and I truly do think he agrees with this. 

When hes in school he hates being there because he doesnt understand any of the subjects, and all his friends are in the honors class (which he is not). When he is home he doesn't study which I assume is why hes having such a tough time in class, Vyvanse or not.

So I have this problem where I often end up in friend groups that feel toxic. After leaving two of them and transferring to college out of state, I feel like I might be in another one.

Basically we all share a common interest, as they’re a campus club. However, it seems like they say things to me that bother me a lot. 

For example, I was playing pool with one, and jokingly said that I bet $5 I don’t make this shot (as I wasn’t doing to well in the game). And the third person responded, “I hope you make it so you lose $5.” It didn’t seem funny, or even like a roast. It just seemed mean to me.

They also tend to heckle and go kind of hard on one person in the group in particular, and I don’t think he likes it. It seems like their bullying him, and that bugs me too.

I’m not really questioning myself, but I’ve misjudged social situations before. It’s just I end this kind of group dynamic so many times, it almost feels like it’s defying odds.

225,"Context: My boss left the company a week ago now. She supervised four workers (including me). Of my co-workers, I've been here the longest and have the most company knowledge and do a pretty damn good job at my job (I consistently get good performance reviews and leadership in the company have approached me for doing good in the past). 

When my boss gave her two-weeks, the company started looking at how they would cover her job responsibilities until they hired a new her (which won't happen until Summer just with the way our hiring freezes every year work. It is BS, I know.) There is another worker at my boss's level. When the company started deciding how to cover the position, I told my then boss to put in a word that I would be interested in doing the position for the interim. 

The company came back in agreement but said they still wanted me in my current position so I wouldn't be FULLY interim, I would take a good chunk of the job responsibilities, but not all of them. What is not being given to me is being given to the other person at my old boss's level and that person is going to be supervising me. 

Well, a question I had after figuring out what I would be doing was ""Am I going to have compensation for this/a pay increase to support the new job responsibilities?"" When I asked that, my boss's boss was absolutely shocked and I guess has never been asked that before (or so it seemed). But he said he would work with HR and see what they could do.

And I have been persistent in asking about it, without being too needy or greedy about it. I haven't set a ""this is how much you should pay"" and I ask appropriate questions at appropriate times. I did provide my old boss with a link to an HR advice type website that talked a lot about interim pay and how to approach that topic.

Today my boss's boss comes into my office and wants to understand ""how additional pay correlates with being able to do these new job responsibilities."" I tried my damnedest to explain that I am now doing my full job plus a good portion of the job above mine, so I am spending less time on my full job and more time on these new job responsibilities and inevitably am working more to get it all done. I talked about how these are new skills and tasks that I am taking on, and not a lateral skill and task set, so it is more demanding of my time and that I believe that should warrant a pay increase. 

He retorted with the fact that we are salaried, not hourly, and that we work until the job gets done (we also are not eligible for over-time). He stated that they were strategic in giving me parts of the job responsibilities so that I wouldn't feel like I need to work more than 40 hours a week. He stated that the whole company needs to work together as a team, that the job needs to get done, and that he doesn't understand why I think I should receive more pay for it. He said a lot of what I am doing could fall under the ""more duties as assigned"" part of my job contract. 

Now, the proposal is in HR. Nothing we talked about in that meeting had any effect on it because it is already there. He made sure to tell me that the proposal is already in, that he is just trying to understand more about why. 

I don't feel like I articulated myself well enough because he still doesn't get it. Yes, he is older than me probably by about 20 years. Yes, he has been doing this line of work for a lot longer than I have (so I'm sure he's seen his fair share of vacancies). He genuinely doesn't see why I deserve any kind of additional pay. He said it sounded like an ultimatum of ""If I don't get the pay, I'm not doing the work"" and how that speaks negatively to my job performance. I told him that it is a terrifying thought, that if I don't accept the work it will seem like I am not dedicated to the company and that I do not want that kind of reputation because it is not true.

231,"We’ve almost been together for 4 years now but here’s some backstory. This is a really long one so please bear with me. 

In the beginning of Jan 2018, my girlfriend (let’s call her Cindy) told me she fell out of love with me. Our relationship hadn’t been as amazing as it was, we were fighting constantly, it was stressful. I tried everything I could to make her love me again, and a few weeks later she told me she realized she does love me, she had thought she fell out of love because of how much we were fighting. But somehow during this I stopped wanting to be with her. Around this same time I got a new job and met a coworker (let’s call her Kate) who flirted with me a lot. I told her I have a gf and she said she wanted to be friends, but still flirted with me. She didn’t speak much english and I don’t consider myself fluent in spanish but google translate worked. 

Fast forward to May, Cindy and I were still fighting. She wasn’t giving me attention like I wanted and was constantly on my case about one thing or another. Meanwhile I had changed my password and left my phone on do not disturb whenever Cindy came over. She was suspicious but I told her she was crazy. Things between me and Kate began to heat up. We would flirt and I even thought about leaving Cindy. I broke up with Cindy in June. I told her it was for my own personal betterment and that maybe one day we would be together again but I think I only said that so she wouldn’t be so sad. 
A week later she saw me kissing Kate at a grocery store. She texted and asked how I met her and I lied and said a party. We ended up getting back together a couple weeks later after I begged and groveled and she looked through my phone and saw all of Kate’s and my pictures together and the nicknames I started calling her. She also saw the message I sent Kate in May telling her to “wait for me to solve all the problems in my life because i want to talk to you more.” which caused her to walk out on me. This happened over and over. Every time she would see something about Kate or think I was texting her or that I missed her (which I did not) she would leave me. And out of spite and loneliness I would go back to Kate. I was dating them both at once and I hate myself for it. Kate told me she loved me and I said it back. I don’t know if I actually loved her because I was always missing Cindy. She knew I was with Kate and started dating a guy we’ll call John. She was constantly hanging out with him and it made me sick. 

In Nov 2018 we decided we were really going to make it work and cut both john and kate off. It was going smoothly until March 2019 when Cindy broke up with me (I’ll admit I was being insensitive about a certain subject but to be fair I think she should toughen up). I immediately ran back to Kate (who had a bf but broke up with him for me). After Cindy told me she knew I went back to Kate, she stopped responding to my texts and emails. Maybe a week after we broke up, I got matching tattoos with Kate. After Cindy found that out, she didn’t want anything to do with me. She completely stopped all contact. Blocked my emails and my number, all my social media. Things between me and Kate were good but I missed Cindy. It was hard to have to translate everything but she had 3 jobs when Cindy kept saying she wanted to kill herself because of her job (part of the reason we broke up). A couple weeks later I found out Kate was pregnant. I thought it was the honorable thing to do to propose, so I bought a $100 ring and proposed at a music festival. I cried my eyes out because I thought I lost any chance to get back together with Cindy. My sister and mom were really close to Cindy and would update me about her life anytime I asked. She started dating John and working 2 jobs. Traveling and being a completely different person. I was so angry with Cindy for being with John even though she told me she didn’t love him. A couple weeks later Kate told me the baby most likely was not mine, and that it was her ex’s. She got an abortion, and we broke up in May after she wanted to settle down with me. I told her I wasn’t ready especially after she lied about the baby being mine, and she kept pushing. I started trying to talk to Cindy. I messaged her from a new account and surprisingly she called me. We got back together in June with a promise to always be honest with each other. She asked me if I had ever recorded myself having sex with Kate, but I lied and said No because I thought I had deleted everything. Turns out it only got deleted from my phone and not on my computer. Cindy saw a video of me and Kate having sex, a long with the pics of us dating and nudes she sent me, and the texts about me being excited to get married and start a family with Kate but I was just lying. 

Fast forward to now. Things aren’t the same but I can’t let her go. She is honestly obsessed with Kate. Cindy watches Kate’s social media accounts and told me Kate went back to her ex bf and is pregnant again. I want her to stop doing this. She found the engagement ring I gave to Kate and still holds onto it. Cindy is really jealous that I proposed to Kate but I keep trying to explain it wasn’t the same. Cindy also fights with me to get the tattoo covered up but she’s still best friends with the person who introduced her to John. I told her when she cuts that girl off I’ll cover the tattoo up. 

I don’t know how to help her. I love her with all my heart but she won’t forgive me for all of this. I keep hoping she will but she’s told me over and over she can’t keep doing this to herself. She never leaves me, but I’m scared she might. She’s ashamed of me. She doesn’t want to tell her family about me again, and is even embarrassed to post me on social media. I want her to post me so badly. I don’t want breaking up to be an option. 

How do I get her to stop obsessing over this girl? How can I fix this?

TLDR: I’m an asshole who broke my girlfriends heart for another girl but realized I love my girlfriend more than anything but I’m afraid she’ll drive herself crazy obsessing over the other girl.",22Feb2020,1

Hello,

This is my first time posting and I'd appreciate it if I got some advice out of this. Thank you!

I have a friend who I've know for about 2+ years now, and we know everything about each other, including the person I admire. (Let's call her S) She's one of those people who can talk to any guy and have him on her tail. So, a few months after hearing about who I like, S starts texting him, day after day, just ""for fun."" Soon, that texting, turned into dating. Of course, at this point, I stopped trying to talk to the boy, as I was already low on self-esteem. (I don't exactly have the best face :) Suddenly, S starts texting me about how insecure she is on dating him, and how he probably doesn't like her, etc. etc. I keep telling her I care, that of course the boy likes her. Except now it seems like she keeps shoving it in my face. At this point I'm just sending her useless replies filled with ""he likes you"".

This has happened many times, so I just need advice on what to do now.. I don't want to ruin our friendship, but I also don't want to be let down either.",22Feb2020,1
234,"Lately when I'm laying in bed trying to fall asleep, I feel a strangely familiar sense of the area around me closing in. Idk what it is but I know the feeling very well. It doesn't feel like anxiety, it just feels like the area around me is slowly getting tighter. Maybe it's memories of sleeping in my parents bed as a child and feeling claustrophobic? Or being wrapped too tightly in blankets as an infant?  Or maybe even memories of being in the womb? I have no idea. Where do I even go to discuss this lmao",22Feb2020,1
235,"(I’m on mobile so I’m sorry for any formatting errors)
 
I’ve been friends with this girl since we were both in elementary school. Considering I’ve always been quite eccentric, it was incredibly refreshing to meet somebody who was so similar to me. We’ve kept our friendship alive until now (currently seniors in high school), and although we don’t talk as much as we used to anymore, we have a lot of the same classes and still see each other frequently.

Now, when I say this girl is similar to me, I mean people walk up to me and get me confused with her. We have the same interests, the same style, the same demeanor, and we even both look alike. It had never bothered me before until I hit high school, and now it’s been frustrating me to no end for the past four years. 

It doesn’t help that, considering that we participate in the same activities, she’s always performed better than me and has gotten recognized for it. Yes, it’s silly of me to be jealous because of that, but it’s hard because I feel like I put in the same amount of effort but end up feeling worse. Usually, I wouldn’t care, because some people excel at certain things better than others and that’s just a part of life, but because it’s this girl, I find myself getting extremely angry over it. There have been times where we’d walk around together and she would be the person who would get endless compliments about her looks/outfit/whatever, while I awkwardly stand there and continue to let this jealousy grow. 

It’s not like one of us is copying the other either. We just happen to be so coincidentally alike. 

I feel like an asshole for typing this all out because whenever I think about this situation, I feel like a bad person. I still like her and I would like to continue being friends, but this constant internal competition I have with her is driving me insane. I can’t distance myself at all because of our class schedules, and I don’t really have any other friends at school to confide in. I feel like my originality and any unique aspect of myself is stripped away from me whenever I’m around her, and I become insanely anxious in every class I have with her. I don’t want to talk to her about it, because she isn’t doing anything wrong at all and wouldn’t understand why I’m upset. I don’t want her to know about any of this, because this isn’t a situation of intentional copying. There’s no copying at all; I just want to be myself without feeling like I have to compete for it. 

What are some things that I could do to help myself get over this?",22Feb2020,1

239,"Hello! Just as some background for this post really quick, I’m a 17 (and a half) year old female who has what I would say are really controlling and overprotective parents. And I just quite honestly don’t know how to cope with it anymore in a healthy way. 

So I have a boyfriend (also 17) whom my parents don’t really like too well, even though they’ve never met. Every time I ask if I can go hang out with my friend or do something with my brother my step dad usually accuses me of going to see my boyfriend (which I haven’t done or planned). My step dad also looks through the messages between my boyfriend and I so I don’t understand why he accuses me of things I haven’t done when he can see all our conversations. A few weeks ago I had planned to go out shopping with my brother and I had put on some makeup just to feel pretty that day and my step dad immediately claimed I was going to see my boyfriend. Honestly I’m getting really tired of being treated like this but I feel like I can’t do anything about it. For more background to how controlling my parents are they placed 5 cameras in and around my house to watch my brother and I, they go through my phone/my messages/photos, they go through my room, they track my phone, and tonight my step dad asked for my friend’s dad’s phone number so my step dad could ask if I was going to see my boyfriend tonight when I went to the movies. They also check through my email, have complete control over my bank account and even ask for my work schedule. If I get off of a shift later than what I was scheduled for I get into trouble even though that’s out of my control completely. I just feel lost and I don’t know what to do, all of this is really affecting my mental health and I hate coming home after school or work. 

Thank you for taking the time to read all that, I know it’s a lot. But I want to move out when I’m 18 I just don’t know if my parents will let me. Hopefully I can get some advice to help me out a little bit.",22Feb2020,1
240,"My brother has been tearing our family apart, my parents are pushing him through college but he refuses to work and he's lying all the time. He's flunked two years in a row (on his third year and already flunking) the whole time telling my parents he had As and Bs. My parents have opposite ways of dealing with him. My dad is aggressive and yells and my Mom just tells him it's fine and he's still doing great. They're always fighting with him or with each other about him. 

It's getting worse every day, he keeps lying to them about everything. He took only two classes this past year, he dropped one and flunked the other while maintaining with my parents that he was passing both. They only found out when my dad forced him to show some work. I keep walking by my mom's room and hearing her crying, my dad is staying at work longer and longer. Every once in a while in their scream offs they shout about divorce. 

My mom has been pushing me to look into big scholarships more and more. I didn't understand why sense me and my brother both have money saved up for college so I'd only need a small scholarship or loan. I found out while my dad was ranting to me in the truck why that is. She's running out of the money saved for my brother's collage and he still hasn't passed his first year, she plans to just use mine. 

My dad has dragged me into the effort of helping my brother, I now keep his schedules in a planner and tell him his schedule in the morning. He won't cooperate! I ask if he has assignments for me to add to the study schedule and he'll say no. Then when Dad realizes he did and he didn't do them my brother blames me for not putting it in the schedule. 

I've been given a talk about ""taking my family seriously"" and how ""my sibling needs me and I need to step up""

I objected but I'm the youngest in the family so no one listens to me! I'm still a freshman in high school, I don't know how to hold a family together. I've started asking my girlfriend to take me home with her some days so I don't have to go home to deal with the yelling 

My dad has scheduled to go help my uncle at his shop in Texas for almost a full month. My uncle has employees so I don't know why he's going other then to get away.

But that dog never barked at night ever because I'm a light sleeper and wake up easily by noises like that.

I'm honestly baffled this even happened because theres nothing back there but trees.

242,"Hey all. I am a recent law school graduate with a ""big law"" job that includes 60+ hour work weeks and a 6 figure salary once I finish my articling (training) period. I've felt unsure about my career path even before I entered law school--I've always wanted to be a filmmaker, but decided to go into law because I was concerned about not being able to financially support myself as an artist. My original plan was to slave away in my corporate job for a few years and save up enough money to finance my own film projects on the side, with a view to possibly pivot into the entertainment industry in the future if the right opportunity came by. However, during the middle of my bar certification process (I live in North America) I had a severe psychotic episode that caused me to be hospitalized for over a month. My psychiatrist told me that there is a chance I will relapse in the future.

Once my firm found out about my condition, they agreed to hold my position for several months while I recovered. However, I know they are concerned about the potential liability that might arise by employing someone like me, which means my chances of being re-hired after my articling period is likely lower than before. I'm also not 100% sure that the high stress environment of corporate law is the right place for me, given my diagnosis. My current plan is to return to my firm and try my best to get hired back, hopefully save up some money, and continue looking for opportunities in the film industry in my spare time.

We were having a good time talking when he asked me if I had anything weird mentally about me. I asked for an example for himself and he really struggled to get this out but he let it slip that his mind is like a sociopath and he might've said something about thinking like a serial killer. He was genuinely trying to say that there was something off about his mind but then he stopped when he saw that I was alarmed. It was so bizarre that I kind of couldn't process it. 

The first red flag was that he studies math /s. But for real... what even?

He spends a lot of time alone and he definitely isn't used to being alone with a girl so I'm wondering if he just conveyed the wrong thing to me...

262,"I (20F) just had the most uncomfortable dream/nightmare in my life. It was about my brother (11), staring at me. Close. I tried to push him away but couldn’t move. He moved closer,  staring, trying to grab me with a sinister smile on his face, I couldn’t talk or move. It was maybe a couple of minutes went on for what felt like an hour by watching the time (I was woken up earlier in the night). I knew it was a dream but I felt stuck, unable to do anything, paralyzed, silent. I couldn’t end the dream. It took all my power to scream “Mom”, and my mom came. She told me she heard an unknown voice call for her. I was now fully awake, gone from the dream. I told her it was me, but I couldn’t feel myself scream. I couldn’t feel my mouth form the words, or my voice say it. Although, I was so tired because I know that it took a lot of me to break the barrier between me and my uncomfortable dream. 
I don’t know what this means. Is this kind of dreams normal? I’ve had nightmares before but not like this. It felt so real yet I knew I was dreaming. I don’t want to sleep anymore. What does this mean?

265,"I [19F] am in my second year university, I still live at home with my parents and 16 year old brother. My university is an hour drive away from my house but I can’t afford to move out so I only go to school 2 days a week and drive in.

Me and my mom have always been super close, but recently I feel like I’m being strangled.

Recently my dad started to work out of town 8 hours away 24 days on 4 days off. My mom has always been a stay at home mom and doesn’t have any hobbies or friends. Since I switched to only going to school 2 days a week this semester I NEVER get out of the house, and when I do go out or even have class I feel super guilty leaving my mom at home alone.

I have lost touch with nearly all of my friends from high school and I haven’t made any close friends in university. Since it’s an hour drive and I can’t afford gas I literally don’t know how to meet new people.

The problem is, this schedule has been since September now and I feel like I have lost all motivation to meet people. I am starting to be content with not having friends (different than the panic I felt at first) and it’s starting to concern me. I suffer from migraines and leaving the house is an exhausting task for me, and I find myself giving in to the rut I’m in. I don’t know how to reset my life. Any suggestions?",22Feb2020,1
266,"I work for a famous mouse, in one of his theme parks in FL. I've been training for almost 2 years, promised promotions and opportunities that have never come, I kicked off a rewrite of the training guides, I've taught almost all new trainers, and I was suspended from being a trainer today. 

I thought since last month that's what they were trying to do, as they stopped giving me trainings, unless absolutely needed. Suddenly I'm suspended for not training well, during not one but two trainings where I had to train trainers and reassure them. Not to mention they claim that the trainees complained but they were 100% fine and when I verified with them, they claim they had complaints for other trainers but not me, as I was the only trainer they felt took one on one time with them.

I did challenge the basis of the suspension when informed and the manager dodged answering, saying regardless of weather the information is correct the suspension holds. What runs me the wrong way about this is that when 4 woman complained about 1 trainers sexual misconduct, they were shut down and told itd be handled, and handling it didn't result in any suspensions for the harrasser- yet a confirmed made up story results in ""suspension either way"". 

I know I can call them on the bullshit, but how? What/how can I effectively do?

With such a large corporate company such as this, I'm not sure what the best response is. Something doesn't feel right and I want to protect myself from whatever might be thrown my way. And before someone saysnit: I'm getting the unions number tomorrow to conneect with them about this.

I've considered breaking things, running away from home, hurting myself, any number of things, but I can never convince myself to do any of it. None of it will help me. 

I'm a very logical person, and burying my emotions and putting on a smile is very easy for me. Because of that, it's not hard to figure out that doing something drastic like that will hurt me more than it will hurt anyone else.

I'm stuck in this awful middle ground where I don't want anyone around because I'm starting to hate every one I know, but I'm lonely without them.

271," 

My wife and I are purchasing our first flip house and we are unsure if we are getting led astray by our realtor for our offer price. We are looking at a house in the Dallas/Fort Worth area that is listed for 200k, and it is 3 bed 2 bath 1999 sqft. Our realtor recommended that we offer 230k initially. We toured the house and it need work but the bones are good... all cosmetic from what we could see. The roof was redone in 2016 and a new 14K Hvac system has been installed, but the person who lived their took on a lot of DIY projects and basally everything needs to be redone. The house was build in 1998 and no upgrades have been done since then. It still has the old wallpaper, old appliances, the pop corn ceilings, and much more.

Based off of tax assessment for the city the house is in, the assessor states the house is worth 246k for taxes (186k house, 60k land), but no one has seen the inside since 1998. This area has seen a boom in the recent years which is why I think the tax assessment is so high. After touring the house, I truly believe that the house is not worth that much. We looked at the Comps and there were three home that matched up to the specs of the house want to buy. All three houses sold in the past month. All three houses have upgrades. All three houses are on the same size lot. All three houses are in the same neighborhood. The three houses sold in the $230k range.

We are struggling because our realtor wants us to place a bid that is 30k over list and the only back up she had for that price was because she looked at one house on the CMAs (her words) and she thought since it sold for 230k, this house was worth that.

My wife and I want to offer 210k which is 10 k over list. We are pre approved, not pre qualified. and we want to waive the seller home warranty and pay for the title. My question to you all is are we being to naive? or is 30k over list just too much. I will give you more detail if you need it!",22Feb2020,1
273,"I (19 F) have an alcoholic and depressed dad. It’s getting bad.
Some background: He’s been an alcoholic since I was about 14. He hid it from me until I started noticing around age 16. When I was 16 years old and under, he was my best friend. We did everything together and talked about everything. We loved each other completely. Our friendship was one of the best things in my life. 

He then cheated on my mom when I was 16. Her gut told her to look at his texts, and there they were. My parents divorced. He hates my mom, blames her for everything. He then jumped into another relationship (not the women he cheated with), and proposed to her. She (let’s call her Anna) said yes. He seemed happier. Things were looking up for his mental health. I was ~17 years old when he proposed. 

I just found out today that Anna is ending things with him because his drinking is still terrible. Currently, we don’t see each other often. His mental health is all over the place. I know he loves me, we used to be inseparable. I’m really hurting. I’ve tried to help him, he doesn’t act like he wants help. During the 2-3 years he’s been gone, I’ve gotten multiple drunk calls. My brother has gotten a suicidal text from him. 
My dad is staying at his parents house tonight and he plans to buy it from them. 

Let me also clarify, when I see him in person, it’s great. He’s still such a great and funny guy. Behind closed doors, he is a total stranger with serious issues and I don’t know how to help. I’m a 19 year old girl with chronic migraines who’s never had a job or gone to college yet. I’m trying to figure out my life and make sure my dad gets the help he needs at the same time. 

His relationship with my brother is bad, he hates my mom, lost his recent girlfriend, hates his parents. I’m the only one he has. I do have a wonderful boyfriend who is willing to help me do things with my dad and whatnot, it just doesn’t seem like anything helps my dad. I’ve tried calling him often, texting him often, making plans with him (he cancels a lot, we had plans for tomorrow that he just canceled), deep conversations telling him I care about him and need him to get help, I just don’t know what to do. 

There’s so much more about his insanely bipolar behaviors that I haven’t even mentioned. My poor mom hid his alcoholic behaviors from us kids for years, and then catches him cheating. When we caught him he told her he never loved her, calls her a crazy psycho, throws the grill off the patio, and leaves (I witnessed it all). He told me days before that happened (things were rocky with him and my mom before we found out about the cheating) that he loves her and always will. And then does that in front of my face. 

I’m mostly just wanting to see how other kids of alcoholic parents deal with this, or if anyone in a similar situation can help put my mind at ease. 

Nonetheless, any advice would be great. I’m grateful for anything. Thank you. 

Summary: dad used my be my best friend. He became a terrible alcoholic, cheated on my mom, left, and won’t get any help. He hates everyone around him except for me. I feel heartbroken and like I’m the one who’s left responsible to fix all of it, I just don’t know how.",22Feb2020,1

279,"Uhhhhh haha yeah. So my (19F) husband (20M) and I are in a bit of a financial situation at the moment. We currently can’t afford to pay our bills, and can barely afford to buy food. We both have jobs at the moment but his job is putting an extreme strain on his mental health and he is contemplating quitting. In fact, they’re begging him to stay but he’s not so sure he wants to accept the different hours they’ve given him. 
Our water and electricity has been shut off, which we got those back up but not without difficulty. Our fridge isn’t working anymore. 

We need to build our credit scores back up so that’s can get an apartment so we can move a few states away for a fresh start which we both desperately need. But we can’t do that because our credit scores are shit (right around 500) and we can’t build those up because we don’t have the money for it. So we’re stuck. 

Now, I am perfectly willing to sell feet pictures to get a little extra cash so we can pay our bills. I’ve been wanting to do it for a while, i even know some people who would buy from me. So I’d have no trouble getting this started up. 

My only problem is that my husband is just so stubborn and adamant  that he doesn’t want other people looking at my feet (he doesn’t have a fetish btw). He feels weird about it, but it doesn’t even have to be weird. I’ve read into it and I’ve seen a bunch of women whose husbands know about it and support them and even help them out with it.

281,"TL;DR 
 me and my friends all experienced the same crazy disappearing/ reappearing hotel and have no idea what caused it. Advice wanted.


Hello! First time poster here, I am looking for advice on what exactly may have happened to me tonight. I will try to make it short, but it’s a bit of a long story. Two months ago I got a order to deliver to an address near the water, on my way there I felt strange but I continued. I was using Apple Maps and It was saying the building I was delivering to was on the marina. On the way there, I passed a large gravel lot. It should now be noted that at 6pm I now saw No cars on the road, at all. I thought it was strange but kept trekking on. My maps began bugging out, sending me all over the marina, back and forth, sideways and down. I eventually ended up going back into my delivery app to double check the address, and when I looked I saw a note (this not e was definitely NOT THERE before I started going to the address, I always always ALWAYS check.) and the note said “hotel indigo”. After I went back to maps to put in the hotel name, it started telling me to go back the way I came, so I went. On the way back, all of a sudden, it’s like I blinked and I was in a different space. I was on the same road, but it felt different. I was in the same area, but it felt different, and then I look to my right and there it is! The hotel indigo. A huge building that there is no way I could have missed. I pull in next to a bunch of nice, new cars. Too new. They seemed almost staged. I double and triple check that there were no drinks I was forgetting as I always do, and there’s nothing. I go inside, I don’t see a single person, but I deliver the food to the customer in room 314, he tips me six dollars and I left. I felt in a hurry to leave, and I sped off. About ten minutes later I get a call from the customer saying I forgot their drink, (remember there was no drink when I dropped off the food) so I look to my right and there it is! A frosty, again almost too perfect. Staged. Not even a little melted, like it was just put there. My gut turned. My face got hot and I told the customer “I am sorry I cannot return.” And I continued on my way. I felt lighter, physically and mentally when I hung up, like I made a vitally important decision. I was by myself this whole time and left it at that. I blew it off as I was tired. I went home and went to bed. 

A few weeks ago, I started getting this strange urge to go to the beach. 

Tonight I finally convinced my friend and her kids to go to the beach with me. We picked a random beach nearby to go to, and put on Apple Maps to take us there. Half way there it goes from horrible traffic to barely any cars on the road. Slowly I start to get a bad feeling. Slowly I start to get nervous and don’t know why. And then I realize, we are right by “hotel indigo.” But I don’t see it. I don’t see it anywhere! I mention it to my friend and she doesn’t doubt my story, but doesn’t take it too seriously. Then, maps starts acting up... it tells us to turn right suddenly, and so we do, but it takes us down a one way road but thankfully there were still no cars (at rush hour!) we all start to feel weird and I mention to her the whole hotel indigo thing and we turn around and start to head home. I point to where the hotel should be, a clear view from the road and no one sees it. Then, we pass a building that blocks are view for a moment and on the other side, there it is!!!! Hotel indigo! We all are freaking out, the road is empty, the air feels different, and my friend turns down the road to it and just like the last time, new cars. Too new. Almost staged, we drive towards it, turn around and go the other way. The dog in the car was freaking out the whole time since we first saw it, and once we got a certain distance away from it, he yelped out like he was in pain and then went back to completely normal... we all kept asking outselves “did you see what I saw?”  “Did that really just happen?” Etc. 

I thought I was crazy the first time it happened to just me, but now that I have it confirmed by THREE other people I know there must be some who are more knowledgeable than us who can give me their opinion on what happened to us tonight... any advice is wanted. Thank you.",22Feb2020,1

She refuses to get a divorce because she is afraid of the consequences and she refuses to fix things because she says it’s too late.

287,"So we have been seeing each other for 2 months. It's long distance (1 hour away) and he has driven to come to see me almost every weekend expect 2(this weekend is one of them).
I dont drive to see him because he lives with a roommate(share room) and i have my own place. 
We went on a date our first meeting he paid.
from that point on we stay at my place and rarely and I mean rarely do we go out. However he paid for chic fil a once and grocerys when I made breakfast.
My birthday came and I bought use 2 tickets to a very nice theater( tickets for seats were 25 each) I wasnt upset about that at all. 
However when we he came over he had absolutely no gift for me and he said it was because he didnt have time. I was like whatever (bs he has been knowing about it).
Anyways we go to the theater and he doesnt order a drink at the bar (this moment I know I'm paying for the drink i already ordered. I was thinking whatever I did pick a every expensive place. But when we got into the theater he orded a beer and told the waiter he had cash. She said we pay a the end. 
At the end of the movie I placed my card there and figured best he would pay for everything or worse he would atleast pay for his drink (which he agreed to do).
No I played for everything! 
He didn't even offer to help. Needles to say I was mad. He said I slammed my card there and I was upset and acted liked I wanted to pay. Ok..
Mind you he is a 29 year grown man who just a month before told me he went to a club and spent a lot of money on his friend who was a girl( not even his girlfriend) 
he also bragged To me that he had 60 dollars cash on my birthday.
I was expecting something or anything for my birthday. Even a card.
He told me he would make it up to me so today (weekend) I expected to see him. We only see each other on weekends.
He told me j shouldn't come to see him because he is broke and we can't go out. I told him that's fine and he brought up my birthday. I told him that's totally different. I told him I didnt care if he spent money and he held onto the same thing. He didnt want to see me until the next weekend. I'm confused how he is broke 3 days after my birthday and refused to see me over a stupid excuse.
I am now feeling like he doesn't care. 
But he brought up all the things he has done for me: driving to see me, texting me everyday, call me every few days, driving to come see me, coming with me to get my dog, and coming at 7am to take me to the doctor. 
Yes that all meant alot.
But I told him that doesnt mean I am a priority because its not in my love language.
I'm wondering if I'm being a brat.
But I'm hurt. We literally have been on 1 real date only. He doesnt spend money on me ever and he is saying since I expected something then I always expect that! I was baffled. 

He hasn't asked me to be his gf, he doesn't ask me questions about my past, he hasn't wanted to introduce me to his friends/family, doesnt ask about mine or my inner thoughts. He doesnt mention to me how he feels and said I should just know bcus he comes to see me. Well he also gets things here he doesnt have at his place: sex, tv, ps4, a cook chick to talk to. Him coming to see me doesnt mean he wants to seriously be with me( that's what I think at least). I'm confused now.

Tl:dr 
We've been dating 2 months, we rarely leave the house. We are long distance, 1 hour apart. He comes to see me almost each weekend. He speaks to me often on text calls atleast 2 times a week, drive at 7am to take me to doc. We go out on my bday he shows up with no gift for me, he has 60 dollars cash on him however and somehow I end up spending money on his and my drinks on my bday( he said its because I had an attitude and wanted to pay). I got upset. He says I w6nt him to pay for everything since I got upset he allowed me to pay on my bday. I said that's different. I couldn't see him this weekend bcus he said he is broke.i said I didn't care he said I can't see him anyways. Now wonder if he is even truly serious about me.",22Feb2020,1

Went Country dancing in Dallas the day before Valentines. Meet beautiful hot blonde girl(freshman in college) and her friends. Danced with all of them and had a great time. They all loved me because: White Latino with curly hair, accent, great dancer, athletic body, dress well, super-nice, comforting aura, make them laugh, etc   
Blonde girl ""blondie"" gave me her Snap. I left around 2 a.m. with my friends. Blondie texted me around 4 a.m. saying ""I had a great time, you are a great dancer... would love to hang out soon... Have a great day..."". I thought what a sweet girl!   
I replied with similar compliments and told her I am free tonight (Valentines) or Sunday eve and to pick one so we may hang out. She says I am free tonight! We went to this awesome park, practice some dancing moves next to this lake/beach area, She taught me more about country dancing and I taught her about Latin dances... talked about how we are such hopeless romantics and our shocking similarities despite coming from different worlds... saw sunset, hugged, kissed... and it was magical.  
Went to her car and listened to music while we made out overlooking a shining moon in front of the lake... she told me how ""her boyfriend had just broken up with her the week before""! I said I am sorry and that I was there for her...  
\*\*\* Skip this if you want\*\*\*  
We keep romancing, talking and could not keep our hands from each other. Things got steamy... then really hot but she would not go further and I did not want to tbh. I told her I respected her and is probably not a good idea to go any further. She agreed. Somehow after a while, we agreed to go to her place, watch some movies, order food and just ""cuddle."" I seriously did not pull anything, I was just being nice and honest and keep saying not a good idea to have sex on the first date. But of course, we picked up food and went to her place and of course as the night progressed we eventually ended up about to have sex until she kinda back out and told me how she had been abused in her past relationships... I told her nice things and that I will never do such things. I just held her in my arms and fell asleep while cuddling and romancing. We even talked about our future. It was cute. The morning after we danced more, ate more, and talked more... then we somehow ended up having quick/suave/cautious sex in 1 position until she came ( I always put my partner's pleasure before mine); I did not come and that was ok with me. Then she fell asleep for a bit again in my arms while we romanced and talked about the world.

After spending the night together we went to our destinations and left super happy. Felt as if a connection was established and agreed on seeing each other more often and planed for future adventures and to truly get to know each other.   
Guess what, I texted her the next day and she was cold, perfunctory perhaps, indifferent and just a different energy. I told her that I miss her and that I would love to see her again. She replied she is too busy and I tried to call her days after but no answer and I made a last attempt to invite her for dinner for her birthday but again she says she is too busy. All this while she keeps posting snap stories of partying and going out with friends and all... All this in 9 days.   
So, What did I do wrong? Did she just use me as a quick rebound? Is she just experiencing and having fun like a normal college student is supposed to do? I wish I could just talk to her and let things clear. What is the next move? and what just happened? Also, yes I will get beat for this but I truly feel connected to her and miss her.",22Feb2020,1

Now that got me to like her way to much so I would flirt with her. She knew I was doing it, and she didn't mind it she said she enjoyed it. Now of course I would fuck it up we got into a argument about a year into are friendship and we split for about a year and a half. I have recently reconnected with her. That's a whole story by itself. Anyway, she said she wanted things to be like the old days. Now I know for a fact she's not looking for a relationship, but I cant get that threw my head so I have to constantly check my writing and make sure I'm not flirting with her to much.

293,I’m an only child and my parents have been divorced for 5 years now. My father has been in the hospital for over a week and I got a call from the doctor saying he has a heart infection. The risky part is to decide if he should live life off medication until the medicine doesn’t help or risk doing open heart surgery with a high percentage of him not making it. They called a family meeting for the weekend but i’m his only family here... I’ve never felt so alone. So sad. So numb. So depressed. I’ve always pictured my dad being able to walk me down the isle when I get married one day. But now I can’t have that and I’ll never see him again. I can’t make the decision without feeling some type of regret as if this will be all my fault. Please help me.,22Feb2020,1
294,"Context: 25 years old and living on my own. There has been some big life changing stuff going on and my mother is not supportive. I need her support on this more than anything, or at the very least, to leave me alone.

My mother has always been, at least to some extent, emotionally abusive and sometimes physically abusive. She is a single parent and only had me by accident and I feel like she has taken a lot of that anger out on me. She doesn't trust me and is very vocal about saying it to me.

At this point I don't want to have a relationship with her, she has screwed me up in so many ways and is impossible to talk to. If she was supportive of what's going on in my life right now I could see myself trying to work with her, but without that support I just can't do it. I'm seeing a therapist currently to talk about it, but I only see her twice a month usually.

What makes this so hard is that my mom has mental health issues of her own; she doesn't really have many friends (or maybe she does, she never talks to me about what's going on in her life), she talks constantly with my grandmother about me and about anything else that's bothering her. When I was younger I would hear her crying in the middle of the night. I'm scared of distancing myself from her because I don't know what she would do. She says she loves me, but she is just so toxic and emotionally abusive especially now, I need to get away and I don't know what to do.

I hope this didn't come across as too much of a ramble.",22Feb2020,1

A couple days ago he's been having lots of nosebleeds and again he's insisting that he's fine.

I walked back to the home he was in front of to try talking to them to see if they could tell him to keep it down. He pulled up again and started saying ""What the f*** is wrong with you?"" I told him we have rules and he said ""I don't f***ing live here and I don't give a f*** about the rules."" The tenant came out and I believe told him to keep it down.

311,"So, me and my online friend always play games together on Friday since that’s the only time he’s allowed to play but sometimes his parent allows him to play on Saturday and Sunday or special occasion. He’s always the one who invites me to play with him and obviously I would always accept it happily. However, since last week, he has been constantly going off after inviting me to play with him. It’s alright that he’s doing it, but the thing is I have to sacrifice a lot just to play with him. So, the first time that he stood me up, he told me that his mom doesn’t let him play even though his dad allows him to. I travelled an hour+ back to my home just so I could play with him since I was at my parent house. He could have told me earlier so I didn’t have to rush home but no, he just had to tell me on the time that we were supposed to play. Alright, fine. 

He then asked me if I wanted to play the following day since it’s presidential day and I agreed to. I have school the next day since I’m not from the same country as he is and I had to wake up at 5A.M (time zone difference) just to play with him but I got stood up again. He just told me “Sorry, I don’t think I can play now.” Alright, fine. Not surprised, just disappointed. 

And again, yesterday he asked me to play with him and I agreed to with high hopes that he would really play with me but I’m left disappointed again today. What’s worst? He didn’t even tell me that he’s not gonna play with me. He even told me at 1:15PM that he would be playing with me in 45 minutes. I’ve been waiting for him since then and now it’s literally 3:15pm. He should be sleeping by now since it’s 11:15pm for him. He usually play CSGO on faceit so we can check their match history there and I found out that he was still playing on 2:30 when he was supposed to be playing with me. He lost his last two matches so he was probably annoyed or something but he could have at least told me instead of leaving me like that. I had an appointment yesterday near my parent house and I was supposed to go back to my parent house since it’s weekend but I travelled all the way back to my house just so I could play with him the next day but I’m just left alone like this again. I’m not mad or anything but I’m really disappointed and idk what to do anymore. Any advice? Should I continue to accept his invitation to play games?",22Feb2020,1
312,"I suppose I’ve been an “over achiever” my entire life. I took pride in my unrelenting standards and viewed perfectionism as one of my strengths. I graduated as valedictorian from a top university... I always give 110% in everything I do.

I am a bit of a workaholic And being a junior member of the team, there is plenty of work to go around. I am always happy to stay late and take on new projects. Everything was seemingly on the right track until our old manager retired and a new manager took over. 

This new manager is the opposite personality type as me and told me today that I work too hard. She said she can’t see me “getting to the next level” until I learn to delegate. She says that sometimes deadlines don’t have to be met and that I have to learn to selectively let things slide and pass things off. Problem is, I am one of the most junior members on the team and nobody has capacity. I find it hard to respect people that just “delegate” all day. 

My entire life I put in the work and it’s paid off. Now, to make it to upper management I have to learn to find ways to avoid work? I realize that I probably sound young and naive but I am genuinely confused and hurt over this advice.

However, Jesus Christ, my girlfriend places her so much higher above me. We’ve almost hit the one year mark and I thought it would get better, but it hasn’t.  The best friend gets so much more time with her physically and then gets more screen time than me. I know this because I’ll send her a message and she won’t respond, but then the best friends brother will be on a ps4 party chat and I’ll hear the best friend talking to my girlfriend while I’m still left on delivered. Also, the best friend gets snaps of her actual face and her acting all cute like wtf. Jesus, why can’t I get some of that? I only know this because she sometimes accidentally  sends them to me and says “whoops, wrong person” which usually kinda hurts.  I mean, I’m just jealous of the best friend.  I remember how she would just dance with her best friend while I’ll just stand there watching. This has happened multiple times.

319,"i was 21 when i was abused and im 28 now. i live at home with my two older sisters and little brother and mom (we're too poor to live on our own) so we make it work together. anyway, my sister (29) is doing something, a habit we'll call it, that i cant really share, that triggers the unwanted memories and feelings of the time when i was raped. ive told her so many times to stop the habit, and my oldest sister has even told her to give up the habit because it's causing me great distress, but she kinda just doesnt get it and never apologizes and instead plays victim. so ive resulted in hiding in my own house when she starts her habit. 

im in misery. i cant look at her without hatred, hurt, and betrayal. everyone would call us ""twins"" when we were kids because we looked so alike and we shared so much in common as kids but when she got in her teen years she kinda started doing her own way and got involved with a perverted guy online and has since been maintaining a relationship with him.. hes absolutely changed her for the worse, its like shes not even my sister anymore.  

but since the house is so small, i have to play civil and be sisterly with her and it kills me every time because to her, her habit is far more important to her than my pain and mental health.

ive had suicide attempts in the past and sometimes self harm to release the pent up aggression her blatant disrespect to my pain causes. i have lashed out at her a few times, ive went the nice way with her. my mom got involved. the whole family is begging her to put her habit away but she refuses. so my only choice is to live with her, be civil with one another for the sake of not creating drama (cuz frankly i cant take anymore drama than i've already been thru) and just swallow it all with a shit eating grin, for her. 

what can i do in a situation like this? has anyone else ever dealt with a stubborn, somewhat cruel mule? and how do i get over the fact that she loves her habit more than me?",22Feb2020,1

321,"So I'm pretty sure that I've ""found"" myself (I'll get more into doubts in a bit). I recently realized that as long as I can be happy from moment to moment, nothing else matters in life. I can let go of all the bad emotions, because I don't have an obligation to hold onto them. The present moment should be enjoyed like a glass of fine wine, bitterness and all. I'm not afraid of anything anymore. I could be walking down the street, get mugged/beaten at gunpoint, and just kinda be chill with the fact that the poor guy prolly had no other choice. Nothin' personal (not that I wouldn't be a screaming, flailing bitch in the moment). And I also realized that all these figures around me, who (up to this point) I'd caricaturized/""otherized"" in my mind (such as super-famous celebrities, historical figures, serial killers/crazy villains, etc) are actually just normal people, equal to me in every regard, uncertainly making their way through life the way I am. Maybe they're more talented, attractive, or intelligent than me, but the ""mystique"" surrounding the images we associate with those stereotypes (and a tooon of others), merely represent our EXPRESSION of those emotions, not the reality. And thus, I'm not afraid of people who are ""better"" than me, anymore. I've found personal security, even though I'm a kind've a fat loser. 

Anyway, the concern arises once I consider my family's mental health history. I believe both sides carry bipolar disorder, and my sister had manic episodes when she reached my age (I just turned 21). I'm on cloud nine right now, I feel absolutely liberated and overjoyed, coming out of a year of miserable, depressed anxiety, locked in my studio apartment, unable to even look in the mirror. It feels like the universe fairy blessed me with its miracle wand. Boom! Instant happiness, hope, and self-love/comfort. It could be legit! I feel pretty confident that my new mindfulness habits of living in the moment are genuine positive changes. But there's one detail that really puts me off I guess.

I'm an illustrator and concept artist, about to graduate my senior year of art college. Art is, and has always been, my life passion. If you're a creative person, you probably understand what ""flow"" is. Y'know when you get completely immersed into the rhythm/feeling of whatever creative thing you're doing (drawing, dancing, singing, instrument-playing, writing, composing, acting, etc), feel crazy inspired, and produce your very best work? That's basically been my life as of late! I feel incredibly creative and inspired all the time, it's truly awesome. It might have to do with my being mindful, and learning to draw my own inspiration from each given moment, but it could ALSO just be my brain being ""fucky"", and making me feel so happy that, well, of course things seem to be going well! I have some degree of confidence that I am lucid, but what I've read about Hypomania seems pretty characteristic of what I'm experiencing. I could use some outside judgement to be sure. I've been pretty talkative in this post, which is characteristic of Hypomania (as well as hyper-productivity). I still need sleep, though. No risky decisions yet. Poor spending habits, but that's nothing new.

Definitely not looking for an expert opinion or diagnosis, just some opinions will do.

Thanks in advance!

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR 

I've found a profound sense of personal security, and am experiencing lots of creative inspiration as a result of being more mindful, but the good things could just be Hypomania. Prolly not, but it's not the kinda thing you wanna brush under the rug",22Feb2020,1

She asked what do i want to do so i say im kinda hungry. We walk to her car and were talking about some food places and some more class stuff. We get in her car and still talk about some art stuff and all that. After a couple of minutes into driving she tells me ""just so you know, i dont like you"". In my head i just thought to myself that im a dumbass and had too much optimism. Despite my thoughts, i say ""its okay i just thought we had a lot in common"". I didnt look at her face but i think she felt bad in some way or another. I was just trying to be friend material because normally ive been told by family and some old friends that im a coldhearted fucking asshole. i dont think i did anything for her to dislike me. I brought up why she even trusted me to be in her car. And she tells me she can tell that im a genuine person. Whatever that means. After some more conversing we pull up to a ramen place in her neighborhood. i see a pho place next door and wanted to try it. So we go there instead. The food sucked but we had a good conversation about some past experiences and times we did some crazy shit. We laughed a lot and showed eachother our art. I had a great time and i feel that she did as well. we leave and go inside a thrift store in the same plaza and talk about clothes and check their deals. We both get bored and go back to her car. We see a midget. I was happy. She tells me she has to go to her place to let her dog out. So we pull up to her house and i ask if its weird if i just go inside house like that. She said yeah its fine nobody is home. I felt relief because if ihad to meet her family when i dont even know her too well it would be super fucking awkward.(i try to avoid awkwardness at all costs cause its my biggest fear). She says her dog will bark at me and hates men. I go in and see her dog. I get down and kind of squat like a gopnik. her dog comes up to me and loves me. She is surprised. Then she lets her dog out and we leave her place to give me a ride home. We talk the entire way through and she gets lost even with google maps in hand. We end up talking about her dark sense of humor and sexual things one of her friends talks about. What i learn from all this talking is that we are basically the same person. She says shes an asshole who forgets everything, and all of her likes and dislikes line up exactly with mine(no bullshit). We laughed a lot of the way back to my place. Once we get there she just says get out. I make some smart remarks till her phone rings and its her mom. I then say hi loud as fuck so her mom can hear. She tells her to call her back. And looks at me. After she hangs up and gather my stuff out of the back seat i say ""give me your number"". I didnt mean to sound like such a dickhead but i suck with goodbyes and it just kind of slipped. She happily gives me her number and tells me she'll text me. I get out and say bye or whatever. She drives off. After and hour or 2 i do get a text from her and we talk about some anime. I think she got bored of texting and started sending some two worders. I tell her im gonna sleep and she says goodnight. 

At this point its been a day or two since she said goodnight, and i need advice on what the fuck i do next. Sorry for my terrible writing skill i just suck at anything english and no im not bi lingual. I appreciate any support.",22Feb2020,1
326,"I don’t even know where to fucking start. But I can’t sleep. I can’t think straight at work. I can’t do anything. All I can do is just accept the fact i’ve ruined my life. Here’s my fuckin story. 

I’m gonna start at the beginning, and it might be a long one, so, hence the title, buckle the fuck up. 

Over 5 years ago, my cousin started dating this guy, let’s call him Brad. She dated Brad for about 5 months, I believe. Maybe less. Maybe just a bit more (like a month longer). And their relationship wasn’t that good. She lied to him a lot, probably cheated on him, I’m not 100% sure but she definitely stayed the night with another man, and their relationship ended quickly after that. She didn’t get him anything for Valentines day and practically used him. He quit his job to spend more time with her, which she just responded with picking up more hours at her already 12 hour long job. He practically was a babysitter and a maid. He just cooked, cleaned and changed diapers. During this time I lived with her, and him and I did not cross any lines, just helped each other with these duties and etc. The most he ever did for me was just buy me an xmas gift, as he did for my siblings. Anyways, her and brad broke up and immediately stopped talking and she immediately moved on to another guy. 

So, lets fast forwards 3 years. Brad had left town and I hadn’t heard from him at all besides bumping into him walking his dog at one point. And we just exchanged hello’s and I pet the dog and it ended there. 2 years after that Brad posted on Snapchat, which for some odd reason I still had him as a friend on (honestly i never delete people and he barely posted so i wasn’t aware I still had him), that he was back in town visiting family for a bit and I decided to just ask how he was doing. That xmas when he bought me a gift was the first xmas after my grandmother had passed and because of hospital bills, my mom couldn’t afford to get me much and I was crying because of it all, and he gave me a game console that I wanted and a bunch of games. So I wanted to be nice to him because I never forget kind actions especially ones like that. We had small talk and a few days after that he asked if i was free to get lunch. It was summer and I had nothing going on, and if there’s one thing I know is that I never turn down free food. We went to Moe’s and he paid for me and we just caught up in the most platonic way ever, but deep down I couldn’t stop thinking about how attractive he was, but I pushed the thoughts away and I went home. Out of nowhere he texted asking if i’d wanna do it again, and he called me pretty. I told him i’d enjoy getting food, but it’s weird if we talk like that because I don’t want to disrespect my cousin. 

Fuck it, Im just gonna jump ahead to the point where he stopped somewhere for gas and kissed me in the car (yes, he asked first and i nodded but i still wasn’t expecting it). I couldn’t even think before I was kissing him back. And as soon as he got out of the car I laughed. I laughed so hard I cried because of how weird I thought it was. But then, I stopped. Because I wanted more. I resisted as much as possible but it happened again. You can probably tell where this story is going. 

Anyway.. I have to skip ahead again, we’re dating now. I realized when it came time for him to leave, my heart hurt. I didn’t want him to go. And he just asked me to be his girlfriend and I just agreed. I wasn’t thinking, but I sure as Hell don’t regret it. I don’t want to break up with him, and I won’t. He’s attractive, the nicest guy ever, he literally has no negative connotation at all. But fuck, he dated my cousin for 5 months, 5 years ago. 

Lord, Reddit, please, HELP ME. I do not know what the fuck to do. I can not bring myself to tell my cousin what happened. Or what’s happening. Is it so bad that I fell in love with him? Is it okay because it was 5 years ago? Is it not okay at all?! Either way, no matter what I do, I lose everything. Ill either lose him or my family. I truly don’t believe Ill ever find anyone better than him nor do I want to. And for god’s sake please just don’t make a mockery in the comments. I need help. I might even need therapist help. But im in love and me and Brad both deserve a win. We deserve each other. I love my cousin though and I don’t want to lose her. I just dont see a winning solution here. Im at a complete loss. Please just help. I can’t sleep, I can’t think. It’s ruining my day to day as our relationship progresses.",22Feb2020,1
327,I was able to piss off my toxic friends by saying 'no'. It was the perfect opportunity I was waiting for until I messed it up. I got awkward as they were trying to ignore me and accidentally revealed that I was heading to the counselor in an attempt to escape the scene which got them all concerned about me. Now they're back to talking to me because they think something's wrong and that's probably why I was behaving indifferent to them.

328,"I got married young after getting my GF (now wife) pregnant And then married very quickly after meeting her, (pregnant within a month or 2 and married while pregnant), I have never felt strongly about her romantically but have wanted to make it work, I grew up in a good home, parents had good marriage I want the same for my kids. When we got married we were still basically still getting to know each other. I know her well now and we have had a good marriage, I just don't feel romantically about her, I want us to be friends but I fell we just are not compatible as a couple. just in different humor, certain values are a little different, and she doesn't have the qualities that really make me fall for someone.

Now I have gotten to know someone else and she is exactly what I want in a partner. I keep developing feelings for her, and I think she likes me too. She knows I'm married and I don't think would do anything knowing that. I don't want to be someone who cheats and won't make a move on this girl, I can't say for sure I would be able to fight the urge if she happened to make a move though.

When me and my wife have disagreements, fights, we can handle it like adults talk it out. from everyone else point of view we have a good marriage. I know she would be hurt if she knew I didn't want to be with her, and she is from a family and culture that does not view divorce very well and she is a decent person and I don't want to cause any judgement from people in her family.

I keep wishing I could pursue the person I have feelings for, but don't want to cheat, and I wouldn't be able to give my kids exactly the upbringing I wanted for them. I don't wish anything bad on my wife, I still want us to be on good terms I just have never been able to develop the same feelings for her. I have been keeping this to myself the whole time, and this is the first time I have put all my thoughts into words on this, I hope it's comprehensible enough.",22Feb2020,1

336,"So I was at a bar tonight and I was having a good time with some friends, till next think I know, a guy grabs me around my lower waist (above my butt). Straight afterwards he proceeds to shove me to make room (bars r crowded). I was pretty upset about this so I decided to give him an elbow to the back because I felt that his unwanted touch and shove were unnecessary. 

Next thing I know I see my guy friend mouthing to someone to calm down (telling the guy who touched and shoved me). I turn around and defend myself (yes everything happened quickly) and say “why did you touch me or even shove me??” And “do you have a problem?”. Him and his two guy friends laugh at me and the guy who did it won’t even look at me. The guy who did it only tried to talk/mouth to my guy friend (while also laughing) saying something along the lines that she is crazy. I’m not sure how my guy friend responded. We left after that. 

First, I’m frustrated cuz the guy that touched me wouldn’t even look at me and him and his friends treated me as a joke, not taking me seriously (when I had 2 beers at the time). Second, the guy would only talk/look at my guy friend, treating me like I was his property and his responsibility. 

The whole situation made me very upset. I felt like a joke (as a woman especially) and none of my friends backed me up or defended me tbh. The guy friend was laughing as he was talking w the guy most of the time. I just don’t know how to handle this situation and was wondering for advice.

After thinking more about it, the more guilty I feel. I haven't signed any paperwork yet, so I was debating whether to reject the offer or not?

350,"Im currently in High school.

I don't slack on my homework, I had all A's (except for a 2 -A and a B) last semseter, and Im in one AP class.

But this semester, I feel like I'm doing the same amount of work, yet I'm working even more. First semester I had the same work load, but I at least had 2 days in the weekend, and maybe worked a bit on Sunday. 
But this time around, I literally have only one free day a week, (if im lucky) the rest of my time in doing homework. From the moment I wake up, to the moment Im going to sleep (10-11pm) I'm Doing Fucking Homework Every Day.
And it doesn't help that I have ADHD, so doing the work was already a nightmare. The pills make me a zombie, so forget even trying to have fun at school and talking to friends.
Math is my undoing, a big time consumer, and the thing that got me through it, was the teacher giving us the awnser keys. I would utilize it, teach my self baised off the awnser key, its how I learn best in math. But nope, she took it away from the class. I asked her if she could make an exception for me (she knows I work hard), and she said no. But i could ""stay after and before school for extra help"". I don't know what suburban utopia she grew up in, where every High School student had a car, but she sure as hell isn't in it right now. Because I don't have a car, and would have no way in hell to do that bullshit every day. And even if I did, I don't have the time to dick around like that. 
And wouldn't you know, the first test she doesn't give us the awnser sheet for the assignments preceeding it, I bomb the test (-C). Wouldn't you fucking know it.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
So basically, what I want is some advice to 

1. Make me get my work done faster (besides more adderall)
2. Some asvice on how to persuade her to give me the awnser key again. Or maybe a way to get the awnsers to the worksheet (I swear to god don't say photomath). Id prefer the first one though.

I have to wake up at 6:30 AM, and it is currently 2:40 AM. For the last - idk - 6 years? I’ve been in a mental slump where I just don’t care at all enough to do anything about it. I literally can’t get the motivation to care, and I don’t know how to snap myself out of it. I know I just have to get up and do it. I’m aware I do. But I’m lazy, so excessively so that I’m well aware of my fatal decision to ignore important things like commitments at work and healthy decisions. I’m morbidly obese and smoke a pack a day, and I’m well aware I can’t breathe!!  I just don’t know how to get where I need to be. I don’t know what can snap me out of something like this. 

Also my friends and I are very passionate about League, and we have Clash tomorrow and they’re relying on me but I can’t sleep and I don’t get off until 5:30 and I have an errand to run at 7 which will take about an hour, which doesn’t leave me a lot of time to nap to prep for it. Idk I just don’t know what to do I feel like I’m going insane wallowing in self pity because of my own decisions because being aware of it is for some reason not enough for me to pull myself out I just don’t care enough about my life to do anything I guess

TLDR; what should I do if I have to wake up in 3 and half hours?",22Feb2020,1
359,"Hi, hello. Nice to meet you all. I never really go onto sad reddits or help reddits or reddit at all normally but right now I don't know what to do. I got fired for missing too much work and going in early too much since they were scheduling me at 7 AM and it was a nightmare to try and wake up and work 8 hours on 2 hours of sleep. got expelled because I wasn't logging into cyber school enough since I'm just fucking lazy and hate school. Between work and school my mental health isn't too great anyways, I've had anxiety and depression for a while and constantly scared I've got like, idk autism or something. Can't get into therapy since my mother refuses to schedule me an appointment anywhere and I have to rely on her since I can't drive to appointments myself since up until about a month ago my dad wouldn't let me get my learners permit since my grades were so shit. I have like, 3 IRL friends and probably 5ish internet friends since I alienated all my IRL friends a couple years back by going out with someones ex. I consistently ruin shit with internet friends by making dumb moves that they are not okay with, understandably so. My room's a mess, I don't do anything except go to work and hang out with friends when I can but both are rare these days, well work doesn't happen anymore but still. I'm overweight, the 4 teeth in the top of my mouth are quite quickly losing enamel, my hair is usually greasy since I can't find the motivation to get in the shower. I rarely visit my grandparents, avoid a good majority of my family like the plague, and was completely unable to cry at my great grandmas funeral due to repressing the pain so much. I'm fucking rotting and failing already and I'm only 17. Sorry this was such a ramble but, goddammit. What kind of advice can anyone offer me? and, I'm sorry if this breaks any rules please do feel free to remove it if so. Thanks.",22Feb2020,1
360,"My dad for all my life has been paranoid about someone hurting me. He’s very controlling, he still is even now that I’m moved in with my boyfriends parents. Anyways since I was getting memories I remember my dad being paranoid about someone kidnapping me. He would make sure to check all the locks in the house, show me where the gun was every night before going to bed, would check every window and door, would set the house alarm, make sure the dog was sleeping with me. So this became my routine every night until I moved out at 18. 

He did and still is constantly telling me that there are bad people everywhere who want to hurt me, when we’re out in public he has to sit facing towards the door incase someone comes a restaurant to do a mass shooting. He tells me watch before I get out of my car not for other cars but for people who will kidnap me. And it’s really effected my sleep. Guys I can not sleep anymore, now that I’m moved out I can’t do it. And it’s been 2 years... every night I go to bed and am wide awake until the sun is up at 6am. Luckily I don’t have a job right now (well not lucky) but lucky I can sleep or nap during the day when other people are awake. That’s the only time I can fall asleep is when I know I’m not the only one up. 

I don’t think I’ve gotten proper sleep in the past few days because I keep hearing noises at night or think that I see shadows or hear crunches outside of my window. I don’t know how to fix this. How do I??",22Feb2020,1

363,"Me, my BF, and my friend were driving home, and once we entered the neighborhood, BF saw a cat under an RV a few houses down from his. Where we live is pretty stray-heavy, but also close to a LOT of coyotes. My cat has gotten outside before and attacked by one, and small dogs and cats alike are attacked fairly often if they get out or are left outside, it's a concern.

He got the kitty to come to him, and it was obvious from the get go that he had a home somewhere. He's fat, socialized, and very vocal when you talk to it. We brought him into the garage with some food and water, and decided to go out and knock on doors in the neighborhood. 

Only about 2 out of the 12 houses or so actually answered (it was about 8 pm), and it was too late to take him to the vet to check for a chip, so now he's just chilling until we can get him checked. The plan in progress was to make fliers, share dat cat's mug, check him for a microchip, knock on more doors, and if no one claims him by Sunday to take him to the foundation that a friend of mine recommended. BUT- I've had a couple friends and my BF's mom say that maybe he's just an outside cat and we should let him back outside. He was dirty enough to be an outside cat, and him being uber chubby kinda backs that up. I'm just afraid to turn him loose because: It's supposed to storm tomorrow, he isn't neutered (the stray cat population here is terrible), he has no collar or identification if he's picked up by someone else who might try and keep him, and to be honest, I am really against having outside cats ever since mine got attacked and never recovered. It just doesn't sit right with me to willingly put him back outside. But that last reason is just a me issue and if it's the right thing to do I will.

I really want him to go home! I really think he has a family that's missing him, and we've already posted in lost and found pages on social media, but what should I do? Is it wrong to keep him inside and take him to the shelter if no one claims him? Should we let him back outside? What's the right thing to do here?",22Feb2020,1
364,"My roommate and I have gotten super close the past year, but recently I’ve been extremely annoyed by her.

She’s super unreliable, she’s a complete people pleaser and posts on her snapchat just doing deeds for others but never seems to want to do anything useful when I’m with her. When I have something interesting going on in my life or if something very minor is happening, she has to post about it like she needs to be the center of attention!! She’s admitted to me on Molly she thinks she a sociopath and I don’t know how to feel about that. She never confronts me with any issues she has, she never seems mad or sad. She’s very close minded, doesn’t learn from her mistakes and overall it’s been very off putting being around her because I KNOW she’s being ingenuine for no reason! She’s not very smart, she rarely listens to me and her other friends and is extremely ignorant in most aspects of life...and the ironic thing is, she wants to be a therapist. I’m living with her next year but as of right now, I can’t stand being around her.

370,"My wife is pregnant and just hit the second trimester a few days ago but the thing that bothers me is that, while I am thrilled to have baby girl, I am not so much excited for a baby boy. To which I am concern that I won't be a caring father to the child because of his gender.

I am not saying that I only want a daughter, but just scared that I wouldn't be as excited or enthusiastic as getting a girl. A prime example is that, even with our cats, I am more than happy to give more love and care towards my baby girl cat than my wife's boy cat. The boys (cat) still get the love and scritches from me but I would spend more time on my baby girl cat. but maybe it's just because I raised my cat for years before my wife moved in and brought her cats along so the biased is already there.

There's also maybe the underlying subtle effect that has been instilled in me because of how I was raised. My father was not as much of a father figure even though he was present throughout my entire life. Don't really know how the father and son interaction should be, like how my friends would be able to joke with their dads while I couldn't even make a light conversation with mine. It was easier for me to talk to mom on things. I was also more keen &amp; reluctant to play with my nieces than nephews when they were around.

It also could be that I am scared that my son will be *me* in terms of attitude toward his father because I sure for one wants a family that is both trusting and able to talk with one another with ease than second guessing if he's gonna start lecturing me on things in life.

yes there's also the chance the my daughter will turn out not to be what I expect but couldn't really blame myself if I tried my best as a father and she was just an angsty tean but yeah... don't really know how or what to feel later when we're gonna go get that scan to see if it's a boy or girl.

I just hope that either way, I will be excited to raise my kid well and be there for him/her as long as I am alive.

372,"  
 Ok so for the context is that I have a friend, let’s call her ‘J’ she’s my friend since were grade 6 (2016) and until now. I moved to another country and she moved to the US. She went to school there and met a girl that lives next door. Imma call her ‘A’. She rides the same bus as her when they’re going to school. In my point of view, they seem really close since ‘A’ has a lot of pictures of ‘J’.

  
  Around January 30 ‘J’ and I decided to have a break because we talked a lot. You know, like the feeling when you see or talk to the same person every day you get exhausted or like tired? That’s what we felt we talked a lot over the past 3 or 4 years. It’s like every day we chat with each other and stuff. So we decided to have a break. WE decided to not talk for a week. WE both agreed. Then after the week I texted her and said sorry and she texted back saying she actually missed talking to me. The break started on January 30 and ended on February 7. We both started to talk like normal. It FELT like it passed two months ago or something. Oh, and I heard that ‘A’ reads ‘J’s messages.   
‘A’ added me on Snapchat. Because I was in her quick add. We talked like normal. Until today February 22 she snapped a picture and the caption said something like “8 months b\*\*ches” and since I was confused I asked “wha” and that’s when she started to rage.""Don't talk to me b\*\*ch"" she said. She said stuff about the break and that I was rude because I told 'J' to not talk to me for a week when we actually agreed to it. She kept insulting me like 7+ times. I have all the screenshot but it's not allowed to put a picture on r/advice.   
 

I don’t really know what to do. If I should tell my friend ‘J’ or just keep quiet. I feel like ‘J’ won’t do anything about it. Well, that’s what I feel because ‘A’ lives right next to her and rides the same bus as her. And I’m pretty sure that if I send the screenshots to ‘J’, ‘A’ will read it. I can’t really tell her to stop hanging out with ‘A’ since it’s her life, not mine. And I really don’t know what to do. Any advice?",22Feb2020,1

395,"I'm in a bit of a complicated situation. I dated a guy for a few years, we lived together and at the time I thought he was ""the one"" and I think he even had an engagement ring picked out but not purchased. We broke up because I realized that I was polyamorous and he wasn't comfortable with being in a poly relationship but didn't want to ""hold me back"" (he's the one who ended things, I didn't want to). We were separated for 3 years, both finding ourselves in other fairly serious relationships during that time. Both of those relationships have since ended and we found ourselves reconnecting about 6 months ago. It started as just friends but pretty quickly escalated to the point where we were hanging out multiple times a week and were physical. I knew pretty much right away that I was falling in love with him all over again. I started noticing things, behaviors, that made me think he was feeling the same way. I waited for a while hoping he would say something first, but I knew from our previous relationship that he wasn't always great at putting his feelings into words, so eventually I said screw it. I told him I loved him. And his response was... Not what I was expecting. It wasn't negative but it also wasn't reciprocal. I spent a good deal of time kind of obsessing over it, and finally I told him I needed to know how he felt about me, whether good or bad. And so he told me, he liked me a lot. More than most people. But he said he didn't love anyone the way he loves his family. And now here is the part where I'm stuck. I know what he was trying to say, logically, but my heart keeps clinging to hope. I keep thinking, he's a man who is very particular with his words when he's trying to convey something important, so why would he use that phrasing? Did he choose those words to try to do the least amount of damage to me, or did he choose those words because he does love me and doesn't want to admit it? (he also told me he doesn't want to be in a relationship because he doesn't think we have the same end goal and it would be too painful, he doesn't realize I actually do want the same things he does but I'm too scared to tell him) He is always doing things to show me he cares deeply for me, which makes it easier for my brain to cling to this idea. But honestly holding onto this hope is painful, and I would rather not have it. So far the only thing I've thought of that might help, is asking him to tell me flat out that he doesn't love me. I want him to say the words, with no room for misinterpretation, so I can finally let it go. I am just not really sure if that would be a crappy thing to do or not, it feels like asking that of him might be too much. So, any advice for other ways to go about this, or telling me whether or not asking that would make me a jerk, that's what I'm looking for.

Tl;Dr: I'm in love with a guy who kind of said he doesn't love me, but worded it in a way that's kind of vague. Am I a dick if I ask him to say he doesn't love me without mincing words? Are there other ways for me to stop hoping that he actually does love me?",22Feb2020,1
396,"I love my Mom with my whole entire heart, she's a beautiful person inside and out, but whenever I try to talk to her about important things in *my* life she'll always bring it back to her. As in, I'll say ""Hey Mom I met this really gr-"" and she'll start going on about something in her life for about 20 minutes. I won't be able to get a word in. I feel like I don't get to talk to her, don't get me wrong I love hearing about her life but I just feel like it's always about her. I don't feel like I get a chance to tell her about me. It kind of makes me sad, I feel like she's not interested in what I have to say. Sometimes I'll just sit there saying 'yeah' while she goes on about something and it'll just make me feel really awful because she'll just cut me off.",22Feb2020,1
397,"I’ll start by saying that this is a throwaway account because we have a mutual friend who would prob see this post and give me a hard time

I’m (15m) and my crush (15f) said she loved me. I was drunk the other night at a party and ended up snapping her that I loved her. The next day she mentioned it but we never really talked about it. We snap all the time, like constantly and we hang out at my house and cuddle sometimes. It’s all felt pretty surreal and great. But I don’t know how I feel about this. 

For context it was like 11:00 pm so she sent me “good night (pet name) love you ❤️” so I responded with “good night (pet name) love you too ❤️” 

The problem here is that she’s not dating till April (her b-day) and idk if she ment love like as a friend or like LOVE LOVE. I am like riding the high of this and scared out of my mind. And I asked if she was down to hang agin and she was stoked to.

I’m just confused and any advice would be nice",22Feb2020,1
398,"(Sorry for the long story ahead)
Ever since I remember my mother has been a very strict parent. Although she rules with an iron fist it was toleratable but for the past 2 years it has changed to the worse (i’m 22 now). 
I had dropped out of college once because I really disliked the field I chose and after I told my mom she offered to pay (after months of hating me) for one third of my tuition if I wanted to enroll again. I accepted and after the school year started she became more and more controlling using the excuse that since she paid for my college she owns me now. Because of all the pressure I pulled all my savings, paid for the rest of my yearly tuition and offered to return her money, which didn’t help at all since she just refused to take it from me. Well I finished my first year and it was all good during the summer. I was working a part time job ever since I started college so I saved up quite a sum, allowing me to pay for my next year, and not having to rely on my mother again. 
Maybe it was because I showed that I can survive without her, the attitude turned for the worse. It would start that once a month she would find something to complain over, that I’m doing wrong, even if it would be just a couple of papers out of place on my desk. It escalated to her screaming at me every day, telling me what a disappointment I am and how useless I am, even though I’m doing well at uni and passing my exams. I had started planning to move out for a while now and it’s coming up soon (next week most likely) and I’m getting more and more anxious, having panic attacks as well, thinking what my mom’s reaction will be when I leave. I don’t even know if I should tell her in advance that I’m moving out, because I’m scared of an outburst. She has threatened to hurt me multiple times, saying she doesn’t even care if she has to go to jail or whatever. Also she has said multiple times that if I don’t like it living here I can find another way and take care of myself. So should I tell her I’m leaving or just remove myself quietly from the household?

(For a bit of context: my parents are divorced and I don’t tell my dad about what’s happening because he never really helped much in the past - he wasn’t able to. Also my mom remarried and I don’t have much of a relationship with my step-dad, he moslty just gives me nasty looks if we cross paths.)",22Feb2020,1

402,"So I will start with details. I live in BC canada and I have had my N for a year and a half (was planning on getting my full license soon). I work as a pizza driver as one of my jobs so I need my license to pay for rent. My home town is a 3 hour drive away. The other day I was driving home because of a family emergency thing with my grandpa who isn't doing too well, and I was a little stressed out because I was on a bit of a time crunch. I was at about the half way point outside of a city and was just matching the speed of traffic, and really not looking at my speedometer or anything. I got pulled over by a cop, not even realizing how fast I was going. He not only gives me a speeding ticket (even though there were at least two others that were going the same/similar speeds but I was in the inside lane and he was on the other side), but he also gave me a fine for not displaying my N. The thing is, I worked that morning and my N was on before I started but I didnt check to see if it was when I got off so I had no idea. My driving record is clean by the way, I have never been pulled over or gotten any tickets ever. This was just an unfortunate situation that happened when I was just not paying attention as much as I should have been. Right after I got my ticket, I went to get a replacement N in town. I didn't realize that I can get my license taken away because of just one of the two violations. I will have to restart the whole N process and I really don't want to, but I also need the money for my rent or else I will become homeless because my one job doesn't pay enough. What can I do? I know I will dispute it but will my case hold up in court? How likely is it that the cop shows? I was really respectful and apologetic towards him, as well as honest. Anyone that has had experience, or knowledge about this, can you give me some advice or am I screwed? Am I able to get my full license before the dispute hearing? Is that an option or would I not be able to? Please help me out. Thank you.",22Feb2020,1

406,"Hello im 23 years old i live alone and lost all my friends on account that our whole group split up and went seperate ways. I haven't been very social at all really for many years. I went through a lot of abuse through out my life either from my peers or bad relationships or even my own family who try to use me a lot of the time. But regaurdless of that I've always held myself to high morals and good judgement i have saved 4 lives in my time being alive on earth some risking my own life. I try my best to be better than everyone else who would do such horrible things to me or others and i try my best to fix and help people's problems.

Well this is where i need advice... you see like I said I have been through a lot of abuse and trama i've even witnessed my sister kill herself in front of her kids. That was the first time i ever truly experienced death and i wasn't sure how to process it but it made me so upset that i could hold in my tears and be strong to try and support my family in grief it made me mad at myself because i felt like i should have been grieving but even when i was alone i just couldn't. So it comes to this december 2019 and something really bad for me happened. You see i really have like a small 2 or 4% of people who actually love and care about me but the most important one was my dog. I had her for 13 year's and she had been completely healthy all the way up until the end. Now if it were a natural death i would have been okay with it i could have had some peace with my girl who grew up with me passed on but it wasn't natural our vet got her sick on purpose with medication that had side effects that gave an extremely high chance of gaining a serious infection but the vet lied to me saying there were no side effects. In case your wondering i brought her there because i wanted to ask the vet about dog hair loss and she then perscribed me the medication for her. I followed her instructions exactly and she ended up getting sick immediately. She stopped walking stopped eatting stopped pooing and peeing. I had to try to keep her fed and hydrated through plastic syringes i bought. When i took her to the vet all she did was come in and listen to her heart rate and take her temperature and some how came out exactly with what was wrong with her immediately which was an infection inside her uvula (lady parts) i called so much horse shit from that but i was determined to save my girl. I bought antibiotics i could give to her and liquified it to a paste to try and help her but it wasn't working. She was suffering for 4 days like this so we brought her to the vet to try and see if they could do anything. They then began to charge me 800 dollars JUST to confirm what the doctor said about the uvula infection which turned out to be exactly what she had. Im not a rich man or anything but i tried as hard as i could to try and save my babies life but in the end they wanted 10 thousand dollars to simply do a simple injection giving her a little bit of a healthy dogs blood to fight the infection to save her life... obviously not being rich i couldn't do it especially since they milked my bank account dry and i already took out loans to pay them for everything else and am in debt. A family friend had to come in and pay to put my girl down. My girl couldn't even lift her head up anymore properly she didn't have the strength but the last thing she did with the last of her energy was try to lift her head towards me and stick out her tongue to give me a kiss. I had to help her do that by getting closer. In the end it was just me alone with my dog and as i had my forehead against hers looking into each others eyes they killed my baby. My dog my baby my girl she meant the entire world to me i been through so much bad things keep trying to give and help and the world just keeps taking everything i love away from me like its testing me to see how far i can keep going..... well i will tell you this.... for the first time in my life i truly truly wanted to die i wanted everything to end i just don't want to be on this planet anymore i want to go to heaven and be with my girl again. I asked the vet twice if the medication had any side effects that could have done this and she lied to my face every time. 3 days later i found the name of the medication and found out about the side effects and how the vet got my dog sick purposely just to milk me dry of my funds.... i lost my girl to human greed and im so poor and in debt now that i can't afford a lawyer and even if i could i couldn't possibly win against a doctors lawyers, i couldn't even have my girls ashes because they wanted to charge me 300 dollars just to sweep her up and give her to me i said why did they have to charge me for that they said because they have to sweep up the ashes even tho they were gonna do that no matter if i paid or not. On top of that it is now impossible to get my girls ashes because they put her down for a communal cremation so her ashes are mixed with other peoples dogs so now i can't get them even if i wanted to..... my girl was the world to me i could lose everything still have my dog and i would be fine my dog was one of the only living things to actually truly love me on this planet and now im all alone.

 I seen a doctor and they diagnosed me with deep depression and PTSD they gave me anti depression meds but that didn't work, i also developed hearing voices in my head telling me to do bad things. I used to have these voices in high school but they didn't tell me to do bad things they just drove me nuts annoying me with bad jokes and puns about everything going on currently around me as it happened. But that went away quickly so i thought nothing of it as i always ignored it. Now it is back and tells me things to make me feel worse like i could have done something ANYTHING to not let that woman kill my girl. To somehow stop her from getting away with this crime. That i had subcome to the ultimate failure of losing my child to an evil person and then i wanted to die more. Im religious however and killing nyself would make it so i cannot be forgiven by god and accepted in to heaven to be with my dog and loved ones again. So i keep going until the day this horrible world currupted with evil finishes me on its own.

My doctor perscribed me anti depression meds and anti psycotics to help eith the voices and in a few days i will be going to therapy. My doctor said that the medication can help me or it can make me even worse and that if i stop taking the medication too soon it would get even worse. As you might suspect it didn't work and it did make me worse so I've bo choice but to stop but the withdrawl is making it even worse now and the voices are louder than ever. I would never do anything bad to other people i have to be better that was my passion and still is to just be the best me i can be to try and be a role model for others by never giving up and always finding solutions to problems. But 3 nights ago it finally got to me. 

I am dog sitting at one of my sisters house while she and her family is on vacation. I came to the house played with the dog and everything took care of him and yeah just normal stuff. But then i had to go to the bathroom one night and the voices came back trying to convince me again to do bad things that I would NEVER normally do. I don't know why but i couldn't control myself and i gave in and did something bad. I went into my nieces bedroom that was right in front of the bathroom went in her dresser and started smelling and licking one of her underwear. I have NO sexual attraction to her she is turning 18 and I have ZERO idea why I did it why I gave in to what the voices convinced me to do. I went and washed my mouth with water and soap wondering what the fuck is wrong with me why did i do that. It is driving me crazy and even now as I write this to you all i hear them and they try to convince me that it's okay to do these things BUT IT IS NOT!! i have failed. I know humans are not perfect that we all have our flaws and differences i mean im not going to stand here saying I am a saint i've made mistakes just like everyone else in the world. But this time felt like a real failure that i failed to live up to my own morals and beliefs, that i am not good enough and the light inside my heart is being attacked and bitten by the darkness and it scares me because what if i am not strong... what if i can't keep pushing away the darkness forever. I need help honest truthful advice this isn't who I am who I REALLY am and I don't want to become something im not EVER. Is it the medications just making these problems worse or what?!

416,"


So I liked this girl for like a year (still do) I told her I liked her when I was drunk like 4 months ago. That’s when we started talking a little bit more. But we still had practically no contact apart from the occasional look from across the classroom. But a month ago we went to a party. I was drunk she wasn’t she doesn’t really like it when I drink but when I stared getting less and less drunk we just relaxed on the bed for 2 hours with her head on my shoulder the entire time. That’s when we started texting and sending pictures and such. But the day after she told my friend she just wanted to be friends. Which I found out today. But that’s the confusing part she always asks the teacher if I can sit with her in math class. We get a private room because we both blow ass in math. In the the break we sit on a couch and she is always all over me. With her legs over mine we also hold each other’s hands a little awkwardly for example she takes my hand says “wow your hands are much bigger than mine” than just holds my hand for a few minutes. She asked me if I just liked her or “loved” her I said I loved her (love in my language is basically the best translation but it isn’t that big of a deal as it is in other places like America) then she sent this string of emojis 😊🤭❤️. We always talk about having a movie marathon together. She is usually the one that brings it up. I always say she can come whenever she wants. She says she will come over when she comes home from her vacation. So that’s pretty nice. But we had a small argument about a week ago about my snusing habits which is basically a small package of nicotine you put in your lip. It is basically the same as smokes but with out the lung cancer and the awful smell. She said if I ever did it she would never be my friend again. Of course my friends told me to tell her because she would find out eventually so I told her. She said we could still be friends and that she was joking. But she was mad at me so I told her I’ll give her space. Which she didn’t want but I said I didn’t wanna talk if your just gonna send pictures of your roof that’s when she said OKAY I AM NOT MAD AT YOU. Which practically reverted everything to normal. And we started talking 24/7 again. So do you guys think she likes me or just playing with me?

she has never been in any serious relationship. Neither have I

she told me about a dream where she kissed a stranger once. She sort of inclined it was me

she has never kissed anyone. She did watch a Netflix movie where someone kissed and said omg so cute their kissing then I asked who. Then she said “you and me😉😉😉» 

I left her on read once so she started started spamming the “all I want” song from Olivia Rodriguez and stated it was literally her love life on private snap story. Which is like a half sad love song

We’re both 15. I am male she’s female 

Tl;dr. Told girl I liked her while drunk. Girl tells friends she only wants to be friends but she send all signs she likes me. Texting, constant looks, really touchy, had her head on my shoulder for 2 hours straight, constantly talks about wanting to have a movie marathon",22Feb2020,1
417,"**The entire reason I made this account is to see what other people think of my perspective on this.** ***Trigger warning: Mentions of self harm and attempted suicide***

**TBF: Toxic Best Friend**

**RBF: Replacement Best Friend**

**IF: Innocent Friend**

**IF2: Innocent Friend No. 2**

A few years back my IF was in a very unstable mindset and would often self harm as a way to relax. TBF would often tell her to kill herself as a joke supposedly unknowing of IF's mental state. A few days after IF told me about it. So I asked TBF to see if she would admit any of it to me. TBF admitted to saying it but ""Only as a joke"" because she thought IF was doing it for attention. With a little convincing she decided to come up with me to the school counselor to report IF for her self harm problems. This was the first time I found out that TBF wasn't as friendly with everyone as she was with me. I forgave her because she had made things right by trying to fix IF's self harm issue.

After this incident we went through a series of arguments over small things which she would always guilt trip me about later. Saying things like ""You're being so mean to me right now, I don't even know what I did wrong."", or ""I'm going to start crying thanks to you!"" These responses always made me feel sorry for TBF and I'd usually apologize and things would go back to being semi-normal.

Last year, TBF tried to overdose on painkillers, she was gone for months and no one knew what had happened, when I finally saw her again she told me she had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and severe depression. I welcomed her back kindly but the peace didn't last long. Constantly she would gloat about how many pills she took as if it was something to brag about. IF2 said, ""I'd rather take an entire bottle of ibuprofen than study for this next test."" and TBF happily responded with ""I did that! 58 pills to be exact."" and then smiled about it as if we were supposed to be proud of her or think it was funny. IF2 and I got very quiet and it felt very awkward for the next few minutes.

Very recently TBF and I got into an argument about me having more than one best friend. TBF used the excuse ""We've known each other for over 7 years, you've only known IF for 4!"" I explained to TBF that it's not about how long the friendship lasted, but about the quality of the friendship. TBF had the audacity to tell me that she thinks our friendship should mean more than my and IF's friendship because, ""we've been through more together"". I tried to politely tell her that it's very toxic to think that because TBF shouldn't feel like she's better than IF. She then explained to me that she's scared of losing me to someone else, which could be true but I also think she could be trying to guilt trip me back into her trap of pity.

Another thing that happened recently is that she uses her mental illness to get out of me being negative. I tell her something that she should stop doing for example, she was just sending me posts on Instagram of funny videos, I told her that I was done looking at videos because I had already seen most of them in other places. She replied with, ""Dia, I'm depressed, I want support from my best friend, not for her to be a bitch.""

TBF and IF have always been against each other for my affection. TBF would often tell me that IF is too clingy and if I didn't tell her TBF would make sure IF knew how much people didn't like her hogging me. TBF to this day still brings it up out of nowhere that I'm her best friend when our conversation had nothing to do with me, TBF or friendships in general. IF constantly cries about how much she dislikes TBF and doesn't feel safe around her. IF isn't willing to forgive TBF for telling her to kill herself either. TBF is ready to apologize over and over for it but IF hates her for what TBF did in the past and will not have it. TBF will also only bring up IF when mentioning that I should only be having her as a best friend despite the fact that I have a third one.

**Now instead of explaining from my perspective I'm going to say some things that may have caused TBF to act out like this.**

Since TBF was young both of her parents would yell at her for not being a perfect child like her other siblings. Even now her mother belittles her for not being a normal child and wishing that the last of her offspring would be something to be proud of.

Not only that but many people at school don't like her whatsoever, recently I overheard her name over the school announcements and saw a number of people physically react negatively. As in looking to the person next to them to see if what they just heard was real, flinching, having an upset expression, and one person was glaring at the speaker. There's no doubt TBF hasn't noticed since she has issues with not being good enough, being liked by everyone, and paranoia.

TBF is also on mood stabilizers that can make her extra cranky when she has to change the times she takes her pills. TBF's therapist is still trying to find the best prescription for her because finding correct medication for mental instabilities can be hard. I am not sure if this is true or not. But mental illnesses comes from the brain and not bacteria so it is likely that medications are harder to prescribe.

I may be somewhat of a comforting person to be around for TBF because I would always forgive her for what she did and never tried to make her take the blame for anything like her family did. My mother teats TBF as her own daughter and TBF always gets really excited to see my mother and even calls her mom. My mother like me is very accepting of people and always tries to understand both sides of a situation.

TBF once ran away from home and showed up at my house crying and barefooted to have a safe place to stay. Her parents had yelled at her and he no longer felt safe at home. We allowed her to stay for a few house until she calmed down and drove back home. Where her parents answered the door very tiredly. TBF had run away while her parents were asleep, they didn't fall asleep after she had left. They both thanked us and looked very happy to see TBF.

TBF may see IF as a threat to her friendship with me because she thinks IF will replace her if she doesn't try hard enough, to her I may seem like I'm not putting effort into our relationship but I am working hard in my relationship with IF.

**Some Final Thoughts**

The only reason I'm really hesitating to stop being friends with her is because I don't want to be the reason she attempts suicide again. I know that she's going through a lot and it's very hard for her to make it through all of this but I'm not sure how much longer I can pretend to enjoy her company. I don't want to associate with her anymore because of horrible things she does. I'm thinking of leaving her with someone else as a replacement for me but she's been attached for so long that I don't know if that person will do since they've only known each other for a few months now. I've been considering trying to get the RBF to tell her that I'm actually extremely toxic in hopes that TBF will latch on to RBF because of the simulated trust to tell each other hard news like that. I do care about her mental state and well being, but I no longer enjoy having to talk to her daily and her always asking about making plans.

**TL;DR:**

I want to stop being friends with my toxic best friend because she has said many awful things to me and another one of my best friends. This could be happening because she is bipolar and depressed. I'm only hesitant because I don't want her to try and take her own life again.",22Feb2020,1
418,"Hiya so basically over the past four years I’ve been experiencing symptoms of various levels of bipolar disorder. I’m also chronic anaemic which may also be it? Basically sometimes I’m hella happy and people love me and I talk all the time and I’m dancing and biking and running even tho I hate all of those, I also do dangerously intense things with my body to try and calm my racing mind (which does t work ) and it just ends in me fainting or something. It’s effecting my school attendance too because I cannot concentrate enough to be productive even when I want to be or I feel too low to care . I’ve also been hospitalised for a suicide attempt from a year ago and because of another incident where nobody’s sure what it was but I physically couldn’t move and my brain just didn’t wanna be bother to let my body do anything for 24 hours. I self harm pretty deep and think about that shit like Clock work. Im incredibly impulsive, I move every year, I have a lot of sex with people I know I don’t want sex with, I either sleep not enough and feel fine or too much and feel tired still, I loose interest in people I love for periods of time and I stop caring about things that literally make me who I am sometimes. I My grandmother has been diagnosed as bipolar1 too. 

I been 100% in denial until very very recently and it has kind of suddenly dawned and I’ve done extensive research on it and I match it like a damn identical twin.

But at the same, I am training to be in the aviation field which has ZERO room for a bipolar pilot.. but this is my dream job. I’ve been suppressing  these things for years now and they keep bubbling to the surface and I’m doing that thing where I convince others around me Im not mentally unstable to try and will it true, but it doesn’t work like that. And I keep breaking over and over again. So on Monday I am going to get assessed once and for all for peace of mind or to rip the bandaid off, either or. 

I’m not sure whether o should tank it and ghost them before if they give an official diagnosis or if I should accept it and pick up the pieces after and find something else to do with my life (I’m reasonably young) or if I should just not go all together and maybe trick myself into not thinking about it too much",22Feb2020,1

421,"Last year I was fired from my full time job for reasons that I believe fit the requirements to qualify as an illegal termination. I am currently in the middle of a lawsuit to that effect. About a month and a half after being fired, a professional acquaintance hooked me up with this part time consulting job on a pretty big project that would look great on my resume and definitely be a good move for my career.

Unfortunately, I am finding that apparently I cannot even manage 10-15 hours a week of part time work that is wholly flexible. Apparently I just had a manic episode over the stress, despite the fact that I have no previous mental health history. I was originally diagnosed with anxiety while dealing with the job, and just now have received a diagnoses of Major Depressive Disorder.

I am going to have to re-enter the workforce eventually, and all I can think about is how bad it's going to look that I can't even manage a part time job anymore, even one where for the most part I make my own schedule. Plus, I DO want to be a part of this project and see it through to the end and would be really disappointed to have to drop out. I don't want to have to quit, and the only reason why I think I should is because I'm doing so poorly right now mental health wise. 

I emailed my friend/boss last week to say I was having trouble completing something kind of time specific, and now it's behind to the point where it will look bad. I don't even know if they would even allow me to stay on and if I just accidentally fired myself, although their first response was that they understood and asked how they could be helpful.

I want to keep this job, but I also want to get better. :(",22Feb2020,1

I've been pretty suicidal for the past few months and have been prone to mental breakdowns about it(he knows I'm suicidal). With my humour I try not to attack anyone personally or do anyone damage. The thing is when me and my friend talk he usually tells me to kill myself atleast a few times. He'll say stuff along the lines of ""I genuinely think you should kill yourself"" , I'll say goodnight and he'll say ""I hope you die in your sleep"".

I’ve let these people into my own, bought them gifts,  created didn’t initiatives for them to lean into the company. When they found out I was pregnant they joked about how they want to work from home in my house. They’ve told me that this is the best job they’ve ever had and they are so happy. Long way of explaining it. I care so much about my team that this broke my heart. My new boss is someone that doesn’t really click with me but that’s fine. She changed my job description a lot and has really put a ton of pressure on me. She is obviously taken everyone else’s side throughout this and has told me she will continue to look into these issue but she doesn’t feel confident in me being able to run this team.

I kind of accepted it because y'know, sometimes he needs a break it's whatever. But then when we were talking about what we should do during the week I asked if he wanted to do something on Tuesday, to which he said 'No, you'll still be on your period. Wait till Friday.' this made me really sad. Then it made me super anxious. Now I'm terrified he's using me for sexual things. No matter how busy he was it's never stopped us from staying the night and seeing each other throughout the week. I know it's irrational because he showers me with kisses and hugs and tells me how I mean the world to him and he thinks im beautiful.

431,"Was bringing a few things to my girlfriend. She had to leave almost all of her stuff when she moved. She's a nerd like me so I brought comic books, toys and dvds.

Anyway. Jesus Christ almighty. I drove all the way from Arkansas. My job just wasn't working out. I was working at a call center and it was good money, but you know. The customers talk to you like you're garbage and I just couldn't take that anymore. So I figured I'd get my last pay check, spend some time with my girlfriend for however long I was allowed with just a passport, then come back and find something better (living with my grandma)

Was supposed to be a 14 hour trip. The speed I drive it was more like 18. Anyway, I get here and the guy tells me ""Prove to me you're not planning to live here permanently.""

I didn't know what to say to that, I felt like he was telling me ""Prove to me you're not going to kick a puppy while you're here."" How do I prove that?

I eventually thought of something, my girlfriend told me she can't have someone permanently living with her in her new apartment or she loses the cushy cheap rent deal she's got. I told him that but apparently that wasn't good enough for him. I know six months was a long time but I was really just asking for the maximum possible, I don't know exactly how long I'd be allowed to stay with her before I had to leave or she loses her rent deal.

I told him he could have the address, if I didn't leave he could just come arrest me. He said ""We're not in the business of wasting resources."" 

I literally told him where I'd be living and invited him to take me to jail if I didn't leave when I said but to him that wasn't proof I didn't intend to stay?  This is insane.

He told me if I tried another port they'd take me away in handcuffs and ban me from entering fle two years. I know immigration debates have gotten salty lately but I've never heard of someone getting handcuffs put on them for trying to enter a country legally, going through customs and all that and with a passport.

What do I do? My girl said she's had trouble with the agents at this port so she just went to Detroit. But if he's telling the truth, I'll be banned for two years if I even try it. And it's Saturday morning so I can't get anyone on the phone. So I either have to risk it or spend $100 on a hotel for the weekend.

I went to Canada's immigration website and I got everything they asked for. It never said anything about proving I didn't plan to stay forever. And that's a moot point anyway because I did prove I didn't plan to stay forever. What do they think I'm gonna do, hide in the closet from both her landlord and the cops?

I know I can apply for a temporary visa but they're not answering the phone until Mondays. I know I can apply in person, but this dude at the port here just told me they'd slap the cuffs on me and haul me off if I tried another port, plus ban me for two years so I guess I couldn't get a visa then.

Anyone ever had this issue before?",22Feb2020,1
432,"I work in a hospital cafe. This girl, who I'll call Janae, is our newest coworker. The first day she was here she asked me, ""Can you put this box of ice cream in the freezer for me?"" I did it for her. Then I thought to myself, ""She could've done it herself."" I went back to her and told her next time just put it in the freezer yourself. She said, ""I didn't know where it was and they told me to just give it to you.""

At the end of each day, the cashiers need to clean out the two coffee machines. Using the fruit and vegetable sink, they basically just run water through it until all the brown coffee liquid is out. They have to do it for each one. It takes a little while. They bring it back to one of the kitchen sinks. There are three sinks in the kitchen. The dishwashing sink, the fruit and vegetable sink, and another sink that the catering department uses.

At the end of each day, I'm back in the kitchen washing dishes. Janae asked me, ""When this coffee machine is clean, can you move the other one through the running water?"" I told her, ""I never done this before, so how would I know it's clean?"" She told me, ""When you see the brown coffee liquid stop coming out of the machine, it's clean then start with the other one."" I told her, ""Okay"". Then she went back out front to continue cleaning out front. I should've just said, ""Once I'm done washing dishes."" I would've never did it had I just continued washing dishes. That is not my responsibility, that is her responsibility. So this was a mistake here.

Also at the end of each day, we pull out a big trash cart out of the trash room to throw all of our trash away. This happened right after the coffee incident. While I was washing dishes, Janae asked me, ""Can you get the trash cart out of the trash room?"" I initially said ""Alright"". But then I thought, ""Why couldn't she do it?"" I asked her, ""Why can't you do it?"" She said, ""Because you're a guy."" Then I asked her, ""So you're being sexist?"" She was like, ""Yeah"". I asked about another male coworker that was nearby. I asked her, ""Why can't you ask Tod?"" She said, ""I need you."" I ignored her and went back to washing dishes.

I never did it because I realize all she is doing is trying to take advantage of me. She eventually went to do it herself. When she noticed I didn't do it, she gave me a dirty look and I just gave her a smirk.

I'm not going to continue to allow her to run over me.

I feel like this is good practice on not being a pushover. This is something I am still trying to work on.

How did I handle this?

**tl;dr: My coworker is trying to take advantage of me. She is trying to get me to do things that she can do herself. I always had a hard time with standing up for myself, but I'm trying to work on this. She had me put something away in the freezer that she could've did, she had me clean one of the coffee machine that she's responsible for cleaning, and she tried to have me get one of the trash carts where we put all of our trash in. I refused to do it, and she gave me a dirty look. I want to know how am I doing with not becoming a pushover anymore?**",22Feb2020,1
434,"I’m going to skip the sob story, and just get to the nitty gritty. I have been depressed for a while now, and I have no one to talk to. I can not afford therapy due to the loss of my job Thursday, but even then I couldn’t pay for it. My mother told me I wasn’t depressed the first time I told her how I was feeling, and it kinda made me not want to tell her anything that serious again. I’ve never felt comfortable talking to my Dad about anything serious. I’m not sure why though even though he’s been pretty active in my life it’s hard for me to even ask him for help financially. I want to ask for help, but I just can’t. I don’t know how so here I am. 
I hate feeling uneasy everyday. I cry, I think about death a lot, and other extreme negative thoughts. I try to shift my mind to positive things, and I end up falling back down into my own guilt, Shame, failure.

438,"I am a deep sleeper. My roommate likes to kick me out of the room to have sex a lot. Like once a week. One time I had to spend a few days in the ER and the day I came back, she asked me to sleep somewhere else so she could have sex. 

We were talking one time, and I mentioned how I’m a deep sleeper. I said, “I sleep through anything. I could probably sleep through you having sex in the room.” And we both laughed. I thought for sure she knew I was joking. 

Last week, I woke up in the middle of the night to her having sex in the room. With me there. I felt sick and I ran to the bathroom where I had a panic attack and threw up. I came back to the room and she was apologizing and saying how it was only because she was drunk, it would never happen again, etc. 

I accepted her apology but I was still pissed. I thought that was crossing the line way too far, but it seemed she thought nothing of it so I decided to move on. We made up and left the situation alone. 

Til yesterday at lunch. We usually all eat together with a friend group, but she ate with some girls from her sorority. Her big called me over to the table and said, “So do you wake up whenever I come in the room?” I told her, “I only woke up one time when (roommate) put a blanket over my head and you said ‘stop, you’re going to suffocate her.’” Which was true for whenever her big was in the room. 

Then (big) asked, “Have you ever woken up when (roommate) had a guy in the room?” I just walked away back to my table because I knew my roommate didn’t want me to talk about it. So I finish lunch and go back over to the table to say goodbye, and apparently my roommate told everyone at the table the whole story. She is making jokes about it and everything, so I chime in with a couple jokes like “he took a long time to finish; i thought he would never leave.” My roommate even laughed at them. 

So that night, she had a sorority event that she invited me to a while back. I had spent money on my outfit and time on making my outfit - painting, cutting out felt, gluing it on, etc. At about 2 pm she texts me “I don’t know if I’m going to go tonight.”

She had mono last week, so I thought she meant she was sick again. So I sent back “Oh no do you feel okay? Is everything okay?” 

roommate: “No I’m really not feeling good about everything rn”

me: “I’m so sorry girl :( I will be praying for you. Is there anything I can do to make you feel even a little better?”

roommate: “Yes I don’t appreciate that u told everybody about what happened. I already felt like shit about it. And I now everybody thinks I’m a better slut then I am. And I just wanna”

me: “I didn’t tell everyone what happened, I just answered your big’s question by saying that I was awake when you put the blanket over my head. I didn’t say any more, and I left right after that because I knew you didn’t want me to say anything more. I’m sorry if they found out and I’m so sorry you feel bad. I hope you don’t think I did this on purpose to make you feel bad. And you just wanna what?”

roommate: “No (my name) u fed into it. It’s not okay. That’s something that no one needs to know about.”

me: “Your big said “Were you awake those times I came into your room?” so I told her “All I remember is when (roommate) put the blanket over my head and you said don’t suffocate her.” She asked what else happened and I said, word for word, “I can’t say anything else.” and I left and went back to the table because i know you didn’t want me to say anything else. So I didn’t. I get that you’re mad at me but I need you to understand that I really said the minimum because I knew you didn’t want me to say anything more. I only said other stuff after you specifically told me they all knew. Which I shouldn’t have done and I’m not saying that is ok. I’m just saying that I really didn’t try to tell them and I literally left the situation when she asked more information. “

roommate: “I just wanna go alone tonight. I already hate myself and I know u all think I’m a slut and I don’t need that from anyone else anymore.”

me: “I don’t think you’re a slut. I honestly don’t think anyone thinks that. I really don’t. I’m sorry you don’t feel good about yourself and I’m sorry if anything I did is fueling that, but I really don’t think anyone seriously thinks of you as a slut.”

roommate: “I’m over it I’m sorry it’s not cool. I know you all judge me and I don’t need it”

me: “I don’t judge you. I never said what i did was fine. I’m telling you right now that I don’t judge you. You know me. You’re my best friend through thick and thin. I forgave you when you apologized that night. I thought that was the end of it. I forgave you and I don’t judge people.”

roommate: “I know (other friend) and y’all do it    I just wanna be alone and I dont need friends who who make me feel like shit. I just fucking hate myself and I really don’t need anything more from any one else”

me: “I really didn’t mean to hurt you. I promise you: one of my highest morals is that I’d never judge someone. I’d never judge a stranger, much less my closest friend. Believe what you want but I just want you to know that I know the real you and I don’t think of you as a “slut” or anything bad. I think of you as a close confidant and an amazing friend and roommate.”

roommate: “I don’t think I’m going.”

So after this text conversation, I’m back in the room. She comes in, and I say hey but she completely ignores me. She packs up a bag of stuff and leaves, slamming the door behind her. Despite her texts, she ends up going to the event. Other friends told me she got super drunk before the event too, so I don’t know. But she thinks I’m the one who initiated the entire thing when I believed that I didn’t feed into it until the joking part, which I understand now was wrong to do. Am I in the wrong for feeding into it and making her feel like we can’t be friends anymore? I’m not sure what to do next because she won’t even speak to me. We had been planning to room together next year as well, but I submitted a roommate change request because I don’t want to deal with another situation like this.",22Feb2020,1

441,"I'm definitely at a crossroads and need direction. There are some things in my life I'm not happy about and i just need an outsiders look into where im at. I seriously don't have many people I can talk to about this, hence posting on Reddit lmao. Here's an overview of who I am and whats happening:

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 22 M turning 23 this year in September. I'm working for my uncle in a city, we're full time gardener's. The work is physical and rewarding and the pay is decent, but a large portion of my savings and what i earn at the end of the week is controlled by my uncle, which I usually don't get to touch. This often means I accrue debts by borrowing money from other people, usually my dad, because i cant touch my own money. I'm good for it, i just don't have access, and have to wait until pay day again so I can use the portion of money my uncle says I do get to keep to pay people back, but its all starting to catch up to me. My uncle got angry at me for constantly trying to ask for access to my money, and said the reason i don't get full access is because im ""drug-fucked"" and that i have to prove i can save before i get access back. Its at $860 now, going up by a minimum of $100 each week, with the rest of my pay cheque, roughly $400, going to living expenses. In this sense i realize that i may be luckier than some, but its really frustrating working every day knowing most of my money is being kept away. Im not even aloud to take cash out for bills, as i have to save independently on the side to pay off things like dental bills and shit. I just dont see the point, and i feel trapped. 

&amp;#x200B;

He said he would give it all to me if i quit, so i basically dont have much of a choice, im too dependent on my job and my uncle specifically to just up and leave. Worst of all is no one in my family is taking my side. My mother, father and auntie all take my uncles side, and i dont even have any friends i can talk too, im becoming more of a loner each day. I don't know how to talk to people anymore, im consumed by fonder times in high school and how miserable i am in comparison now. Its sad but i know anyone else in my situation would prob have a much better go at it than me, im just not as outgoing and positive and smart to really take advantage of everything going on around me. I guess in essence i just dont feel very important. Like im just a small tiny cog, that no one remembers to grease with oil or shine with polish, yet is still expected to maintain an efficient work flow. I guess im not alone in that regard, but anyway, any helpful advice would be great. I may have missed details so feel free to ask more questions and what not, im not really that important but i appreciate it if you read this far in.",22Feb2020,1

443,"Hey Reddit, I need some advice. My mouth has been slightly bothering me for a year but I haven't had time to get it looked at due to more pressing family matters. Yesterday I was in so much pain that I just kept going to sleep. I woke up today and decided I'll go to the dentist but he's closed until Monday. I need anesthesia because they're going to have to pull it(that's why  I picked this dentist). Is there anything I can buy OTC to help? Even a low grade oxy didn't get rid of it. Any advice would be deeply appreciated, I'm literally crying in pain. I've tried a salt water gargle, gently brushing it, what else can I do?",22Feb2020,1
444,"I was playing volleyball and another girl fell on my leg while I was running the opposite way. Lucky me I got a spiral tibia/fibula break. Yay sarcasm. This is my first ever broken bone and they put me in a cast from the base of my toes up to the top of my thigh. I chose light blue because I didn’t think it would be as obvious.

Well, out in public, everybody asks what happened. Or they want to sign my cast. Or they just stare in shock. It’s like haven’t you ever seen somebody in a cast before? I’m in college and it’s like that in my classes too. This one girl from my class was like that’s a huge cast. I just said yep and it was super awkward.

I just get so embarrassed and what’s worse is I need this cast for 12-16! Then I get a below the knee cast. Is there anyway to hide it or make it less obvious during that time? Any way to stop feeling embarrassed?",22Feb2020,1

447,"I (17F) am an Italian girl and I study in a boarding school in England. Obviously I am quite loud and from the outside I seem very confident, as I talk all the time, I am always impulsive and doing things first, but most importantly I like being at the centre of attention. 

I strongly believe this is caused by the fact that I have been isolated throughout my whole schooling experience in Italy, but also because in my home country I don't meet the beauty standards for a teenage girl, whereas here I do. 

The problem is that since I've come to this school, I've been extremely euphoric and even too intense, I'd dare say. Which is caused by the fact that for the first time in my life, I'm actually happy with the school and the people I'm studying with. 

My issue is that many often consider me ""too much"", and the situation feels surreal. In Italy I was considered the ""fat"" serious girl, whereas here I'm seen as the ""hot"" loud girl, which is not what I am used to be perceived as. Most importantly, I don't want to pass by as attention seeking and desperate. This is also affecting the ""dating"" side of my life, because of being isolated all of my life, nowadays I only feel confident in myself when males compliment me, which sounds incredibly moronic but I really can't help it. 

Do you have any advice on how to be more confident in my personality or at least on how not to be seen as crazy? 

PS: please, don't tell me to focus on school and not worry about this as I'm too young, because I basically have all As and I'm here on a scholarship. My academic life is pretty okay, what I need advice on is how to deal with my insecurity. Thanks in advance.",22Feb2020,1
448,"So I'm (21M) in a situation where my best friend (20F) also my housemate is sleeping with her ex boyfriend, who is also my ex best friend.
We all had a massive falling out, when the ex was living in the house, and was then kicked out.
Since, she has been sleeping with him again.

I've made it very clear I don't want him home when I'm home, which has caused some issues when he wouldn't leave the house when I wanted to come home.

Additionally, she and I had also gotten very close, and since she started sleeping with him, things have changed since.
This has messed me up big time, she has admitted it's purely just sex and would drop him if she were to starting something serious elsewhere.

Anyways, the whole thing about him being in my house and her constantly going back is messing me up. My mental health is suffering big time from it, when he's not involved everything about us is amazing.
I had a mental breakdown today when she went back to see him, really badly.

The lease expires in 2 months, and I'm looking at saying two things
 1. If you continue to see him, our friendship is over for my own sake
 2. On that, he is never allowed in the house ever again including the new place

I don't know if I want to give up this amazing friendship for this one thing thats happening. I know this issue seems small, but everytime it causes an argument, and it causes me so much mental stress, I under perform at work, I just want to curl up and cry everytime. I really enjoy our friendship, and we've had so many good times together.",22Feb2020,1
449,"First of all, sorry for my English, it's not my first idiom. 
So, yesterday I went out with some friends (receiver of the text included) and I got REALLY FUCKIN DRUNK and after I got home (he gave me a ride home) I sent him a text saying things definitely should not have said, that I liked him a lot, that I knew he felt the same some time back, that I was super into him, drunk shit like that. And he hasn't replied. And it's even more embarrassing cause we go to college together (all the same classes, and we sit close to each other), we have an internship in the same place (again, sit supper close to each other) and we have lot of friends in common so it's not like I can just ignore him and pretend it never happened. 
Like I said, he hasn't responded yet (didn't even read the text) and I'm not sure if he will reply at all. I don't know why I sent him that text, I don't remember if we hooked up yesterday (we've hooked up before), but I'm pretty sure he doesn't feel the same anymore. I just had a lot of fun and liked hanging out with him again. I'm feeling terrible and super embarrassed and I don't know what to do. I just want to run inside a cave and never leave.

450,"Hi. New here, hope all of you are doing well.

What should you do if your anxiety or suicidal tendencies are triggered by a family member?

(Context)

This parent is so good at playing off the situation as your fault. For a bit of context, im pretty young. Just moved out on my own after college. Been able to support myself finacially with absolutely no help (nor moral support) from the parent i used to live with.

That parent makes no money. Literally none. They've been ""working"" online for years to no avail. Now went bankrupt. I had previously given them a big chunk of my savings when they asked. It sparked a pretty big feud. I decided to distance myself since because the situation is triggering me. Thing is, they wouldn't have gone bankrupt if they listened to me and moved out after I did.

The parent is staying at a pricey apartment we used to live in during my college. My other parent used to support us financially so we could afford it. But after I graduated, the money stopped of course. I can earn and am happy to build myself up.

After being asked for money, I proposed a solution so that both of us wouldnt have such a hard time by it. Told them to go to back to his side of the family and stay there. They dont have to pay for rent that way. They could keep the online stint for all they want. 

But they wouldn't budge. Saying its all ""for me"" that they're staying, and working online is such a struggle... Also, they don't like their own family members. More drama between them. Personally, its too childish that I can see how to resolve it. Theyre just being immature. 

Even still, I tried to be civil. Even took them out to dinner when their birthday came round...

Jump to now, they messaged me asking if they could come to my place and use my internet. They got cut off from electricity (sounds like my money all went poof).

I said no. The mere thought of them coming made me anxious. I refused to reply to their further comments saying a computer cafe wouldn't suffice. Went away after 18 minutes. Said thanks.

I feel so horrible. Is it my job to be there for them even if they purposefully refuse my advice that would help us both? I provided when I didn't have to. I thought of a working solution but got denied. I know its supposed to be family or whatever, but the way they talk is like im responsible for things happening this way. It comes from love that I want them to go away, but their only definition of love is proximity and helping in need... even if i fully predicted the situation and warned them against it.

I'm thinking of suicide everytime I ponder on the situation.

I have a will to live. Only because of my SO. I just dont want to be overbearing and needy.

Thoughts? Thanks.

Sorry for the long post. I hope to get some advice but also spark discussion. Mostly about when familial responsibility ends, in favor of self care. I love you all..",22Feb2020,1
451,My friend needs help! She’s in her first and most toxic relationship. He doesn’t beat her or hit her he just threatens. Never raises a hand. But he loves to threaten her living situation. So She currently have something on her record. Nothing major but it’s hindering her from getting a job. So she moved out of her moms 5 months ago and because of her record she’s unable to get a job. So her and my bf do Uber eats and use out school money to pay for rents/bills. She desperately had to move out her moms and he was homeless so they had to figure out how theyre gonna live. So they decided to use fake check stubs. Every time they argue and the conversation is heated he threatens to tell the apartment office that she’s using fake checks. What should she do to get out of that situation? She can’t go back home. And the only money she has is from taxes and the school money. He does forex so he’s gonna be good. But she doesn’t know what to do. He’s controlling.,22Feb2020,1

453,"Last night I came back very late from a party and I was pretty much wasted. However, I stayed with my friends all night and one of them stayed sober and made sure I got back safe. We planned this out before we even left for the night (My friend even wrote her number on my hand so if at some point in the night I got separated from her and couldn’t get to her on my own, someone could help me. Of course that didn’t happen, because I’m not stupid and I stayed with her and the rest of the group).

Anyway, when I got back, my roommate was really mad. She took care of me, but I could tell that she was angry. She told me that if I felt like i would lose control to the point that I needed to write someone’s number on my hand that I just shouldn’t go out at all. Oh yeah, and she downright called me stupid. 

I put up with a lot during the week. I have my own issues and problems, and I knew exactly what I was doing last night. I didn’t want to feel anything for the time being, so I drank enough to make that happen. I don’t know why she can’t just let me live my life and make my own choices, especially considering the fact that I was being smart about it. I know she cares about me but I’m upset about this. This isn’t her lifestyle, but she doesn’t have to bash mine. 

TL;DR - My roommate doesn’t support my drinking even though I’m smart about it and always make sure I’m safe. She called me stupid.",22Feb2020,1
454,"Myself and this mentioned friend, let’s call him CJ, have known each other since we were 12, nearly half of our lives. He has been a fairly good friend over the past 10+ years. We’ve had one argument in our entire time as friends, and he has always seemed to be very rational.

He began dating a girl we both met while in high school. She seemed alright, albeit kind of aggressive and a bit ungrateful. Two years after graduation, he (accidentally) knocked her up. Though he wasn’t sure of his relationship with her, he was very sure of his love for his baby girl. He was a great father. His relationship with his baby’s mother remained very rocky. He asked me to try to formulate some sort of friendship between her and myself, as her and I always remained cordial but never close. When I told her we should get together sometime, she invited me to get our nails done. I came over the next day, and she asked if we could run errands first. I essentially became her chauffeur for the day, with her running into stores, and me remaining in the car with her baby. When we finally got to the nail salon, she asked if one of us could stay in the car while the other got their nails done, to watch the baby- “one of us” obviously being me. There were a few other instances where I attempted to befriend her, only for her to leave me with the baby, instead of actually hanging out with me. Long story short, I stopped trying to be her friend. I love her baby, but I am not going to sit around and be someone’s unpaid babysitter; especially because I hadn’t been invited to her baby shower, and she even fought tooth-and-nail with CJ because he insisted that I become the baby’s godmother; he lost that fight.

He has confided in me about how he works two jobs just to support himself, his daughter, and his daughter’s mother, and still, when he would come home from a 14-hour day, he would be berated for not changing diapers, or cooking, or cleaning. (It is important to note that she is a stay-at-home mother). He called me after a long day of work, asking if I could join him at the bar for a quick drink; I had promised him a round on me, as he had kindly recommended my younger cousin for a job at the company he works at. Not even 10 minutes into drinks, his baby mother called, asking where we was. When he informed her that he would be an hour later than expected, I could hear her screaming over the phone, telling him that he is an awful father to his baby. 

Sometime between that night and a few weeks later, he somehow knocked her up...again. Maybe 4 months into the second pregnancy, CJ got caught cheating on her. I was not aware of any sort of infidelity, so when I received a phone-call from his baby mother, sobbing/screaming at me for “breaking ‘girl code’ by spending all of that time with her and never letting her know that CJ was a cheater.” Despite being blamed for something I was not even aware for, I felt sorry for her. 

I met up with CJ a few days later, and he told me that he has been done with the relationship since the first pregnancy. He told me that he only began seeing this new girl 2 months into his baby mother’s second pregnancy, and that he only wasn’t honest because he didn’t know how to not be with his baby mother, and still have a relationship with his babies. He tells me that she is incredibly spiteful, and holds his babies over his head whenever they fight, so he knew that if he tried to leave her, she would take the babies and never let him see them again. This made sense to me, as his baby mother does seem spiteful in that sense, but I still could not find it in myself to support/agree with his behavior. I am not quite sure what transpired within their relationship after that, but 3 months later, all of his photos of his baby girl were removed from his social media, and from what the both of them have told me, he was not present for the birth of his son, nor has he seen his kids in nearly a year (meaning, he has never held or met his son). 

When I talk to him, it seems that he desires a relationship with his kids, but his baby mother makes it impossible to visit them without turning the situation volatile. She tells me that he has chosen his new girlfriend over his kids, and that she is more than open to him having a relationship with his children; she claims that she cannot allow CJ to prioritize work and a new girlfriend over his kids, so, yes, sometimes she won’t allow him to come see them, as he chooses sporadic times when it is not convenient for her or her kids.

I don’t know how to feel about any of this. His baby mother is definitely in the wrong for many things, including the lack of appreciation, the verbal abuse she has committed against CJ, as well as holding her children over their father’s head. But he is absolutely in the wrong, too, for no longer making an effort to see his kids, cheating on his pregnant girlfriend and then blaming her behavior for pushing him to do so, rather than just breaking up with her. 

I don’t know if I should remain friends with CJ, as I don’t condone fathers not being their for their kids, no matter how difficult it gets. I know it is not my direct business, but you are who you associate with; do I want to be associated with a “deadbeat” dad? What should I do?",22Feb2020,1
456,"Title says it all really. Everyone treats this girl like the sun shines out of her arse because shes the bosses daughter. I sit next to her at work and makes racist comments constantly. Not only does it make me uncomfortable, but I'm worried if anyone over hears they'll think I'm part of it. She doesnt exactly lower her voice either. 

The obvious problem is that shes the bosses daughter and I feel too scared to say anything to her, which in turn makes me feel like I'm enabling it 

What can I do?",22Feb2020,1
457,"Over the years I've realise that I'm starting to be more negative towards myself. Never think that I can do something good, and whenever I or someone else think I did something good, I'll quickly shot it down with ""I shouldn't feel this because there's always someone out there who did better than me"".

Maybe because I was always being compared to since I was a kid and I thought what I did is never enough. For example, we hv this big exams with 8 subjects, I got 7As and a B. Every other kids was congratulate by their family, but when I called my mum to tell my results her response was ""wow, that's a bad result"".

I sometimes blame others as well. It's like my heart is blaming the world for everything. This had causes me to cry by myself a lot since I think no one understands me and multiple times thinking to hurt myself. I've also become distant with a friend because I feel like I'm whining and I might be taxing them. So I decided it's better to keep it to myself. 


If possible, I would like to have a positive mind and stop comparing myself with others. Is there any advice that u can give or a self help book that you can recommend?",22Feb2020,1

Also that all the showers may be taken when I'm done, because I don't want to be late for work.

459,"I took a job a few years ago hoping I could make a switch to a different job once my foot was in the door. I didn't switch jobs but my boss was happy to adjust my responsibilities based on my skill set. I was happy, I worked long hours, I was the kind of guy to reply to an email at 3am because I loved it.

Then, we had some restructuring where the company was split into two. I had a choice of which side to go, there was good and bad on both sides. The choice I made meant I got a new boss. 

My boss right from the start seemed to scrap the adjustments that my previous boss made. We had a chat where he said I was good at my job and he'd be looking at promoting me. I was really hoping the work I'd be doing for the past few years would be recognised and it would essentially become my full time job.

But no, he wants to recruit another person to take on this and have me devote 100% of my time to my original job spec which I absolutely do not want. I did talk to him about this and he said ok, things can be adjusted in a few months time once things have died down. Only in reality, he's continued looking for a new person and he's talking about me going into leadership, management of the things I don't want to do. 

I don't like it, I'm not that good at it. But I know at the end of the month he's going to offer me a promotion with a nice pay rise. I'm looking for another job and I'm in the process of applying for a job where I've had good feedback so far. 

But in the mean time should I just tell my boss that I'm not interested in the inevitable promotion something like ""Sorry, but this doesn't align to my career goals so I would like to decline this."" I suspect he'll do what he's done so far, to tell me that this promotion is happening.",22Feb2020,1

At school some teachers are putting some great stress on me.

At home my mother and father(that is a drinker) are having fights everynight, because my father wants my mother to have sex and she refuses so he slut shames her blames her for his drinking problem that he denies everytime you would address it. 

My mother is working on her own bussinies while my father works 8-5 everyday and he refuses to help in the slightes, even has screwed her up a few times, always puts her down. I am trying to help her build her bussiness. But I think that I cannot do a thing to help as much as I try.

I dont have friends I trust. In fact I just know a lot of people. I wouldnt call none of them friends,I dont go out a lot(rather almost at all) so I dont talk to anyone if I struggle mentally or in any other way. I am kind of a hurt loner that feels really suicidal lately and i do not know what to do. I am 17 and everyone my age and everyone i know is solely focused on girls and pussy, gettin wasted, drinking and eating. And here i am sitting alone most weekends wondering why do i even exist, I've cried myself to sleep countless nights. Had a crush on a girl, turns out she flirts with anyone to get them to catch feelings so she can boost her self-esteem or get attention. She is in my class and I have not talked to her in few months, she found it strange at first but then started to ignore me as well and got awfully close to other guys in the class, since we are mostly males in the class it wasnt hard to do. That went on for about a month and a half. I work out regurarly had stoped faping, started again recently.... I have though and planed what to do once i graduate, I even have plans how to start my own bussiness and try to succeed in life.

But I feel as if all I want is to die and perish so i wont struggle anymore. My head is a mess, such a fog you can see as far as your nose goes. Still my head works faster than all the people in my class, I dare to say I am as smart as confused I am.

I need advice on what should I do, should I just end it all(stab myself)? Should I just suck it up for longer ? What do you think i should do after you have read a short story of what is going on with me recently ?

For the last two or three years, I would sometimes get these INTENSE pains in the upper abdomen after eating certain meals.

They feel like super intense heartburn (but without the ""burn"" the acid gives you) that comes in waves, each wave seemingly radiating farther and getting worse than the first. The pain pierces through my back and sometimes ribs, and radiates up to my throat.

It's really painful and leaves me just sitting up and coughing/burping my ass off for an hour. I also salivate like a damn dog.

The triggers are confusing. But I noticed canned fish and greasy/oily meats trigger it. I literally can't eat tuna anymore, while I could before.

Fast forward to January and I ask her out.She declines the date because she was busy that day but suggested that we go out another time.After that we continued talking like nothing happened.Two weeks later I ask her out again and she says yes.We have a mutual friend(who happens to be my best friend).She told me that i should ask her out a second time because she was sure she would accept.Now a day before the date Jessica talks to my best friend saying that she doesn't want to go on the date anymore.She didn't even have the decency to tell me herself making me almost waste money on two cinema tickets(I don't really have a lot of  money so I had to save up and this pissed me off). We didn't really talk anymore since then but a week ago she invited me to her birthday party.I accepted.The party was pretty damn nice except one thing.It seemed like she tried to avoid me all night(except when I would ask for a drink or when I left) being busy cuddling with a guy(by guy I mean a cunt who kept drinking my fucking beer and asking me for free cigarettes) she invited or being on the dance floor.How should I feel about this?What should I do?,22Feb2020,1

485,"Hey everyone,

Thanks for taking the time. I don’t want this post to seem hyperbolic or attention seeking. I’m just feeling desperate and overwhelmed.

I’ve dealt with a difficult past of abuse which has resulted in a variety of self destructive behaviours. In the last 48 hours, despite 45 days of sobriety, I’ve got isolated myself and gotten drunk.

It doesn’t actually feel very great, or beneficial. But for whatever reason I can’t shake the compulsion to absolutely fuck myself over.

A few weeks ago my partner peeled me off a couch after consuming Listerine, hence my first attempt to get sober. I messaged him tonight to let him know I needed to be honest about my slip and convey to him that I’m trying my best and that manipulating or hurting him is last thing I want. I also said I’m feeling vulnerable and asked if he would come by.

He said he promised himself he would finish some editing work tonight but I could come see him tomorrow. I know it sounds self absorbed to expect someone to drop everything to see you and I would never expect that. I guess I selfishly feel quite undervalued and overbearing for asking him to come by.

I don’t want to burden, judge or disappoint anyone. But the non-rejection of my partner not coming to check in makes me feel like a waste of oxygen, a burden, and an undeserving mess. I see the self-absorption and unfounded depressiveness of that statement, but I can’t make it go away.

It just makes me feel really worthless, hopeless, unmanageable, disappointing.... I don’t want to commit suicide but when I feel this way I feel drawn to it as a solution because it (irrationally) seems like the altruistic approach.

Anyone relate? Could use a kindred spirit. Thanks in advance x❤️",22Feb2020,1

488,"TLDR at bottom. Not overtly NSFW but tagging to be safe.   


I started RPing with an individual on discord about a year ago. It's simple RP, but also includes sexual scenes. I have trusted him and have enjoyed RPing with him throughout the year we have been doing so. 

We never spoke about RPing with other people, and it never seemed to be an issue. All throughout the year I was RPing with him, I was RPing in other group RPs, some of which he was also a part of. He also was in other group RPs as well and he did not try to hide it. Yesterday he saw me RPing in one of these groups, which has people who aren't exactly the nicest, and called me 'fake' 'a bitch' etc. etc. He basically was extremely upset that I was being 'in-genuine' in his eyes for RPing with people who we've discussed in the past were not nice. I understand why he would be frustrated, but he continued to freak out after I apologized and tried to explain the situation. I expressed that I appreciated him as a person and as a roleplayer and that I would never do anything to hurt him, however he thought I was just trying to weasel my way out of the situation.   


I was informed by someone else not long after that he has a history of vindictive and spiteful behavior. Leaking screenshots, leaking photos, etc. I had absolutely no idea he was this sort of person before this happened.   


So, now I am terrified that he will try to 'expose' me, especially by using screenshots of the sexual scenes we've RPed over the last year. I like RPing with him, and have enjoyed it in the past. But now I am afraid that if I cut it off he'll blackmail me. 

  
**TLDR:** My year long RP partner has become upset at me after finding out I also RP with other people. I was recently made aware that he has a history of spiteful and blackmail like behavior. Now that he is upset, I am worried he will 'expose' me to a RP community we are both a part of.",22Feb2020,1
490,"I am a waitress for a hotel and I work approximately 40-50 hours a week. 
I have been told by higher management that they can see I work hard and put effort into my job and making sure customers are okay, and so they are considering promoting me to supervisor. (This was mentioned over a month ago)
I confronted the subject of being promoted last week as it still hasn’t been confirmed or made official/serious, and they said I might be up for it in another few months (they need to fire the current supervisor first apparently)

The past 3 weeks I have been asked to come in 4-5 hours before my scheduled start and then stay an extra 1-3 hours after my scheduled finish (I get paid for each hour so I do get paid those extra hours); the issue I have is I have said is this is going to be regular can I just be scheduled an earlier start and later finish as this is preventing me from making plans and I have to keep cancelling any plans I’ve made to then go into work. 

This seems to have just gone over my managers heads. 

I know I don’t HAVE to come in early or stay extra late, but I’m the type that I know if I don’t, we won’t ever have any preparation done (I come in and get loads of prep done for the night/following morning) and that then leads to everyone being stressed, including myself, about the fact we don’t have anything. 

Tl:dr - do I keep putting in effort and saying yes to extra hours to possibly be considered for a promotion (supervisor) in a few months, or do I start saying no (which may ruin my chances of a promotion) or do I look for another job which doesn’t mess me around as much?",22Feb2020,1

So the other day I was playing Leauge of Legends with my friend and her brother when I went to get some food. I said I'd be right back and I get back around a minute later. I sit down and tell them im back, to which my friend responds that I was probably just sitting there listening to their conversation. Keep in mind that before I go to get food while playing I always mute my mic, so she may have gotten suspicious because she couldn't hear the sound of me putting on my headset or sitting down. I tell her that no, I wasn't listening to their conversation, I was downstairs getting my food and the discussion ends there.

I don't really know what I did to make her think that I would just sit there, muted, listening to them talk. And it makes me feel kinda shit that she thinks I would do that, as I believe that to be a pretty creepy thing to do. I really dont want to be portrayed as creepy and the whole event just proves to me that people definatly don't think of me the way I though they did.

497,"This... is going to be long, sorry. 
 
God, where do I even start? I guess I'll start with myself and then work my way up to the current situation. 
 
I'm a 32 year old man, living in Florida. I have been diagnosed with (high functioning) autism, bipolar, depression, severe anxiety, and various other things. I had been on social security Disability for most of my life (since I was a teenager) and have never really worked in any job. I did not graduate high school, I have no skills or experience in anything worthwhile. 
 
My body is frail and sickly, and always has been. I'm only very slightly overweight, but even when I was a child and was thin, I've always had unreasonably low strength and stamina for someone my age. I was always out of school for various health issues, but no doctor ever managed to come up with a defining diagnosis for why I was always so weak and frail. Even in recent years where I have been deliberately trying to increase my body's strength and stamina, through moderate exercise, I am unable to push my body for any sort of extended period, and I can't keep up pretty much any physical activity for longer than 15 minutes or so, and I don't know why. Nobody seems to know why - tests always come up normal. 
 
But yet despite all of this, social security determined that I was no longer disabled. Despite all of my doctors writing personal letters to social security, telling them that I am not physically nor mentally fit to hold a job... they still denied me. Multiple times in fact. I've even seen a judge about the case, and they too denied me. 
 
I am currently no longer receiving Disability payments. The only income I have right now is Food Stamps. I'm living with my mother right now because I have no other place to go. I lost my medicaid coverage along with my Disability payments, so I can no longer get any medication or see doctors with any kind of coverage. I recently had to go to the hospital and now I have an astronomical bill from them that I can never hope to pay back. Speaking of paying back, social security wants me to pay back all of the money that they gave me while I was appealing, which is to the tune of $18,000, which I also have no hope of ever paying back. 
 
But what can I even do? I can't find a job. There's a laundry list of problems that I have that keep me from functioning in just about any workplace. I have absolutely crippling social anxiety disorder (yes, officially diagnosed) and can't even pay for my groceries without nearly having a panic attack, so there's no way I can work in any job that has me work with customers or with many co-workers in any capacity. I cannot even talk to people on the phone properly. And of course, as I stated before, I have no physical abilities at all, so anything involving physical labor is automatically ruled out.  
 
I have no marketable skills to speak of either. I have no skills, no talents, nothing that could be used to make me money, that I know of. I can't even do something like work as a chef, due to being afraid of being burned (I live a life pretty much ruled by an unbelievable number of fears, by the way). I can't cook right, I can't clean right, I'm afraid to drive and have no license, I have difficulty learning how to do new things, and I'm bad at following directions. I didn't graduate high school, I don't have a GED (and considering I was always perpetually failing or nearly failing all of my classes, I'm highly doubtful I could get it), I've never undergone any kind of job training. What even is there for me to do?  
 
I've tried applying for jobs. I've thrown applications at pretty much every job in the area that is within my skill range (which is basically 0), but have either been completely ignored by them or have received rejection emails. I've even been turned down from places that almost anyone can get into, like Walmart, Gamestop and grocery stores. To be honest, I've actually stopped applying over the last couple months, because my heart just can't take seeing so many rejection emails. It fucking kills me every time I get denied. 
 
As if all of that weren't bad enough, I have pretty much zero emotional support from my family. All they do is tell me that I'm worthless. That I'm not trying hard enough. That I'm lazy. They even yelled at me, claiming that I wasn't even applying at all, well before I stopped doing so. They're terribly abusive towards me, especially my mother, who is physically and emotionally abusive towards me. But I have no choice but to live with her, since no one else will take me in. I don't have any friends, and no one in my family wants to help. All they do is tell me what I'm doing wrong, instead of trying to lead me in a direction where I can do something right. 
 
What do I even do? Where do I go from here? How can I succeed at living? I don't want to be worthless. I don't want to be useless. I want to be good at something. I want to make my own money, live my own life. Maybe if I'm lucky, even have a family someday. But I feel like I'm at the end of my rope here. I feel like I have absolutely no future. That death is the only thing that awaits me. Heck, the only reason I'm even still here is because I'm afraid of what happens after death. Don't worry, I'm not gonna kill myself... but only because I'm too scared to. But that doesn't mean that I won't wind up succumbing to whatever illnesses have been plaguing me that I don't even know the names of, or that I won't be thrown out of the house and left to starve on the street. I don't see any brighter future than that ahead of me.

I wanted to go back to them in senior year, but ended up being rejected from the team.  Not realizing at the time, this turned out to be the biggest regret I have to this day.  Although I am now in one of my dream universities, there always seems to be a part of me that wishes I had not given up high school sports to be here.  My head is filled with ""what if""s and alternate universes of how much better my life could've turned out.

Simple job for a small tax company, just scanning and filing papers and helping out with whatever needs to be done around the office. Pays well, $12/hour for 9 hours a week. Not the most interesting, but keeps my bank account alive. 

About a week or so into that job, I got offered another job for work that’s actually related to my major and future career. Hours are flexible, just log them myself and turn it in every 2 weeks for $15/hour + free computer to borrow to do this work on (boss said I can use it for personal use too, it’s just best for this work since I have sucky laptop and he had an extra). It’s just learning this but it’s very time consuming. Since it’s not set hours and it depends on the workload given to me for each project, it can cut deeply into my personal time and it’s started affecting my relationship. 

Here’s my issue:

Fun boss is my neighbor. He helped me get into my major when I was interested in it and has taught me a lot. Tax boss is fun boss’s father in law. Both are incredibly sweet people and they’ve both offered me good opportunities.

I could quit tax job, but fun job is very unpredictable and unpredictable is difficult to manage in my college experience. BUT, I could get good experience for my future. Tax job is very small company with 5 people including me. Last person I replaced worked there for 2 years and I feel like if I quit it would be very sudden and they’d struggle to find new person. 

I could quit fun job, but tax job is mundane and pays less and is a drive away rather than working form home. BUT, it’s stable and pays consistently same paycheck every 2 weeks. Fun job is also small company but I’m not main person for my task. I basically do grunt work for someone else to make their job easier but this grunt work is technically an essential part of the projects we do... so I wouldn’t be missed for my position but it is a good foot in the door for my future. 

I’m leaning toward quitting fun job because it’s more unpredictable and my leaving would be less of an impact on them as they’ve been doing great without me (neighbor just offered me because it could help my experience). I’m hoping in my head that if I went to my neighbor I could ask that after this current project I could hold off continuing until summer? Then 2 jobs would be more manageable. But I’m also missing out on college experience but maybe that’s not good enough reason...",22Feb2020,1

518,"This happened yesterday and I can't stop thinking about it and feeling disappointed/upset.

My daughter was upstairs playing with my SiL when I came to pick her up. SiL brought her down, but she still wanted to play upstairs and we were all telling her it's time to go home. I let her cry and be sad about it for a little bit, offering her some water to calm her down. She wasn't having any of it. She started to get more agitated and upset that nobody was giving her what she wanted (as some 2-year-olds do).

MiL picked her up and tried to calm her down. My daughter pushes her face away and mil puts her down, turns her back to her and says ""I don't want anything to do with you right now!"" Leaving my daughter even more upset than before. 

I don't know if I'm overreacting, but when I saw her face as she was just standing there, it broke my heart. I didn't say anything to my MiL, just picked my daughter up, and tried to calm her down with offerings of food and water. She started doing the same thing to me, and I pushed her hand away and told her I didn't like that, and she stopped. She drank some water, she was still sad, but she wasn't angry anymore. 

I feel disappointed at myself for not saying anything and I'm disappointed at my MiL for making my daughter feel that way. There are better ways to calm a child. Am I wrong for feeling this way? How do I get myself to speak up more?",22Feb2020,1
519,"My cousin and I were always really close. I moved to his primary school at one point because when I was around 7 my older siblings had both left the school and me being the lil bitch I was cried that I would be alone so my mum let me move (besides the new school was closer to our house) and my cousin was in that class. This brought us even closer. 

I would go to his house most of the time and it was great, I was always a shy kid and I still am quiet and everything but my cousin was so energetic and happy. He would bring me out walking and carry a speaker with him playing his favourite songs and he’d just go all out singing them. He’d introduce to his friends. He was a great fucking person. 

Come secondary school, immediately from first year he got bullied. A lot of people did in first year so it wasn’t too hard to deal with because you would be friends with most of the other people who also got bullied and knew how you felt. My cousin and I got with a group of friends and they were great but they would occasionally make jokes at each others expense. Sometimes this was funny and all good but my cousin got the worst of them and it fucking kills me to know that sometimes I was a part of said jokes to him. Sometimes he’d just lose it and get really upset and it was at those points where I realised how shitty what we did was and I’d go to the other friends and tell them we should apologise, which we did and my cousin being as nice as he fucking was forgave us. 

Few years into secondary school the group drifted apart and we got new friends everyone except my cousin at least. He was with a group of people but they weren’t friends really just there to fill the space. I would speak to my cousin and be with him every morning and every break and lunch as possible but because we weren’t in the same classes we rarely saw each other. 

The first year GCSEs started my cousin and I usually just spoke about our favourite TV shows and TWD and videogames. We never talked about our lives with friends or anything and he kept personal things to himself mostly. But this year apparently the bullying he went through got especially bad. Got so bad that he stopped coming to school, he was even allowed to drop out early due to his mental health and the doctors his mum went to said they were worried about him and the school wasn’t safe for his mental health. That’s when I found out my cousin had been going home with fucking bruises on his legs. He got bullied badly because of his acne, which only got worse because of the amount of stress he went through and he got so depressed he just stopped caring about himself and his hair got long (which wasn’t bad but uni assholes are assholes) and he got bullied for that too. 

Anyways, he dropped out two years ago and literally a month after he dropped out most of his acne had cleared up because he felt safe and calm. He rarely leaves his house or does any social things because he doesn’t have anyone to do them with and I try to go to his as often as possible to hang out with him and although we enjoy ourselves part of me is just sad to see him knowing what he went through but happy to see that he’s not going through it anymore. I just feel like I could see him far more often and I wish I could do something to make up for the shit I put him through in the first year of secondary school. 

The worst part for me is knowing my school did nothing to get rid of the bullies. They tried to identify them by asking the rest of my cousins class (which a whole lot more of them were also being bullied) and no one said a thing. I get why they didn’t, they were scared but even then my school ducking knows who it was. Everyone knows who it was. And it kills me. Seeing them being allowed to walk around happy and enjoying life. One of the pricks even asked me why my cousin left. And he referred to him as an insult ( people in my school didn’t call him by his name, rather by an insult they made) and I ignored him and he kept asking to which I just said “He’s got a name you know and if you cared about why he left at all you’d be using it but you’re only asking me so you can be the one to spread the news about how he is so you can take the piss out of him some more.” He ended up telling me “Whenever you heard people say (insult) instead of his name why’d you not defend him? If it were my cousin I’d be going nuts” I didn’t even respond. I was too fucking shocked both because, he was right but secondly he WAS the one who did it more than anyone. He used that insult all the time and now he tries to make me feel guilty for not stopping him? 

I just miss my old cousin. I miss the kid who was happy and energetic and had no worries in life. I want him to be happy again but I don’t think he can be truly. And I don’t know what I can do to help him achieve this. I’d offer to bring him out with my friends (they were the few who actually didn’t partake in the bullying) but I know his anxiety would get bad and he either wouldn’t want to go or he would go even if he doesn’t want to and out himself through a stressful time just to avoid disappointing people. I fucking hate this shit and I hate that he’s so fucking hurt.",22Feb2020,1

524,"Hi Everyone- I have worked at a company for 3 years and for the first 2 years I was iffy on my job. I found it lackluster, boring, management wasn’t fair and it was hard to move up. 

Because of this attitude, I gained friendship with two co workers and the basis of our friendship began because we shared complaints about the company. I must say that part of my complaining was on me due to my professional immaturity. 

Fast forward to recently. The past year has been
Pretty good and I have gotten more mature I feel in my job.  In the past 4 months, a spot has opened up for a promotion on my team. Ive started to show interest and work very hard to get this promotion as it would be huge for my growing family. They are stuck in their old ways- constant complaining, no interest in growth because everything is always everyone else’s fault. 

Ever since this, my co worker friends have started to exclude me from our daily activities, such as lunch, even as far as excluding me from our weekly happy hours on fridays. When I walk into the kitchen during work and they’re in there, they get quiet and change the subject. 

What do I do? Have I outgrown them? We used to have so much fun. Worst part is their significant others have also become friends with my wife.

525,"(this is so unorganized i’m sorry)

I’ve been thin my whole life. pretty much all of elementary school I was teased for being underweight and called anorexic. it got to a point where I would force myself to eat until i felt sick in hope of gaining weight. I’ve never really been completely happy with my body but I am currently 17, 5’7 and about 122lbs. my mom has never made comments about my body or my weight (as she should) but my dad constantly does. he tells me to eat a cheeseburger, that I’m not eating enough, every time we have a meal as a family he mocks me for not finishing my meal (even if I do). I feel like I can’t eat anything without being badgered about it and it’s lead me to have this fear of eating in front of people. I never eat at school and always just wait until I get home. I also used to never weigh myself because I knew that it doesn’t correctly reflect your health but over the past few years I’ve weighed myself in secret and I measure my waist on a daily basis minimum. the thing is, I’m currently very happy with how I look, I’ve learned to love my body but I feel almost ashamed to and I’m not sure why. 
I’ve recently lost a bit of weight from a medication which freaked my parents the fuck out even though it was only like five pounds over a month, and they will not stop bothering me about what I’m eating and it’s making me feel like shit. I’ve also been trying to go vegetarian for the past few years but every time I try to go with the vegetarian option my dad makes me feel like complete garbage for it.

530,"Retaliation or My Own Fault?

I started with my company in 2016, had a great boss who gave me a lot of exposure and helped me get promoted by 2018. I’ve had above average reviews and have been well respected by many. 

In 2018, my former boss and I began working on a project in another department (led by “Drew”, c-suite member) and in early 2019 I was offered a lateral move to join Drew’s department to continue driving the project.

I accepted the offer, although a hard decision, because I loved my former boss and this wasn’t a promotion- I kept my same title and was given a small (5%) raise. 

The decision to join Drew’s department was also hard because Drew’s department is large and riddled with drama, it’s known in our company as the “toxic department”.

During this time, I had engaged in a flirtatious/ sexting relationship with Drew starting back in October 2018, but kept it secret since he is a c-suite member and was now becoming my boss. I also had one sexual encounter with him immediately before accepting the position (April 2019), although it was consensual.

In May 2019, I officially joined his department and began having issues. By June 2019, an anonymous letter was mailed to everyone in our c-suite stating that I had a sexual relationship with a different c-suite member (not Drew, and not true). The accusations came after I was seen being walked to my car by this c-suite member after a small company event where my new department team members were present. Nothing happened, the sender was never identified, but it did make HR began to see me in a questionable light (even if they wouldn’t admit it).

In August 2019, someone scrawled [my name] f#cked [c-suite team members name] on a bathroom wall. The bathroom writing was likely done by the same person who mailed the letter, as they referenced myself and the same c-suite employee as before (not Drew and untrue), however, no one was ever caught. I was confronted about it by HR and they told me they’d look into it but no further actions were taken.

In January 2020, I was called up to HR to be questioned about any potential sexual relationships at work, for promotion or coercion, I’d had with anyone- including Drew. I denied having, doing, or knowing anything. I suspect, although unable to verify, that they questioned Drew too, which if the truth came out, he could be fired. 

In February 2020, I was offered another lateral move to take on a different group within Drew’s department, except it was double the work load and they were eliminating one of two assistant manager roles, effectively setting me up for failure. I turned down the lateral move (which appeared to be a demotion). I was also being moved under a different person within Drew’s department who I’d expressed I didn’t want to work for on multiple occasions.

After turning down the role, Drew approached me in the workplace to say that “I’m shooting myself in the foot” by not taking the role. I asked for a promotion and was told no, that it would be unfair to others in his organization (again, full of drama) and “cause a mutiny”. 

I reluctantly accepted the role and began looking for other jobs. I reached an unfortunate breaking point at a company even and told my current supervisor that I know this was all being done out of retaliation and that I was quitting. 

I left a company event after the blow up with my supervisor. I wish I would have done it in a much more professional way, so I’m very embarrassed, but also relieved. 

I didn’t have a plan to quit before securing another position,  or put together my thoughts about whether or not this is retaliation or my own fault for engaging in a consensual relationship. 

Is there anything I should do to protect myself? I’ve cut contact with everyone in the company until I decide what my next steps are. Should I just start looking for another job? Should I contact an attorney? 

TLDR: great job for 3 years, took a role on a new team in 2019 and it all went downhill. I had a consensual relationship with my boss and now I think I’m being retaliated against by a demotion and ongoing harassment. Blew up and quit my job, not sure what my next steps should be.",22Feb2020,1

At the moment we pay £650 rent and after food, bills etc our outgoing payments a month adds up to £1100 if we haven't overused the heating. After we get a car our outgoings will most likely be £1400.

We  get £1600 a month total and so we'll be saving £200 a month if we buy zero luxuries.

The most anyone will lend us is £102000 for a mortgage. The cheapest home we could move to and keep our jobs is £275000 that's on the help to buy scheme.

Even if anyone would lend us the money for a home the repayments after the fixed period would be 80% of what i personally earn making buying a house impossible.

I have only a college education and there's no job I can get in my town that allows me to earn even the average UK wage (£26000) which is what I'm sure the 5% help to buy scheme is aimed at.

544,"Hi all,

So I’ve run into a situation where my tenant/roommate is very neglectful of his dog. Situations related to:

1. Leaving her outside all day
2. Owner goes out drinking at least 3 times a week to the bars - sometimes doesn’t even come home
3. Dog’s poops are borderline diarrhea 
4. Dog is completely trashing my backyard (scratch marks at my back door, poops everywhere, and holes dug everywhere as well)
5. Neglectful - leaving her in her kennel for long periods of time where she pees or poops.

However my mother came by and asked me if she could take this dog because she loves the breed. (She has one that’s a boy at her house). She would take much better care of this guy’s dog to say the least.

I got home and I took too long showering, and getting dressed. That made her very upset . God forbid I relax a little bit at home.

Long story short she doesn’t want to see me until next week now, when she’s out of work working LONG TIRING HOURS. She gets out at 8pm and tomorrow at 2:30pm yet she doesn’t want to make the effort in seeing me either day .",22Feb2020,1

However, I recently thought about moving (I'm from the US) to a nice, lower cost-of-living, place.

549,"This is someone I used to hang with monthly in a group setting, but haven't talked to for a couple of years, since he moved to a different town. We never really did anything together just the two of us. I got the news recently from a mutual friend who went to visit him.

The mutual friend wrote that our dying friend would probably not be up for a phone call, but a text would be fine. I tried starting writing a message, but realized I have no idea what to say in a situation like this. Neither of us are religious, so I can't start talking about praying for him.

       - Or to put it simply, a total dick

But unsupervised underage drinking makes me very uncomfortable, even as a high-school-aged person. Not in relation to any particular event or traumatic experience, it just does. I have tried alcohol (wine, beer) at my house in small amounts, with my parents presence and supervision. Because of this I would *never* engage in it anywhere besides my house with my parents. It just isn’t me. My parents and I have a great relationship, and we have great communication and boundaries.

My friend has stricter parents in almost all ways, and they do not get along as well as my own parents. We both have a friend group together, and separate friend groups apart from each other. Some of her friends are 1-2 years older than her, and sometimes have Friday night parties, that my friend attends once and a while.

At around 12:30 AM my phone receives texts, which is not in my bedroom (I was asleep by 9:30 lol). They stated things like 

*“I just took my first shot and I wasn’t even phased by it”*

*“It was actually good, I took another one”*

*“I’m so good at this”*

This was upsetting to me. I can’t tell if I’m being dramatic? Is this okay? Do I tell someone? Is this normal? When I woke up I responded “this is really not good man. I don’t like that you did this”

She responded in a long string of messages
*“It was only a little. And I drank a whole lot of water in between it and before and after.”*

*“And then I went to sleep and I feel fine. They were hardly even full shots”*

*“And I’m not planning on doing again. I really won’t do it again it was just for fun and it really wasn’t that much. I’m sorry”*

I just said “No you don’t have to apologize. It’s just not something that I would do, but you do you man” I DIDN’T KNOW WHAT TO DO, I don’t want to lecture her, I’m not her mom. I feel like I shouldn’t have to be, but this feels dangerous to me, especially the first messages.

I  have a friend (my housemate, actually) who always gets sick. If there's  something going round she'll catch it. This is mainly applicable to  stuff like colds. She'll have one for a week, start to get better, then  catch another one. It's not uncommon for her to ""chain"" through several  colds without really getting better. Unsurprisingly this gets her down  quite frequently, as she never seems to get better fast and the people  around her often don't catch any of the colds.

&amp;#x200B;

Because  she's had this issue for a long while, a lot of the stuff I think of she will have already tried, so I'm reaching out for other advice. I struggle to give general reassurance, or health advice, so I'm open to  anyone's ideas. I want to be able to say something more useful than ""I'm sure you'll get better soon"". For reference, here are some of the things she already does/has worked on:

\- Eats healthily  
\- Exercises regularly  
\- Tries to manage sleep (regular sleep schedule, enough hours etc.)  
\- Takes additional vitamins (B12, iron for anemia etc.)  
\- Little alcohol  
\- Moderated caffeine  
\- Non-smoker

Right so I need some advice I have fell (really hard) for a friend I won’t say her name but anyways originally I worked with her wasn’t for long as she left but she instantly caught my eye I couldn’t stop thinking about her for a while and eventually that died down anyways I added her on snapchat it wasn’t chatting all the time but suddenly it picked up we met up and took my two dogs for a walk and spending those what felt forever (in a good way) hours with her I felt straight away that she was for me and we’ve spoke nearly every day meet up a few more times she’s been over to my home and spent time together, now here comes the confusing part she has a boyfriend now when we starting spending more time together she confided into me saying she felt trapped and had to love Him but she just wanted to be friends with him but now shes also very open about her sex life she said she hadn’t slept with him for months but she was telling me this like the second time we met up she has bipolar and said her meds she thinks are the reason due to no sex life (not important just thought I’d add it) now they’re ok and she seems happy being with him but when she was hanging with me I was conflicted on wondering if she liked me like that im still not sure because we are so much alike and she always smiles around me which I love I make her laugh so easily but I don’t want to ruin a great friendship but I also don’t want to get in between her and her boyfriend I just want her to be happy like this is never happened to me if you knew me you’d get what I’m saying but I can honestly say I have fallen massively with no climbing rope like i drew a portrait of her and hid a “I love you” in the picture (you’d have to zoom in to see it) I honestly can say I’ve never felt this way about someone before so Do I ether

565,"I don't have enough time to explain everything so I'll give a TLDR, I'm young, late teens, and if anyone wants to discuss it in further detail and help me decide what to do I'd appreciate that a lot. Basically my black friend, we'll call him Matthew, from school gave recommended me a job because prior to this I didn't work and my family isn't the richest, he said it'd be a lot of money so I said sure. I asked him if it was legal and he said yes. So I decided what's the worst that can happen. He makes a group chat and adds this guy to it. We'll call him Mike. Mike seems really nice at first lulls me into a false sense of security and he explains that I'm gonna sign up for a phone contract he's gonna get a guy to cancel it from the inside and it's all gonna be good and dandy. I ask him again if this is all legal and he says sure. I'm put off and tell him I'm not gonna do it. Mike and Matthew are extremely pissed off and keep saying that I've wasted their time and how I'm a pussy and stuff. I reaffirm that I'm not gonna do it and my best friend comes round on the weekend, I tell him about it and he says oh you should do it, it's good money, he kinda jokes around and scares me saying that Mike is the guy that stabbed a few people and if I don't do it I'm gonna end up like that. He was joking around but I thought he was serious so I decided to do it in the morning. I messaged him and had my doubts but he told me he's a really nice guy in real life and he wouldn't hurt a fly, told me to bring some ID and my bank card, I was really hesitant but I just did it anyway because I didn't think there was any turning back after I had already agreed, I didn't wanna piss off the wrong guy. Met up with him in the high street with his black friend (someone else not Matthew), he didn't tell me someone was going to accompany him, I was really anxious and scared and I then told him I didn't wanna do it, but he said I have to now. He asked me for my bank details and he transferred money to my bank to cover the upfront cost of the phone contract. So I said okay, I'll do it, I went into the phone store shaking like a schizo, I barely managed to do it. I came out, he took the phone off me and I said okay that's it right. I begged him to let me go home, I said I can't do this, this is too much, I was stressing out and shaking so much, and we can do more another time but he and his friend weren't having it. They said that I was wasting their time, he came all the way here (he lives like 15 minutes away, mind you) and that I'm not going anywhere. I said I need the toilet. They let me go to a cafe and I hid in the toilets, I messaged Matthew and told him they weren't letting me go. I started to cry, I knew this was a big fucking mistake, I should have stayed home, but it was too late I was their bitch, all I wanted to do was go home. Matthew messaged me and said he'd message Mike and tell him to let me go, but Mike told Matthew to fuck off and that he was going to make me do another phone. Mike banged on the bathroom door and asked me if I was okay and ready to do the next one. I tried to compose myself, wiped the tears from my face and said yeah gimme a few minutes. He went outside again and waited and after about 5 minutes I walked outside and sure enough Mike and his friend were waiting there for me. I tried the next few phone stores and was hoping they'd say they couldn't accept my card, and sure enough they did the next 2 stores both said they couldn't accept my card. I thought oh I can just tell them it's not working and they'll let me go. But no, they kept insisting I try the next one down and unfortunately they accepted my card. I took out a cheaper phone the second time, which greatly annoyed Mike and his friend but fuck them both, they complained that the phone was too cheap and that they weren't going to make much money off it. Mind you both phones add up to about £1400/$1800. I came out with the second phone and he took it off me and they let me go. I messaged Mike constantly for weeks asking for updates and whether the contracts were actually cancelled. Telling him that I'm from a poor family and can't afford to pay 2 phone contracts, especially while I'm still in education and unemployed. He kept saying not to worry and that they were cancelled. I recently got letters from the phone companies demanding money and if not they'd get a debt collection company to collect the money and it'd ruin my credit score, preventing me from taking out loans or a mortgage when I'm older, if I ever needed to. Matthew told Mike that they weren't cancelled, he left the group chat and blocked me and Mike. Didn't pay me or him a penny and when I told one of his friends who's also my friend what happened. He said it was my fault and that'd I'd have to pay it, and basically fuck off it's not my problem kinda thing. I explained it to my dad and he's furious. And now I'm kind of at a loss as to what to do. I got employed recently, thank fuck for that. And now I'm dumping all of my wages into these phone contracts which feels so shitty, I don't get to keep a penny. Every months it's gonna be me dumping my money into these contracts because of this fucker. Now I'm not entirely sure what to do. Because my dad said to wait until we move (August) to inform the police because then I'll be far far away and Mike and his friends won't be able to hurt me or my family and the police will sort it all out, and the phone contracts will be resolved so I don't have to pay them or whatever. Now I'm not sure what to do. Do I go to the cops? Should I wait until August so me and my family are 100% safe? Do I just pay it off and not tell the police, and just leave this as a lesson to never get involved with people like this. But then I have to pay this for years on end, I'll be miserable for ages and have no money. What do I do?

566,"So about 5 years ago I really wanted to get Spotify Premium. Unfortunately, my parents wouldn't pay for it and I couldn't/didn't want to pay for it with pocket money. So I chose to pay via my mobile communications contract which was linked to my parent's bank account. I didn't tell them (idk know why, I was just stupid back then). But everything worked fine, since my parents don't check their bank statements too dilligently, they didn't notice.

 A few years later or so I terminated this contract and switched to a new one. So I wonder what happened with the money. Was it still somehow payed via the old mobile phone contact although I terminated it? After all, I can still use Spotify premium. And if I now were to terminate the supscription or change the way of payment, would my parents get a notification like an e-Mail? 

Those questions are probably stupid but I don't really know too well how bank accounts work in situations like that. I really don't want my parents to find out that I've been lying to them the whole time but I don't know what to do. I don\`t know if it matters at all in this situation, but I'm from Germany.

They’ve known each other for years and tell each other everything. Anyways I’ll get to the point. When we drank once, i went into the cupboard of jake’s flat and took out some syrup and was like having spoonfuls of syrup because i had the munchies (i get really bad munchies when I’m drunk). Anyways jake got really really angry because the syrup was Alan’s and he’s very protective of Alan. Anyways Jake then told me as a consequence he wasn’t going to drink with me for two weeks. He also said if i did it again, he would not drink with me ever again. Despite the fact that i knew my actions were not okay and were disrespectful i thought this was quite drastic. Anyways i talked to him and we worked it all out after like a week and we’ve been having a good time drinking all together since. Anyways yesterday we were drinking and i was quite intoxicated. I couldn’t find my wallet anywhere so i went to the kitchen and was searching all over the kitchen. In my drunk logic, maybe because i had looked everywhere for it already, i decided to see if maybe it had somehow ended up in one of the cupboards. Anyways i was looking through the cupboards and everything and i opened this one cupboard and inside the cupboard was the same type of syrup. I’m quite an impulsive guy and i think it’s one of my worst qualities. So anyway i like ponder like do it or don’t do it and noone was around so i was like okay i’ll just put a bit on my pinkie finger and put the syrup back and be on my way.

I'm 33 F, no children, from the Netherlands and need to leave my relationship. I have contact with social work, police, government, etc. And they all agree; I'm not safe. But they can't technically help. 

My partner has changed after an accident. Getting increasingly violent. And just really changed. From being liberal to now alt-right... it's so weird. From being a goody two-shoe he now became someone involved with not the nicest motor gangs and local heavy!! (terrorism) criminals. 

Due to this last part it is adviced by social work/police etc. to move to the other side of the country; far away enough that he can not know where I live. The problem;

Housing has a 10 year waiting list. Housing for abused women that need to go in hiding has a 4 month waiting list. Although the police drives through my street now twice a day; it's actually all that can be done. We are all stuck. Every place that wants to help me; is annoyed by it too. I have contact with a place for people that will get homeless; because that will be the situation. I do not have family where I can stay; I only have my father; which wants to financially help me and go far and beyond for me; but due to his severe autism living with him is no option. I stayed so long with this man with his aggresive tantrums because it feels so much like home.. just like my father when dinner is 1 minute late..if someone gets wha I mean.

I have 1 option; renting outside of social housing. Due to my lovely ex-partner that did not like it for me to work; I run in to problems. Commercial housing has bureaucrasy rules. I need 3 copies of salary from 3 months after each other. I have 1,5. I have a job now but I was unemployed/between jobs the half of january and february. I am in luck; I found a place in south-limburg in the Netherlands near the German border that has 1 room housing for only 300 dollars; and they are fine with my average income of 300-800 dollars a month. Which is unique because normally  the rules are way stricter; you need to make 2200 dolars a month at least. IF I would live there; I could get social benefits of 900 dollar (I can't get any now because my ex where I live makes too much money). This is not my plan; I am capable of work and have several finished educations that particular in that region is needed; but the problem is; this housing-mediator does not care; I only need 3 months salary to get this room; how I pay for it AFTER that; they don't care it's just bureaucrasy. I ALL ways I WILL be able to pay the rent due to even not having a job getting 900 sollars social benefits; and the rent is only 300.. this housing medeator knows this; but this 3 month salary rule still applies..ánd my father even wants to sign a contract where IF I would not pay HE will be the person that needs to pay..

I could leave next week with this room;

But I either need

\- A company that fakes 1,5 month of salary and is willing to write an official note that I work there. OR a compagny in south-limburg that is willing to write a note that it is going to employ me for more then 800 dollars a month.. the last one is hard when you can only do a job-application through skype.. ánd immedeatly asking for such letter comes off as not-trustworthy; like I only apply for the job to get housing.. and thats not the case; I would love to have a job there.. but as an employer I would have doubts if a person immedeatly asks for that..

\- OR; this housing compagny does not know my situation.  Should I come clean to this housing medeator about my situation? Hope they are emphatic? I do not feel so because they keep hammering on this 3-month salary bureaucrasy rule; while they already know that I can and will be able to pay. All other needed stuff is okay; the have proof I have no debts and no criminal record etc.. it's just that 1 stupid rule.. 

I'm at my wits end. And thought; let's just throw it out here and see where it gets me. So many minds on here that might have ideas. Maybe connections. Who knows. I just know that I daily have to fear my life untill I am moved to a safe place. And this is my only way of communication since he does no have the password and I'm not allowed to leave the house/invite people/have a phone. I can also only talk on here if he is at work. So If I do not reply; he is home. 

I'm sorry if this story is incoherent; due to this stressfull situation I'm not really clear enough to write something logically and/or forget important details; and rules are different per country offcourse; please ask if you need more information.",22Feb2020,1

578,"It will be a few months before he makes the move, but he's definitely moving here. No question. I've advised him not to, but he's dead set on it. 

When he gets here, he will have no job, no savings, and no place to live. Crashing with me is out of the question, but I want to help him avoid homelessness.

He has no marketable skills and no driver's license.  I'm his only friend in this city.

So far, the only idea he's come up with is for him to send me half the money for a cheap car, and when he gets here, he lives in the car while I teach him to drive. He intends to try and get a job while that's happening. I'm positive this is a terrible idea, but I can't think of another way to keep him under shelter.

Is that idea sound? Does someone have a better idea? I don't know if there are resources for making this happen.",22Feb2020,1
579,"Hey so I've (22f) been in the dating game since last year and lemme tell you, it sucks. I've had no luck with guys whatsoever but I met a guy a couple weeks ( about right before Valentine's day)  off of a dating site and we hit it off really well like I mean we joked about being soulmates and when we first started talking he would ask to call me almost every day and I even called him on his way to work one day. Well we were supposed to hang out this weekend and get like a hotel just for some privacy since we live with family and I told him I'd be paying for it because i didn't want him to spend money if he doesn't like me ( I personally don't think I'm the most attractive person in the world and when I brought this up to other people they said I was wrong but) I told him he could just say he needs to go to work tomorrow and leave early if I wasn't what he was expecting and he was really nice about it saying "" don't be so hard on yourself, I'm not perfect"" but idk if that kinda put him off, our conversations after that were normal but then he seemed like he was kind of distancing himself like not talking to me as often as he used to and when I ask to talk on the phone at night he'll say sure and I get really excited but then a few hours will pass by and he'll say "" sorry I have to go to bed"" and last night it happened and he said "" I can only talk for a little bit then I'm gonna hit the hay"" and at this point ( 1 hour later) I was out with my friend so I told him I couldn't and he said "" oh thank God.... I really didn't want to"" and at the time my brain couldn't understand that he was being sarcastic so that made me really sad then he said that it was sarcasm and it I just laughed and we left it at that. So I got really drunk last night and I ended up texting him this paragraph about how I think our communication is off and i was sorry about what I said and that I'm actually a really confident person and that I just get nervous before the first date but I'd still wanna hang out even for like an hour yada yada. I think he usually gets up for work at like 4am so I feel like he's definitely seen it so I'm freaking out cause that was a risky text and I'm scared of his response.

So I have a coworker who we'll call John that causes a toxic work environment. He lies constantly, screams at people for no reason, talks about how he wants to beat up other coworkers, etc. And is an overall unsavoury person to work with. He is the most immature, insufferable person I have ever had the displeasure of knowing.

A prestigious promotion came up at work that I asked for months ago - I'm still not qualified, despite having trained many people and having second-highest seniority. John asks and immediately gets it, because ""he keeps people in check."" (And not because they're really good friends, but, yknow, that's neither here nor there 👀)

I need advice for telling my boss that John absolutely should not be in a position of authority over anyone. He is far too immature to even be considered for it.

597,"I am a plane spotter, for the reference, I do [this](https://www.avipeo.com/assets/images/f/13.09.18_Planespotting_1-b0c6d9ef.jpg). 

My country (Georgia)  doesn't tolerate planespotting, mainly because our airport administrations are not familiar with it and they simply do not understand that humans have a passion for things which they spend their energy, money and time on.

We do not have any specific bans regarding taking photos/videos of aircraft or the territory around the airport, however, you need a special permit ***inside*** the airport to have a camera with you, but you also need a permit to access the airport.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even enter the airport, I walk around the fence (but without a ladder, like its shown in my link)

and take photos until the police come and start harassing me or others. 

I think it is happening because they do not anything regarding the laws because when I am at the spot, as a photographer I can take a photo in every direction I want, but they still come and disturb the peace.

Yes I can have my papers with me and even the papers proving I am not standing on any property, including the airport territory, but I want it to be free, like in other normal countries.

they claim their job is to make aviation popular, to attract Georgian people into this field and yada yada yada, so I contacted the GCAA and United Airports of Georgia and both are lazy to take the matter in hands.

*side note: they don't even have any laws regarding experimental homemade aircraft and people have their hands tied.*

The reason why I am trying to dig into this hole is that there are no spotters (except only one person who is willing to fight for us), nor such aviation enthusiasts who are really committed to this field.

How I am going to fight? well, I dont think I can persuade them to change the laws or add any new laws regarding this matter, but I guess there is some way of creating the association linked to aviation, so It will have more power than a random citizen with a huge camera - probably this will explain why I need advice with law.

What can be created as a media, so the voice can be heard?  
creating an association? registering myself as media to gain a temporary pass?  
writing tons of formal letters to administrations?  


I dont really know how other countries and people managed to achieve this, therefore I am asking for such advice here, on Reddit, hoping to find a shovel to dig through this hole.",22Feb2020,1
598,"My brother was diagnosed with Autism in 2008 when he was four years old. I didn't understand much then because I was a toddler as well. But as I grew older and began to realize what's wrong with my brother, I felt... Kind of ashamed, I guess. Ashamed of him and jealous of the other children in my school. I saw siblings fighting with each other or supporting each other when they were having trouble. I was jealous of them because it never felt like we're ""siblings"" with my brother. It felt more like I was alone. You see, he doesn't have Aspergers in which you can communicate with them somehow. He has classical Autism. 


The problem is that I never stopped feeling this way, even now that I am almost 17. My parents and my other relevants expect from me to be a good big sister next to him. Everyone's like ""He's disabled, you should be nice to him"" and I know deep inside they're right. It should be my duty to protect him, now that am more ""mature"" and grown-up. When I was younger, they wouldn't say such things but it got more intense when I turned 15. 


You see, my brother entered puberty as well, and when an Autistic person becomes a teenager, things are not that easy. I avoid hanging out with my mom and my brother because of the fear they'll judge us for being with him, or that he'll hurt someone. When he's angry, due to he can't express his feelings with words, he starts screaming or crying, or even break stuff. I remember him doing that in public places, with mom trying to calm him down. I just couldn't bear people starring at us, so I just shouted things like: ""Shut the fuck up, you moron!"" I keep doing this but only at home, because it makes me feel chilled out somehow. I don't care if he can't express his feelings. He just needs to shut his mouth. 


Okay, let's be honest. Most of you will think that's immature of me, and you're right. Am immature. I can't do anything about it! My parents never seemed to have problem with him, especially mom, so they always keep telling me: ""Stop doing that!"" ""You'll turn 17 soon! Just grow up!"" ""He's your brother! I don't understand why you feel this. He didn't do anything wrong"" 


They say ""The god never makes mistakes"". Well... He made a grave mistake that time! He gave me to the wrong family. If he knew what was about to happen, he wouldn't send me there. If I was born in a different family with no disabled siblings, I would probably be the best big sister! You know what? I don't actually ""hate"" my brother. I feel pity for him. I just wish he had an another sibling. Smarter than me, more mature than me, and of course more kind-hearted than me. Am still a problem to my parents because I can't accept the fact that my brother isn't like other people. He's not the problem. I am.",22Feb2020,1

600,"I’m 17, about to be 18. Before I explain this, keep in mind I know I’m the bad guy in this story. I’m finishing up my senior year. I met my boyfriend (D) a little over a year ago, and I felt strongly for him instantly. We ended up dating pretty much immediately. He’s a great person. Very caring, empathetic, all the good stuff. He is caring in every sense of the word. Despite of this, I don’t feel in love with him anymore. 

I am someone who is sort of controlling. If stuff isn’t done right I get a little anxious. I’ve dated before and I’ve been fine and not controlling, but when I’m with D I feel like I have to parent him. This is wearing me down and I can’t stand it. All the little things he does and doesn’t do + me having to manage this has made me feel bitter. It’s stuff like the fact it I don’t tell him to hell go days without showering. He won’t clean his laundry and he’ll wear the same clothes the entire weekend. All he ever wants to do is smoke weed and have sex. He wants to have sex 24/7 even despite telling him when I’m high or drunk I’m not comfortable with sex. 

Now here comes the part where you see why I’m the bad guy. With dating, I’ve become close to his friend group. We hang out with them every weekend and it’s great. As I’ve gotten more worn from the relationship, I feel like I have feelings for one of his close friends (S). I don’t want these feelings, nor would I ever act on them. Either way, I can’t control it. He’s so much more.... everything and I hate it. Being around him makes the flaws In D stand out. D feels like he stopped maturing mmm and trying at 14 so he’s just focused on playing video games and not trying to keep his hygiene up at all. 

S is smart, mature, and fun. D just wants to play switch and watch movies and that’s fine, it’s just not me. I’m bored and feel like I’m stuck. I don’t know if I’m picking the bad out of D cause I’m not in love, or if I fell out of love because of the bad. 

I feel absolutely trapped. I’ve built such strong friendships with his friends and i regret it. If me and D broke up, id likely never see them again. I don’t go to school with D or any of them. I live like a half hour away. But I care about them a lot. Some days I feel very in love, but a lot, maybe a majority of days I don’t. I don’t know what to do. Is it wrong to keep things going with D just because I want to keep my friends? When D looks at me I don’t even wanna make eye contact some days. I don’t want him to kiss me. I don’t want any of it. 

What do I do?",22Feb2020,1

Some girl and her boyfriend helped me find them as it was a large club(multiple floors), I literally searched the whole club and finally found them with her sisters boyfriend and his mate, when I went up to them I thanked the two people for helping me and they were really lovely about it, but as soon as I walked up to my mate she really looked disgusted to see me. I could tell straight away that she wasn’t happy I found them and she started again telling them how I’m pissing her off and she’s booking me a cab to witch I said I haven’t done nothing to u and she starts shouting “yes you fu****ing have u had a go at me in the toilet” and I said no I never as it was her who started on me.

603,"About a month ago my bf told me that an ex of mine had texted him a selfie while holding a coffee mug that said 'Better latte than never.' He had been worried about us spending the night apart as we are always together except for the one night a week his children sleep over at his place. This night only happens at my insistence since I feel he should be able to handle his children alone for one night. He confronted me asking what the picture meant and why he sent it when he did. He asked me to send him my location and then questioned why the address was slightly off. 

Fast forward to a couple of days ago when he says that my ex sent him a photo of me in a hotel room with another man in addition to my ex. Ishould say here that i have never in my life had a threesome. He raged at me over text while we were both at work, threatening to go to his house and confront him. By the time I got off work he was waiting for me. We didn't talk about it all evening because I was upset by his accusatory tone. 

I went to bed and he proceeded to text me about how he felt about the picture and when I asked him if he was sure the photo was me he said he was. I asked him to send me the photo so I could see it, but he said he deleted it to keep himself from being angry about it. He said he would block my ex and that he was sorry for his behavior. 

The following day he said that my ex had texted him a meme referencing paying bills. He accused me of talking to my ex and telling him about our situation. He said he blocked the number as well and when I asked him for proof he sent me a screenshot of his block list after a minute. The thing is the block list shows he blocked the second number first and then my ex's number. 

I was initially upset at my ex for his behavior and I texted him angrily demanding he cut it out. He swore to me on the lives of his children that he hadn't contacted my bf. The thing that makes me believe my ex is the fact that the only photos he's shown me actual proof of are the same photos my ex has posted on his Instagram. The selfie and the meme were both on his public profile. 

Last night my bf called me, he had his kids and I was at home, he accused me of talking to my ex and said he made his Instagram private. I asked him why he was looking at his Instagram when he told me he wasn't going to keep tabs on him anymore. He said the situation was suspicious and I turned it back on him.

This happened probably about 5-6weeks now. He was living with her and her parents. When they broke up he told her he would come by and get his stuff. Her mother basically told him it would be on the porch. Well, a lot of it was but not everything. Was missing quite a lot. Just the other day, he finally managed to get more stuff back. It took over a month of him reaching out to her and told her just gather the stuff when she can and he will come by to get them. Went on for a month and in the end she kept just blowing it off. This weekend he  got a little more demanding since she's been ignoring it, but she basically told him off and she'll return his stuff when she gets around to it (even though that's how it has been for over a month now) my mother texted her saying they'll stop by this weekend or she can drop it off. She dropped them off in the drive way I guess today.  


Issue? Not everything. Now my brother, and father agrees, that just accept the lost here. He's not missing much...just some jeans/khakis, some underarmour shirt/hoodie, and cords to the ps4. I thought it was a bad idea, but I know he probably just wants to be done with it all. My complaint is he already took the lost from the start. Anything they ""shared/split"" on buy? Yeah she kept it.  A switch that they split, a desk, and some kind of speaker.   


I know he is the person effected and he taking the lost in stuff. But the whole situation just annoys me. She already kept all the stuff they split, that costed money. She was completely disrespectful during the whole thing with just playing this ""next week"" game of hers and then telling him he is an ass and she'll do it whenever it's good for her. Just wish I could do more for him. I mean I know for the future, for sure have his stuff kinda packed before breaking up and then dealing with this stuff.

610,"Here’s the situation: my 11 year old daughter copies her siblings and I can’t figure out if it’s because she feels unloved, is an introvert, or some other reason.

For instance, my 7 year old son has been playing Zelda for the past two days and suddenly she wants to play and is constantly asking him/me to let her have a turn. Before that, the Nintendo Switch sat unused for two weeks. 

Before Zelda, the 7 year old was into Overwatch and was constantly bugging him to let her have a turn to play. (We we’re getting close to buying a second account for Overwatch when the son lost interest in it and my daughter subsequently did as well.)

The same son got into rock climbing four months ago and then she suddenly wanted to do it. 

This morning my four year old climbed on top of me when I was just waking up and I cuddled with him for a minute. Once she saw what he was doing, my 11 year old daughter piled on after him but it was not as endearing because she is much heavier!!

I have encouraged my daughter in her own interests (drawing and archery) and praised her efforts and skills but maybe she still doesn’t feel my approval or love enough, and that’s why she is copying younger siblings? 

She is the only introvert in the whole family so maybe this is something I am not comprehending as an extrovert?

I know that it’s normal for younger siblings to copy older ones but I find it baffling that the older one keeps doing it. The few times I have talked to her about it she has burst into tears and feels scolded even when I try to talk to her about it nicely.",22Feb2020,1
611,"I recently got back together with my ex and now that were back together everything is going great between us, we worked out everything that caused us to split up in the past and I really enjoy what we have now. 

One of my best friends doesnt like her at all and wasn't happy or supportive of me when we got back together, he later told me that he wanted one my GF's old friends to talk to me about something that happened between them when my GF and I were apart. Then I heard that my friend actually told my GF's old friend to talk to my GF   to convince her to break up with me. 

I hope I articulated this clearly. My question is, my priority is keeping my relationship and making sure my friend not get in the way of it, whats the best way I can do that without causing to much conflict/drama?",22Feb2020,1

614,"Many years ago when I was still a teen, I was speaking with an old pal online.
Whatever way the conversation went, I informed him that he was a hot-head (I was approx.  17, so he was 15/16). His immediate response was 'Thanks man, now I know who my real friends are'.
This left me chuffed, which turned into confusion as I had apparently been 'dropped' from the group.

As an adult I can see that perhaps I was too direct, and also perhaps he neither could, not wanted, to see this aspect of himself at the time. Who does at that age?

So, in the adult world do our friends want to hear the difficult truth, or to help them pretend it isn't there?

Personally I underwent some major trauma as a late teen (prior to said convo above) which gave me more mature attitudes to issues and honesty.

I'm in my 30s and to this day I don't know the correct way to interact with people.
I have often been polite to be laughed at, so I adjust my behaviour to be in the wrong for being impolite with others.

615,"I was at a bar with my fiancé and her best friend, and we were all smashed drunk. I don’t remember a whole lot so most of these details I’m giving are from her friends perspective who remembers it better than I do since she didn’t drink as much. We went back to our place, and my fiancé and her started making out and touching each other. Her friend then felt we should invite her fiancé over so he doesn’t feel left out, so when he came over, our friends started having sex at the same time my fiancé and I were. Then after a couple minutes my fiancé had to go to the bathroom, so I was just standing there watching my good friends for a long time have sex. I don’t know why I did this, but I walked up to her and she (my fiancé’s best friend) started performing oral sex on me while she was having sex with her fiancé. After a few seconds I stopped and went to go find my fiancé. I didn’t remember all of this at first but when my fiancé’s friend starting to explain what happened that’s when my memories of the night before started flooding back. I feel absolutely terrible, especially since my fiancé doesn’t remember anything from the night before and she doesn’t want to talk about it, either. My fiancé’s been going through a lot of family issues lately so she wanted to drink to forget and I joined her thinking it would be fine, but now this has happened and I’m so scared. I need to tell her, but I don’t wanna lose her either. We’ve been together 8 years next month and she’s everything to me. I don’t know why I did what I did. I guess I thought because she was doing stuff with her it would be ok but all they did was touch each other and make out and I let her perform oral sex, albeit only for a few seconds. But the problem is we’ve talked about other people in the bedroom when we were sober and she wasn’t into the idea all that much. I’m afraid she’ll view it as a breach of trust (which it is), and I already damaged her trust in me once before on an unrelated incident very early on in our relationship. I need to tell her, but she’s so upset because of what’s going on with her family (grandma dying, uncle had a heart attack, niece is in a psych ward after trying to kill herself). I feel like this is gonna push her over the edge. Should I wait or do I tell her right away? I’m not sure what to do.",22Feb2020,1
617,"Basically, about a month ago I left the only job I’ve ever had for medical reasons. I found myself physically unable to do my job. They were... less than understanding about it, which is disappointing given how much I gave that place. Ah well. Bridge is burned. C’est la vie. 

Spent some time getting my health issues a little more under control, and now I’ve decided to go out and look for a part-time, less physically demanding job to help keep myself on my feet. The issue is that idk who to ask to be a reference.

I have one supervisor from my last job I’ve asked as we stayed friends, and I’m hoping she’ll say yes, but I’m worried she’ll decline as I eventually outranked her. I’m also thinking of asking someone from a volunteer position I had a while back, but it’s been a minute since I left to focus on that last job as it was becoming more demanding of my time, so I’m not confident she’ll say yes either.

I’m four years out of high school, so asking a former teacher would be ridiculous. I was in uni briefly but not long enough to forge any decent connections with profs or TA’s before I was forced to leave for, again, health issues.

I’ll probably pick up another volunteer position soon, so I’d be able to ask them to be a reference. The problem with that is that there’s a job position that just opened near me that rarely does that I wanna go for.

If you were in this position, what would you do? Those of you who hire people, what kind of references do you look for outside of former employers?",22Feb2020,1
618,"Yes, my parents are divorced. They divorced about 10 years ago. I’m 18(F)
I was at my dad’s this week and there was a party today. A few days ago I was in the car with him when my mum rang. I had planned a birthday surprise for my mum (this took a lot of work) and we are going there in July with a close friend she has who is male, and who our whole family is quite close to. 
My mum also has a child with another man- they are not together anymore, yet he feels like he owns her and gets to dictate her life. To say he is toxic is an understatement.
This man found out about the birthday plans and proceeded to have a go at my mum because of this other man that is coming with us. So, my mum rang me and asked if we could cancel because she can’t be doing with the hassle. This upset me and she has eventually decided we will still go, after a lot of trouble from this stupid man. 
The phone call lasted a little while, even after we got home. Naturally my dad was curious later on as to what happened so I explained the situation. Now today (2 days after the phone call) there was a party here at my dad’s, and while I was preparing some of the food, I overheard him speaking to his mother (my nan) and our neighbour about what had happened with my mum earlier in the week. I do not think this is appropriate at all, especially because I know my mum would be quite annoyed if she knew about it, and I know my dad would not appreciate it one bit if my mum did the same thing. It’s almost like he’s trying to show people how messed up her life is and it’s some weird way of trying to put her down in front of other people. I don’t think it’s anyone else’s business and I told him what I did in confidence. I did not think he would tell anyone else at all. Do I speak to him about it and say I didn’t like it/think it was right? How would I do this? It hasn’t really happened before so I also don’t know whether I should just leave it and maybe raise it if it happens again...? Any help is much appreciated.",22Feb2020,1
619,"Hey... 
So, recently I've recovered from a disability of mine (almost 5 months). I was unable to walk for 3 years (paraplegia)..... Those 3 years of mine were extremely lonely and sad. I spent those 3 years in the corner of my bed, exercising &amp; watching anime.
You see, those few years were extremely difficult for me both physically and mentally. I was super lonely. My friend and family stopped visiting after a while which I don't blame em for. My recovery was long and difficult, but here I'am, once again walking like a normal 19 year old C': . 
The thing is... I've held in my emotions for too long.... And I feel like they're finally bursting out...  And it's ruining me.
For the past 2 weeks, I'm slowly feeling sad for no reason at all. They seem like mixed emotions mostly sadness with a touch of depression.
I can't focus on my studies, I used to love gaming but I don't even feel like going near my PC anymore, I was hanging out with my friends and had the most fun I had in a while.. but these days I find myself forcing myself to laugh and enjoy. I suddenly lost 6 kgs which spooked the living shit out of me. 
The 2 ways to really release your bottled up emotions is to either cry or talk. 
I'm gonna say something really cliched but I really can't cry anymore. I can't find a reason to. I sometimes at night pretend to cry and watch sad shit to force myself to cry which works but I feel like it doesn't help me with my emotions at all.
The talking part is absolutely BS. Whenever I talk to people about this they say the normiest stuff which is correct but it ain't helping ya donut. 
What do I do to stop myself from being so ungrateful, stupid and petty.
I'm just confused, feel like I'm just running in a circle.

620,"Hello, I’m all out of hope. I have no friends to talk to. I’m not allowed to go to my doctor anymore, and I’m trying to solve my problems by myself with no success whatsoever. 

I have constant anxiety attacks and I cry a lot. I feel mentally and physically unwell. I am at a point where I can’t form proper sentences while talking. I was taking medication for stuff but I can’t get them anymore due to not being allowed to go to my psychiatrist which I’ve been going weekly before. I have tried telling this to my parent but every time I start explaining he starts yelling at me. 

They have always been like this. Whenever I cry they yell at me and insult me which makes things even worse. I tell them that I can’t stop crying and I need to calm down a bit but they just keep yelling. 

We have a lot of fights. I know I am not very good at explaining things but I try my best. Whenever I try explaining myself they yell and stop listening to me, interrupt me etc. 

I had to stop going to my doctor a couple months ago.  My parent stopped paying for my doctor because they thought I was getting better. I can’t financially support myself since I’m still a minor. 

For example, I tried making pasta today. I kinda failed. I burnt the sauce and my hand. They came home and said “don’t you know how to make pasta” and started yelling at me again. I had an anxiety attack they kept yelling at me etc. I tried explaining that them yelling at me is making me even more distressed. I got yelled again.

We can’t have a day without a fight or an argument. I just keep getting yelled at. Whenever I try anything and make one mistake (big or small), try explaining my emotions and opinions, cry, have anxiety attacks or throw up I get yelled at again.

652,"This is a follow-up to a previous post I made.
So I heard my mom talking to my family and they all want me to stay here and go to a university. I don't want that. I can't even get a job at the moment (for personal reasons). I just need to finish two more semesters of college.
I have mentioned wanting to go to another state but my parents always say I cant even if I try to convince them that everything will be fine. 
My life is falling apart and I feel like going to another state to live with the one I love the most is the answer. He has been showing me everything I can do there and all of the opportunities that are offered. There's barely anything to do where I live and I just end up sleeping all day. I'm losing all hope in life. I'm tired of trying to make my family happy. I want to make myself happy too but I can't because of my family's choices. My depression has gotten worse, I'm always bored and tired and I have been crying more often because of some stuff that's been going on. I just want to move away from all of that.
I really need help convincing them on this situation I'm facing. I'm losing hope.",22Feb2020,1

He has gotten home and has to spend money on cleaning and the cat was put down. I know he’s hurt but he is blaming me for it when he literally rang me and said not to take it to the vet. He said I should pay him for the damage when I couldn’t do anything. 

I’ve had a massive fight. I want to be paid for my work and I don’t want him to be a dickhead.

655,"First of all, I apologize for the long post. A lot of things have happened this week. 

He revealed on Monday he had plans to end his life. He called the police on himself. NOBODY saw it coming, especially not me. He had never mentioned anything about suicide, death, or depression. All I heard about from him was mild anger issues and aggression. I had no idea how bad it was. I visited him for six hours in the emergency department over two days, before he was transferred to a behavioral health hospital. 
Nothing could have prepared me for this at all. I’ve been in a behavioral hospital before when I was younger, so I told him what to expect. He was very grateful for me visiting him in the emergency department.
When he was in the ambulance on the way to the next hospital, he texted me a long paragraph about how much he appreciates me. Saying he loved me, saying he would always be looking forward to seeing me when he discharged. 
This is where it gets confusing. He calls me the next day at around 6pm. I’m happy that he’s calling. But soon, he tells me he doesn’t want me to visit. A little odd considering he was begging me to visit him just last night, but he explains he wants to focus on himself, which I think is completely respectable and reasonable. 
Then, he tells me he’s made friends. They’re all girls- and he excitedly tells me that they understand him “really well” and that he will hang out with them when he gets out. I trust him, so I decided not to ask him any questions about cheating, because while I’m starting to feel insecure by now, i don’t think he would react well.
What also confuses me is how happy he sounds over the phone. Don’t get me wrong, I want him to be happy, but just two days prior he was talking about jumping off a building. So that was strange to me, how quickly he changed. 
The next day he calls me. I ask him how he’s feeling. He admits he’s been feeling “all over the place” and “confused on emotions”. OK, I think. That’s understandable. 
He starts talking excitedly about “restating his life”. I have no idea what he’s talking about. He explains that he wants to forget about everyone back home- because it reminds him of when he was suicidal. ( he uses the word “was” as if he is no longer feeling suicidal after two days. I’m not sure how I feel on this.) 
My jaw drops when he says that he wants to take a break. Okay, he going through a LOT of stuff right now. I will respect his wishes. But then-he goes the extra step of telling me “don’t contact or call me. I won’t tell you when I discharge so you know not to text me. We can talk when the break is over, maybe a month or so when I get back.” He also tells me he’s going to “set aside” every picture of us we have taken. And that the only people he will hang out with when he gets back will be the three new girls he has met. Because, they “understand me better.” All the whole, he’s telling me this in an excited and happy voice. 

How can I still support him when he’s telling me he wants a month long break. He doesn’t want me to visit. Telling me he will not contact me. That we can’t eat lunch together anymore at school. 
I nearly snapped when he told me that his new friends understand him better than I ever could. It’s been two days. How could they POSSIBLY understand him better? 
I am trying very hard to give him the benefit of the doubt, and assume that he still loves me, and hasn’t found another girl at this hospital. I keep reminding myself he’s still the same guy, but he’s just going through a rough time, and wants some space from me and the rest of his friends. 


Am I overreacting? I’ve been an emotional train wreck this past week. And for him to tell me that he doesn’t want me to talk to him at all, even when he gets back is crushing me. Can I still support him? Should I? And if so, how? 

TL;DR
My boyfriend went to a behavioral hospital. The phone calls we have exchanged together have led me to believe he wants to break up and make me suspicious he has found another girl. Even though he only said he wants a break- he gave me a bunch of rules I need to follow during said month long break. But I still want to support him no matter what because he is going through a very hard time. What is the best way I can handle this situation?",22Feb2020,1
656,"Me and my friend (both 21 F) have been friends for over 5 years. I was a very weird 15 y/o when we met and she was the one person okay with it. She saw it as endearing and we shared a common bond over edgy jokes and love for books/bands. I have had a harsh time with my mental health which led to me not doing very well academically despite having a lot of potential. She got into a good college and moved away. I eventually got into a college of my choice too but we stayed in contact and we texted almost everyday. 
  We met few times a year but eventually she started flaking on her plans last minute (this happened multiple times) . She progressively got more angry as time passed and whenever we talked about absolutely anything (we once we're talking about a past relationship I had when I was 15 and she said I had no standards or braincells). 
I usually keep myself out of conversations but I was once talking about going off meds and she goes off about how I make everything about myself (I ask her about herself all the time but she says she doesn't want to talk about it). I ended up apologising. She said she's 100% okay talking about meaningless stuff and that she would feel very guilty if she cut contact with me to which I said ""you don't have to"" and she goes ""see? Everything is about you?""
A week back, she talked about being busy but she met up a friend of hers and spent the day when she was in the same city(I found out from social media which I was temporarily blocked from btw) I confronted her about it and she refused to admit it. I've been trying to find a solution to this but talking goes nowhere. She was my only friend (I live in a very conservative culture so open minded people are hard to find) and I feel lost. 
In her defense....I did some reckless stuff quitting my medication without asking my doctor (it was making me gain weight and there was a significant pressure on me to quit) and I get that dealing with someone else's bullshit can get jarring. I just want some guidance to what my next step should be.",22Feb2020,1

To be honest, I miss going to school.

Even though I have a love-hate relationship with school, it still helps me to distract myself from sad thoughts because I would be spending most of my time there interacting with other people and doing work.

Now that I am on a break but not allowed to go out (due to the coronavirus situation), I spend most of my time home alone. School only reopens months later.

I am currently facing some situations which are causing me to think of sad thoughts again so maybe cooping myself at home isn't really a good idea at all...

But then again, my parents are strict and they don't allow me to go out. Hence, I cope by taking long ass naps lol.

He’s said some pretty racist shit in the past. Last night it was he respects Donald Trump because he doesn’t give a shit what anyone thinks and only looks out for himself. He thought it was hilarious that the administration ignores recommendations not to fly the 14 people who tested positive for coronoavirus back on a flight with 300 other people.  And wouldn’t let it go that he respects Trump more for doing that.

My family combined all make enough to live comfortably but they live in one of the worst neighborhoods renting a very horrible apartment with a roach problem and literally everything broken like the AC we live in Arizona.. and it’s because they don’t wanna get their finances in order. I’m talking horrible credit and owing a bunch of money. Before I moved in with my gfs family I made a budget for them and they didn’t wanna listen or take my advice I don’t know didly about finances neither, my worst subject is math. I’m talking special ed math courses all my life.

I refuse to live the way my family does worrying about paying bills due to poor money management.

Anyway, my S.O. And I applied for our first apartment yesterday and we have yet to hear back but incase we do get approved I created a monthly budget based on our income (after taxes) and she straight up refused saying “we’ll just put whatever away that we need whenever” or something along those lines basically refusing to budget. I’m frustrated because I wanna play this smart specially since it’ll be our first time on our own. We can’t do the 50/30/20 method because of the estimated total I calculated since we don’t have the best jobs so I went with 80/10/10 after doing the math on rent, utilities, groceries, etc. Not the best but we will survive and that’s what matters. This is also me guessing so after our first month hopefully it’s subject to change to something better.

What’s holding us back is a car she’s paying off Aprox $500/m which she wants to pay for independently, in a relationship this serious I see us as a unit and take on her Debts and choose to assist because of course we wanna be debt free.

She thinks that just because she’s like 2 inches tall that she can punch me, push me and then COMPLAIN ABOUT GETTING HURT. YOU PUNCHED ME!? She even pushed me into a locker which gave me a bruise. She took my other friend’s hand and slid it into my crotch which made me SO uncomfortable. She always looks at my phone when I’m texting someone and she gets irrationally angry anytime I‘m visiting my old class during free period because she had to spend it alone then. When I jokingly tap her shoulder or do anything she jokingly says “oooh sexual assault” (??). Whenever I say “I’m going home. I’m feeling really sick” she says “pls stay I don’t wanna go home alone”. Girl, I’m literally about to vomit. I’m not staying just bc YOU fear loneliness. And she always hangs out with me but as soon as her other close friend enters the classroom, she goes back to her desk to sit next to her. Basically, I’m just someone she talks to because she doesn’t wanna feel lonely. Been there and I’m never going back. She JUMPED me during P.E. a few days ago and proceeded to apologize what felt like 20 times. She literally cried because the teacher asked her a question that she didn’t know the answer to. Btw, she’s starting her job at a pharmacy this autumn. Wtf is she gonna do when a rude customer approaches her? Cry? She apologizes for EVERYTHING even when she didn’t do shit.

I get that she has problems at home. Her parents are tiger parents. They yell at her when she brings home a B. She literally has no hobbies and rarely meets up with friends outside of school. Her sister bullies her by calling her “fat” and “chubby” (she’s not). I don’t wanna hurt her feelings even though I unfortunately have to. She has to respect my boundaries and understand that not everything has to go her way (she’s a pathological perfectionist). She’s 19 now. I’ve told her “if you don’t become a stronger, confident person, you’re not gonna make it in life.” Sounds harsh but that’s just the truth. Weak people get taken advantage of. And I feel really bad for her but simultaneously I want to never talk to her again.

Does anybody know what I should do? I can’t put up with her BS anymore. I’ve dealt with people like that and it drained my energy. I’m can’t “fix” her. A good therapist has to do that. But how do I tell her to stop hitting me, clinging onto me and misunderstanding everything I say?",22Feb2020,1
687,"Some context; So. I recently came back to work after being gone for a year and a bit (I moved and came home) well timing apparently isn’t on my side right now cause I’m crushing hard on my coworker whose actually moving for a few months to a completely different province. The day we first met he told me to come with him, I was doing a night shift and he wasn’t scheduled in the morning, drove up at 5am to drive me home and has drove me home a few times since meeting him. He plans on leaving for the other province after I take him out for dinner next weekend. 
Last night I showed up for my shift as his was ending in a few hours, he told the other nights girl to go home so we could work one on one and we spent the whole shift talking and flirting, instead of driving me home we smoked up and made out. 
After telling my mom basically what I typed above, she said to do it when I have the money. My other coworker that also knows the whole situation has said just do it cause there’s not issue in finding jobs out there and he’s someone I don’t want to let get away (very true)

688,"My parents are super strict, and often forceful. Today, they went on one of their usual hour long rants on what a disappoint I am, a failure, etc. I (17M, three months from graduation) left not wanting to deal with their bullshit. I have been out of the house for a few hours letting my head clear.

A little background. My mom is anything but good. She’s been trying to get me fired from my job for over a year, has literally removed all my friends save a 12 year job of who we’ve known for life, literally has her friends in town watch my every move, has turned most of my mentors on me, and refuses to let me leave the house unless either she or my dad are accompanying me.

My father is a brute, not exactly caring or helpful. He’s always been his wife’s lapdog. I can’t count how many times I’ve been beat, searched, grounded, or just cussed at at her word. 

This morning, I woke up only slightly earlier than I usually do and then he first question I got was “Why the hell are you up so early?”. Sensing how this was going to go, I told her I was heading to the gym. She did not like that and then went and got her lapdog.

I was getting ready to leave when my bedroom door gets kicked open and he’s standing there “Where the fuck do you think you’re going?!”. I kept my reply short and curt, he responded with “You watch your god damn attitude or I’ll beat your ass right here.” (This was screamed in my face while he was pounding my chest with hi finger).

Anyway, they forced me to do the entire household work (I have two brothers that also help, but not this time). After those were done, they had the audacity to sit me down for a talk. “Why are you being disrespectful? Why did you get up so early? Who are you meeting? Are you buying drugs?”. I didn’t even answer and once they were done just left.

Anyways we looked up the person and found a Facebook and insta. Now this may or may not be the person who sent the package, we’re not sure. They are a married man who lives in Japan. His location on social media matches the address so we are assuming it’s him. Anyways the package contained these little skunk figurines that you attach flatulence clouds to. The fart clouds are in the shape of different animals(as promised picture will be posted in comments). Anyways, what should we do? This has made us somewhat uncomfortable and we hope this is just a mistake. My S/O is very attractive and her insta is not private. She does pole and post her moves on insta.

691,"So, my brother is applying for two private high schools and his very clear first choice gave him a 50% off tuition scholarship. However, to everyone’s surprise, his second choice offered him a complete full ride with no tuition needed at all. 

My brother says that he definitely still wants his first choice still, but he also still wants to relieve some pressure off my parents. He is a very empathetic brother and always wants to constantly do what he can to make my parents’ lives better. He is undecided as of now. My mom is undecided too. 

My dad, however, still wants the first choice school, but he thinks that a full ride is way too much to pass up on and thinks we should ask the first choice school for a more competitive offer. If they don’t increase it, he thinks he should go to his second option school, which my brother said he would be kinda fine with it but not as comfortable with it since he really wants his first choice.

I attend his first choice school, and I am 100% for him taking his first option school. I’m trying to argue that high school is a big four years, and if his first choice school is the one he wants, we shouldn’t argue with what he feels is the right school for him. Plus, transportation and carpool issues (and after-school activities since we both play multiple sports) will definitely have to be thought over. I’m not trying to sway your guys’ opinion to side with me, and I will readily accept any criticisms of my main argument. I want your honest opinions.

Again, my family in general just is kind of shocked at the dilemma we have, but we also do not know what to do. It’s been a day so far and we haven’t come close to a solution. We will email his first choice school and ask for a more competitive offer soon. But, in your guys’ opinion, which would you choose?",22Feb2020,1

Instead, I sent more messages before she opened it, such as: sharing a news article, asking a question, and asking her to call me so we can make plans for lunch the next day (something we were already going to do coincidentally). These distractions insured that the fan fiction wasn’t read and I would have a chance to delete it off her phone the following day. When we went out for lunch she was showing me something on her phone and I managed to delete the message when she wasn’t looking.

693,"21M || Obviously everyone wants to be with someone, well not everybody, I do, but what Im trying to get at is:

How do I overcome ""needing"" someone, I want to feel what its like, but, I want it to be with someone that its worth it, I find myself looking, when in reality its going to come when it comes.

I've tried but I end up getting disappointed because the other person doesnt value me on the same level as I value them.

I can say that I'm happy with myself, I truly am, but since I never been on a physical relationship it makes me think Its me and that the problems I have (of value) are _essentially_ mine.

I give love to anyone around me, obviously not romantically unless its needed, I care for everybody, and I see that not everybody does that, most of the people I've met, they're focused on themselves (which is great!) and it makes me wonder If Im giving more love to everybody else than myself and I guess I need to balance that, because I like helping out, everyone asks for advice on personal stuff without me asking so I guess theres a level of love there.

_Im going off track_

My main wonder, its If I think Im happy with myself, is being romantically frustrated something that Im experiencing now?  I want to learn how to focus on myself but at the same time I want to share moments with someone, and Im fine being a virgin, Im not in it for the sex but rather a S/O.

It was so loud it sounded like it was coming from the front door. I sat up and waited to see if it happened again and it did, this time I heard more knocking/banging.


I wear earplugs to bed too so that tells you how loud it was to wake me up. 


Either my neighbors were really getting down on it OR someone was being abused and banging on my wall for help. I wasn't sure what to do as it was midnight and I live alone and didn't want to go next door and knock to see what was going on. It was very disturbing to say the least. The banging happened 3-4 times every 30 seconds it seemed. Eventually with the help of my radio I went back to sleep.

He would call them whores, bitches, tramps, cunts etc.
He would often hit them, although not very hard but hard enough to hurt

My new school is extremely centered around seniority and the I as well as the guy is in grade 9 and essentially what this means is that we are ""better"" then the grade 8 kids and he is very rude to the grade 8s as well. He is rude to the high grade kids as well even though hes constantly preaching to everyone about seniority 

On my second day in the school he argued with a grade 12 for over half an hour because he had to sit one seat further forward

So I'm really muscular and a strong jawline. I'm apparently rated 10/10 though I don't believe it but people think I'm dating a model and probably get tonnes of chicks. I really get annoyed when people assume this because it's quite the opposite and possibly the reason why girls assume I'm unapproachable. Often my friends tell me that girls are insecure and scared to approach because they have a fear of rejection and don't want to risk it with someone who she thinks is out of their league. But really? Even the girls who are 10/10 would think the same? Possibly not. If I chose to be an Instagram model, I would definitely be popular. Often people think that I am and would be surprised that I don't have social media (because it's useless and I'd rather do something productive than chit chat and waste my time on it)

so basically what happened is my roommate invited me to go hang out with him and his friend, plus a couple of his friends, over at his dorm. I thought it would be fun to catch up with my roommates friend because we played IM volleyball together last semester and I hadn’t seen him in a while. there was no mention of alcohol, before I got there I thought it was just gonna be a couple guys hangin out playing xbox and whatever. so we get there and everyone’s drinking. my roommate and I immediately knew that we should’ve left since i’m on deferred suspension but we stuck around for a little to catch up. I was literally just playing xbox with one of the guys there (who was also sober) when an RA knocked. even though I wasn’t drinking, I became incredibly nervous because I knew how this would look. the RA was chill and all, and he put in an incident report. the worst part about all of this though is when the RA asked for my name, I SPELLED MY NAME WRONG. I don’t know why, i don’t know how, I think I was just so incredibly nervous about the possibility of getting suspended, and that on top of my social anxiety killed me I feel like. 

The RA said he was going to have to call the cops to do a room search but my roommates friend stepped in and brought a few bottles of beer over and said that it was the only alcohol in the room, and he bought it so he didn’t call the cops.

maybe it’s a blessing in disguise that I spelled my name wrong, who knows. maybe they won’t be able to find me in their system, but honestly I only swapped like 2 or 3 letters by accident so I feel like they’ll be able to figure out who I am and be like “oh he misspelled his name, he had to be hammered”. 

my roommate and everyone else involved were actually super supportive towards me, telling me they’ll do anything they can to make sure I don’t get suspended, which I appreciate a ton. 

honestly I don’t even know if you get referred to student conduct for incident reports, I know you do for conduct reports (which is what I got the last time I fucked up). I have another friend who got caught up in a similar situation (he wasn’t on deferred suspension though) where he was in a room full of people drinking and he wasn’t drinking, and he was able to get out of it. i’m hoping I can too.

705,"I went out partying with my coworker last night. We drank, and did a little bit of lean. I actually didn’t drink any of it, because I was feeling like it wasn’t such a good idea.

After a weird, but fun night, I go to crash on their couch. Now keep in mind they do have a history of mental illness, but, as this is the only way I can describe it now, utilize their manipulation tactics to seem in control. They were texting in to kids help phone about thoughts of self-harm while I was sleeping, and that resulted in me waking up, to someone loudly banging on the door. I started panicking, and asked if we should call the police. My coworker continued to stare blankly at me, until I made the executive decision to do it on my own. When I called, the dispatcher told me to open the door, and that it was the police. I told her she must be nuts, and she assured me that I was okay to open the door. Once I did, both paramedics and police officers forced their way in, to talk to my coworker, who seemed to be suffering from what I can only describe as a bad, pretend amnesia spell. After she wouldn’t talk to them, they told me I was responsible for her, and that they were “placing her in my care”, and they left. After they left, she told me that the DXM in the lean was interacting badly with her medication. Which, I knew was not true. At that point, though, I was willing to say anything to get her to the hospital, so I could get myself some help from the nurses. I pulled one of them aside, and then told them what happened. She told me to just go home, and that I didn’t have to be responsible for her any longer. 

Now, I called in, and told my manager I needed to talk about a personal safety concern. She’s told me to come in tomorrow, but I can not do so. In fact, I don’t think I’ll be able to come in at all, if Sam is there.  I can’t afford to quit, but I can’t physically go in there, knowing that borderline psychopath is just waiting for me.

706,"The title describes it, my friend was apparently caught  doing something with her boyfriend.  She’s had a bad life, was in an orphanage after being abused, and was adopted at like 15.  

I became friends with her from school.  However her parents I’d say are strict.  I’ve had bad feelings about them ever since seeing them interact with her and the other children.  One time I witnessed one of the 7/8 year old kids had wet his pants outside and went to go inside to tell them he had wet his pants.  He was basically yelled at for wetting his pants which I’ve read   Isn’t a good way to approach wetting issues.   

Another case, they don’t care she doesn’t have at least a phone for emergencies. There was an instance where her car headlights were broken.  She was driving at night and could only use her blinkers to find her way.  I’ve even asked what if her car broke down, and she told me her parents told her to knock on every door. The problem is she lives in a more rural area compared to me.  And it would be unsafe for a young teenage girl to be knocking on every door of strangers.  If I had a 16 year old daughter, I wouldn’t want her to do that.  And where I live, there have been missing cases.  

So it’s all a bit weird.  She once was allowed to have a phone when she turned 16 because she met the requirement for having a phone which originally was if she had a job.  She was excited but soon it was taken away from her not even a week long.  She doesn’t even have those cheap flip up phones for emergency.  

Now her and her 14ish year old brother is being kicked out.  However they did have hard lives because they grew up in an orphanage and had bad parents they were taken away.

709,"Long story short: I'm a teenager with a job as a shift leader at a fast-food restaurant. I'm a fairly relaxed boss, but also not too soft. Today, I asked an employee to perform a certain task (which wasn't unreasonable at all, it's one of his duties) but he went like this: ""Arghhh (my name), I don't want to do that! Why do I have to do that!?"" in a really unpleasant way.

My boss stood next to me (the store manager) and overheard it. He then quickly said the following: ""(Name of employee) don't act like a fucking smartass go do what he says and listen to (my name)."" in a very serious way. After that, he was immediately quiet and actually did everything I said and didn't dare to speak back to anything I said. It seemed like he got really hit by that.

Now, my question is, was this an example of assertiveness / leadership skills? That employee was obviously getting a bit out of hand, and my manager immediately made him shut up, listen to me and do what I say. Seems like a good lesson to me: when employees don't perform the things they're supposed to do / reasonable tasks you can be direct with them, assert that you're the boss, they're being paid to work and otherwise they can leave and not come back.

I also read, for example, that Steve Jobs was a (massive) dick to his employees (his leadership style) which is the reason why Apple had all the successes it had (and is today a 1400 billion dollar company).

I make plushies for people: made one for my best friend to ask her to be my maid of honor, am making one for my mom for her birthday of baby Yoda etc. Even have an Instagram for my plushies and plan to start a small business soon. 

My fiance and I are going to see a band we like for a meet and greet/concert in may. I had the idea (as a joke at first) to make plushies/dolls of the four band members. Fiance thought this was a great idea and I went ahead and got materials.

My dad says it's weird to do this but I don't see why. They wont be stuffed with my hair or anything and are new materials. I even found reference photos of their clothes from the video for one of their songs that is going to be our first dance at our wedding. 

Is my dad right? Is there a way I can do this at it not be creepy or weird? If I dont give them to them, I'll probably just keep them since I bought the materials anyway. Help!",22Feb2020,1

I know my feelings are irrational but I feel them and I don't know what to do because they're so strong. I'm worried my family won't give me as much attention, my mom talks all the time about my sister's baby and I don't even really consider her as part of my life. I just need someone to talk to or some advice. My problems are the constant talking about her kid, the attention thing, and the fact that it changes a person.

Long story short, I fell deeply in love with this person and I believed he was someone who truly cared for me and loved me. We had an emotional and sexual relationship. I thought he was the one. Found out not only is he married, but that he has a kid on the way (other children as well). She’s only a few months pregnant so he was having sex with both his wife and me simultaneously and I am furious. 

He admitted it when I confronted him. He basically told me to get lost and that I meant nothing to him. So not only am I heartbroken but I am filled to the brim with anger and I want him to regret ruining my life. He has so far not expressed any bit of remorse. I believe he must be some kind of sociopath. 

How do I make this right? What would you do, ladies? I have been thinking about contacting his wife but I don’t know what kind of reaction i’m going to get from him.

727,"I 25F live with my grandma, who was fine and independent until three weeks ago. She caught a virus and we suspect she also had a stroke during her stay at the hospital. She basically went from fully independent to needing a full time caregiver. 

Our apartment only has two bedrooms, and I understand they want the caregiver to move into my room. I'm not being kicked out forcefully - I understand the situation but it doesn't make it any less dire.

I left my job also exactly 3 weeks ago because I had plans to work part time and begin my college studies again, which I had previously been unable to complete for multiple factors. 

So, I have to move out. I have no job right now, currently sending out CVs and I also have money saved up. My mom is insisting I go to college and she will pay half my rent, but I don't think this is what I want.

My mom is not precisely rich, we live in an under developed country in which rent costs pretty much your entire salary. I wouldn't be able to afford with a part time - I'd barely be able to afford it if I worked full time.

My options are staying here, finding a job that pays shit but enough to rent a crappy apartment that I live to pay. I don't have friends who can move in with me and shared rooms are not common in my country.

My other option is grabbing the savings I have and moving to Spain. My dad lives there, though I have a terrible relationship with him I would only stay until I find a shared room and then look for a job. I can legally work in Spain and my chances there are at least better than my chances here.

This option also means leaving most of my family behind. My stepfather has melanoma and while it seems he is going to get better I would be leaving my mom alone to take care of him.

But I truly don't know what to do. I feel lost and helpless. I feel trapped. My mom can't afford to pay a second rent and I don't even know how long it's gonna take me to find a job. Everything was so sudden and I don't know how to process it.",22Feb2020,1

So, I know how general masturbation works for a woman. I've done pretty much everything I can do except actually fingering myself. I decided to try it out last night though. I cut my nails, wet my fingers, and went for it, but I swear to god I couldn't find the hole at all. every time I felt like I was in I looked down to check and my finger hadn't gone anywhere.

It literally feels like there is no entrance. And honestly it's making me really nervous for the first time I actually have sex, because I don't want to look completely inexperienced.

Is there something wrong with me? Should it be easy to find for a woman? Are my fingers just really small? Are there steps I'm missing, or something?

735," 

Im  not sure why would they do that.Appearantly i heard that my neighbours best friend  had supposingly a crush on me for the last years without me really  knowing much.Although i knew she looked at me at times she didnt really  try to approach me when i was always alone or say something to me,i was  extremly insecure back then so i also didnt do anything and hoped she  would just snap out off it eventually and find someone.Turns out she  actually didnt forget about me,and even after 2 years she had the same interest somehow.

Now her friend has  told her about me,she has even told her that i went to a physchologist for  my issues and that im sick and i should be avoided.Next  rumours spead even more in class,people knew i had issues and combined  with my bad social skills and bad situation grasping people now see me  as a weirdo and avoid me.

I said  some weird things on the phone back when i was extremly depressed,like  im sick,im tired,i have health issues,eating issues,appearance issues,i  cant be worth to be made a friend cause i have no energy and im sick.Now  that i eventually finally started to try and climb up and found and a direction  in my life,but this all gets out there and gets known,idk how much is known  but i still cant keep shaking the thoughts and some comments out of my head.This year i  just wanted to maybe try and talk more to others and finally create some  connections,but its hard to get this out my mind,people just think of me  now as a person with many physchological issues and problably avoid me,some  comments just haunt me.

I have had a slighty big change in the last month cause i have finally found a direction in my life im which i was completly lost,so i can be a bit more free,unafraid and place less attention on others opinions,still just this 3 week period isnt enough for my skin to become so thick and for me to suddently gain social skills or forget about everything.I just want to move on,but i dont know what to do now,i feel ill be haunted just thinking the other people around me might know i have this issues and avoid me,i dont think i have abilities to tackle this problem correctly,it may be a simple solution but i may mess everything up.

I feel that this is likely gonna be the last week for me to make an attempt to talk and try make friends,i heard some conversation near me about people considaring adding me to their friend group but then rejected the idea.I might appear weird sometimes cause im not fully past my insecurities but i have being able to appear confident and shy at times during the last week,which is what might scare people away,its almost like i have a split personality.",22Feb2020,1

Ok so, I live in a pretty troubled area; lots of gangs and violence. One day I met this girl who lives blocks away from me, we got talking and met up again just as friends. She was perfect smart, funny and pretty. We unfortunately never exchanged numbers as we lived so close ( by the way she was definitely coming on to me). Then one day tragedy struck; the gang that sorta runs my area started feuding with the her neighborhood (note: myself and herself no affiliations to any of these groups). Anyways no it is very unsafe for me to go over there and meet her. She also never comes out of her room. So I haven’t seen her in almost a year even though we live two blocks away. I constantly think about her, she was perfect ( I know nobody is perfect and she was probably mean, evil and unkind at times like every human) but I just can’t get over her. I’ve never felt this way about someone. Any advice for getting over her? Thanks guys",22Feb2020,1

746,"Hi so I am at college right now, I am just coming back after a two year break where I worked and so far it’s been great. I made deans list and I love my roommates but it cant all be great right? There is this girl we will name Betty and she is driving me nuts. I met her through my former roommate (she left last semester because of funding). In fact all my friends outside of my roommates I met in this friend group. Last semester things were fine, she would occasionally hit me up for something and I didn’t feel she liked me that much but honestly I didn’t care. I can handle a nasty comment, or the need she has to always be the smartest person in the room because I didn’t see her. I would hang out with others in the group and occasionally give her a ride somewhere. This semester it all fucking changed though.

Betty has to leave school as well, see she is In The foster system and because of that she couldn’t attend this semester and she had to enter this shelter for 18+ girls in the system. It’s an hour away from our college and she doesn’t have a car. She now.... constantly is hitting me up for something, whether it’s money, (I made the mistake of loaning her 20 while she was at school and never will again) or a ride, she texts. If you went through our convo it’s just her asking for things and if I say no she doesn’t even bother replying. 

Last weekend I broke though, she hit me up on Vday and I had a thing planned with my best friends from outside the school. She asked for a ride and I said no, she then asked for me to drive her to the airport the next day and I said sure if you throw me gas money. The next day she has strep and says how she can’t be around people for two days. I think “fuck yes I don’t have to hear from her” it comes towards the evening and I get a text from her. Not only does she want me to come over so we can smoke weed but she wanted me to drive her to get juul pods. I don’t juul and in our state pods aren’t legal so we would have to drive out of the fucking state for them. All in all it would have been 4 hours of driving and no fucking way I’m sharing a mouth piece with someone who has strep. I managed to say no. Even though Betty made me feel crazy for saying it . 


I then went to my friend Jessie who is Bettys best friend. Jessie mentioned how Betty felt very alone, I felt bad for her so I decided since I don’t have class on Monday I could get her and then her and Jessie could have some time together. Sunday I text Betty this.

Betty then proceeds to say Sunday would be better and that she just had the worst Valentine’s Day and all this stuff to make me feel guilty. Like the fucking doormat I am I agreed to get her that day. But on the only condition that she secures a ride back. She agrees and it seems fine. I wasn’t surprised the moment I dropped her off with Jessie, Betty stopped hitting me up. Jessie came by and we talked and had breakfast but apparently Betty was tired. I didn’t complain at all. 

Monday I come over and Betty asks me to drive her back. I said the only way I would was if she couldn’t get anyone else too and it couldn’t be that day because I made plans. She said she would try. Tuesday comes I go through the whole day not hearing a peep but right at rush hour she texts me. I ask for 10 dollars gas and that we leave ASAP because I didn’t want to hear from her for the rest of the night. I was so angry. We get in the car and it felr like an Uber ride. She wanted music control the whole way, she then wanted me to get food, when I said no she bitched and she also said she could pay me till the next day (she still hasn’t lol). I didn’t care I just wanted her gone. When she left I realized how much I hated this and how I was sick of being so obviously used. How do I break of ties with her without breaking ties with my other friends like Jessie or is it not possible?",22Feb2020,1
747,"Right so i’ve been working with this guy for around 3 months now, and we've built up quite a jocular friendship over this time. From the start it was one of those friendships where you roast each other and be playfully mean, etc... HOWEVER a few days ago we nearly got into a fistfight; granted I said some mean things (i thought we were joking around) which led to him throwing a balled up receipt at my face. In rage I shoved him back, and he swatted my hand away with force, got all in my face and then threatened to choke me. Now we’re the same age, but i’m a very small girl and he is much bigger than i am. At first i thought we were play fighting but afterwards i felt humiliated and scared, like i was going to cry, and despite my confusion of how to feel, i know that friends aren’t supposed to leave you feeling like that which is making me question if he really was my friend from the start, and if i was dumb enough to have been bullied all this time lol. He left work right after this happened btw.

It’s also worth mentioning i kind of have a crush on him which makes it worse for me because i really don’t want to like him but i can’t seem to help it \[which sounds pathetic, i KNOW\].

I’d have pegged him as a bully, it’s just he’s done a lot of things for me that convinced me he was actually a friend and that we WERE just playing around all those times, but this recent encounter has left me feeling perplexed.

Would appreciate some objective views lol...how do i reorganise my boundaries around him??? i want to maintain a working relationship with him at the very least...some advice on how to deal with him would be nice; he's quite rowdy, belligerent, immature, and abuses the fact that he's only very slightly senior to me whenever he gets the chance.",22Feb2020,1
749,"Tl;dr my father isnt in contact with us for over 15 years, my sister demands I'll pay respect when he dies and sit with the rest of the family in the funeral. I don't see the point given he was NEVER there nor did he ever cared about us. I wonder what to do..

So my folks got divorced when I was 6, I have two sisters and another half sister from my father's second wife. My father constantly cheated my mom and was always taking his anger on us, his children. 
After the divorce he was forced to see us due to a court order and after several years he thought: f this, you kids are dead to me!
Stopped all communication with all three of us without a reason. We tried to get back to communicate with him but he completely ignored every single effort each of us made.
To top that up, when I was 17, I needed his approval to get a passport to fly with my class, and he told his wife to tell me:""tell school your father is dead"".

Fast forward to nowadays, my father isn't well. In the past several years he was admitted to the hospital due to multiple heart attacks and issues with diabetes.  A few days a go one of my sisters and I hypothetically spoke about what will happen when he dies. For me it was obvious- nothing. I'm  not even sure what he looks like anymore, he never gave a s* about us so why should I care?
My sister took it hard. She started crying saying that despite him being a jerk all those years we must pay him respect because he's the one who gave us life. I reminded her that I also don't care much about him, and she said: I won't be able to talk to you if you wouldn't take part in his funeral when the day comes.

My sister is very dear and important to me and I want to respect her, but by doing this I'll disrespect my own beliefs. 

I know its soon to think about it, since he isn't dead and all, but with him, we can never know and I want to try and be as prepared as possible.. 
Just so you'll understand,  he wouldn't allow his wife telling us she was pregnant until she had the baby (our sister, yes) we might hear he's gone without even knowing what had happened before that. All his heart attacks? We heard about them months after those accrued.  
I also tried calling him once ,after I found out about his condition. He picked up casually ""hello?""
I said: "" Dad?..."" and he just hang up.  Like I was nothing. I doubt he knew which of us called him. 
So, I ask you dear redditors,  if you were in my shoes, what would you do?",22Feb2020,1
750,"Hi, this is my first reddit post and I’m not sure where to post it. I’m 18 years old, turning 19 next month, and in two weeks I will be homeless. I am a full-time college student with a full-time job, but with this coming up and other life events occurring at the same time, it is extremely unlikely that I will be able to continue my education at this point, as I will literally not have enough time to manage it all while also not having a place to stay. This is a huge bummer because I payed for my semester in full as I did not see this coming at all. I’m currently talking to counselors and resource officers to see if there is any amount of tuition refund I can receive, but that is also looking like it is unlikely. I did have a good amount of money in my savings, but, long story short, I had to surrender about $11,000 due to my insane family. Now, I have less that a thousand left. I work as a cook, so I do not think I will end up hungry because my job feeds me, which is a huge benefit at this point. I have a spacious car that I recently purchased in full, before this situation could have been foreseen. I pay for my own insurance as well but I am on someone else’s policy, which I will soon be removed from. Also, there are no friends or family that I could stay with. So, I guess my question is, where should I go from here?

Anyways he lost the bed and is going over to his friend's place tomorrow to be spit on. Could something bad happen to him? Can it actually make people barf like I've read somewhere online?

Any advice is appreciated, just want to make sure he's safe! Only two rules. 1 - don't tell me to ""break up with him"" or something, I know he's goofy but we've been together many years. 2 - please no ""this is cruel to the llama"" nonsense, I like animals as much as the next guy but I have absolutely no patience for animal rights crazies - I'm worried about my boyfriend, not the llama.

It gets later and later. Eventually it’s 3 am. He should of already been home at 7pm. We’ve had problems with this female in the beginning of our relationship. But he choose to run off with her that night. I have my mother pick me up the next day Thursday. Calling all the hospitals and jails. No answer at all. I started messaging him Emergency call me. He finally does call. I told him our son needed to go to the doctor because he did, he was suppose to go yesterday but he had to work. He hang up and says that’s not a emergency. I call furious back asking where’s my car. I message his dad saying if he doesn’t return my vehicle I will be calling the cops. I’m not stupid. He eventually talks to me and says he was hanging out with his people and got drunk. I asked if he hung out with her he says no. Then hangs up on me because he got another call. Calls me back about 30 mins later and says yeah I hung out with her all day. Hangs up again. I’m devastated. Crying and yelling. Not knowing what to do.

[The original post is here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/f76a5c/i_have_been_getting_one_of_my_friends_hooked_up/)
TLDR: My friends are looking to get a friend (John) a girlfriend for his birthday. The potential girlfriend is Kailee, who is a long time friend of my brother’s girlfriend (“GF”).

The new news is that John is totally interested in Kailee. Kailee is also interested in John—she told GF to keep her in the loop regarding any group outings we go on so that she can tag along and she can get to know John a bit better.

There will either be a group outing this evening or next weekend depending on a few contingencies, so I’ll keep everybody updated.

In the meantime, what should I keep in mind? Right now I’m thinking I’ll be very laissez-faire about the situation. I recognize that either they do hook up because they’re interested, or they don’t because they’re not, in which case forcing or even pressuring it would end very poorly.

Hopefully this works out...",22Feb2020,1
759,"Some background:
I currently work for a state agency as a seasonal worker, however my job has now turned into a year round position. While I technically have four bosses whom all report to one manager, only one of them is my direct supervisor. 

My problem being one of those four has had a vendetta out against me since day one. Constantly attacking my work ethic, my work itself, talking badly of me to their manager and my own supervisor, leaving harassing notes etc... now that it is winter I am the only seasonal worker on site and the borderline harassment has only worse to the point where I am considering quitting my job despite it being the best job I've ever had. None of the other three supervisors has ever had any issues with my work and I've even been commended on it by them in evaluations. I've brought up this issue to my direct supervisor as well as to the overall manager and nothing has seemingly been done. What do I do from here / is there anything I can do from here?",22Feb2020,1

 I don't really know if I'm an alcoholic or problem drinker or whatever, I just know I want to stop and cant stop until I black out, even if I just try to have one. I'm accepting this and have been sober for a month.  


However I'm in my mid-twenties and my whole social life involves alcohol in some way, plus I'm usually a bit of an instigator with that. Being sober will be a really big sea change and I'm committed to putting it first but I'd love for there to be a way not to lose my friends.

775,"I’ve posted really heavy handed advice requests on this Reddit, and it’s been incredibly helpful! Now, for something a little more light hearted :3. 

I hate reading. The last book I’ve ever finished to end was about a kid with a cat that gets lost. I forget the rest... This was in the 6th grade, lol. I’ve picked up books and read to half. I enjoy Bill O’Reilly’s ‘Killing’ series, because I find myself to be more of a nonfiction fan, and he portrays the history really nicely... but every time I read, I feel like I’m forcing myself to do it. I can read just fine, mind you. My comprehension is great, but my speed is, I’d say, slightly below average; which probably contributes to my distain.

Anyhow... I bought a new book because a series of events in my life have led to me to needing better, more productive hobbies... but for the love of god, I’m just staring at this hunk of a paper, dreading the thought of getting into it. And the author is very much someone who I’ve been meaning to get into for awhile. 

And yes, audio books are nice... I’ve listened to more of those than I have read, but there are obvious benefits to actually reading. 

Any advice? :)",22Feb2020,1
776,"I don’t know where to start... 
I have been very close to my cousin for all my life we know everything about one another like EVERYTHING. While growing up I did something really wrong to him. But we’ve managed to move passed it. But I’m July 2019 my cousin started to frequent this french guy and they’d go out dates very often which lead my cousin to fall in love with him...but the guy had to go back to France and wasn’t sharing the same connection level... 

Since then my cousin has been very anxious and almost depressed about the fact that’s been happening about people abandoning him...and two weeks ago on February 09 (my birthday)  my cousin organized this whole trip to Toronto and it was mind blowing we had so much fun and my cousin was very happy...

We got home, his attitude changed and wouldn’t talk to me anymore...few days later he tells me he wants to work on his mental health and in order for him to do so he has to eliminate his best friend from his life (me) because when he was thinking about everything he remembered what I did to him...and he couldn’t tolerate it. 

This is the third day we’re not talking and I haven’t been so sad. I feel guilty (which I am) and I’ve apologized numerous times. He had already made his mind about cutting me off and I respect that. But I’ve been having such strong remorse that drive into thinking about ending my life to allow him to breath and for me to stop crying and hurting. I feel like I want to inflict the pain that he went through, to myself... I just want to end my life and I’ve had many occasions where I was like “this is the time for you to do it” I’m scared that one day I will finally do the action since my mind doesn’t make it look farfetched anymore",22Feb2020,1
777,"While writing this post I'm at my lowest in terms of mental strength. Also English is not my first language so I'm sorry for any mistakes. 

So the story goes like this. Back in my school days, I used to be a topper of my class. If not always mostly. I was really good at academics with subjects that took less memorization and more like conceptual knowledge like mathematics, physics, computer programming. 

My interest in programming led me to choose computer science in college. But this is where it gets messy. Back in school, I had the guidance of many people that helped me. Here at college, there was none. I ended up chasing things on my own. On the other hand, one of my friends who always had inferior scores to mine at school had a cousin who guided him on how to target different exams and he ends p getting better opportunities than me. I'll be honest here that I do feel jealous, it is in the nature of humans nothing shameful about it. I don't even feel that much jealous from him it's more like I'm unhappy from myself for wasting my potential, what I'm really sad about is that I had greater potential to begin with but due to absence of proper guidance I ended up a loser in life where it mattered the most. 

Some people may think that I'm saying it myself that I had a lot of potentials, is me being self-centred there but I know for a fact coz we're friends from past 6 years and when you're with someone for such a long time you just know how you compare to them. I was and am definitely better than him but now that the time is gone nothing can be done.

I know what's done is done I'm now a loser. But I'm unable to cope up with the fact mentally. I keep thinking about the same every now and then. I'm afraid I might fall into depression if it goes on like this.

If anyone read this to the end I'm happy for just the fact that someone read it till here.",22Feb2020,1

779,"I have endless discussions with people about all sorts of things, most are more than friendly and I find them really interesting.
Sometimes though, (and most often with the same people) I will be accused of being controversial for the sake of being controversial.

I don't believe this is true for me and think it is down to the fact that certain people and I hold extremely different world views. As a general I get along quite well with a wide range of people and most of the disagreement comes from the idea that there are certain things that we should not discuss, or certain things that we understand and do not need to be spoken about any longer.

As an example, in one conversation I suggested that I would be more than happy to sit down and have a meal (a conversation) with a racist in order to try to understand why they think what they think - and possibly try to convince them to change their mind (although I imagine the likelihood of that is pretty slim). They disagreed and said I shouldn't because by listening to them it validates their opinion, which to a large extent I can understand, although I fundamentally disagree with it. They said the reason I believe what I believe is because 1. I am in a privileged position, and 2. I don't believe in white privilege. (which is not entirely what I believe but is closer to the truth than not I suppose). I was then accused of being controversial for the sake of it, which is fundamentally not true.

Things often get very tense, especially in this example, and I find it very difficult to talk about it but would like to try to explain to people why I think/say what I do as well as 'prove', I suppose, that I am not saying these things just to be controversial.",22Feb2020,1

782,"A few weeks ago I went for a weekend away with my girlfriend's family. I've met them various times for meals over the last few years and all has been fine. Most of the weekend went fine too, until the very end.

The aunt and uncle suggested we go for breakfast before leaving, and we agreed. When we arrived at the breakfast place, we were told there would be a 45 minute wait. The aunt agreed immediately that this would be fine. Immediately after, my girlfriend, her mother, grandmother and I agreed that we were better off heading off instead.

We told the aunt we would be leaving, and this seriously annoyed her. She started getting really angry at us, complaining about all sorts of things, and people were profusely apologising to her, trying to appease her, but she was determined to stay angry. I stayed quiet, until my girlfriend sincerely, with tears in her eyes, apologised that we changed our minds about staying for breakfast. The aunt snapped at her, telling her not to be sarcastic. I swore in disbelief at the situation and we left the group then.

Shortly after, I had a message from the uncle angry at me, as he had misheard me swearing and had thought that I had sworn directly at them (""We'll just fuck off then"" has been misheard for “Fuck off then”). I replied asking for a call to sort things out, but he had blocked me. I also messaged the aunt to apologise for what it sounded like and to clarify what I had said, and have not had any reply.

This happened several weeks ago and I still have not been unblocked by the uncle. He has also blocked my girlfriend’s mother and she doesn’t know why. I’ve come to understand that this sort of thing has happened before several times, and it seems outrageous to me that minor things like this can explode so much. I’ve lost interest in trying to maintain any relationship with that side of the family, who have been volatile now and surely will be in the future, and would rather cultivate the relationship with those in my girlfriend’s family who I feel can act sensibly.

He has been going to school high on weed almost every day since December of 2018, even though I, and my other friends repeatedly beg him not to and explain that he should not. He also abused alcohol of course, which makes him extremely aggressive and nightclubs, where he just looks for either girls to hook up with or fights.

In college years I got a partner but also got fat, depressed, had greasy hair, didn't care about anything nor wanted to exist, I wasn't happy with who I was. Later I realized that he was the main influence for my depressive and passive behavior.

  
Now I have an inspirational partner, I have really changed, he motivates and supports me a lot and I love him really much. After being with him for around a year I realized I like myself and can improve here. I've started losing weight recently, almost 10 lbs down and decided to change my clothing style completely, as it was hoodies, skimpy clothes, worn off jeans and sneakers.

  
The main problem about that is since I have always been against make up and stylish girls because that always made me think they are shallow carcasses and besides the appearance, there is nothing inside (as portrayed in movies and other media) and the inside matters the most. I'm aware that it's not always the case and I admit that I started taking inspiration from them as that kind of girls are well groomed.   
Going through Pinterest or other networks for the ideas makes me feel terrible, very hostile towards the girls as I perceive them as ""basic bitches"" because I don't want to be perceived or become them.

My mom then started using that money to go on vacations with my sister (i forgot to mention: we have different dads and my dad and this sister didn't get along up until my dad died).. as I was saying.. she has gone on several vacations with my sister - Florida, New Orleans, Hawaii, etc.. well.. I was supposed to go with my mom on a cruise in May.

She has two she's already scheduled with my sister.. 

But right before we booked our tickets she decided she didn't want to go with me.

So, she's been on 3 or 4 vacations with my sister.. planning at LEAST 2 more that she's already paid for.. and won't go on mine.

What do I do?",22Feb2020,1

806,"Hi, I just moved far away from home and adapting to my new high school is being really hard. I know that it's gonna take a long time to make actually meaningful friendships but I've been here for 7 months and nobody even wants to talk with me. I always try to get along with people regardless of our differences and even if it goes well at first they keep disappearing. The girl who was assigned to sit next to me didn't even last two weeks and changed her seat. She also now laughs at anything I do and secretly takes pictures of me in the hallway. Another example is the new girl who just came this month, I helped her with everything, I was nice, I explained everything she needed to know, I asked teachers her questions for her because she was too shy and somehow she didn't even last a week sitting next to me and just had to go to another seat. Then I finally thought I got it, I met a girl who wasn't even in my class and we were meeting in the same spot for recess every day and then she just disappeared. I saw her the other day and called out for her and she looked at me but didn't even answer. What the hell is wrong with me? I don't get it, I don't need anyone to be with me 24/7 or anything but is it really that hard to breathe the same air as me?

Not because I used too much salt, but just for using salt at all because salt is apparently the devil or something idk. Things like this happen all the time with every little part of cooking, again stuff that doesn't make sense like don't use oil, do this this way etc. 

This happens whenever he's around and I try my very best to kick him out while being respectful but then he just starts yelling more and I just leave him to do whatever he's doing.

810,"I would like to begin that I have always been a tomboy girl, never cared about fashion nor make up basically a man in a woman's body, have been working on my inside since I was 14, been always keep on being as educated about everything as I can, improve on my behavior, basically a typical nerd.

In college years I got a boyfriend but also got fat, depressed, had greasy hair, didn't care about anything nor wanted to exist, I wasn't happy with who I was. Later I realized that he was the main influence for my depressive and passive behavior.

Now I have an inspirational partner, I have really changed, he motivates and supports me a lot and I love him really much. After being with him for around a year I realized I like myself and can improve here. I've started losing weight recently, almost 10 lbs down and decided to change my clothing style completely, as it was hoodies, skimpy clothes, worn off jeans and sneakers.

The main problem about that is since I have always been against make up and stylish girls because that always made me think they are shallow carcasses and besides the appearance, there is nothing inside (as portrayed in movies and other media) and the inside matters the most. I'm aware that it's not always the case and I admit that I started taking inspiration from them as that kind of girls are well groomed.  
Going through Pinterest or other networks for the ideas makes me feel terrible, very hostile towards the girls for no reason as I perceive them as ""basic"" because I don't want to be perceived or become them. How can I stop this stupid feeling and let myself relax more and feel better by dressing up?

812,"I am 14 and a girl so.......




Background info; 
Imma start with my oh so great trauma. Imma be brief though; My family of five was poor (mom, dad, brother, sister, me). We lived behind my aunt's renovated garage and my mom was only home for 6 hours a day. We barely saw her so my siblings took care of me. 
I suspect that my father may have molested me when I was 3. I show really clear signs of child molestation and knowing him, it isn't far off. When I was 4, he moved to my grandmas house without a goodbye or explanation. He just left. I remember writing suicide notes and my mom and sister found one. It was forgotten the next day. When I was 5, my sister attempted suicide by cutting herself. I remember seeing my mom screaming at her and then dragging her to the car. I remember hiding under the blankets while hearing her crying. When I was 6, my brother left to the military. I had a lot in common with him as he mainly raised me. I share a lot of mental problems with him. When I was 7, we moved to NE for 6 months. I had only one friend who wasnt even a friend. I moved back to LA before 5th grade and found my dad in prison. Apparently, he raped my sister, thus causing her to be suicidal. What made it worse (or maybe easier for her?) was that he was a stranger to her who lived under her house. We all have different dads and he was mine. I still feel guilty and terrible even tho I had no part in it. We moved back to NE after a year and then I just fell into depression. I had no friends at school at her and started cutting.




Despite everything, my mom believes that if you aren't happy and cheery every time, you are mentally ill. No exceptions. So my brother kept everything bottled up and grew anger issues. My sister started hurting herself cause she couldn't show it and kept rejecting therapy. I did the same as both (anger issues and cut myself (its been a year since I did it though so yay!)). My siblings moved away back to LA. They aren't any happier though because of finances.





Actual issue; A few days ago, I kept coming home in a bad mood. Usually this time of month, I just get so depressed for no reason. Things are going great (esp. In my love life) but still, just feel shitty for no reason. I caught myself before falling deep though like prior years but nonetheless. Friday though, my mom kept telling me to change. She kept saying, "" why cant you be like those girls and have a lot of friends?""





I cant make friends easily because i have so much trauma. I always push people away without even realizing + I am kind of happy the way I am. I do this thing on Instagram where I make groupchats for people to vent (Pm if you are interested) when they don't have places to go to. A lot of people come in and I have like 90 gcs by now. So I do have a place for support. Stuff my mom says though put a lot of stress on me and soon she keeps trying to play and joke around. I snap though since she always put me in such shitty and insecure moods when she says stuff like that. I mean she wants a better normal daughter and I just cant provide that which sucks. 





Today I woke up with really bad neck pain. She keeps trying to help but keeps dismissing me everytime I object to her suggestions. We eventually started yelling at each other. She even tried to spank me (wtf?). I didnt try to speak normal though at first. It's always pointless with her. I used to speak naturally and then she would be the one to escalate and say that I am screaming at her when she would be the one doing so. Instead, I just skipped that part. It's pointless now. The pain kept getting worse and I tried to leave and cool off, she didn't let me. So I had to endure her and no surprise, my neck pain stayed the same. She tried to call my sister but she didnt pick up. Eventually she yelled at me that she was going to take me to therapy. I yelled and said that she should since she is always the one starting things. She kept saying that I am the problem and that I have a terrible attitude. I told her that it is because of her and she started crying. I don't feel awful though or happy. It was neutral. I am just sick of bottling everything up just so she doesn't make a big deal out of things. She is known for being overdramatic so even though it should be a big deal, she'll def make me regret ever telling her anything. She literally says ""oh so you want me dead?!"" Whenever I suggest doing things myself.






So my question really is; Am I in the right or is this just stupid angsty teenager stuff? I am sorry if my story is messy. I am not good with telling stories. To be honest, i think this is her first time actually parenting. Last times, she has always been working morning to night, over and over again. She was barely around in my brother or sisters life. This might be the first time she is actually present.",22Feb2020,1
813,"I am non binary queer, but because of my sex most people refer to me as lesbian.  I have this Friend  who has outed me about my gender and sexual orientation. 

The first time was a while ago, and we were having a conversation with the Friend  who outs me, a Friend who I have told, and a friend who does not know, and I was outed to her. I didn’t speak up about it and I honestly wish I did. 

The second time however, i did react. It was about my sexual orientation which I am a bit more open about. There is a post in my history on r/AmITheAsshole it’s really long if you wanna know the whole story, but if you don’t the story pretty much goes like this:

She outs me, I say f*** you in a group chat, she calls me a bitch, the next day she texts me again about how we can’t be friends anymore, we call each other and she calls me a bitch again, a week later we meet up to do an assignment and she apologizes, I forgive her. 

The third time, is what I’m gonna talk about. We were sitting at a table with a couple other people that I’ve known for a long time. One of them asks about gender and I start explaining to him the concept of gender and answering some questions he has. Then, another Friend who was previously mentioned when I was outed the first time asks how someone can be non binary and also identify as lesbian, referring to me. I look at the Friend who outs me, trying to get her to look at me so I can signal for her not to say anything. Then she says “oh come on op, these people have known you for years. They already know” (they had no idea) I tried to brush over the comment the best I could.

816,"I've been going through a rough time in my life. I moved states, making us long distance, and hate it here. I've been unable to make friends and my physical and mental health have been getting worse. 

On February 1st I was having a break down to a then trusted friend, I knew my boyfriend was out having fun at a party with friends and really didn't want to prevent any fun he might be having cause knowing he is happy makes me happy. Well this friend sent screenshots of my lowest point to my bf which lead to us having a conversation about how he can best help me. He told me he felt helpless when trying to help me sometimes but still wants me to use him as more of a resource. We agreed on a sort of symbol I could do to show him he is helping. We never really got the opportunity to use that. After that incident I tried to start therapy and see about getting meds but had quite a few issues and set backs in the system that lead to me breaking down to him. During this breakdown he said ""be right back"", hung up the phone and called back 1.5 hours. It was for a very justifiable reason but I got unnecessarily upset with him over it and we had a small fight. 

I finally started meds last Thursday however we had a small fight that night and a larger one on Sunday morning. Sunday night he asked for us to take a break and I agreed. His reasoning was my mental health was getting to be a bit much for him and he wanted to do this to preserve the longevity of the relationship and he ""in no way wants to cut ties."" We discussed problems for a little bit and are trying to still act as friends. We also agreed to talk tonight about what I am going to do about the plane tickets I have to go see him in a little more than 3 weeks. 

Since we agreed to take a break I think I had a bit of a break through and feel like I have been coping with this better than I could have been before. I saw a different therapist in an emergency clinic who really re-contextualized how I had been approaching problems in the past. I also have decided to increase going to therapy to twice a week and see about changing to this other therapist that I saw. I have also learned how to use the crisis support line provided by my college and think that will be a helpful tool in the future. And finally discovered the meds I had started on just before we went on a break had a side effect of increased anxeity and sometimes increased anger issues. I have stopped taking these meds and have been put on some more imedately as needed ones which have helped me so incredibly much so far.

So know I don't know how to handle this conversation. I want to tell him about the progress I made and ask for him to give me a second chance. But I also really want to respect his space and boundaries. 

I am also hesitant to tell him the effect the original meds had on me because I want to take responsibility for my poor actions over the past couple months and not make any excuses.

And my last problem right now is it grasp in reality has returned enough that I can see how terrible of a person I was and how I hurt him.

822,"Two months ago my doctor prescribed tramadol to me (75 mg) to take once a day. He was the one bringing pain medication up, as I had never even thought of that possibility. I suffer from a connective tissue disorder and have both chronic (joint) pain and acute pain (from joint subluxations (multiple times a day) and dislocations).

The tramadol worked like a dream. I tried some over the counter stuff before like paracetamol and ibuprofen, naproxen but it never helped the joint aches so I never took it more than once in a blue moon. The tramadol I  took it on and off. 

Until about 3 weeks ago when I started taken it daily like my doctor actually intended for me (I am terrible with forgetting to take medication). Soon I noticed how *bad* the pain was when I didn't take them. Usually around 12 hours after my last dose (they work for 8 hours) I would start being in pain.

It took me a few days but last week I realised that I might have become physically dependent. Now I am on a low dosage, and I had only been using them daily for 2 weeks, but I am afraid this is true. 

From here on there are two options in my eyes

1. I can lower my dosage to 37.5 mg and take it twice a day, this way I can avoid the withdrawal period entirely. My doctor only gives me 30 pills every 15 days (of 37.5 mg) so taking my 75 mg dosage twice a day is impossible. But I dont like being dependent on something, I also dont know of that low dosage will work as well. 
2. I go through withdrawal and stop taking them entirely. This also means I wont be able to use any pain medication for my disorder as I wont be able go have another appointment with my doctor for at least the next 4 months (waiting lists) and other pills don't work. 

Option 1 is what my mom prefers, but the idea of being dependent on a drug is just so wrong in my eyes.

Option 3 would be going through withdrawal and then taking the 37.5 dosage, since my tolerance for the higher dosage should be gone. 

Any advice on what I should choose? 

Honestly it's really hard as the withdrawal is not just that but also my own normal pain which is really really hard to tell apart. The only difference is, is that I have slight fever to go along with the pain which tells me it isnt just my disorder. 

My disorder has worsened dramatically (not just in my pain experience but also as in that I went from never having subluxations to subluxating my shoulder 6 times a day on average withing the last month). So going without any pain meds is really hard. Also, part of revalidation is the whole ""it gets more painful before it gets better"". Sigh.",22Feb2020,1

My dad is a 56 year old man who has gone through a measure of hardship throughout his life. He is a recovered alcoholic, had a stroke due to obesity, and has been deeply depressed for a number of years now. As a result, he has become very emotionally detached and bitter in recent years. Through it all, my mother, who is a saint, has stuck by his side.

My brother and sister are 29 and 31 years old respectively. My sister and I live in the same town as my parents. My brother who is likely very disillusioned from family ordeals now lives in Colorado with his girlfriend and stays relatively ignorant about what is going on within the the family. My sister however, is my greatest confidant and acts as something of a second mother for both me and my dad. 

At the risk of being too needlessly wordy, I found myself using my dad’s phone for work today and noticed that he had Grindr installed on his phone. I opened it to discover that he was carrying on conversations with a number of men. In addition, his Google homepage has what appears to be a gay porn site bookmarked. 

This obviously hit me like a ton of bricks and I have no idea how to approach the situation. Approaching my family could lead to consequences that I might not be able to fully comprehend.

838,"TL;DR! Should I get a Class-A CDL or should I get a smaller job if my goal is to get to Washington and build a small business and a mentorship program?

Ok. Here are the bullet points:

* My big-picture idea is building a very creative mentorship program. I’m VERY excited about it. 

* I plan to start a small, mobile, summer business (to start learning business &amp; so I can have flexibility in the summer to invest time into the mentorship program). If I can grow this large enough then I won’t have to work in the off-season. 

* I need to join this community in Washington (state) in order to start this program, so the sooner I get there the sooner I can start doing what ACTUALLY matters to me. 

* I need to get a bit of training in a field so I can have a job that doesn’t exactly matter, but pays enough for me to take the next step (which is the mobile business, which should make room for the mentorship program).

* I just came across an opportunity to earn a Class-A CDL, but that’ll keep me out of Washington until probably August vs May or June (because the training is $5,000 that I’ll have to pay back over time).

* I could instead just get a smaller job and maintain my autonomy and freedom to leave whenever I’m ready. 

* Whatever lower or mid-level training I attain, I’m not certain which will be more conducive for the life I want to live and businesses I need to grow. The job I choose will be what I do until I can switch over to this mobile business. 

* Consistency in community is a priority. I need to be able to steadily invest and be a presence in the lives of those involved. 

* My emotional health is also a big factor. I currently don’t have relationships with anyone where I am (outside of a few family members), so if I choose to stay where I am it’ll just be for money. I’m not sure how long I can maintain this kind of lifestyle.

843,"I'm currently in a shared house, with a group of chilled people, but the real problem is their friends. They come home drunk and bang on everyone's bedroom doors (even on weeknights), they steal my food from my fridge, they always try to borrow my things without asking, and they are generally just a noisy group that have no chill. Although it's annoying, it's tolerable as it is.

However, the real problem is going to be next year, when I move into a house with this rowdy group. (I know I chose to be in this house, but there were problems with grouping, and the house was signed for before all of this started). This house has no locks on bedroom doors, and overall just more facilities are shared. I'm getting increasingly anxious about people coming in my room when I want some privacy, going through my stuff, being woken up when I really just need to sleep, the list goes on.

I'm really not sure how to approach this situation. I'm friendly with them on most occasions, and I've sent the worst offender a message to tell him how I feel, which he didn't reply to, and I have seen no improvement. I'm starting to consider just distancing myself from this group in general, and just not talking to any of them except about house stuff.

What should I do?",22Feb2020,1
844,"Our house is set up pretty weird, and currently I sleep by the front door. I have no bedroom door, just an empty doorway into the living room. The cat will sit by the front door all night and *wail.* She's not in heat, she just wants to go outside. I've been letting her out whenever she does this, but my stepdad told me to stop doing that because it's too cold. 

She kept me awake until five this morning. Every time I started to doze off she would jump up on my bed, get in my face, and yowl as loud as possible. I tried giving her food in another room. I tried repeatedly putting her over the gate in the doorway very politely, hoping she'd get the message. I spanked her at one point hours later when I got frustrated. Eventually I stopped reacting at all and pulled my blanket over my head. This got her to leave me alone for a few minutes at a time; she went away and came back over and over, clawing at my blanket, sitting on top of me, wailing. 

She can't stay in my sister's room because she keeps her door open at night. (I don't know why she doesn't act like this to my sister, but that's beside the point.) I've asked my stepdad several times to do something about it, like maybe put her in a room at night with the litter box and food and water, but he doesn't care and won't let me try anything. He keeps his door closed and she doesn't bother him. I have severe sleeping disorders I'm trying to fix. He knows this, but he doesn't give a shit. 

I'm moving out in the next few months, but until then, what can I do to make her leave me alone? Will ignoring her no matter what she does eventually make her give up? I don't want to spank her again; I feel bad about it, especially since she's not my cat, and it didn't do anything anyway. Is there a gentler deterrent I could try?",22Feb2020,1
845,"Just to be clear, I'm not the one who drinks or has the problem. (I personally hate drinking, it makes me feel like ASS)

SO anyways, I have a house mate, 69 yr old female, who is VERY addicted to drinking. It's not where shell shake if she goes two hours without it, but to me, its just as bad as what she really does.

She is known as an ""energy vampire"" if you will, she uses her emotions to manipulate, esp when it comes to bars or beer. I could write a book on everything, but I'll give you some detailzzz about what happened recently.

Shes the type of alcoholic to lie constantly. all the time, when it comes to her drinking problems. She claims with FULL belief she only drinks twice a month. She says this at least every 2-4 weeks. she also says ""I dont even feel like drinking"" when no one said anything about it for days. she will randomly say this at the most confusing times. I have on my phone the messages of her messaging me when shes at the bar every time. &amp; she goes about 2-3 times every week. She also drinks more than she should, at minimum she drinks 4 beers... okay? MINIMUM. shes 69 years old, has diabetes, fibromyalgia, high blood pressure, depression, etc. she takes more pills than I can count on my hands if that makes sense.

So what happened recently, is that she drank too much, again, but she smoked a bowl of weed like she does everytime when she gets back from the bar. (btw, she has weed in her possession every day, &amp; she will have me &amp; my boo to take her to get more weed at the dispensary before she even runs out. She has her own pipe, she does it all, even Bong bowls)
Exp this time it wasnt normal have a beer smoke some weed &amp; watch trailer park boys.. no.. this was different.

She got sick. super sick, like she kept throwing up over &amp; over &amp; over, to the point where I kept asking ""do I call someone"" &amp; everything said that it was fine whatever, so I just kinda.. stood there, with a face that says ""my GOD"". (she didnt have to go to the hospital, shes still okay &amp; not sick or dying or anything thank god). but here's the kicker, she was throwing up so much, EVERY single person in the world who knows her, KNOWS it's because of purely alcohol. Me &amp; my boo have dealt with this so much, that his reaction was ""why do you think you're sick"" &amp; kept asking her because we NEEDED her to admit that she drank too much. She uttered out barely ""beeerrr"". Okay, good for you. you can kinda admit it. But if she was feeling sickish for a while before she threw up, why did she purposely stay in my room so she could push onto me that I have to take care of her? Her room is like a few feet from my room. &amp; she seriously sat in the chair, knowing shes gonna throw up within the next 10 minutes, &amp; she purposely sat there. &amp; then when she was about to throw up, she yelled at me to grab her something. Me rushing around because she wanted to stay here to throw up in my fucking room, she didnt even bother to go to the bathroom when she was questioning it. She seriously knew she was gonna hurl soon, &amp; made me panic &amp; rush around to make sure my stuff doesnt get poison all over it. 

Then, instead of going to bed when she was done throwing up, she decided, that she was gonna pass out on my couch &amp; not tell me. I had to run upstairs &amp; tell my boyfriends parents ""shes fucking puking in my room &amp; she wont leave, she knew she was gonna get sick &amp; stayed there for me to take care of it!"" Let's just say, momma bear mode kicked in. My boyfriends mom, has dealt with her drinking for more years than my own age. She rushed downstairs &amp; told her that if she feels like shes gonna get sick, to leave the room &amp; not force more than one person to hear your constant hurling &amp; crying over &amp; over again, &amp; then lays down on the couch without me saying ""yes that's fine"". She took total advantage of us, &amp; our space. I gave her my best fucking trash can &amp; told her ""can you take care of that can because I'm NOT touching it"" &amp; she goes ""yeah WHATEVER I DONT care"".... um yeah that kinda hurt dont ya think?

After being forced out of my room, she starts kicking the can of throw up across my floor. like she full was kicking it to her room. I wanted to cry. 

The next day she said that it was 100% the weed... ya know... the weed she smokes almost every day.. that weed. ""oh that smoke was too much last night dont ya think?! hahahah!!"" okay.. I dont think this is very funny. but go off.

after that it was still. very still. for a week. &amp; then yesterday happened.

She said ""you know, I'm thirsty, I think I need a beer. just one tho! &amp; no smoking this time!!"". well me &amp; my boo said that we just had to go to work that night so we couldn't do it. she said ""oh not tonight, I'm talking like now"" ""oh well I'll see how G (my boyfriend) feels about it &amp; we will let you know"" whatever whatever. about a minute later she goes ""you know, I think when I come back from iowa, I'm gonna go to the bar &amp; have their chili."" (oh yeah I forgot to mention. she always tells everyone shes only goes to the bar to eat their food. as quoted above, &amp; that is not the first time I've heard that)

When we told her no were not comfortable with taking you to the bar, she said ""okay no problem"" &amp; dead ass went to my boyfriends dad &amp;, I'm not kidding, told on us. ""G said he wont take me to the barrrrrrrr"". Yeah, daddio didnt even give her the time of day. ""oh"" is what was said (lol I love him)

She uses her emotions to manipulate us. After she said she wanted to go to Elbert, not the bar, but the town (she thinks shes slick), &amp; I was VERY visibly uncomfortable, she decided to actually bribe me. she said ""I wanna go to Elbert soon, do you think you could take care of my cat when I'm in iowa if I give you 50 dollars?"" first off, those two topics dont relate to each other. 

She has given us money to take her to the bar before, &amp; will call us &amp; tell us shes bored &amp; wants to go to a different town &amp; drink, &amp; then I'll have to go pick her up too. So, the town is 10 minutes away from my house, we drive 10 minutes there &amp; go back home. 20 minutes now. Shell message us an hour later, saying shes bored. so now we have to go get her because she gave us money &amp; that's her way of trapping. We drive 10 minutes &amp; then drive 30 minutes to go to the next town for her. It has been an hour in the car at this point. But then after we drop her off, we have to go back home which takes 20 minutes, &amp; then have to go BACK &amp; get her, another 20 minutes there &amp; back. At this point, we have driven I think 2-3 hours in the car, driving her to multiple towns because she gave us money, &amp; WE would be the shitty ones to say no after she gave us 30 bucks. okay, well now that 30 dollars in gas we put in, is literally ALL gone because we had to keep driving her, otherwise, it's ""not fair"" to her right? that we took her money &amp; ""didnt do our part"" sorta thing.

She will make sure I am alone, &amp; tell me with seriousness in her eyes that she wants to go the bar, ""to have their home made egg rolls"" of course. She does this, because since I have not known her for as long as everyone else, who am I to get pissed off &amp; yell at someone when it's not my house? I feel trapped, treated VERY unfairly, &amp; I have been so angry the past few days. I feel so unhappy, I lay awake at night for hours not being able to laugh at anything. Anything that shouldn't be a big deal, I become furious. I'm SO tired of feeling this tension, &amp; the anticipation that I know shes gonna ask me to take her again in a few days, if not today. I feel so shitty, &amp; I cant deal with her anymore.",22Feb2020,1

854,"My medical Condition that requires the most attention: Type 2 Diabetes. 


Current Job: Car sales. Long hours (10-12 hour days). Can be chill at times but is also pretty intense. I desperately want to get out of this particular store because the long hours. This particular job has affected my overall health, I've gained weight, become more stressed, less sleep, I'm back in therapy, I have no time for a social life, etc. However, the medical benefits are pretty nice. I recently went to the doctor, had no copay and didn't have to pay anything for my prescription. 



Job Lined Up: Another car sales position at another dealership. Here are the perks: It's only a 10-15 minute commute to get to work. It is right across the street from my gym and grocery store. I can go home for lunch and let my dog out. The management and store overall are much more relaxed and flexible. During my interview, I emphasized how important quality of life is to me. And lastly, they have the same health insurance benefits or at least very similar benefits. 

Dilemma: I am only covered with my medical insurance up to the last month of the day I decide to quit. For example, if I decide to quit March 1st, I am covered up until the end of the month. There is a 90 day waiting period for me to able to enroll with health insurance with my new job. 



Essentially I will be without health insurance for about 3 months, or maybe 2 months if I wait until March 1st, to at least have the month of March covered. I do have a refill of my medication coming in next week of 3 months worth, so I should be okay in terms of my medication. 



TLDR: My current job is costing me my health, but also providing me health insurance. I have a new job lined up that will provide me health insurance after 90 days of employment. I have 3 months worth of medication to hold me down. I desperately want to leave this job.

856,"Hi guys. I’m writing this for a person I met who was having troubles with someone or a group of people breaking into her apartment. 

Backstory: I got this random call and I ignored it because I thought it was spam. I checked my voicemail and it was this old woman who called me by accident asking if I was a private investigator. I called her back and told her that I was only a student, But asked what the problem was.

She said that someone or small group of people (Who she has an idea who it is but is waiting to catch them) Is somehow getting into her garage door and picking the lock into her apartment, stealing her things such as bookshelves, plates furniture,tables and chairs ,TV, and replacing it with similar models or almost even identical replicas. She said they also sometimes come in the middle of the night and steal stuff from her wallet which is in her bedroom(wtf!) but she has slept through it. ** she thinks they come into her apartment every time she leaves for a few hours. She leaves maybe once a week. 

^.^ She told me this when we met in person (I felt safe meeting up with her). She explained in detail how the items placed were different than her original items. I was dumbfounded. The amount of work that had to go into this to replace everything. I was a little skeptical but mostly believed her because she seemed sane of mind. 

After talking with her on the phone The first time, she ended up hiring a private investigator.

When I went to her house I brought over some mini spy security cameras that fit in the palm of your hand. I had to choose those because she does not have Wi-Fi, But those proved to be a little difficult for her to work (for me too because the instructions are a little wack)

———————-
What I am asking you guys for  is any recommendations of how to go about this. She lives alone and her nearest family members like 2 1/2 hours away. 

She can’t get any usual security cameras because she has no Wi-Fi, and the landlord won’t install a regular security camera in her garage.

859,"When my father passed away I was devastated, he died at age of 51 and a day before his 52nd birthday. I was so mad and angry. It happened in September and in that period I worked (student summer job) and even tho I knew he was sick I barely spent any time with him at home because I worked every day.

Due to a disease he lost a lot of weight and he barely had any appetite and we were worried that things could go wrong. He had specific diet to follow which is a lot of protein in food but he didn't want to eat the same food every day even tho he knew he had to so we decide to find what he likes the most and then combine it with food he must eat. Few months into therapy results were promising. Medical files were saying that it is getting better and doctor said that results are improving. We talked with him that we wont give up and that there is always hope which we wont lose. 

Around early august things started going south. He started to lose energy constantly and he barely could walk by himself. He could barely speak and even if he tried he would have felt tired and exhausted like he ran a marathon.

On the they he died I was sleeping and one of my brothers called me and said: come here dad is not breathing and I didn't know what to do. I got off my bed and when I came next to his bed I started shaking him and calling him even tho I knew what actually happened. We called an ambulance and the lady on the phone explained us how to do CPR and talked with us until doctors arrived. Doctors said that our father is dead.

I cried entire day and I couldn't accept that he is gone. I was laying down in my bad and I didn't want to talk to anyone. Naturally I am shy and I can't open myself to everyone. From that day I haven't talked to anyone about it even tho I feel terrible and I don't have that in me to share my feeling with anyone about my loss. Few of my friends suggested to try professional help but I really can't because in my mind I think it will make it even worse. My mood drops every time someone mention my father or anything related to him. 

Not all my friends even know what happened because I try to keep it secret and it would be awkward of me if I come now and just say: hey guys my father died 5 months ago, I don't feel myself right now and sorry for not spending much time with you.

I really don't know how can I continue my life normally, I am barely talking to anyone and if someone tries to talk with me I always make it short as possible for no reason.

He would have her speak to his “personalities”. Flash forward to October she confronted him about it because she felt he was lying, he admitted it and seemed pretty chill, as she screamed about it.

861,"On a throwaway because she uses Reddit too. Anyway, lately I (24,F) have been noticing that my best friend (24, F) of more than ten years has been doing a lot that's been increasingly getting on my nerves lately. Let's call her Trish.

&amp;#x200B;

For some background, Trish is a bit socially inept and awkward. She doesn't have many friends and she has never had a boyfriend, whereas I tend to bounce from friend group to friend group and talk to pretty much anybody. We've been best friends since around middle school and most of her ""street knowledge"" (for lack of a better word) has come from experiences hanging out with me. For as long as I can remember, we've been each other's best friend, having a lot in common and doing practically everything together, telling each other everything, all the typical 'best friend' stuff. 

&amp;#x200B;

Things began to change immensely when we were in university. Trish had family problems going on and I had personal problems going on. I did become a bit distant and stopped talking to her as much as I had in the past, but we still kept contact really often. She became a bit different and more cynical because of her family problems, but nonetheless went on to finish a certificate and now works as a receptionist at a school. She's worked here for two years now.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to now, and I've been noticing a lot lately. 

&amp;#x200B;

For one, she's began to copy my mannerisms and speech patterns. I know this because when talking, I'll say something, usually slang (for sake of an example, 'that's dope!' whereas she has never said that phrase before in her life, she will immediately begin saying it after I've said it.) That is a bit aggravating, but that's not just it.

&amp;#x200B;

Second of all, whatever I tell Trish seems to go through one ear and out the other. I find this tends to happen **especially** with life-advice, which *she* approaches *me* about. 

A good example is that she is about to be laid off in a couple of months, and when she first found out, I told her to try and calm down and maybe consider looking for another job. After all, if there is a possibility that she is going to be laid off, than any consideration of her current job being a life-long career is pretty much going to be out the window. I have told her this time and time again, particularly when she mentions it's getting worse and she's always just brushed it off or responded with some variant of a 'maybe'. Now, several months later, her coworker talks about finding another job and jumping ship, and Trish comes to me as if her coworker's word is gospel. She acts as if it's newfound knowledge and she has *'found the way'* and tells me that her coworker is very much so right and she should find another job.

&amp;#x200B;

This also happens with smaller other things, Trish is extremely into makeup and I've told her about the brand Morphe because it's cheap. Her and I went there for Black Friday and she seemed as if she couldn't be less interested, simply mumbling stuff like a fake 'oh that's cool!' But when she goes shopping several months later with a friend of her's, she sends me mountains of pictures from Morphe, raving about how cheap and how great the stuff is as if she's found the holy grail.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm not sure if I'm being petty, but it just seems like she doesn't care for what I have to say or doesn't listen. Is there anything I should do?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Everything I say or show to my 'best friend' goes through one ear and out the other, but she'll come to me later on after **someone else** has told her the exact same thing as I did and talk about how great it is. It is extremely annoying.",22Feb2020,1
863,"I am a student currently enrolled in high school, senior year, and recently got around to working in a small indie team online. I do around 7 hours daily as a programmer from home, meaning I get to define my schedule. We just got an update released and it gave me the time to think about what this meant for my personal projects.

My daily routine has been stripped to eating and going back to work, getting a couple of hours by the end of the day to cool down. This means I haven't gotten any progress done on my own stuff, and I am conflicted whether I should take more free time so I get to work on those more (petty problem, I know).

To make this choice easier on myself I wrote down a list with the reasons defending each side of the argument, but I am still having trouble deciding. Here's the list:

&amp;#x200B;

\[WHY I SHOULD TAKE TIME OFF\]

1. As of right now I am not getting any money from them (and I know what you may be thinking, but this person is a trusted source of mine. The stakes of them bailing out on the money are higher on them than on the rest of the team), this means that taking time off would allow me to find other sources of income until I get paid.

2. Once I graduate in a year I'll lose my freedom completely. I should take advantage of the time I have now to work on my projects.

3. I am trying to boost my own popularity as a developer, but it's hard to do so when you can't post content on the stuff you're currently working on.

4. I owe some work to some other people that I haven't been able to get to.

&amp;#x200B;

\[WHY I SHOULDN'T TAKE TIME OFF\]

1. This month has been chaotic, meaning I ended up missing an entire week due of work since I had to help family out (which included a lot of travelling). Still, I should be striving to make up for those lost hours by working extra.

2. I have to treat this as job experience. In the real world working more than 7 hours a day with no personal time is the norm. I should be glad that I get to define my schedule and am able to leave at any moment to assist my family.

3. Despite the project having no set deadline it would be ideal to get the demo released soon.

&amp;#x200B;

I am on my last week of winter break. After this the amount of time I'll get to work on stuff will be halved.

Any advice?",22Feb2020,1
864,"I'm an 18 year old girl in my first year of university, and I've never really cared that much about my appearance.

870,"[23 M, recent college grad] 

Most of the people I have in my sporadic friend group rn just aren't very congruent with my lifestyle.  They fall into various categories that make it hard for me to get close to them; (1) home bodies who only want to hang out once every few weeks, (2) people who don't share many interests with me and if anything find my passions kinda weird/obsessive, (3) people who are social for social sake and care more about image and gossip than having a good time, (4) people who I'm super compatible with but have way different schedules/priorities than me.  I enjoy the time I spend with all them, but outside of my longest term friend, it's **incredibly rare that any of them will reach out and ask me to hangout**, and I'm started to get the vibe that they are all annoyed by my fairly regular group texts trying to get people to hang out.  Hell 4 of my best friends have just straight up left me on read this week.

I don't have a terribly large amount of time for a social life, as in addition to work I have to study for a professional certification that will help me get my career job (and 1.5x or more my income). I also need to lose weight, and can't afford to get involved in a friend group that likes to eat out all the time.  I also have a struggling little brother I'm making it a priority to spend time with.  However, I'd love it if my Friday nights &amp; Saturday afternoon/evenings could be consistently used in a social setting.    And it'd be cool to find a gym buddy.  

The first time I tried to solve this by moving out of my parents house closer to my work (about a 25-30 commute difference), thinking I'd have more time and energy.  This helped some but the roommate situation has crumbled and I'm going to move home again. I don't see myself moving out anytime soon, as my parents have a worsening financial situation and I want to help them out.  

My main interests are; live music, board games, frisbee, events, fun activities (arcade bar, bowling, mini golf, etc).  I'd love to travel more but it's really expensive to do alone. I despise just going to bar and sitting around and doing nothing but drink (I feel some sort of activity is necessary).  I'd love to find a consistent group of concert and board game buddies, but I just don't know where to look. I'd love to have someone to go to Bonnaroo with (hell I'd even split the cost of their ticket).  

I will admit there's a couple coworkers I have who I get along super well with who share my passion for live music and board games, but I'm completely clueless about how to turn them into friendships without risking making the professional relationship awkward if they don't want to socialize outside of work.  **Advice for this?**

I'm tired of just sitting around and pitying myself (about this, about my weight, about my family's financial troubles, about my shit entry level job where I'm making like 20k less than I expected to when I graduated, etc...). I want to take action.  However I'm finding it hard to make a plan about something so abstract that has always challenged me like social skills.  Losing weight is easy enough (CICO, exercise... So is advancing my career (get the big certification and spam my resume around). Making friends is far less algorithmic.  What can I do to improve my social life?",22Feb2020,1

872,"I’ve never written a post like this and my memory of things are a bit fuzzy, so please bear with me on this. Posting this on an alt also since I don’t want to bog down my main with this.

I (15 years old, approaching 16 this year) live comfortably, in a house, with food to eat. There’s nothing wrong that like, affects how my needs are met, but I’m not happy. I think it’s because lately my relationship with me and the rest of my family have been coming apart, or rather, the relationship between my mom and I has been coming apart.

Whenever she talks to me, I dread it because they tend to spiral into arguments where I end up teary-faced. As to what these arguments are usually about escapes me, but something about how someone my age is still dumb and immature, despite what people have said about my demeanor. Because talks like these make me feel like shit, I try to avoid them, but she doesn’t quite respect boundaries, so trying to assert myself just turns into another argument.

Lately, she has also been putting me under what I think counts as physical abuse. I went through puberty at an early age, but acne has been cropping up since January/last December. This was alarming news to my mother, apparently, as she decided to take the initiative and try and get rid of it herself… By picking at my acne, despite most sources saying that doing so is actually detrimental. I’ve tried to tell her this, but she claims that if she doesn’t pick at it, it’ll never come out. 

The part of this that I \*believe\* is physical abuse is that this process hurts like \*hell\*. She’ll pick at places like my neck, jaw, and mouth with no concern as to how I feel. By the time she’s done with my face, I’m in tears, to which she tells me to stop crying so that the medicine won’t wash away.

Lately, my mom also hasn’t been trusting me to take care of myself. In January I noticed I had a bald spot at the back of my head (looking up ‘bald spot on scalp’ told me that this might be alopecia areata). I told my mom thinking she’d help, but this might’ve caused more pain for me. At first she just applied medication to these spots, but as soon as she saw some red spots on the back of my head she had the compulsion to pick at them, much like the acne on my face. When I shower, she tells me to scratch the back of my head as hard as I can, but I didn’t since I feel like that would make my hair fall out even more. Soon as she found out, she took to doing it herself and it hurt like hell, enough to bring out tears in the shower.

There’s more I want to list, like how in 7th grade after a CPS interview my mom (through my dad I believe) told me to ‘never tell anyone, not even the president, what happens’ but I feel like this post is running its length. So now I ask, is there something wrong or am I just entitled?

There is a doubt in my mind that I’m actually just an entitled cunt because I do run my mouth sometimes (though I want to believe that was a trait that rubbed onto me from my mom) plus, I get to live comfortably for free; I’m eating good food as I’m writing this. I don’t know which way to feel, so insight is appreciated.",22Feb2020,1
873,"A few weeks ago, I decided to do something nice. I often shop at a local market and there is an old guy who I always stop and chat to. He must be in his 60s or 70s and doesn't seem to have many friends or family in his life (I assume this as he didn't seem to have many plans or people to spend Christmas with when I'd spoken with him previously). 

I thought it would be a nice gesture to invite Mike, around for Sunday lunch. When I suggested this to Mike, he seemed very enthusiastic and we exchanged numbers. Mike had called me before our lunch arrangement and something kind've made me get a weird feeling. When I told him on the phone that my parents would be there, he seemed a bit surprised. I brushed away this feeling that something wasn't right and put it down to me being a mean person.  Mike turned up for Sunday lunch. My mum was also there and later on in the day my dad joined us. It was a bit obvious that Mike was a little different. He talks non-stop, admits that he is a hoarder (which in itself is a symptom of some mental health conditions) and it was a labour of love. Eventually as we approached the evening, I told Mike it had been lovely to see him and that we should arrange another get together sometime, but that I had to go out to visit my grandmother (I work full time and it's hard to spend my whole day entertaining someone). My mum and I agreed it was a nice gesture to invite Mike around but maybe not to do it too often, as I am really busy. The following night, Mike called me (and again I hoped it was just to say thanks for dinner). However, he talked non-stop to the point it was difficult to get off the phone to him, and was asking me how my day had been and stated that he felt my mum had 'grilled him' at lunch yesterday (I was there and my mum did no such thing....she did ask Mike how old he was at one point, and he refused to answer).  As I was saying bye to Mike on the phone, my front door rang which distracted me greeting someone and finishing off my call, but Mike had said something along the lines of 'well anyway let's meet up again and go to the movies or dinner together'. I think I was in shock and it took me by surprise and I replied something like 'yes I'm sure I'll see you around sometime at the market again'.  

Then, Mike started to call....every....single...night from that point on. I ignored his calls any by the Friday, when I answered the phone, I told Mike in no uncertain terms that he had got the wrong end of the stick and I thought of him as only a friend and nothing more due to our huge age gap (he looks like an old man although I don't know his exact age, and I am 33 yrs old).  Mike seemed surprised and a bit hurt but I didn't really allow him much time to talk as I just wanted to get off the phone and put this episode behind me.  The same night, Mike called me again (I ignored his call), and then again. This time he left a long voicemail.  In it, he claimed that I had basically lead him on, given him mixed signals and left him feeling confused.  I was in utter shock listening to his message. My heart was beating as if I had just run a marathon and I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I spoke with my mum in the week and she agreed that Mike must have something wrong with him and just ignore him from this point on. 

After Mike had tried to call again, I decided to block his number on my phone. However, he was still able to leave a voicemail message, a friendly one as if we were best mates, and asking if I wanted to chat.  I have not made any contact with him and avoided going to the market again.  Today, I received a Valentine's Day card from him posted to me.  Even though I now know that there is something not right with him (I don't mean that in a horrible way but genuinely his behavioiur is not normal), I am still really, really angry. I tried to do a nice thing (and feel so stupid now and will never do anything like this again). I am angry that this man, who looks old enough to be my grandfather, thinks that I have romantic feelings for him, and has basically ignored what I have said to him and continued to make contact with me when I don't want to have anything to do with him now. 

My question is, how do I handle this going forward? My mum is also very annoyed by this and wants to go to the market next week on her own and tell him not to make any further contact with me again. The whole situation makes me feel disgusted. I apologise if I sound like I'm being bitchy but I genuinely invited him around as an act of kindness. If you saw this man, you would see that he isn't good looking in the slightest and I would never in a million years think of him in a romantic way.  

Any advice?",22Feb2020,1
876,"I am a middle school student studying somewhere prestigious. Lately, I have been feeling depressed and I always feel like I never fit in with my best friends.

My best friends are a group of sweet and kind intellectuals who banded together because of a simple debate competition. They treat each other very well and will always help out when they have the chance.

The thing is that I keep feeling like I don't belong in my friend group. I found out that it was because I kept comparing myself to them. They are super rich and talented and can play two to three instruments while I am middle class and can't even play a flute.

Other than that, I also feel super stressed in school. My family keeps telling me that my grades are super good, but I don't believe them. Due to the stress, I have had thoughts of suicide race across my mind all the time.

877,"So back in 2017, a new girl started working at my job and I was among the very first to guide her into the ins and outs of the job. I was a very awkward person and didn't know any social cues. She was the first person in my life that showed noticeable interest in me, and that became even more apparent when she ""accidentally"" texted me claiming to have added my number and hit send by accident. 

Long story short, we started talking almost daily until deep in the night, and suddenly she asked me if I wanted to hang out with her in the city. I was ecstatic, this never happened to me so I gladly agreed. When the day came, she told me she had some boyfriend issues (felt like a punch in the stomach for me) and that she just didn't feel comfortable with him anymore.

We just kind of wandered around the parks of the city, spewing our troubles and listening to our traumatic stories that happened long and not so long ago. I felt very comfortable with her, but thanks to my anxiety I refrained from holding her hand, hugging her or even kissing her. The day ended and the texting at night soon stopped as well.

When I look back I've been pretty short in my messages, coming across as really disinterested and bored when talking to her after the date. That's why I feel it is my fault that nothing ever came to be of us, even after she broke up with her boyfriend. 

After a year she quit her job and moved to Germany, meaning I never got to see her again. I've always wanted to know whether it was me who screwed everything up or if she wasn't as interested as she seemed. 

My question therefore is: is it weird if I text/DM her asking what her perspective is? Do I come off as insanely creepy if I bring it up after three years of essential radio silence? 

The last thing I want to do is come off as a creepy loser that's been hung up in a fantasy relationship with a girl I had no shot with but I really want to know if she ever liked me.",22Feb2020,1

Hi everyone. So, I'm currently in uni. Unfortunately, I've really been struggling with my mental health. I have bad social anxiety, and basically no friends. At uni, I worry I have a bad reputation and everyone secretly hates me, and I feel so ashamed. I have ADHD and ASD, as well as chronic insomnia, and because of this I really struggle with having a filter or acting correctly in social situations, and I feel like I have come off as rude to a lot of people. I also have realized I don't like the course of study I'm currently in. I'm super far behind in my classwork. Worse, I completely failed to submit an assignment on time and then asked a professor after the deadline had passed if I could have an extension. So rude and unprofessional :( I feel like that professor hates me now.

I was halfway through submitting the paperwork to withdraw from uni but then stopped. It's very uncommon at my uni to withdraw, and I am so worried about what other people will think about me if I do withdraw. Fortunately, the financial penalty is not significant if I do withdraw, so that's not the center of my decision at the moment.

Does anyone have any advice? Do you think it is possible to try to make amends with a lot of people and develop a better reputation over time? Is it better to try and get through the rest of the semester, in order to prevent having an even worse reputation? I just want to disappear, and I feel hypervisible whether I stay or leave.",22Feb2020,1

885,"Years ago, in August 2013, I started my first year of high school (here in Switzerland it's typically three years before you can go to university). To set the context, I am a 14 year old boy at that time, passion about video games and fantasy, not into sports at all, heterosexual and a little insecure about his body but not that much. Pretty smart also, I have always been top of the class in almost all subjects and stuff.

I did not know anyone in my new classroom. We were 20, and fate made such that a group of me and 4 other boys quickly got acquainted and became friends. I quickly got even more friends with two of them. There's also this girl, which I like, and turns out some months later that she likes me back. We start dating. Big deal.

In the middle of the second year of high school, I break up with this girl for many reasons. Or at least, that's what I wanted to think. But actually, there's only one true reason in this story. I cheated on her, but... with another boy. A friend of mine that told me he was gay and wanted to experiment. Super douchebag move from me, but the following might explain some part of it.

She never found out, but I realized that I did not feel about her the same way I used to. And I also realized some things about some of my friendships. Remember, these two boys I got closer to? Well, one of them, let's call him A, became my BEST FRIEND. I had never had a friend like him. We did everything together. We had picked up going to the gym together (I hate sports remember?), I picked up watching live sports (just so I could talk to him about it), I started playing video games he also played (so we could spend more time together). 

He lived far away from me, but he had a big house, so I typically spent at least one night per weekend at his place, sleeping in a bed next to his. We were used to each other's body, but... it wasn't the same for me. At first, I admired his body because while I had the body of a teen who enjoys video games more than running or sports, he had the body of a young adult who has always been sporty for his whole life, with defined abs and shit. The kind of body that society makes you look up to. And while I was at the beginning super impressed, I quickly realized that I was also... aroused. 

I could go on hours and hours about this story. For your information, this went on for almost the whole duration of high school. We shared everything, our most intimates secrets, we west the best friends ever, people started thinking we were dating, he did not care, neither did I. Some of my other friends (outside high school) were saying that I was letting them down for him, that I only cared about him. We went on vacation together multiple times, he met my family, almost all of it, and I met almost all of his too. We were family in each other's family. (Note the use of past tense).

Everything went downhill when the end of high school was getting near. I had multiple things on my mind:

1. I was now sure that I was attracted to him.
2. Ok, maybe I was even sure that I was in love with him. Like, totally batshit crazy in love with him.
3. I was IN LOVE with my STRAIGHT best friend while I was IN THE CLOSET. 
4. I was scared because I thought we would stop speaking if we weren't in the same school anymore.
5. And because of my love for him, I became the most jealous person I've ever seen. I could not see him doing anything with anyone else than me, because I could not understand why it wasn't with me he was doing it. I mean, we used to do everything together, why did he suddenly need other people?

After high school, we went to uni. Turns out we chose the same major and we ended up in the same classroom for almost all of our courses (along with other boys from high school). But I had adopted a defense mechanism: I became very cold with him. I did not respond to his messages, did not sent any or only very cold ones, I barely looked at him in public discussions, never talked directly to him in public, never wanted to be alone with him. I resented him, I hated him, I tried to do my best to get him out of my head. 

I hated myself for a long time, and I still do today. I think he completely wrecked me. 

Nowadays, 7 years later, we're ""friends"". Like, just normal friends. He never got to know all of this, why I was so weird a lot of times, why we lost contact, why I had to completely stop our friendship. 

Also, nowadays, I cannot fall in love. I met many great men and women, had sex with a lot of them, but I cannot fall in love. It's impossible for me, I always compare anyone to him and they're never ""good enough"", I can never find the same feelings I had for him. And I feel like I never will, and it scared me so much, sometimes I can't even sleep at night.

**What do you think, Reddit? Should I seek closure with him, after all this time? Do you think it could help me to go past this story? I'm getting desperate.**

P.S.: I only told this story to two of my (female) friends, but only because I basically had to. They talked me out of suicide, so, yeah had to. And for the context of today, I am now an ""out"" bisexual man, but he's one of the few people I never got to tell to, because I am so afraid he realizes things without me telling him.",22Feb2020,1
886,"I've been having thinking problems, memory loss, and suicidal thoughts for about a year now but I'm unable to talk about it to anyone professional; these mental issues have made me unable to read at grade level, unable to listen, and unable to remember a lot of important things.

Sometimes I don't even remember if I ate, or even washed my hands; i don't remember the time even though i just read it a few seconds ago; I'm more and more unable to speak with people and interact with anyone face to face.

My grades where around passing but have gone down to D's and F's over time, failing since Junior highschool; I can't take notes, copying is a nightmare and I often daydream and forget.

Doing my research I've shown signs of Dyslexia or SCT, the symptoms seeming to get worst over the years; I have ADHD, so SCT could be a possiblity for my constant mental fogginess and mental overloads.

I can't focus anymore and have stopped doing my homework, having nothing turned in since the second semester has started. I tried my very best last year only able to get D's and C's; I've also developed a fear of doctors over time.

I'm usually a very happy and excited person all the time, but I don't seem as energetic as I was; still unable to sleep and never feels tired, but all the things I've found fun are no longer fun anymore; I've always wanted to help people now, not even thinking about myself and just making sure everyone is ok.

891,"About 4 years ago I started talking to this girl I was 19 at the time(23 now). I was living out of state at the time. I never had any feelings for her. But I did visit home once and while I was there we went out on date to this shitty local diner, it was nothing special. Afterwards I had decided that was no longer something I wished to pursue in a romantic fashion. We stayed friends, talking every now and then. I would say about a year or so later my best friend and her started talking, but she still liked me more, she always did. Although she wouldn’t go on to admit to that much later. Anyway, she secretly was still trying to talk to me as she was to my best friend thinking for some reason I wouldn’t tell him. I would tell him and we would laugh at how dumb she thinks we are to the situation. She went on to do this for about a year. She was secretly engaged to another guy while she was doing all this. she never told my friend that. She did come clean to me about it. She tried to make her case to me that she would leave him for me. I wasn’t interested. I told my friend about this immediately because I didn’t know if he was still talking to her. He seemed disappointed I don’t actually know if he was or not. But a few days later he called me saying that this girl went into her job with her fiancé who she has told me she broke things off with and gave the ring back. At that point the 2% chance she of me being interested her was completely gone. She is obviously bad news. However, I did remain friends with her loosely. And secretly I think my friend was still trying to talk to her. Fast forward another year and I decided to move back home. I had a housewarming when I moved back and my friend showed up with the girl. And he had been talking to her just like I assumed. By the end of the party she was texting me saying she wanted to stay over pretty much. I didn’t let her. Nor did I stay texting her, for obvious reasons. I told my best friend about her once again. He stops talking to her again. Once I finally settled into my new job, and home i decide that I can go back to partying as much as I used to. I’m an alcoholic, this is well known. The girl and I have a lot of mutual friends so we see each other often. I have never done anything with her. The most I have done was kiss her on the cheek. Which is what I do to everyone as I’m saying bye and being dragged out of the bar at closing time. Around this time, my friend decides to start talking to her again for the 200th time(this time saying he wanted to wife her long term). So naturally as his friend I hyped him up to her every time I saw her. She would ask me why I didn’t want to talk to her. And I would tell her that my best friend was better man than me. And if she ever wanted something real I wasn’t the guy to give it to her, my friend was. So finally they get together. We’re all 23 now. They didn’t last a week. I know this is a lot but I feel it’s important to the story. 

So a week later, I’m at my local bar that I frequent quite often. And so does the girl. It’s a Tuesday night and I invite my friend out to the bar. He had work the next day so he couldn’t stay long. My other friends that were there also couldn’t stay long because of work the next day. But I was off so naturally I’m going to drink all night. Anyway, as my friend texts that he’s outside, the girl walks in right before him. And he walked in about a minute later thinking she had already been there hanging out with me. Its worth noting nobody invited her, she just showed up as it is a local bar. So immediately my friend just starts telling me that I’m a snake and bitch and what not. That’s pretty much all I got out him for the next couple hours until he noticed that I actually wasn’t talking to her at all. It’s about midnight and everyone who has to work leaves. So it’s just me and the girl. We kept drinking and she basically starts spilling her heart out to me about my friend telling me what happened with them. Basically she had said he’s a sensitive little baby. Although he thinks he’s a manly man, he’s definitely one of the most sensitive persons I Have ever met. anyway, its last call so we decided to go another bar a few minutes away that is open later. So we continued drinking and by last call at this bar I knew I couldn’t drive home(this happens quite often). I didn’t really want to leave my car there because I had stuff to do the next day. The girl had been babysitting her drinks all night so she said she was ok to drive. So she said she would drive me home and from there I said I would call her an Uber home. so we got back to my place and it’s 4am. She said she was tired and if she could just sleep there. I said ok. I let her sleep on my bed and I went to the couch. The couch is usually where my dogs sleeps. I am allergic to my dog, but most days it is manageable. However sleeping on the couch was killing my allergies. So I told her and she said she didn’t mind if I slept in the bed. So I did. We didn’t cuddle, we slept facing opposite directions. in the morning when we woke and we’re both sober. She told me that it should have always been me not my friends she that she regretted him. But now that she’s slept with my best friend, she would never sleep with me. Which was ok. I felt the same way. From that point forward, we decided we could be friends, as we longer wanted to sleep with each other. I spoke to my friend later that day. And told him everything except for the part where she slept over my house. I also didn’t tell him about her saying that it should have always been me. As his friend, I know how much it would hurt his ego to be seen as inferior to me. This was the last time we spoke.

My ex best friend was a manipulative, sensitive, egotistical guy. But most people move past it, and say “that’s just him, you have to love him right.” He wouldn’t try to pull that shit on me often because he knows I give a fuck and I never gave him whatever he wanted like other people would. The past 4 years I have been a lot more well off than him. He would frequently ask me for money when I was living out of state. He would ask for 20$ here and there maybe 50$ so that his bank wouldn’t go into negative balance or to take a girl out. He always said he would pay me back( I never expected him to). He did a few times. The most he ever asked me for was 250$. He said he just been fired from his job(he quit because his boss made a joke about his mom and had too much pride to go back even though his boss would have gave him the job back). So he needed the 250 to buy equipment to become a barber. He’s barber now, that is 100% of his income. he swore he would pay me back over time and I told him it was fine I didn’t need to the money any time soon(or ever really).  To this day he hasn’t given me a dime. Not that I care about money, but I do care about principles. Fast forward to me moving back home. I bought a my first house when I moved back. The entire time I was looking for houses I always looked for one with an extra room for him to move in to try and help him out of his house and help become more independent. What I was gonna charge him, a teenager working at McDonald’s could afford to move in. finally after it’s all said and done, he tells me he can’t afford it and that he won’t be moving in. So I just bought this house with this extra room for nobody. From that point I started taking notice to more things. When we would go to bars I would always buy the first the round and there was never a time we went out and I didn’t buy him food or drinks, it was like he was my girlfriend. I was spending so much money on him now that I look back it’s fucking crazy because I don’t remember him ever returning any type of favor. I remember one time he asked me how much money I had saved up. I didn’t give him an exact number but I said I just said I have enough and he said “I know you do you bitch” as if he was mad that I am successful. he quickly followed up with “just kidding, good for you.” But that right there I felt like just showed me his real colors. And that he has been leeching off me knowing I have money. At least that was the way I took it. I realized he does not fit my future. And I started distancing myself from him. This was occurring at the same time all the drama with the girl was. Now we’re pretty much all caught to the present. 

I’m not quite sure when or how he found out, but he found that the girl had slept over my house. Which I didn’t tell him because I knew how he would get. I was at a friends wedding one day and he told me that my Best friend was on his way. I told him that I don’t think he likes me very much, because the last time I saw him(about a week earlier) he ignored me in the bar. My friend immediately said in response, “yeah I know he told me.” So that was kind of a slap in the face to me I felt like. Because after what happened I at-least I went to go talk to him about it. He showed up to the wedding, and ignored me again. it’s been about 6 months he still hasn’t tried to talk to me about it. 

Just about everyone sides with me and says he’s being sensitive but that I also do have some fault, which I understand because I know how it looks with that girl. But as a two men, who were best friends for about 10 years, you’d think we could talk about it. I would have no problem apologizing for it. But he has never given me the opportunity to talk to him. I had to learn from someone else that we weren’t friends anymore. I don’t know what kind of advice I’m looking for. If it were up to me, I would just leave it how it is now. What do you all think?",22Feb2020,1
892,"My (29F) dad (67M) is a POS who has no respect for my brother or for any other human being. 

So my brother is doing well for himself financially. 
He travels a lot majority of the year but does stay here mainly to protect my mum (my dad is abusive towards my mum and can get violent) but I can handle the mess here. 

Recently my dad has been forcing us to to give him financial aid which we all refused. He is financially extremely irresponsible. 

Upon putting our footdown to preserve shared resources for other important stuff (like medical expenses ) he has attacked my brother in the most humiliating way possible regarding his manhood. 

My bro is closed off kind of a person but I know he is hurting. We may have our differences but this is a new low. 

I am doing everything I can you support him to show I am on his side. What more can I do to show I am on his side?",22Feb2020,1
893,"At the moment I go to a community college about 6 hours away from the town I am from. I have tried to do my best here at making friends and all that, but as many who have gone to college know, it's really hard to do so, even for those who typically make friends easily. I have somewhat put more effort in, but I feel like an idiot who is stuck in the past and just wants my old life back. Living in a new place and as an adult is scary and part of me wants to leave it behind and go somewhere easier. I just do not think I am strong enough. I also have no major and little idea for what I want to do with my life, but I've always had good grades and done well in school, so I went to a really good community college to figure things out instead of blowing all my money at a UC or private Uni. I am 19 and I could not feel like less of an adult.

Next year (2020 fall semester/quarter) I have the opportunity to move to a town 2 hours from my hometown, where a couple of my friends live. I would be able to live in a house with 3 friends and my significant other. The school I would go to is objectively worse so doing that feels weird, but at the same time I would probably transfer to a UC the year after, so it likely doesn't matter. I also don't have a major, so there's no real draw in for me at any school at all, I sort of just go by ranking, the campus, the school's amenities, and the town it's in. It also feels stupid to follow friends and a significant other to a college, but I am also passionate about career discovery and know I could continue working hard at figuring things out and making things the best for me. If I were to stay here, I also have the opportunity to live in an apartment with a friend and some other people I don't know, with relatively good rent and a 15-min ride to school.

I feel like I would be happier at the other school because I would be around familiar faces and be able to focus on my studies and not feel the anxiety and pressure of NEEDING to meet people and make friends while also trying to discover myself and what I want. But it also feels like by leaving, I'm robbing myself of a good opportunity here at a really good cheap school, and I am just too big a pussy to stay longer and attempt to socialize better and actually make my way in the world. Which is a lot to put on my 19-year-old shoulders, but it looks as though that's what successful people do, no? Do I prioritize potential happiness and lack of anxiety (new school)? Or potential success and lack of feeling like I wasn't good enough to stay here (current school)?

I have made so many pros and cons lists, and I've been thinking over this for two months now. I have been meeting with my therapist, my academic counselor, my career counselor, and talking to just about anyone and everyone I can. Ultimately the answer I get is that no one else can make the choice except for me, but I thought hearing from some strangers with an objective point of view could be helpful. So please, if you've made it to the bottom and think you could say anything helpful, feel free.",22Feb2020,1
894,"I've always written as a hobby and I have been told I am quite good at it. Depression has kept me from writing for 5+ years now, but I've been wanting to get back into it. I've always toyed with the idea of writing a book about, or loosely based on, my life. I had the idea that not only would people probably be interested in my experiences, it would also help me process the things that have happened to me. However, whenever I think about my experiences I get ridiculously anxious and I just try to forget all about it.

 Is there a way I can write about (and consequently work through) my experiences? Or is it a really bad idea to do this in the first place?

TL;DR: should I write about my trauma to resolve it, and if so, how?",22Feb2020,1
895,"I've needed braces for a long time my teeth are pretty crooked but my family was very poor when I was young and the cost would've been like $2000 so I told them I didn't care.

Well I'm 100% independent now and have dental insurance but I'm not sure how good it is so idk how much it would cost and idk if it's weird to have braces at my age or if teeth even matter that much and I'm overthinking.

896,"Been on tinder since me and my ex broke up, I'm getting nothing, no matches, no dates, nothing. While my friends are getting 600 matches a day (no exaggeration). I don't understand what I'm doing wrong.
I'm not the best looking, I'm not perfect (no body is) tho I've been told i am. Been told that i would make a good husband too by a family member and my ex tutor. I just treat women or people in general how I'd expect to be treated, with kindness and respect. 
I've also been told I'm too nice, i would love to treat my gal to a romantic dinner or go to the cinema or stay at home. I would love to buy her gifts and flowers.  I know some gals don't want that but I'm a hopeless romantic. 

When i hear that my friends are getting 600 matches a day or when they talk about their love life, a piece of my heart breaks, cos i would love to have that. Someone i can call my love, someone i can call my world. Someone that i cuddle with, someone that i can show my emotions to.

901,"I've known I wasn't cis for a long time, but I wasn't sure of my identity until recently. I've looked everywhere at sources and I do believe that I am Transgender. I've already come out to my two closest friends and they're both accepting and calling me by my preferred pronouns, but I'm not sure how my family will act.

I want to tell them now since I'm still young and want to make this as easiest as possible for me, but when I said I was Lesbian, not fully knowing what being Trans was, they accepted me (sort of).

My nan isn't the most tolerant person and I know she might not take it well. She was hesitant to accept me when I said I've had a few girlfriends, so I'm not sure how she'd act.

I know my dad would be fine with it, he supports communities and tells my brother off when he makes any sort of intolerant comment, but I don't think he'd want to lose his daughter.

My mom asked me what the Trans flag meant once, I told her the meaning then after she said, ""You better not turn out to be one of those."" and at that time I sort of knew I was trans but didn't fully understand, so since then I've tried my hardest to keep everything bottled up. I also know that she wouldn't want to lose her girl. She always says she wants my long hair back, I know before she had me she wanted a girl, and my only other sibling is my brother so I have no clue how she'd act. She's only just got out of therapy and I don't want to make her bad again, but I want to be open about it because I'm sick of pretending to be something I'm not.

904,"I am spiralling right now. Everything in my life is going to unravel and I feel suicidal for the first time. I am a liar. A fraud. And everyone in my life is going to find out.

I lied about graduating from my undergrad degree. I was doing well until my second year when I started having issues submitting coursework. Every coursework, I tried to do more than what was required. Make it really fucking outstanding. Research it to death. Hours spent in the library getting nowhere. I could never submit on time. When I finally did submit late, the tutors would usually say it was amazing work. But late submission meant your module score was capped. I dont know why I did this. I did well in exams and assessments but coursework was a failure. I'd be paralysed with fear too when the emails came in to ask me and I just ignored them. I'd work on the coursework past submission without a plan in my head. I wasnt sleeping. I had migraines every day. Eventually i make it to my final year. I can't submit coursework on time or complete my research thesis. They almost kick me out in the second semester but they give me more time to try. I tried to catch up in the summer but ultimately I failed. I told people that I graduated late in 2013 instead of 2012 but I didn't. Told them I got a 2.1 because that's what everyone expected. I go back in 2015 to repeat the year and I get outstanding marks but once again I cannot despite my efforts submit my research project work. I dont tell anyone in my life about this btw. The uni end up giving me a third class honours degree even though I didnt submit a project worth 2 modules.

In 2017, I manage to get into an online masters degree in a uni near me. I am convinced I can do it this time. I'm older, I'm intelligent, motivated. I need this. My third class degree is useless. I excel in the course for the first 3 months and then same shit happens. Struggle to submit work. I go into denial mode and refuse to open  emails from anyone. Pretend like everything is going okay. Then, I get some pretty devastating news and I find out my partner is a sex addict and has been seeing sex workers. Have a meltdown. Life focus shifts to that. As I'm supposed to graduate in december 2018 and I've told nobody about what's happening, I succumb to pressure from enquiring loved ones and tell them I finished. Tell them I'll start looking for applicable jobs. Last november, my partner sends me a perfect job for me. In my masters field. Bachelors required but not masters. Academy programme to train people up for the job. I apply saying I have masters. Denial mode again. They give me 2 interviews and I get an offer this week. They're really excited to have me 

In my denial brain I think it's fine. It's a small company they wont check my degree. Of course they will. They state on letter than they will need a certificate on the first day. I consider buying a fake degree certificate online. I searched earlier and actually spoke to someone who said they can produce it 

But even though I'm obviously insane and a horrible person my rational side of brain is screaming at me to stop. Please talk me out of this. I will be committing fraud and imagine if they found out

But I told my friends and family about the job. How can I turn down the job without telling everyone in my life that I'm a fraud. A liar. Will my partner leave me? What will my parents say?I want to die. I genuinely want to die at that prospect.

I emailed my course tutor today to ask about coming back to finish it. I'm not sure if its possible and if I did go back I'd need to change fundamentally 

But why is my brain like this? It's not lack of effort. Lack of intelligence. Sometimes I wonder if I have ADHD. This cant be normal. Why do I have this mental block? Why do I the  just shut down and refuse to address my situation in anyway?

I'm so lonely. So scared. 

Someone help me",22Feb2020,1
