So I’ve had the same gmail forever now, basically username@gmail.com

For roughly ten years now, I’ve gotten numerous correspondences from travel reservations, to doctors results, Amazon orders, French dating sites (kinda cool lol) etc from a guy in France who’s name is Name User and apparently keeps linking the gmail acct name.user@gmail.com to all his accts.   Is there anyway I can try to reach this bozo? 

It went from mild but funny annoyance to extremely frustrating and I’m not sure what to do. 


I’ve even used a French to English translator to respond to the more sensitive emails hoping they’d relay  a message but no dice",07Jan2020,1

My two roommates and I live in a small complex and our rent is due the 5th of each month, by check. The office was closed from December 31-January 6.

My roommate went to pay rent earlier today, Jan 6, because of the office being closed for the whole prior week. Upon presentation of the check, she was slapped with a $75 late fee. She deferred paying until Friday the 10th.

We have lived here 12 months and never been late once. They told us we should have slid the check under the door on any day prior to today. I find this baffling, to leave a huge check like that unattended ""under the door""?? They didn't give us notice about how the office was going to be closed for so long or any notice about needing to find an alt way to pay.

Even if there's no direct legal recourse, is there any way out of the fee?",07Jan2020,1
2,"I am freshly 25 and I am LITERALLY having a quarter-life crisis. 


1) The Career:

I am not where I would like to be professionally. I loathe my job. Mind you, there are some great, tolerable days, but most are spent wishing I had gone a different path and would be doing something different. Plot twist, I don’t know what else I want to do. Computer programming? Sure seems fun. Public enforcement?  Fuck the bad guys. Go to school and do a  complete 360? Financially impossible. I can’t find my place in what I am suppose to do with my life. I have big goals, and that’s being able to support and provide for a big ol’ family. 

I don’t have a lot of time to figure this out, especially if I want to reach those goals. So, unleash the secrets of figuring out what to do during your existence, before a gradual, inevitable death. 

2) The Relationships:

I am in a great, long-term, super-serious, we-beat-statistical-odds-finding-each-other kind of relationship. No complaints there, but I feel like symbolic friend circle has grown smaller than I would like. I’m very introverted, and not very social. Classic millennial, am I right? I feel that because I am now a great big adult, living the adult,  bill paying life, that it is difficult to find new friends. Especially male friends. (What gives?). You all appear to have many pals, where did you get them? We’re they reasonably priced?

3) The Pursuit:

Tips and tricks on how you fellow earthlings  live a happy, fulfilling life would also be neat to hear.

4,"I'm going to condense this down as much as possible. Unfortunately as I do work at a government organization, I need to keep things pretty vague. Early 20's, USA, part-time job (29 hours/week), $10.50/hour, dog will be a trained service dog and not an emotional support animal. My dog and my rights to a service dog are/would be protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

I love my job. It's flexible, they've been wonderful with my cancer treatments. I'm even lined up for an amazing promotion that I genuinely need. Unfortunately I have a medical condition that I now have a very hard time controlling, and I qualify for a service dog. That's perfectly fine and according to the ADA I cannot be refused the right to a service animal within my office. That being said, I decided to be polite and ask the director of my department if she was okay with me having one. She sent an email to HR, all was going fine, and I could easily provide the proof they were asking for.

Until my director sent an email to both HR and myself saying that my supervisor has an allergy to animals. She refused ALL dogs, including the two hypoallergenic breeds I applied for. I have an allergy as well, so I couldn't have a dog that would set off moderate allergies anyways. I already told her explicitly that these are hypoallergenic dogs (one is completely hairless), but no dice.

I desperately need this dog. I don't have a choice, and I'm at this office/area for 10-15 hours a day since I attend additional activities there that I cannot miss (what I do there would reveal what kind of organization it is). Because of these activities, I also cannot raise too much of a fuss.

So... what do I do? Do I just quit?",07Jan2020,1
5,"Hey everyone. Hope y'all are having a good day. 

I got my smart serve a while back to work at a concert. There was in issue with the website that did not work when I tried to input my unit number in the address. I entered all the information, called them and asked and confirmed with them that they added the unit number in there. 

I told them I would need the certification as I was working at a concert soon and they were the ones who told us to get one. 

Anyways. 2 weeks pass and the concert day comes. The people organizing it know that I passed my certification and told me to come work. The thing is that smart serve did not send the card to me at all. 

I worked at the concerts and recently I reached out to them and told them what happened. They weren't as helpful as I thought. I told them the person had confirmed they added the unit number due to the glitch on the website that evening. 

They said that I could get a replacement and it would cost $15. I said it's the principal of it and I have them my unit number to check. They said it wasn't there, but said they added it now.  I said okay it's nice they added it now but this doesn't help much when I needed it before and could use it now. 

I asked them if it would have been sent back if it didn't come to the correct unit and they said it probably got sent back or something. I asked if they can send it as a courtesy but they said l would have to pay for it lol. 

Anyways. I decided not to. Thanked the person on the phone and didn't purchase a replacement. 

I don't want to hold a grudge against them but I'm wondering what to do. That was the main person in charge (apparently) and I don't see point calling again. Anyways wondering what to do. Based on the principal of it I decided not to get it but the thing is I would need the card if I wanted to apply at some restaurants and stuff. 
 
That's about it for the smart serve. 
I just decided to apply elsewhere and not as a server. 

Anyways would appreciate some advice. Cheers.",07Jan2020,1

19,"TLDR AT BOTTOM

Okay so this whole situation goes quite a while back. Me alongside 3 other buddies from our home town decided to all get a place together when going off to college since it would be easier than having to deal with randoms. Well that quickly fell through as one of my roommates (let's call him Dean) decided to go all crazy a week into our move.

Dean and I were good buds and hung out all the time for a year leading up to our move and as soon as we moved his personality switched into a complete 180. He was extremely vulgar and downright racist and homophobic even in public. He had major mood swings and clearly some mental health issues. Only a week in we got into a physical fight which ended with me being beat on the ground. We both agreed to shrug it off as neither of us wanted legal trouble and thought it was just to do with us being stressed since it was first time moving away from home. All of us 3 guys tried talking to him about these issues and it only made things worse so we backed off.

Eventually one night we were all going out to have a great night. Get food, play video games and have some drinks. He got very drunk and none of us noticed. He ended up getting extremely violent and ended with my other 2 roommates locking themselves in their rooms as Dean tried to break in and me trying to calm him down. That only ended up in him chasing after me with a knife screaming he's going to kill all of us then himself. I called the police as I outran him and when the cops finally showed up they merely took him to the hospital and let him go immediately. Dean walked hours and got home finally. I was scared shitless so I contacted my landlord and explained everything and she evicted him. A week later and he's out of the house THANK GOD! Found out he even lied about his living situation before we moved and he was actually homeless for months due to coming at his guardians with a knife as well. Hmm...

Things were good for a long while it went great.... Until around April 2019. My other 2 roommates started talking to me about Dean and how they were still friends with him after everything and kept in regular contact. For a few weeks they guilt tripped me into feeling bad that I got him evicted.  They kept asking me if he could come over to watch Game of Thrones season 8 with them (Dean had been banned from the premise legally and they didn't want me to call the police on him) So I eventually gave in and said he could come over ONLY to watch the episodes. Well that spiralled out of control real fast and gradually they kept having him over.

Fast forward to now and Dean has completely converted my roommates against me basically bullying. A while back they tried to get my gf to stop talking to me and claimed I was a pedophile and sexist and all sorts of things. This is when the turning point started. Ever since then my roommates have been basically bullies purposely excluding me out of everything and making me feel trapped in my own home. Dean is over literally every day and has been for a while now and he hates my guts so he always mocks me and treats me like garbage in my own house and my own roommates do It too. I feel like such garbage and am pretty sure I'm in a bad state of depression from this all. On top of that it frustrates the hell out of me especially since I can't use my own TV and couch I spent hundreds on since they feel entitled to them despite it not being their property. 

I can't use my own devices or my own furniture. They've basically taken over the house and it's always 3 on 1. I'm not sure what to do at this point. My lease doesn't end until August and definitely don't have the money to move. I have some long time best friends coming and we plan to get a place in September but I'm not sure what to do. I don't know whether to call the police on Dean (since I've been told by landlord if he shows up I call call the police). If I do that then that would start so much drama and make my life an even worse hell. I live far away from any family and with my school workload, holding a job and trying to maintain my high grades was near impossible for me. I had to leave my part-time job due to insane college workload. Idk if I should just suffer until September or if I should do something. I'm not sure what I could do.

Any help would be so great thank you.

TLDR: roommate who tried to kill me and was evicted has come back into my house as all my other roommates remained friends with him and now all of them have put me in a bad spot bullying me in my own house everyday. He's over every day and I constantly feel like I'm trapped in a corner. All roommates and evicted roommate feel entitled to all my possessions and I'm not allowed to use my own devices or furniture. I can call the police and have them take evicted roommate as told by landlord but that would cause a lot of issues with other roommates. I don't know what to do. I'm planning to move in Sept when lease is up with some other friends. I don't have money to move before then and I'm losing my mind and fallen into a very depressed state in my current situation. Its only gotten worse and I'm not sure what to do. Any help would be great.",07Jan2020,1

23,"So i was in a terrible situation i gave up my apt to take care of my elderly mother moved in with her when she got cancer. It got real bad and well she got moved to hospise or a hospital and was given 8 months. I was out of a job and homeless my sisters told me to go live on the streets.  My friend or old friend offered to let me move in with her had a job lined up for me if i took care of her kids did cooking and cleaning it was terrible she was abusive mentally and controling .  I got enough and moved in with a buddy and his wife from wow . When my old roomie found out she stole all my stuff while i was at my moms funeral harrassed my very pregnant sister and other sister while i was there.  She moved while i was in texas to bury my mom took my stuff and the cops could do nothing it was legal. I flew from the funeral to my friends i think are ghosting mes home in cali.  We hit it off well i did the cooking and cleaning until the planned move they were doing in met their friends got along well enough that when they moved they asked me to join them where i currently live .   So we have a cast of people  the married couple  mc and female roomie fr male roomie mr and reallly rude chick rrc


So fm mr and rrc were friends from in cali one of them rrc moved to somewhere for a job lost it and got kicked out of her apt for refusing to pay rent because they people above her smoked weed. And that stuff is bad . She ended up moving in with us a few months after we moved cause she was homeless

The other one was a couple they moved when the mr got out of the army to be together but couldnt afford a home.

Now it started out nice rrc was sweet but when mr and fm moved in she just started ignore And borrowing money i never got back from me .
I was left out and the only time they would spend with me is if i payed.  Over time i got enough of it and me and the rrc clashed and aince i was the newest member in the pack when the year mark came i was asked to leave because me and rrc clashed alot. Because i was tired of her tryinng to talk down to me like i was stupid borrow money and not pay back and correct me on stuff that didnt exist.  So i was hurt and was going to blow all my money on a trip to do things on my bucket list before i wanted to end it. Luckly i found my bf  before and that never happened im in a better place.
Now when i came back from my trip to nyc rrc really wanted my room to hersef offered to pack me up and moved me the next day because shes having her birthday party and she didnt want me there and i wouldnt like being alone in my room.  She wasnt happy with the fact i refused to give her my guinea pig she asked mc fr and mr to get me to give her him before i moved cause ahe loved him.
In that rush i left my extra switch joycons and a few chargers for my switch and controllers. About 80$ worth of stuff.
The day i unpacked was the day i moved i told them they stated mcs husband had surgery to just wait theyd send it and to send 10$ for shipping and stuff. 

After that the replys were not happening much i got some telling me hes fine just wait a bit more still recovering.  Until i waited a month or 2 saw he was on vacation in dc. So i asked the husband to see whhat was going on because i was just getting on veiw and they said theyed talk to people to see hows it going.

Month went by no response so i messaged him and i got well rcc said that she sent them. 
I didnt get them and everytime i ask about them i get left on seen.  I wanted to waste over 100$ on a lyft ride to go confront them but it would be a waste. 
I want to belive that they are still good people the mc but im
Not sure anymore im pretty sure im getting ghosted. 

Like im pretty sure they stole 10$ and 80$ worth of stuff and ghosted me. Which is suprising because they own 2 houses and are loaded so they dont need to steal.

30,"So here's the situation. To make a kind of long story short, this girl (lets call her K) was a casual friend of mine at lunch during school hours. She was a bit obnoxious but a year younger then me (a sophomore), so I didn't mind so much and figured she'd grow up eventually. Not like I had to be best friends with her.

So one day while we're sitting, she sees another girl walk into the cafeteria, and starts talking about how this girl did her wrong. I asked for clarification, and turns out this girl was dating this guy and the guy cheated on his girl with K a while back, so the girl obviously didn't like her, but the way K presented this situation was that she was the victim and the girl was in the wrong. A friend confirmed this is how she presented this, as sometimes I have trouble picking up on stuff. This didn't sit well with me, cheating is one of the things that gets to me the most, so myself and a friend sitting there tried to give some sound advice, which she brushed off saying the other girl was a bitch and all this stuff, blah blah. It was clear she didn't want to listen and ended the conversation with a passive 'lets agree to disagree' and plugged herself into her phone.

A mutual friend, S, confirmed that my advice seemed to be good and I was genuinely trying to help. Again, sometimes I miss things and push issues too far, so I did check with witnesses to make sure I hadn't been in the wrong here. I texted her later that day to apologize and said if she wanted to vent next time to let me know so I wouldn't offer unsolicited advice.

Shortly after that she made it clear she wanted nothing to do with me. The worst was when I sat down with her at a lunch table thinking it was fine, and asked how she was and all that. She looks at me, grabs her stuff, and just leaves to sit somewhere else. This kind of thing has never happened to me before, and it made me feel awful. Luckily my other friends came to my rescue so I wasn't alone.

That would be the end of it if I didn't know she was still concerned with me, over three months later. I didn't even know her that well, so it feels like this kind of persistent hatred and trying to bring me down is dumb. We have mutual friends so they do tell me whats going on. 

I recently dyed my hair over Christmas break (if you want to get an idea of the color google 'punky color alpine green', its just about that but a bit faded from all the washing) and it was debuted today at school. Most reactions were fine, but as I walked to lunch I spot K craning her neck to see over a group of people she's talking to. I see S walking past that group, and she stops for a split second before rushing over to meet me.

S informs me that this happened:

She was walking past K and saw her looking and heard her go, 'of course that bitch would dye her hair that ugly ass color'. Being who I am, S thought of me because I dye my hair rather regularly, and then she saw me coming in the direction K was looking in, and made the connection. It hurts, because I thought we could just move on and forget that K was ever a casual friend of mine, she'd live her life and I'd live mine. But I guess not, and with all the mutual friends we have, I'm not sure what to do. The more I ask people about her, the more I figure out she's generally just a shitty person. I'm not sure if I should call her out and tell her to keep my name out of her mouth, or let her be and take the high road.

I was really feeling good about my hair today, and this comment kind of dragged me down. Help?

He stays in the bedroom and the other bedroom is occupied by a wannabe rapper who does not pay his rent. My problem is that she does not want me to stream or spend money on anything I need to do so. I've tried talking to her several times to get to the root of the problem to no avail. I could really use some advice on this issue.,07Jan2020,1

33,"Throwaway, for obvious reasons.

So a little bit of backstory, my parents never really got along, either with each other or any members of the family. Almost 10 years ago we moved into this new house (that honestly isn't that much, but at least it has a roof) and we have to pay rent every month. Now my really smart parents didn't pay those bills for FUCKING 6 MONTHS. They've been ignoring phone calls from the bank and now when my dad finally picked up they said in a few days they're going to take our house if we don't pay. My mom got off work and they had a really intelligent discussion and both decided they're just not gonna pay it (they don't have the money and neither do they want to pay it) and they are going to go each whereever they find. 

No ofcourse I ain't gon be left alone, but this shit hits me on a whole another level. I've dealt with my parent's shit my whole entire life, with arguments and fights and fucking police and me needing to be there so they don't kill each other. LITERALLY. I'm fed up. I've been depressive for well over 3 years and suicidal for that fact and I think I'm honestly going to kill myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't really know what I'm expecting. No I won't be talking to anyone professional. First of all I don't have the money to talk in person, and all the suicidal help lines are bullshit (in my opinion) because I can't relate to someone I don't know (kind of ironic, I am on reddit tbh). I've talked with friends about this (my depression, not the full details about my family's past) in the past but in my region they're all close minded. Especially my parents.

I think I just wanted to get this off my heart, but now I'm almost 100% sure I'm gonna kill myself in the next few days",07Jan2020,1

I’m disregarded by everyone and when i’m drowning no one helps me. I want to be a psychiatrist to genuinely help people with mental illnesses but everyday i learn more and more this isn’t about helping people, it’s about making the biggest paycheck. i have prior knowledge in the area that greatly helps me but it’s always “i’m your boss you do what i tell you” or “who cares this is procedure”. besides the constant bashing by people, the absolute conflict of what i’ve been wanting to do and how i imagine it to be vs. how it actually is has been chipping away at my mental health. I’m supposed to start school today and i haven’t registered for classes because i’ve just lost so much motivation to go to and finish my degree. for what? waste money to get a degree to just end up working for money and not helping others, i might as well just quit and become a fucking server; i made 20x more money than i’m doing now. This literally sucks. Can someone give me some solid advice on what to do with my life, i don’t want to end up hating my life for this.

I’ve always lived with my sister and my parents. My sister was diagnosed with schizophrenia several years ago and had not spoken to me since due to irrational fears. I’ve gotten over this and she has always seemed to not care so we just don’t speak to each other. This probably seems odd and yes I have tried to speak to her and start conversations but she pretends I do not exist and refused to even say my name for years. 

Fast forward to now, she is doing remarkably better and she is taking anti-psychotics. She goes to school, works and from the outside she can pass as a member of society. She still had leftover delusions but I know that you can only expect so much from her and I’m just happy she is doing better. As of four months ago she got this boyfriend (23M) that she met in college. She introduced me to him by bringing him down to my room after they were loudly having sex. I don’t really like him very much to say the least and I’m worried that he is taking advantage of her because this is her first real relationship and she is very vulnerable because of her mental illness. The normal day for them from my perspective is they go to college together, they go to my home and loudly have sex, he eats our food, then they loudly have sex again. (Her room is thirty feet from mine). 

I don’t know how to bring it up to her that this really bothers me because we have such an odd relationship and also I don’t know if I should even bring up my opinion of her boyfriend because he seems like a real pos.

42,"TL;DR

Plate Pass is charging customers a convenience fee for processing toll charges. To avoid such fees, typically one would pay at the toll booth in cash. However, New York only does electronic billing.



So I vacation to new york to visit family and rent a car for a week. New York has eliminated manned toll booths. Everything is electronic and you receive a bill in the mail. Because I am not the registered owner of a rental car Hertz receives the bill. The company in charge of handling toll bills for Hertz is called “Plate Pass”. They charge “convenience” fees every time you use the vehicles EZ pass (toll transponder). I literally dont have a choice in new york and when I explain this to the lady on the phone she just gives me a hard time. I feel like this is really shitty business etiquette. If there arent any manned tolls how am I supposed to proceed. I ask her this question and she says “well you would have to apply for a transponder before hand”.  Sure I could have done that because I used to live in new york and know there only electronic tolls, but how about the thousands of people who visit new york and dont have the slightest idea about that. Feels like they are just preying on people and taking advantage of the fact that new york only does e-billing for tolls. She ended up offering 50% refund which is still shitty.",07Jan2020,1
44,"So one of my nieces was adopted by her dads sister and her husband. My niece is black and white and the parents are white. My mom tried helping explaining to her that her hair is very different from most white hair and she can’t just stick a bunch of bows in it and not add any moisturizers to her hair. It’s very course and thick so she often just has it sticking out everywhere and it’s very dry. My mom has even tried to tell her tips in how she can style her hair to keep it healthy but she doesn’t listen to them. Like ultimately it’s her child but it just kinda sucks that she won’t take her advice. She’s only 3 but I kinda worry how she will handle telling her that she is different and that people will definitely treat her different.

They moved to Texas a while ago and idk which area but the area my family lived in before, my sisters experienced a lot of racism and I just want my niece to be prepared that some people aren’t going to like her purely based on her skin. I just hope that her mom will not act blind when she gets ready to start going to school and is exposed to other people.

46,"Hey guys, 

this may deviate from usual content a bit as I'm more looking for UNETHICAL ADVICE. But bear with me here, I have good reason to want to fuck this guy over. So about two weeks ago, I sold an old laptop to a guy we'll say lives in state A (I do not live in state A). This dude proceeded to freak out over minor cosmetic damages and request a refund. Ngl, buying a laptop on Ebay and not expecting a few scuffmarks is a bit unrealistic, but I granted the return as I'm GENERALLY an ethical and understanding person. 

I was out of the country at the time for Christmas so the package bounced right back to him in State A as it required a signature and I wasn't home at my permanent address.

I notified him this is going to be the case, and he never responded. After I came back to the country a few days ago, I requested an update from him as I haven't received my return goods, and Ebay has refunded him already. He sent me something pretty dismissive like ""check your local post office"". Yesterday, I was looking for my phone and was using the Findmy App to find my airpods when I noticed a new macbook registered to my icloud that I do not recognize. It pinged the laptop's location to a name I don't recognize in State B (for Bew Bersey).

I had to read between the lines a bit, but it's really not that many dots to connect. He thought I wouldn't be able to track the laptop I'd sold him, but what I didn't know at the time and was a massive help is that unless you manually remove a device from icloud, it pairs with the physical device for life. I am still able to track my old laptop via icloud even after I'd factory reset the device. Because he thought he basically had a laptop now, he sold it himself to the guy in state B. 

I put the mac on lost mode and sent the guy in state B a message from the mac telling him what had happened to the mac and asking he help me murk this thief in State A. 

Now comes my dilemma, I have the thief's address and enough proof to build a case against him. The value of the laptop exceeds the dollar amount needed for this theft to qualify as a Felony Grand Theft in the 3rd degree, which goes on record. Obviously a pretty bad punishment, so I was thinking of offering him the option to settle this out of court with no charges pressed, at a price of course. I'm thinking of setting the cost at double the cost of the laptop. 

What are some other good ways for me to play this so this thief learns a lesson?",07Jan2020,1
47,"Tw: mention of assault 

When I was 15, I was going through a lot of mental health issues and was extremely impulsive and didn't care what happened to me. A man at a bus terminal came up to me and started a conversation with me, eventually he offers to drive me to the mall where I was going. I decided ""fuck it"" and went for it. While in the car he asked me how old I was and I told him, he made a comment about how young I was but still was touching me while driving. I wasnt into it, but I just laughed and wanted to act cool about it. By the time I finally got out, everything was fine. Until he yelled at me to get back in the car, as I was ignoring it I turned back because I felt some stupid obligation. He took me over to the back of the parking lot, we argued about how I thought it was a bad place to do what he wanted... Eventually he just did it, I don't want to go into any details cause it's gross. I am nearly 18 now so it's been awhile. ( I am well aware that it is largely on me.) 


What I am thinking about now is I am pretty sure he hangs around at bus terminal to pick up younger girls. He saw me at a bus terminal a few months after and kept insisting I go for a drive with him, but I refused. He ended up trying to look sad and telling me how he wants a ""meaningful relationship with me."" He has seen me on a few more occasions and each time has approached me multiple times even though I am clearly uncomfortable and attempted to get me to go with him. Even trying to guilt trip me into it . 


 Each time he had a stupid reason he was there, one time he even said he was taking my bus to see his friend. But a second later asked me to go to his car with him.. And, I saw him again there I'm November. I've seen him in 2 different terminals , and i don't see why he hangs out there when he can drive. I am worried that he is doing it to other girls, and I regret not doing anything now. I am aware he didn't really do much wrong cause I put myself in that place.. But I still don't feel right wondering if other girls could be impacted by him too.",07Jan2020,1
48,"Throwaway account, I'll try to be brief. Apologies for any formatting mistakes, it's been years since I've used Reddit.

Recently I (20M) have developed a very strong urge to start cutting myself. *I am not suicidal*. I would consider myself a relatively confident and happy person most of the time and I'm at a comparative high point in my life so I do not believe I am suffering from depression. I have been diagnosed with a mild form of Asperger's and have been known to self-harm to a certain extent in the past. Mostly this has consisted of punching in the face and head, banging my head against walls and furniture, and biting my arm. I guess I don't do it out of a desire to hurt or punish myself, more like a reflexive action to clear my head. I've never done this around other people nor have I done anything that might leave permanent marks or damage.
This feels different, however. For the last couple days I haven't been able to shake this compulsion to take a knife to my flesh. I don't want to cause any damage or even cut too deep, and I'm unsure if I actually want to leave scars or not. Part of it seems like a sexual thing and besides that I just feel like it's something I have to do.

I know this is an unsafe train of thought and I'm scared to risk my health, relationships, career etc over it but at the same time I can't stop thinking about it. It would be so easy. I guess I'm a bit of a masochist and I enjoy certain types of pain and the sight of blood.

50,"I have a younger sibling who still lives with our parents for a minor rent, but over the past couple years items have started going missing, culminating in items that I lent them before Christmas which they claim has been left at a friend's but which hasn't resurfaced despite being asked repeatedly to return it.

Some of the items that went missing were tools belonging to our Dad, which were later discovered in the local Cash Converters, and I suspect that my items have gone the same way, although CC are saying that they're unable to let me know about anything they've received from this person without my sibling's permission, which I know I'm not going to get.

It's not so much trying to regain my items that is the question here, but more what options or suggestions you can make about getting help for my sibling - my parents have been trying to get to the bottom of this for over 2 years now but this person just insists that nothing is wrong and that the stuff that has gone missing is invariably 'with a friend', although none of it has ever turned up again.

They have a well-paid job but month after month are unable to pay rent to our parents, typically because of supposed issues with being paid, although the employer is massive organisation who I personally have worked for in the past and know that this is highly unlikely to be the problem. I suspect they've lost their job and are selling things to get by, but by ignoring what is clearly a major issue and getting angry and defensive whenever put on the spot, it's just not possible to get any genuine answer on what is going on.

Apologies for the wall of text, but I'm increasingly concerned. Our parents are both retirement age and simply aren't as healthy as they used to be. My concern is that the ongoing stress of the situation could cause one or both parents to get ill or worse, or that they'll just have enough and kick my sibling out. I know my parents have argued a number of times about this latter option, but I think that my sibling has alienated all their friends so would likely be homeless if kicked out.

58,"Just for a little background. I am black, college educated, bilingual, and I have a well off job. My husband is Mexican and works in cars. I don’t want to say too much and I had to make a new account because I know he would see it if I posted on my normal account.

We have been together for 4 years and politics isn’t something we ever really discussed. I met him when I was freshman in college. When it’s time for voting, he has never gone voting with me and I’m not even sure he has his voters registration card. That’s fine. I wasn’t going to force him to get involved with that stuff, because not everyone wants to be involved in things like that. (I guess this was a red flag.) 

Before I go on any further, I want to say that i think it’s completely okay for people to be liberal or conservative. There’s no need to hate anyone for having different political views. My best friend (White) and her family are extremely conservative and they love me dearly. I know that political views don’t define a person.

My issue is that, with my background (and his) I wouldn’t have expected him to be such a HUGE trump supporter. I came from absolutely nothing. When I was growing up, my house had cracks in it and my entire family was poor. I’m the first person in my entire family who has received a degree and I’m currently working on my masters. I was able to accumulate so much in scholarships I fixed my grandmas house up. My husband comes from a family of immigrants, so naturally I thought we would at least have similar views. Especially since his family is very vocal about how much they hate trump at family gatherings. 

Supporting some of trumps ideas? Sure. Wanting to practically be up his ass? No. My husband spends all of his time looking up “conspiracy” theories about politicians and claims that I am not “woke.” I don’t want to go to into details but I’m sure everyone has that one weird person in the family that’s like this. Unfortunately, this is how my husband is. This behavior just started about a year ago and continuously gets worse. It’s baffling and a bit scary. We were planning on having a child soon, but now I’m wondering if I made the right choice marrying him. I’m so mad at college me for not nipping this in the bud already. 

We were reading an article together about an exchange HS student (16) who was shot here in the US for knocking on the wrong door. He was dressed for a party and had nothing on him. Homeowner still shot him dead. My husband said he agreed with the homeowner. Who killed a child for knocking on his door? Didn’t instigate or attack or anything just knocked???? A little later, he goes into this long talk about how I need to “wake up” and that “everything” he is saying is “true.” It makes me so angry that he didn’t even finish school, yet he has all this time to research for hours on this mess. He recently got into something called pizza gate and honestly I feel overwhelmed. He’s constantly nagging me about this stuff and he even showed me one of those BS articles about Obama not being a US citizen.  (I’m not an Obama supporter btw, but I don’t think he was that bad) We have enough issues to deal with as it is in our relationship, but I feel like I’m at my breaking point with this.

Should I plan a party and send out invites to the wedding party and his buddy and pay for the stripper and have a probably akward party or what would you guys do?",07Jan2020,1

62,"Hey everyone. Hope y'all are having a good day. 

I got my smart serve a while back to work at a concert. There was in issue with the website that did not work when I tried to input my unit number in the address. I entered all the information, called them and asked and confirmed with them that they added the unit number in there. 

I told them I would need the certification as I was working at a concert soon and they were the ones who told us to get one. 

Anyways. 2 weeks pass and the concert day comes. The people organizing it know that I passed my certification and told me to come work. The thing is that smart serve did not send the card to me at all. 

I worked at the concerts and recently I reached out to them and told them what happened. They weren't as helpful as I thought. I told them the person had confirmed they added the unit number due to the glitch on the website that evening. 

They said that I could get a replacement and it would cost $15. I said it's the principal of it and I have them my unit number to check. They said it wasn't there, but said they added it now.  I said okay it's nice they added it now but this doesn't help much when I needed it before and could use it now. 

I asked them if it would have been sent back if it didn't come to the correct unit and they said it probably got sent back or something. I asked if they can send it as a courtesy but they said l would have to pay for it lol. 

Anyways. I decided not to. Thanked the person on the phone and didn't purchase a replacement. 

I don't want to hold a grudge against them but I'm wondering what to do. That was the main person in charge (apparently) and I don't see point calling again. Anyways wondering what to do. Based on the principal of it I decided not to get it but the thing is I would need the card if I wanted to apply at some restaurants and stuff. 
 
That's about it for the smart serve. 
I just decided to apply elsewhere and not as a server. 

Anyways would appreciate some advice. Cheers.",07Jan2020,1

65,"I feel like my foster dad has some bad attitude with me for no reason. only two things just happened within like thirty minutes but I still feel he has an attitude. ok here's the story.

first, I was asking for a cookie. they're going to a dinner thing with their Church. I don't go because I'm usually at work on the library. I only go to church on Sunday. so i just asked my foster dad if they can save a cookie for me. he said no. I was jokingly doing fake tears (running my fingers down my face as tears would). I wasnt really hurt though i was just like ok. so my foster dad was like ""what? you don't participate and want us to do stuff for you.""

about this, i genuinely dont know what hes talking about. i am only ever really asking them for my money. but i just let this go. but i asked why he was saying that. he said ""we miss having you around' and tbh i forgot what else he said. i said ""no yall dont."" and he gave me a ""come on"" kind of look. that was the end of that.

the second time. so since im not going to the dinner im supposed to be at the coffee shop doing work on my foster moms laptop. but i forgot to grab it so i just asked if they did. my foster dad said ""nope thats your responsibility."" and hes right. it is. i am just confused again on why he couldnt just say no. the way he said it makes me feel like hes getting an attitude with me when its not necessary. should i not be upset? if not how can i stop?",07Jan2020,1

71,"So I texted my friend/setting buddy/ crush for she want to be fwb. I asked him does he want to be fwb. And he said “Uh why” and I said “cause” and he says “Uh ok” then I said “lmao I’m asking do you want to. Do you want to?” And he says “Uh ig” first of all idk why he kept saying Uh. So I said “Bruh lmao okay” and he said “ok” 14 mins later he texts me asking “Why” and I’m like “why what” and he said “Why’d you ask me that” and I said “Case for all the freaky shit we be doing so why not, let’s just do that I guess. But if you don’t want to then okay. Why do you want to know so badly it’s common sense” and he said “Do you want to be just fwb?” And I was thinking is he saying he wants to be something else? So I said “oh ohhh I never asked you what do you want  to be? Do you have anything in mind?” He said “Uh idk” and i said “like we don’t have to be fwb we can be something else”  and he said “like what”  I said “Girlfriend and boyfriend, fuck buddies, friends with benefits” He said “hmm well I can’t be in a relationship because I’m dealing with shit rn. Wait let me restart. Since we sexted a lot do you want to be something else” and I said “what do you mean by something else. Are you suggesting something? Hmmm we could be like fuck buddies but idk”. He said back “no I’m just saying. Wym” and I said “Let me rephrase that” and he’s like “Wait I read that wrong” and I’m confused so I’m like “What? read what wrong” and he says “So you want to be fwb”. So I said “What did you think I was asking”‘and he’s like “idk ig we can. But wym fuck buddies” and I said “It’s literally what it says Fuck Buddies” and he’s like “Oh”. And he’s like “so like sex” and I said “yeah that’s what it is lmao” then he said “Lol I can’t do either cause I got straight home after school when I don’t have anything” and I said “damnnn” and he said “yea”


So I asked him “so you still wanna be fwb? You up for that?” And he said  “At the same time I want to but not really either”
Then I said “we can think about it we don’t have to rush this.” So he said back “Aight but honestly I don’t think we would be good friends. Well we don’t talk in person and ik that’s on me” and I said “Yeah I never thought we were friends tbh. Just acquaintances. That sext. And like each other sexually” and he said yea. And he said “Ik you want to be friends but I don’t think that’ll work and I’m so sorry for wasting you time for these months. Well we can talk to eachother like once” is he talking about like we can still chat? But not as often?. And I said “I appreciate your effort to acknowledged your mistake.” He’s like “And maybe sometime later” and he said “hold up” and I said okay. Then he said “Idk but I’m sorry we can’t be friends”

Where the heck is going with this? He seemed so confused with going back and fourth between saying we couldn’t all to eachother, then saying we can’t be friends. What kind of mood does this give you?  I’m sorry for all these words and the typos there might be. This is the last bit. 
 So i was getting tired. We just had a good convo that lasted like a hour about trumpets. I said “Yeah ima go
To bed so gn” then he said  “Yea I guess this is where the journey ends.”
I said “What? You deadass? We just had a good convo🤣😭 I don’t want it to end like this” but tbh it was gonna end some way. So might as well end it now. 
He said “Oh”. And I said “*sigh*😅😞” his response to that was “Sorry but maybe in the future we could be friends. See ya” And I said back (I’m sorry if y’all cringing at my clingy-ness. I kept pushing it omg)
“So we done done? Okay I understand” 
And he said “ig” and I said “See ya.” And he said “Sorry but this wouldn’t work” I said back “I know, I know shit. So it might be awkward when we see eachother then I guess” and he said “Eh not really but see ya” then I said “for me yeah” then he blocked me 

So does this seem like the end for us? Is there a chance he would come back, from telling in the story? This is everything word for word that was spoken. He said i guess a lot and idk what to do or think about that. What do you guys think he was feeling or playing at? And i think me asking him if he wanted to be fwb scared him tf off. What you think?",07Jan2020,1
72,"I've posted this in a couple of subreddits to get the most advice. 

This happened in TN.

In either April or May of '19 I was contacted via mail by an attorney that was representing the Timeshare company that I had previously worked for (quit due to many reasons about 8 months prior to the contact from lawyer) and was informed that I was being named in a lawsuit filed by some people that I had sold a timeshare to at some point.   


The lawyer proceeded to ask me a few questions, which I answered honestly and told him straight up that it more than likely was cause for a lawsuit because there were many shady things happening at the timeshare company and basically told him that they should go ahead and settle because if it came up in court I would not lie for the company that I used to work for. 

We ended the call and a few days later he called me back to tell me ""It would be best if you were represented by another attorney in this matter, but the TS Company would like to pay for all legal costs"" I, of course, accepted because well, I'm broke AF. 

Talked to the new lawyer, told him all the info, he seemed like a good guy and told me ""I get paid by TS Company but I work for you"" so that was reassuring. 

After a while, they sent me an email saying that they responded to a summons on my behalf, but that was all no other information about what I needed to do or anything like that. 

It has been since August of '19 since I received that email and have had no more contact since then even, though I emailed them telling them I was moving out of state on Jan 1, 2020. Nobody got back to me about that. 

I'm concerned because the documents said I defrauded them and they wanted like 500,000 dollars or something like that. I certainly don't have 500,000 dollars and I really don't want to go to jail over a job I took just to barely put dinner on the table.

74,"To give small context I have worked for my family's company since I was 16. Started sweeping floors, moved to maintenance at 17, moved to outside construction installing at 18 and got offered to take an office position(production manager) in one of our other branch locations at the age 25. I have enjoyed each position I have worked in and have gained a lot of experience in the industry. I'm now age 27 and coming up on the start of year 3 at this branch. Tonight I got a call from my father and he offered me a project manager position back at our home branch. We didnt talk too much detail about it, he is just wondering if I would have interest in it. 

Where I am lost is when I took the current position I am I was told it was a minimum of a 5 year deal here. And i still have stuff i am wanting to check off my personal plan to get done in my current position, but i always told myself since taking this position that i would take the first opportunity to go back home. Because family is home, and even though we all work together and we all up until this year all lived in the same neighborhood, we are big on family time. What is weighing on my quick decision is my best friend whom works for the same company took a job at the smaller branch about a year and half before I did, and since I moved here we have become even closer to each other, that i would hate to leave him up here by himself.

Am I qualified to take this new position... yes. Do I think others within the company has the same or better qualified for this position... yes. But I'm not sure when the next opportunity while be to get offered the next step on the ladder inside this company will be. (Yes as the owners kid, I want to take each step from the bottom, to hopefully take over some day. I find employees respect you better doing that than being a snot nosed kid with a high chair)

77,"In this fantasy land, “Dustin” and I are blushing for each other. We’re not *together* yet, but we’re at that stage when you know you like each other but you don’t want to admit it. You pretend not to like it when your friends make fun of you over this, but you know you love it and it makes you blush.

In reality, I have been there before with a couple people who turned out to be total disappointments. With Dustin, I’m not even close. He has a girlfriend, he seems to be quite happy with her, we aren’t super close with each other, and we only really talk through mutual friends.

In my fantasy land, he is a knight in shining armor. He is incomprehensibly smart, brave, kind, handsome, charming, and flawless. He is the prince. I am his damsel in distress.

I am cognizant of the fact that I am living in a delusional fantasy land. Here’s the thing. I’m ok with it. I am not making any reckless decisions over this. If I were to cash out on my credit card while buying a wedding dress, that would be a problem. I haven’t done anything like that. All I get out of this are blushes and daydreams. Even though it’s delusional, I don’t know if any harm is being done.

By the way, I think the reason I’m doing this is because I want to think someone like that exists. The real Dustin is probably a cool guy, but not necessarily like the prince I see him to be. This might be immature at worst, but no harm no foul.

The problem arises in my friends asking me about dating. I moved into Fantasy Land about six months ago. I live in a sugar castle there. I’m not interested in anyone else at this time.

Most people would be a little taken aback if they heard this. Maybe it’s one of those “I guess it’s not too bad if you really think about it kind of things,” but I personally might be a little concerned if someone else told me this about them.

When my friends try to set me up or ask me why I’m not interested in anyone, I don’t know what to say. I’m the only one in a squad of six girls who isn’t dating and isn’t interested in dating. And considering the social repercussions, I don’t know if honesty is the best policy.

79,"We are all in our teens so this is pretty juvenile, but the situation gave me an anxiety attack today so I really don’t know what to do!

My (female) friend and I drifted apart over the last few months. Around half a year ago, she used to like this guy, but they never ended up being a thing. They hooked up but were always into each other at different times — it never turned into anything serious. 

The guy is kind of a mutual friend, and over the past few months my friend has openly ridiculed and mocked him many times (in what I assume is a friendly way?) However, this led me to believe she had absolutely no interest in him. Recently, I started thinking he was kind of cute. I even asked the group “Hey, X is kind of cute, do you guys think he’d be into me?” and she was all like “HAHA do you want me to ask him?”

Anyway, we actually did end up hooking up. I didn’t tell anyone but she somehow found out. The guy didn’t end up being super into me, and said he didn’t feel like doing it again but we could still be friends. This was fine, but my female friend FREAKED. 

She accused me of being a toxic friend, of being insensitive, of betraying her. I had no idea this would be a violation, since, after all, they were never anything serious. She also decided that I “took advantage” of him because we were both intoxicated. The guy friend doesn’t feel that way at all, but my female friend started spreading rumours that I did. Now she and 2 other friends won’t talk to me. 

I have to see everyone involved in this situation every day and it’s really stressing me out. I just don’t know what to do! I don’t think I did anything wrong but I apologized anyway, however they all maintain what I did was “unforgivable.” Also I did not assault him wtf.

81,"I am a 31 year old male with Scheuermann's disease. As a child I complained about my back pain to my doctor who told me it was growing pains and to ignore it, later he lost his licence for coming in to work drunk but that’s beside the point. The long and short of it is that my spine began to curve and as it wasn’t treated as a child, now is fairly severe. 

The point of this all is that my spine has been more or less my only source of self consciousness in my life. In six months I’m getting married, which is good. But it means I will have to stand up in front of a lot of people, in profile, which is the most strikingly obvious way to see my back, and an angle I always struggle to avoid people seeing me at, to the point where I’ve rotated my desk at work so my spine is never side on to a coworker. 

My incredibly long winded question is this. Short of having surgery in the next few months (lol) I’m looking for a device I can wear to straighten my back. It doesn’t need to be healthy or necessarily safe. It will be worn for a few hours once and then thrown away. I’ve seen some sort of strapped things you can buy online, and I’ve even tried one but no matter how tight I pull the straps they don’t make any difference, if anything the tight straps pull my back into even more of a curve. Is there anyone out there who knows of some method I can use to avoid this issue? With my spine the way it is I’m struggling with the idea of even having the wedding. 

And to cover bases, no I cannot simply concentrate on standing up straight, I am able to straighten my back mostly but unless I put in constant struggle I cannot keep it that way, and if I’m not constantly thinking about it the posture drops without me noticing after a minute or so. Obviously I can’t do this during my wedding.",07Jan2020,1

I’m a very social person. However, I don’t tend to get along with people easily. My emotions also tend to get out of hand. Recently, as within two years, something changed. I got tired of being ignored by my peers and instead began to talk to myself inside my head. There are different variations of me. I don’t hear voices. One of me, takes over when things rile me up or get me sad. I make myself happy and immediately and able to regain control over my emotions and I’m able to instantly kill them. However in order for me to calm down I have to... well I can’t tell you guys the specific term for reasons. It’s where I make the conscious decision to change mes. It doesn’t always work though. I have to get into a specific state of mind. 

When I get sad, I cheer myself up. But it’s done in a strange manner. I have full on conversations with myself. It’s done mostly in my head in silence but whenever I get the chance I speak aloud (obviously nowhere near people). It’s hard to keep our thoughts separate. It gets confusing so that’s why I do it. Now, I can’t imagine ever being alone or being silent in my head. I’m satisfied with not talking to people and I don’t crave for attention. I don’t remember what it’s like to have your mind go silent or to ever feel alone because to me, I’m NEVER alone.

87,"For clarification, I have OCD, so I tend to overthink things, especially things that scare or disturb me, so I have been fixated on this a lot. Here goes:

There are a few times in my life where I beleive I may have encountered the subject of this post, the earliest being when I myself was around 12-15. I used to look for videos of people my own age, which I did not know was illegal. I have vague memories of some of the pictures and videos I found which I now beleive were CP. 

Later on, around the age of 17, I developed an interest in younger girls (as young as 12). I don't know why-maybe I'm a hebephile, or maybe I wanted something ""extreme"" to fantasize about. I never laid a hand on a child, and I never intentionally looked at illegal porn (mostly for fear of getting caught), but I did look at a lot of the ""barely legal"" and ""extra small"" kind, and sometimes on sketchy, third-party websites. I would also search google images for these kinds of photos, and even non-sexual photos of actual underage girls-ranging from Instagram photos of girls at my school to photos of nudist families. Basically, I'm scared that some of the things I looked at could have been CP. I never touched the deep web, and never went into anything that I thought was illegal, but I just don't know. 

The third thing is pop-ups. I know that, at least twice in my life, I have come across pop-ups or weird websites that contained images of children. I should have reported them, I know that now, but at the time I came across them I was just scared. I ""noped out"" and tried not to throw up. But I'm scared now that this somehow still counts. 

I don't know if i'm overthinking, or if I've done something unforgiveable. I hate myself for this, and I want to get help but I'm scared I'll get arrested or attacked. Maybe I deserve to, I just don't know. Any advice at all would be helpful.",07Jan2020,1

Okay so when I was 4 or 5, I used to visit my “dad” (I wasn’t his) his girlfriend apparently purposely kicked/pushed me into a table, causing me to fracture my chin. I still have the scar, it’s pretty small. My mum told me this a few years ago, she said there was evidence in court and she won the case and everything.

The thing is, I vaguely remember this day. I don’t remember his girlfriend being in the room at all. In fact I don’t think she was even at his house. I remember running around like a 4 year old, and simply tripping and falling into the table. I don’t remember anything before or after this.

I told my mum that I don’t remember this happening and she just said well you were 4, then she didn’t want to talk about it. Whenever I ask her about the past, there’s always a “I don’t wanna talk about it” response.

For a whole year I stayed in my hometown and didn't spend a dollar of it until my mom started finding random little things to become enraged about to the point that she said I now have the means to find my own place so she ""kicked me out"" for 2 months and I used those 2 months to travel.

A lot anger coming from my mom for no specific reasons at all. a lot of my brother trying to kiss ass to my mom now. I don't understand what they're gaining by isolating me so much now but it hurts. it really really really fucking hurts. and now amount of money is worth the level of guilt and isolation Im dealing with right now.

I don't know what is going on. I don't know why I feel as angry as I do sometime. I can't help myself. 

When I was a young girl, for no reason my dad would assume I said/did something bad and he would beat me in front of others. I got bullied at school, and when I went back to visit my home country I  was molested at age 11. My mom stood there and watched, sometimes even joined in, sometimes knowing I did absolutely nothing and still not telling my dad that. 

My dad passed away when I was 15 and my mom and my relationship improved. 

Since then I've been in a relationship with a predatory sociopath who raped me knowing I was molested at a young age. 

Then when I was finally ready to move on, I fell in love with a guy who left me for his religion right after doing sexual things with me. I had to be on anti-depressents from then on which I stopped using again. 

I finally realize my bestfriend is a narcissist and I think that for a lot of reasons. 

As for my mom, she become so codependent and terribly scared I'll leave her. So she's become nicer since my dad died. But sometimes, if she doesn't want me to do something, she'll use others, or lie to control my environment. And when I find out, I go ballistic and become verbally abusive and threaten to leave her all alone. 

I'm terribly afraid of what I'm becoming. Sometimes I wonder if I should just end my life. I'm so sick of this. I can't trust anyone.

93,"TW for this story which I'll get right into. I’m a uni student in a big city. I was at a party a few months ago hosted by another uni’s student union with a few friends. Two of my friends ended up hooking up and going home together early in the night, leaving a very small female acquaintance and me. It is I guess notable that I’m a lesbian but I was quite drunk and for some reason accepted the advances of an adult man (later found out he was 28, don't know what the hell he was doing at a uni party) and made out with him. I don’t remember why, I guess I was too drunk and just sloppy. I noticed later that my small female acquaintance (Kate, let’s call her) also made out with him later in the night. At the end of the night around 3am we’re standing outside the venue and the man comes up and says that he and a few buddies are going to drink at his place and asks if we’d like to join. God knows why but we said yes. I’d never say yes normally but I don’t remember being that drunk at this point. The night is however very, very fuzzy at points. So we end up at his flat and it turns out it’s just him, no buddies, and I instantly get a bad feeling. I have a suspicion he was at the party alone. He offers us drinks; we take water. I think he sat on my lap or something and the next thing I remember I’m sitting on his bed and Kate is in the bathroom. He pins me down and pulls down my shirt and starts licking my breasts and puts his hand down my pants. I froze completely, I couldn’t move at all. 

When Kate left the bathroom I expressed that we had to leave and we did manage to get out fairly quickly despite his protests. Almost immediately the man requested us on Facebook. I don’t know how he found us, I don’t remember giving him my name or number or anything. I declined but Kate accepted. 

The next week was one of the worst of my life. I skipped all my lectures and didn’t leave my room once and had too many panic attacks to count. I deal with anxiety but it’s quite under control, but that week it was just off the charts. 

Months have passed now and I try not to think about it much. But now I can’t stop. I feel so ashamed for agreeing to go with him or making out with him in the first place. I’m a lesbian, for fuck’s sake! I tried to tell friends what happened because they were worried about me but always changed the story and left out details to make it seem like I hadn’t just done something so incredibly stupid.

100,"(I'm still not sure if this is the right subreddit to post this; if it isn't, I would appreciate it if any of you could suggest other places where this should be posted in)

&amp;#x200B;

Well, I guess I'll give a little description of myself. Male, 21, 5'2"", haven't ever dated anyone irl and I'm a virgin, grew up sheltered, I'm introverted and I don't have many friends (I interchange friends with bff's).

&amp;#x200B;

As stated earlier, I've never dated irl but I recently got out of a long-distance relationship with a girl who lived in the other side of the world. I've known her ever since march, we started dating in may and we broke up the day before thanksgiving. Although we still have feelings for each other, there are various reasons why we separated. The first is that she is muslim and her parents are extremely religious (yes, we knew that the relationship wasn't gonna work but we couldn't help it). The second is that she lives far away and the time zones are a pain. And the final is that the only way for us to be together is if one of us sacrifices and converts in order to be together but we will be disowned by our family. I know she was very close to her family so I said she shouldn't but I'm also not religious, nor have any interests. I could fake it enough to marry but I find that disrespectful so I wouldn't do that. Anyways, we were both crazy for each other and we still are. Ever since we broke up, we've still been in contact (as much as we can because she's overworking herself atm) and I've felt even more lonely than what I've already been (since I've only really had her and a couple of close friends) and this loneliness is eating me up from the inside. I've always had sexual urges to begin with, and she need that, but after we separated, the urges have gotten worse. 

&amp;#x200B;

Originally, I made this account a couple months back in order to find things that would help me satisfy my sexual urges. At first I thought it was alright since I know masturbation is normal. Then it started getting a little out of hand and now it definitely is. I've ended up joining several nsfw subreddits in order to get off. But there's more; as going through these subreddits, I sometimes would encounter what that guy's would be packing down there as a result, I've became extremely self conscious about my size and my body. I've search through many sites, many pages, many posts, about my size; I would post whether my size was enough and whether a woman would be satisfied with my size. It's gotten to the point where I would post pics of my size, hoping for woman to say that they would love it... but instead, I get other guys commenting instead. Nothing wrong with it, it's just not my thing and as a result, I feel even worse about myself. I would post pics of my body because I've always been self conscious about it, and I would get responses from some woman, but many men. To think that I've gotten so fkd up about my size and my body that I've even considered paying woman for just their opinion (I know some ppl do it but I don't want to be like that). My now ex knew I was self conscious about my body and my size and she still accepted me as is. She knew my flaws and how messed up my mentality was but still loved me. I loved this girl with all of my heart and I don't think I'll be able to get over her any time soon. And now that she's gone... I've just keep looking down on myself; on my body. Many ppl have said that I've only posted because I was attention/ only want to show my size off... And it makes me feel awful because part of me now feels like they are right... There are rare occasions where some woman say that my size is alright and it puts my mind at ease. But later, I would still go back to that same thinking and look down upon myself. I just wanted to be accepted... and now that the one girl who loved and accepted me with all her heart is gone... I feel so empty. It also doesn't help that all my bff's have their own lives that they are taking care of, and that I rarely get to speak to them, let alone anyone. I don't know why I'm like this but I hate it so much. I don't know what to do or how to stop myself...",07Jan2020,1

103,"okay so not to air out dirty laundry online but I really need advice...

his mother and him have the SHITTIEST relationship of any of my friends (I tend to attract people with bad relationships with their parents? I don't know why.) because she's verbally abusive.

he's been in college for the past several years, struggling. he's stuck in this loop of negativity that I have tried to help him out of before, but it doesn't seem to work. He doesn't know conflict resolution, apparently.

they are always having screaming matches to the point of one or both of them calling the cops, or losing their voice (they had one earlier to the point that he lost his voice, so now I'm here. she came in to bitch at him and he launched a pillow at her and told her to close the door and get out.)

he's 21 (TWENTY-FUCKING-ONE.) and doesn't have his shit together. He's an adult, and can't get out of this awful home of his. he's just sinking deeper into negativity, and won't do anything to fix it.

and now i'm worried that he's clinging to me (in the not-so-good way), because when i'm here in the mornings his mom doesn't wake him up by screaming at him. but when i'm not here, she does. she berates him in any way that she can when I'm not around. I'm practically living here at this point given how often I come over and spend several nights in a row here.

I also feel it's too soon to get tied down in something ""serious"" (and i say ""serious"" with the quotations, because he shifts and switches subjects when anything relating to marriage is brought up; he is against having children whereas I'm all for it; he wanted serious by title apparently, but I want serious in every sense of the word.)

His friend group has become my friend group. His best friends and I vibe so well that now they're my best friends, too. They help me through shit (not regarding him, of course. Bias.) and keep it chill and drama-free. They're human, they don't hold themselves to impossible standards and they don't try to be something that they're not--the opposite of how my old friends were.

I'm going to start SU classes on the 27th and I'm moving into a dorm on the 24th. I can't. keep. doing. this. I'm sick of playing mediator. I will have studies, finals, all of that. I'm following my dream in school but I have to get my 2 years of general education through.

I love him, and we have amazing times together, but it's constantly overshadowed by all of this and it's to the point that nobody can help him get where he needs to be except for him.

And I know this to be true because I was once in that spot, too. It took me cutting most people out of my life and leaving school for a while to be in a good place again.

But his mother won't let him leave his classes for a break. He's burnt out. And the tension between those two is horrific. I'm always here to help somebody and people have said many times that I give great, deep advice, but this is just one battle that I don't have the strength to get through without lashing out at her (I'm also bipolar. The mood swings are insane.) I'm not a therapist, so I don't think I should be putting all of my effort into fixing their problems. I've helped him through a lot already...

But is this even worth the trouble and stress that it's causing me?

I want out.

What do I do?",07Jan2020,1
105,"Hey everybody, just need some advice on a situation I have.

I have a 22 year old sister who turns 23 in a couple weeks, she has done meth and has an alcohol problem and she recently dropped out of a college program that was very easy to complete (at least in my opinion). Not only was this program fully paid off for her, but she also was getting a check every month to go get the easy work done. It was simple enough, but she dropped out because of stress she said, she lived in an apartment with a deadbeat boyfriend who was doing nothing to try get a sustainable job, he also had 2 kids who were I think 4 and 5 that he wasn't associating with, never heard why not. Anywho, the relationship fell apart (and I don't really know the reason why) and now she's constantly talking about new guys and old guys she's already dated, she obviously wants a kid but my parents and even I have told her that a kid isn't going to make her situation any better.

She also received a 20000 dollar check which she was able to do anything with, she drank and did drugs with most of it. She's worked various jobs and has a lot of experience and I think she was able to get jobs back when she was younger because the market wasn't as competitive as it is now and she also got valedictorian in grade 8 but it was at a piece of shit school where the rest of her student peers were dropouts / barely went to school, I know this because i went to the same elementary for a bit.

Okay, now for my bit. I'm 18 yrs old in my second semester at university and like above it's fully paid off and i'm getting checks of 1600 every month, I've been primarily saving it and giving extra to my parents to help out (like 350 a month) I also got the 20000 dollar check and have a mustang and saved some of it also. I have terrible anxiety and I don't want to blame it on my family but I feel like I had to grow up fast, I've seen my mother break down numerous times because of my sister and my dad (my dad has also had opioid problems, he's a mechanic and still supports for us but it put us through a rough time.) 

So since i have bad anxiety and social anxiety I rarely try to talk to anybody else, I just mind my business and am trying to get my degree cause I feel it's the best thing to do. Since I don't have friends and don't do much really my sister always tells me I need to get out but all that's ever happened to her when she went out is bad shit, I don't see no problem with just chilling all the time, i'm an introvert and im perfectly fine being in my own company, maybe one day i'll break out but I don't feel the need, idk.. I just always feel like a piece of shit, i went through the same shit my sister did and I still try my best to good but what i do never feels enough.. my family all says i need to fix my attitude.. maybe i need a therapist haha.

I was on the masturbation subreddit, where a girl was looking for some inspiration to think about and I gave her some. She ended up asking me if I wanted to chat and I felt absolutely horrified. I got cold feet and did not get back.

There was another incident. Since December 2018 (not 2019) I have been SnapChatting with this one girl. We like each other, and I was super excited for our first meet. I had a fun time with her, but afterwards I felt a lot of guilt and shame.

The second time we met up (a few months ago), I was dreading it. I was horrified. *I was selling myself short. I don't want to be intimate with her, I will be indebted to her and it will be harder to break things off with her later. I could be doing far better than her. I am shooting myself in the foot by not getting someone better. I should go and get the ""hot"" girl instead!* (She's a lot heavier.) I wasn't into the cuddling when I arrived. I was so horrified at this, that when I was fingering her, she asked me if I wanted to fuck her, and I outright declined (not verbally, I just kept fingering/massaging her).

Here's a description of me:

* 24M, about to start working for 30 hours a week while I study at my university (two classes). I might get my degree by the time I'm 30 (long story).
* I have my own place, but am being financially supported by my parents while I go to school.
* White, 6'2"", 200lbs, long hair/beard. I'm extremely physically fit (half-marathoner) but I'm definitely no Chris Hemsworth or Dwayne Johnson.
* Ambivert, quite shy, struggles in social situations.
* Likes to run (obviously), play guitar, record music, Star Wars, engineering.
* Not adventurous. I would like to be, but don't know how or where to start.

Here's a description of her:

* 24F, works part-time at a minimum-wage job and is looking for something better/full-time. No school.
* Lives with her parents.
* White Hispanic, A bit shorter, really cute, could be considered BBW or SSBBW.
* Extremely shy.
* Does not have very many hobbies/interests, although we have similar music tastes.
* Not adventurous.

**Soo..... on paper, everything looks good, right?** We're the same age and in similar situations in life. We're both low-key and everything. But every time I'm setting something up with her, there's this voice that's **SCREAMING** in my head to back out of it, like the stuff in italics that I described earlier. The voice also screams at me that because she's kind of desperate dueto her weight and low-income, that I am taking unfair advantage of her.

110,"I know this sounds like a weird question, like “Just don’t” but let me explain.

When I was a kid, the mentality of “Don’t do anything to people you wouldn’t want them to do to you” was ingrained into my mind by my teachers. Now, basically everything that is empathy based I do on a basis of “What would I want someone to do if I was in that situation.?” And my way of helping people emotionally is by telling them that I relate to their problems and why I relate, and what I did.

Now I don’t mean that in a way of “Hey look at me, I want attention too for bad things that happened to me!”
I more so mean it in a way of “Hey look, I went through this too, this is how I got out of it, and what I’d suggest to you.” People don’t get that though.

I also have the issue of the fact that I really want to tell people I like about my thought processes. Like, when they tell me about something and it reminds me of something I did once I’ll tell them about it. 

People don’t tend to appreciate these things tho. They think I just try to make everything about myself, which I don’t. I really want to listen to other people, just the way my empathy works everything is reflected into me and how I’d feel, so I can understand them.

120,"I don’t wanna make this too long but I want everything to be clear because I’m not sure if I should still be feeling any type of emotions about something that happened so long ago although it was significant for me. 

So a while ago I was 13, almost 14 and I had been interested in this guy for ages, we liked each other and we were kind of on and off for the previous maybe 4-6 months and everything was going smoothly and in my opinion its quite a while for two people to be consistently interested in each other at that age. We finally got together after many cringey snapchat conversations and one day we were in his bedroom when things began to escalate really quickly and we ended up performing oral sex on each other, at the time I didn’t feel like I was pressured into it and it was completely consensual however this is where the bullshit starts, right afterwards he went it the room next door with my so called “best friend” and she gave him a had job, when I look back on it (I’m 17 now) I don’t realise how obvious things were, that I was being used &amp; my friend had completely betrayed me I just kinda brushed it off and ended things with him thinking it was nothing that I should stress myself over.

Unfortunately that’s not it, I really trusted him and we agreed that NO body would find out about what we had done with each other but unsurprisingly that didn’t last for very long, after the summer holidays he had told another girl about what me and him did and she was conveniently friends with a girl who disliked me so as you could imagine the rumour spread like a fire and soon enough people were making remarks at me and saying things to provoke and irritate me, it was typical high school situation where a “scandalous” rumour had come out and everyone was thriving off it. Looking back now I realised I was bullied for a few weeks and I had lost a few friends and from my perspective it was almost like people didn’t want to be associated with me and it was as though I had passed on my shame to them. 

After this point I began to hate school and even though the remarks stopped I still didn’t feel myself, I feel like I’m so much better now but even 3 years later I still don’t fully feel myself and I don’t know if this is wrong or right, I’ve never been as confident with boys and have a lot of self doubt and insecurity when it comes to trusting people. I maybe thought it was because I experienced something so traumatic related to relationships at such a young age but I just wanted to ask for some advice and maybe reasons it still effects my actions and emotions to this day.

I am a 43F.

There is an old family friend (86) that I am particularly close to, as are my parents 75-82 (although they aren't as close emotionally as me). They have always tried to do the right thing by her. Been friends, invited her over, helped a lot as she grew sick. She lives alone, no family, they have helped out a lot over the past few decades.

About 3 years ago, she put her house on the market for the umpteenth time, saying it was too much for her, she felt isolated in it and wanted to downsize. No one would buy it as it needed major renovations and she was asking too much for it. She became increasingly agitated about not being able to sell it, and fell into a depression. This was dangerous to her health, as she in suffering from untreated breast cancer and stomach cancer, her health was very frail. She knew my parents had investments, and she asked them to buy it from her. They agreed, saying that she could live in it rent free for as long as she wanted, and just had to pay utilities. They also stipulated that if she moved out for longer than 4 months, then she could not move back, as they would want to fix it up and rent it out as an income property. 

Well, they have renovated. She has been moved out for almost a year. The property is not yet rented out. 

Now my friend is dying. She has maybe 6 months left at most. I'm probably being overly generous with that time line. She refuses medical help, and wants nothing more than to die anywhere but in a hospital. 

I made a pact with her a long time ago that I would be with her when she died, take care of her, help her pass. I need to be living with her. She can't move to me, as she knows no one, more impiryantly, there is no real hospital or medical help of any kind where I live. If an emergency happened it would be a 2-4 hour drive, depending on what was wrong and what hospitals were currently open. 

So here's the problem. My father won't allow her to go back to her home. It's not about losing out on rental income, (she could afford to pay rent no problem) it's about her smoking. They don't want the renovations ruined by cigarette smoke (which had previously caused a lot of damage). Even though I said I would take her out on the balcony to smoke, he said this option was out of the question. 

I can't live where she is currently, it's about 200sq feet bachelor that is very run down. 

I can't afford to rent somewhere else for us, (I currently am living on about $19,000/year). And she doesn't want to move to a whole new place at this stage, unless it is to her old home (understandable). 

The final info is that this house in question is my house, in theory. They are getting it put in my name as part of my inheritance. Currently, they legally own it. Not sure if that is important info or not.

My opinion is that my father is being too stubborn in this. In my family, they only tend to help or show love for appearances sake, love doesn't really come through in times of difficulty. Love if it's convenient, and if it's not, oh well. I think this is a case of loving someone who is dying is messy and will require sacrifice, so best not to bother. 

Should I push my father to allow her and I to move in until she dies? I feel this is the right thing. We'd pay rent ($1000/month, abo), I'd take her outside to smoke. I'd leave the week after she passes and resume my life 4hours away, where I will still be paying rent. So it's not a concern that I will hang around in the house, and they can get new renters.

I just want to do the right thing, and want opinions before I stand up to my father on this issue. I know he has all the legal rights in the world to have things his way, I'm intending to ask him to consider having empathy for a dying friend. It will be an epic battle of a discussion.

124,"Well, title says it all and I probably shouldn't write this because I am upset and just had an argument about it a while ago. Maybe I'm seeing myself as spoilt and shouldn't write this either but whatever's your opinion I'd honestly appreciate it. I really just want to rant as well so here it goes.

I'm 18F and I'll be going to uni in September to study. My parents, especially my mother, forcefully wants me to do first year online since according to her, I'm a child and I will not survive.

And I quote ""You're a child, you act like you're 12 years old, you don't even act like a teenager and you're 18.""

""You're lazy."" Yes I'm lazy because I happen to leave a snack I eat beside my bed, falling asleep without remembering to throw it away.

""You can't cook."" I can cook breakfast if she's wondering, scrambled eggs? French toast? An omelette? Beans? Dinner? She thinks I can't cook dinner for myself because she always makes dinner. She had to go abroad and what else did I do than make dinner for myself? A pot of rice and some chicken. She said ""I don't know what you're talking about but you cannot cook that.""

""You don't clean your room."" A quick note is that we have a housekeeper so my room is clean most of the time. When it isn't..  my laundry is sitting there to be put away which is the biggest problem as I'm told. My father claims he has never seen me clean my room. Whenever I clean my room myself, he is never there or he just doesn't remember. What's funny is that my mother always sees me going in my room with a Swifter or broom and she just lays there laughing and not even defending me.

She's concerned about the fact how I'll be able to get up and make breakfast, go to class and make a schedule to study and among other things. I do all my homework, I do all my required projects for my subjects, I go to every single one of my current classes in upper school without missing any, I don't get into any trouble, I have a clean record without detentions and suspensions. I'm not a failing student. 

She doesn't want me calling them when I'm sick at uni which is something I don't know about. What should I do when I'm sick? Go back home? It's not far away and sure I'll notify them about it but they think I'll essentially die.

Oh my god.. I can't believe I actually have to say this. They don't THINK I BATHE. I don't know WHY they think so but I BOIL when I think about it. They know I fucking bathe, they know it's a necessity. They even laughed at this comment that ""I don't bathe"" and at this point I don't know if they're making fun of me or not. I honestly just rather die than continuing anything of what they're saying. One of the main reasons I just want to GET AWAY. After that comment I just walk away because it was utter nonsense at that point.

My mother has always been toxic in a way and even my sisters agree with it. We all do. She has insinuated that I am stupid, I can't do anything for myself, that I am an absolute dunce. And you don't know what that has done to me mentally. NOT ONCE I remember her motivating me. NOT ONCE I remember her praising me. I HAVE cried my eyes out wanting to scream with things she has said to me before.

 She has ALWAYS complained about me and that I make her go insane when my other sister does the same thing. It just ruins me and I'd rather the world to just end tomorrow. WHICH IS WHY I WANT to atleast get away from her when I go to uni. I've always been treated the least favourite and I know for sure I'm the least favourite. No one has to say so so it's very obvious. I can't deal with it anymore. Maybe it's because I'm a middle child that I get treated like shit? Or maybe I'm spoilt and I should act like an adult and not a ""12 yr old?"" Maybe I am after all a complete idiot?

God I'm probably too upset to write this but that's my rant.. any advice as to what to do or to handle anything at all..?",07Jan2020,1

Today is 1/6/20 and Jamboree takes place in June or July of 2021. I'm not sure how willing I'll be for a scouting event by then.

I don't want to do it because scouting seems to enjoy shoving religion down your throat and as an atheist I dislike this. Second is I don't like camping in general as I prefer a soft bed over a cot.

127,"Using a throwaway acct bc this contains some info i dont want to use on my main.


In June and July I was sent to a teenage mental health program in New Jersey because of my struggles with depression and anxiety. It wasnt a mental hospital, it was a day program that replaced school for a period of time. My favorite part of it was mainly the other teens there. Especially one guy, Hayden. He was kind and cheery despite his struggles with ADHD and bipolar disorder and we made fast friends. He gave me good advice and we hung out a lot during the program. However because of its strict rules, we were not allowed to get the contact info or even last names of the other people there until either our last day or their last day. All i know is that his last initial is G. He was scheduled to leave in late June because he was moving to Utah. We had talked about how we’d stay in touch after he moved even though it was halfway across the country. I’m still in touch with some friends from there, but Hayden didn’t show up to his last day of the program. I guess he’d moved earlier than he’d planned or something. I tried asking the staff there if i could get in contact with him but they said it would be illegal for them to give out identifying information of a previous patient.

So a little background on this thing today. I went back to school and just about everything was all good before my 5th period started. I was vibing with a friend when one of his classmates whispered in his ear and pointed at me. After a few confused glances he said “if you’re not gonna tell her I will” he proceeded to give me the weirdest look and say “hi I think you’re pretty”. Now I kinda shrugged it off because I was gonna be late to class and stuff. My school has a weight room and me and my other friend were gonna walk home together after we worked out. The guy who called me pretty earlier followed my friend around the weight room constantly asking for my name and stuff telling him I was cute and “hot”. This was when I began to kinda get concerned because my friend would come up to me and tell me everything that happened. We ended up leaving because we both got extremely tired of his bull crap and just wanted to go home. Now I met a guy who lives 300 miles away from me and we ended up starting an LDR. He asked me how my day went and now I’m really scared to tell him about what happened because I don’t want him panicking over me getting hit on.",07Jan2020,1
130,"I posted here a few weeks ago about my situation. Basically, I [M20] matched with a girl [F20] I know through a small club at my university. We chatted for a little bit on the app and I ended up asking her to lunch. She said yes but on the whole it sounded like she wasn’t super interested in it. Since it was the end of the semester, I said we could figure it out closer to when we were back from break, and break is almost over. Shortly after this, we were both at a party where someone who was into her but had been rejected had a convo with her and told me she “didn’t know what to think of me asking her” and that she wasn’t really interested.

Whether that’s true or not it hit me, and since we didn’t really text before matching, we haven’t talked over break. At this point I’m debating if it’s even worth going for it. My friend said that I should just ignore it and pretend like our match never happened, while someone else suggested I send her a text telling her not to worry about the whole matching and asking out thing. Another person told me to go for it.

I guess I could have a shot and there’s no harm in trying, but I’ve been in this situation before and it sucked. I asked out a girl in the same club to coffee last year, and she agreed but politely rejected me afterward. It made being a part of a club I love difficult, and while I’ve gotten over that it can still be awkward at times. I just don’t know if I want to start off the semester feeling sad or awkward. It’s not like I had a huge crush or anything. I’m also basing all of this on her response to me asking her, which isn’t going to tell me everything. I know technically there was nothing wrong with me asking since we matched, but I also don’t want to become the guy who asks out every girl in this club I’m in. I’m just not sure what I should do

TL;DR: I matched with a girl I know through a small club on Tinder and asked her out before our winter break. Her reaction and things I’ve heard from others are making me question if it’s worth it to pursue her when it could cause awkwardness and unnecessary pain",07Jan2020,1
131," Hi r/Advice, one of my best friends had a severe mental breakdown a few months ago; it could have been subtly developing over months, but it rapidly worsened over the course of about 5 days—he was eventually baker acted by one of his fraternity brothers. In the ""health center"", he was shaking his head at paintings for 10 minutes at a time, would only let you speak to him if you were back-to-back, he couldn't sign any forms because he was so out of it, wouldn't stop pacing, etc. He went home for a few months but it's the beginning of the spring semester (undergrad students) so he ran away from home and took a bus back up to our apartment (me and 2 other roommates are now in an uncomfortable position). I have no idea how, but he kept himself together enough to convince the dean that he was good enough to enroll in classes. He is currently in our living room standing on the table with his eyes wide open and won't respond to us, he just keeps playing the same song on repeat (his mental state fluctuates from seemingly mild delusion to full psychosis).

**Now for the legal part:** he is 20 years old therefore he is not legally under his parents' control. He is too stubborn to go back home and insists that he is fine, but he is definitely *very* off. I'm worried he'll get in trouble since I don't think he has the capacity to make good decisions let alone pass classes. His parents did not get him to sign over power of attorney, healthcare proxy, or HIPAA medical release forms; I tried to get him to sign over medical release forms when he was baker acted but he could not understand us nor could remember his mom's name and eventually scribbled *my* name \[incorrectly\] on the address line, which the facility would not accept. I'm not sure why his parents didn't push the forms on him while he was at home or take him to get a full psychiatric evaluation, but I am questioning his parent's competency at this point. What are my options? I will try to convince him to sign the forms but it is unlikely. Is there any way for his parents or I to do something despite him being an adult? Should I go to the university and tell them what's going on, that way he might be more willing to go home and get help since he wouldn't be able to attend school? I don't want to baker act him again if I can help it because his mental state worsened in the facility.

**The mental health part for those of you who may have experience/knowledge of this:** He hasn't been diagnosed because his mother is not proactive about the situation (believes in homeopathic remedies and is likely in denial about her son's mental health), but we think his behavior aligns most with schizophrenia or extreme bipolar disorder. He told me that he talks to himself in his head and he makes odd movements with his head/body for seemingly no reason—you can tell when he is talking to himself because he makes expressions and head movements as if in a conversation, or laughs to himself at inappropriate times. He doesn't give a shit about his parents because he thinks they are ""holding him down"" since he is unable to see that they are trying to do what's best for him. I understand this to an extent, but he clams up and shrugs in response to every question about his mental health which suggests some sort of denial about his condition. But, to be fair, he isnt really capable of much conversation at all—basic responses are the most he's capable of, but sometimes he can flick a switch and answer more complex questions, such as what classes he will be taking (but it seems like it takes relatively a lot of time/mental energy to develop these responses). He is also extremely narcissistic and delusional which do not mix well—sometimes he watches a movie or listens to a song and replies to it as though he thinks he is in the movie/song, or that the person is talking to/about him. He also thinks in a way that is so abstract that it is no longer rooted in reality—body language or tone conveys an interpreted meaning to him that is totally different than the intended meaning in reality. This has turned him into somewhat of a prick and gotten him in trouble before as he has tried kissing girls out of nowhere and recently ""felt up"" my friend while sitting next to her on a couch. I confronted him about the latter and he kept repeating rap lyrics about ""all girls are the same"" and how ""bitches are bitches"". He just didn't care... most of the time it's like talking to a brick wall. I know this might sound ridiculous and it definitely *is* totally bizarre, but I don't know what to do and I really need some help on how to handle this because nobody in my life has been particularly helpful about this and his parents have fallen short.

He is my best friend of 15 years and I hate seeing him like this. I want him to get help but am unsure of how to do it since he is so unwilling and persistent on going back to school. At this point it is very taxing on me and my roommates, and I don't think I can go into this semester carrying this mental weight. I can't help him myself and it would be best for everyone if he got diagnosed and would seek help, but he is apparently intent on making life harder for everybody, including himself. Any help or advice is greatly appreciated, and let me know if there are any other subreddits or resources that may be able to better help me with the situation or offer a potential diagnosis based on my description. Thank you.",07Jan2020,1

Option #1...
I am currently about to start classes for a Bachelor Degree in History or Criminal Justice 30-40k in student loans, after in 3-4 years I want to apply for the Air Force as an Officer and become a pilot, with that it is a 8-10 year commitment but pays for all of the flying which averages 40-50k. 

Option #2...
I pay for flying out of pocket which would cost 40-45k but I would be flying sooner and not have to pay for a Bachelor degree which costs about 30-40k in student loans. 

Which option would you go with? I’m stuck between doing my degree and hoping I get selected for a pilot slot which is competitive and hard to do. Or I can save up for a year and pay out of pocket for flying right now.

146,"So on NYE I made a really stupid mistake. I was at this bar drinking way too much and I randomly hooked up with this guy, we ended up back at his place and we had sex. 

Couple days back I get a text from ""Mark,"" asking me if I want to go out again. Honestly it took me a while to remember that was his name. I don't remember adding him as a contact. I texted back, said I had fun but was too busy with work (I was trying to be polite). But then he sent me 3 pictures, of me, naked, lying down in his bed and posing for him. I don't remember that at all, but I'm looking right at the camera. He keeps texting me like, 'oh looks like you had a good time.'

I'm terrified this is turning into some kind of blackmail. He knows my first name and cell number, but if I google my number nothing identifying comes up. Can he find me somehow by searching my face? I don't really know what to do. I CANNOT let anything get out because of my job.",07Jan2020,1

I can’t exactly start going through someone’s bag. Plus i really dont want to be dealing with this man. He’s nice on the surface but you never know with people like this. 

This is just a passive job (in a huge retail supermarket) as i study that i’ll be out of real soon and i dont want to be arguing with old drunk people. I’m really more angry with the coworker for telling me than i am for the guy stealing. She found out because another customer told her.

It was great at the start but it started to become toxic, and he’d become controlling and mean. I feel like i gave him lots of chances to improve but it just kept getting worse and worse. I decided to break up with him.

About two weeks after the breakup, we started talking again and we decided we should be just friends. I said that we could only hang out in group settings and on occasion. We’ve already hung out a couple times with our mutual friends and it’s been perfectly fine. 

He said that he’s almost gotten over me, but since the last time we’ve hung out, he’s started to text me more and tonight he called me asking for me back. He says that he loves me and will go through hell if he can’t get back with me. I feel like he’s guilt tripping me a bit. We both started crying on the phone. 

I feel awful that I don’t have feelings for him anymore and I keep telling him that he should move on. I think that we shouldn’t talk for a few days so he can have some space. I want him to move on and stop texting me for right now. I’m mentally exhausted.

154,"This may be long and I'm sorry. This may also be TRIGGERING as it deals with sexual abuse.

My sister is over a decade older than me and my brother is about 11 months younger than her. They grew up together and obviously I was not around in their earlier years. I know that my sister was rebellious and my dad was in the army and was strict with her and they fought a lot when she was a teenager. She got pregnant at 16 left home, moving several states away. I barely knew her during this time but when I was around 11 she moved back to the area and she and I became close. She was my best friend despite the age difference and her son and I pretty much grew up together as we were only 3 years apart.

The problems started when she visited a hypnotherapist. This was sometime when I was in high school. Under hypnosis, she had 'memories' come back of her being sexually abused by our father for the first 12 years of her life. After this she called cps and tried to get me taken away from my parents and she put her son in therapy because, apparently, an female relative in the other state sexually abused him, though he's told me he doesn't think this really happened. This was all years ago and caused a lot of issues in the family but my dad has since passed away and the subject had not been mentioned in years.

Until the day before Christmas. My sister texted me and told me she had suddenly remembered the first 12 years of her life and all the horrible things BOTH of our parents apparently did to her. According to her, my dad was abusing her and my brother, my mom knew all about it and did nothing and in fact called my sister a slut for sleeping with her husband. She's told me she got pregnant by our father 3 times before the age of 11 and was forced to have coat hanger abortions performed by our parents. Lots of horrible accusations.

But the thing is, I don't believe her. She has a history of mental illness and drug abuse. MULTIPLE people who were around during that time say these things never happened, including my brother who was, by her word, also a victim. My sister has told me that they grew up like twins, were always together, inseparable. But he knows nothing? He's blocking it out like she used to, that's her answer to why he doesn't remember.

Since Christmas my sister has sent novel length texts every few days to me, my mother and my brother with her memories and accusations. Every time it's something worse and more disturbing and disgusting. These stories are impossible for me to believe. I didn't believe them in high school and I really don't now that I'm 20 years older.

I've said nothing in response to her except that I hope she gets the help she needs, preferably from a professional. None of us want to talk to her anymore because of this. But I'm very concerned about her mental state, she has self injured before and had claimed to be suicidal in the past. She very recently adopted her grandchildren and I'm worried about them being with her in this state.

I just don't know what to do, what to even say to her. I'm lost. Any help would be appreciated. Sorry for any mistakes.",07Jan2020,1

158,"So I can probably write up a whole story about this but I do not have the time or patience so I will try to be as detailed as possible.  

My best friend, we'll call her Jen, has been in a long term relationship relationship with her fiance for about 6 years and they recently agreed to get married this upcoming March. The problem is that she had an affair since November till just recently. The guy she's been seeing is wonderful and they both seem perfect for each other (romantically,  sexually,  playful), jen shares a lot with me. From what I know,  she fell in love.  But in the end she broke it off to be with her fiance. 

Which is totally fine but she's been having issues with her fiance that she believes will get better if ""she works hard enough"". I trust Jen but I'm also worried for her. She seems unstable lately and I do not know what she is mentally going through. All I know is that she is desperate to get married. I think its guilt but she says that she doesn't regret the affair. It opened her eyes to seeing what love can truly look like. So now I think she is only staying with her fiance because they have history and she does not want to let that go down the drain. Once again, I understand the decision. 

I told her that she should postpone the wedding but she is not budging. I also asked her if she could always keep her affair a secret from her soon to be husband but she says that she will never tell him.  I don't think that's healthy.  I am not rooting for the guy she had the affair with but I dont think one person can just get married when she was just having an affair so recently. 

As her friend. I am not sure if I should just let her be, or try to push her to see the reality of things. I feel useless as her friend.  Not sure what I can do,  and now I feel like there isn't anything I can do for her.",07Jan2020,1
159,"This is a long story and I’m sure there are going to be missing gaps in my story. I’m going to try and get all the details that I deem are necessary!

Essentially, my mom has been quite disrespectful as of late. I would say it started around 6-7 months ago when I proposed to my girlfriend. I had actually approach both of my parents before doing so and as well as my girlfriend’s parents, everybody was onboard but my mom had a condition to it. 

She wanted us to have a big wedding to celebrate with everybody, so this is fine because my dad says he’ll be happy to finance it alongside my fiancé’s parents. Anywho, fast forward to today. She’s very snappy and very toxic. I’ve noticed that during the holidays, she’s always looking to try and not include my fiancé in family photos or family gatherings. ALTHOUGH, she hasn’t been like this prior to my engagement. My fiancé and I have been together for 6 years.

I’ve noticed that if I mention that I need to go pick up my fiancé from work or pick her up from the mall after a day with her girls, my mom will immediately reply “why? Why can’t she make her way on her own?” I find it incredibly rude in the tone she’s saying it. I’ve expressed this to my mother as well by saying “why are you saying it so rudely?” And she’ll just stay silent. Additionally, I’ve gotten upset with her when I get fed up with her attitude, so I’ll tell her to stop being so disrespectful to me. Then her simple reply is “why are you being so rude? Is it because you and your fiancé are arguing? That must be it. Stop being so rude” and I’ll tell her “my fiancé and I are fine and you’re just being extremely disrespectful”. 

There is a plethora of things she does and I can go on all day. I’m just wondering what would be the appropriate action to take to sort of extinguish this. I don’t want to resort to it, but I was thinking just completely cutting her off. I have no problems with my father but my mother is filled with hate and toxicity. She’s constantly bringing my self esteem down and commenting on things I do.

160,"Hey r/Advice, I'm in a bit of a bind. 

**tl;dr:** Once edgy teen, now not an amazing person but trying to get better. Two people have suggested I seek therapy, but in emotionally heated moments. Nobody in my family, nor friends have noted anything wrong with me. Should I take it seriously? 

I'm 20 years old, and this is a throwaway for obvious reasons. Since going off to college, many of my personal relationships have changed (as can be expected at this stage of life).

In my adolescence, I was a bit of an edgelord and was mean in general, you know the archetype. Trump 2016, hitler did nothing wrong, that kind of sophomoric meme culture shock content. 

Sometime last year my then-girlfriend of two years broke up with me after a rather toxic relationship, with the toxicity mostly being on my end. I was emotionally manipulative on account of my own insecurity, and did not treat her with respect. 

I did a bit of soul searching in the period after that, and have since worked on making myself a better person, especially in my treatment of other people who I care about, and to grow and improve as a person in general. When she broke up with me, she had suggested that I seek professional help- which I discounted as unnecessary at the time, and simply a bit of language she used out of spite. 

A month or so ago, a close-ish friend had decided to cut ties with me out of the blue, and while they didn't explain why, I could reasonably guess that I was still not as good of a person I had wished to be and had hurt them in some way- I had expressed I was sorry, and personally decided I should take this as a sign that I shouldn't waver in my efforts to be a better person.   


Today, I had contacted the now-no-longer-friend again for a small favor, details upon request, in which I apologized for, and explained the reason for my contact. While they did not seem to have an issue with the request, they pointed out my apology.  


**ME:** Sorry for where my behavior had made you upset *(in hindsight this apology might have suggested it was their fault for getting upset which is not the case)*  
**exFriend:** That's hilarious. You're f-'ed in the head and you don't even know it.

To which I apologized again and clarified that I did not mean it was their fault for being upset- and tried to make clear that the apology was genuine. 

They then said ""You need professional help"", which makes it the second time somebody had suggested this to me. They seemed rather agitated when they had told me this. 

Should I take this as genuine advice, or simply just as them lashing out at me because they were upset? Both of these situations were quite emotionally charged.  Nobody in my family has suggested I was mentally unwell, and none of my other friends have either. I have many friends, all who seem to enjoy my company, so I suppose I cannot be particularly unhinged and unpleasant to be around.",07Jan2020,1
161,"Background: A few years ago when I had some time on my hands, a friend asked for help with his side business and I agreed. Fast forward to 3 years later, I’m still helping out but now I have a full time job and it’s getting busy.

My friend has been very nice, saying that my own work comes first etc etc and not to worry if I cannot attend meetings (once a month) or commit to helping out on weekends (the nature of the business requires time on weekends and weekday nights). But sometimes it’s not that I don’t have time to do it, I do, but I would rather be at home watching Netflix or working on my other hobbies. And the I feel guilty for not helping out. I have a few pending tasks that I will find some time to complete but after that I really want to stop helping out.

How do I do that in a way that will still preserve our friendship? I know he will say ‘don’t worry, just help out when you can’ but I would prefer a clean cut so I don’t have the guilt of not helping out when I do have time, but don’t feel like it.

To make matters worse, his business has hit a rough patch and it makes it even harder for me to tell him I want to quit. I don’t want him to feel abandoned.

I’ve done some analysing on this and I think this guilt and feeling bad stems from me making a prior commitment to help out but now I feel like I’m renegading on that commitment. 

How do I proceed? People who have been in this position before, either as the breaker or the breakee (not sure if that is a word) how did you do it/handle it? Help!

TL;DR I want to stop helping my friend with his business but don’t know how to do it in a way that will preserve our friendship.",07Jan2020,1
162,"There’s this guy I was finally happy he was out of my life and now almost 2 years later he’s texting me. He’s not a horrible person but his lifestyle choices and views don’t agree with me. I don’t care what he does, I’m no bigot, I just happen to be a straight man who doesn’t feel comfortable walking around with a cross dresser. He never fully dressed up, more than once, just a few woman’s accessories. And the one time he was dressed up he literally looked like a man in drag and was dressed like a street walker. I told him no more of that and I didn’t see him dressed up ever again. He’s not like most cross dressers, he does a half ass job dressing up. That’s not really the problem, even when he dressed up I still went with him and we had a fun day. Another problem was his driving, he’s going to get himself shot one of these day or run someone over. Also his political and religious views clash with mine along with his views on pretty much everything. So in short, we’re too different for each other. He needs like minded friends, not someone who he just ends up in arguments with. Only reason I hung out with as much as I did, and it was like 4 years we were friends, I just don’t like telling people no. I didn’t want to hurt his feelings. Then one day when I did say no, I had other plans, he stopped texting me. At first I thought what an immature reason to stop texting, just because I turned down a beach trip, then after a few more months I thought to myself, wait a minute, I’m finally free. So now he’s back and I don’t know what to say if he starts asking if I want to hang out. My hope is after the first no he stops texting me again for 2 years.",07Jan2020,1
163,"I'm currently living with a friend of mine, but he'll be leaving the country to go work in another one next month, leaving me with the apartment. In his words, he's not planning to come back. Now the place we live in is a 2 bedrooms apartment, but we actually end up paying about the same price as a 1 bedroom for it so I currently have no plans to move out or have another roommate after he leaves, but of course that could change in the future as life happens.

He's sold a few things and is planning to move a few as well. However, despite not planning to come back he's asked me if I could keep the rest of his stuff ""long term"" in case his plans really didn't work out. His saying this makes me believe he doesn't entirely believe he'll stay, but that's another topic. He was also planning to leave some stuff in storage, but after looking at pricing, he actually asked me if I'd mind keeping it for him for a price instead.

So I'm looking for advice on these two points, acting as safe keeper or as storage basically. I'm not sure if he'll be asking for both or just one. Ideally I'd rather pay him for the few things I want to keep such as appliances and furniture so that they're actually mine and not his, and forget about the rest as that would be more straightforward. If I were to keep his things instead it would create a weird situation where I would have his stuff but not really own it, because if he did come back he'd want to have it back. I did ask what if I wanted to get rid of some things, and he replied I was free to do so, but obviously his reply'd be different if I got rid of *all* his things. As for acting as storage, he'd obviously want to pay me a smaller sum than what actual storage costs. However it indirectly costs me to keep his things as well since it prevents me from moving in a new roommate who would need the space, adds to the clutter, as well as work required were I to move elsewhere. In fact if he were to pay me the same price as storage, it wouldn't even cover a third of the additional cost I'd be paying by being the sole payer.

So before I talk about the spreading info. , I need to talk about what it's about. So I like this girl (I am also female, she is straight I am lesbian). I told a few friends that are also friends with her to help me out. My friends are very supportive and helped me out and I told her. She said she still wanted to be friends but (of course) told me she's straight. (In this I'll call my crush R)

Now let's talk about the spreading info. So one of these friends (I'll call them B), was talking to someone else (Who I'll call D). B (Who I trust- well trusted) apparently told D that I liked R and that I was a lesbian. D already knew I was somewhat gay. D then told my sister (Who I'll call L) about this. L told D that they should not be saying any of this because it isn't their business, but D then replied back with that they don't care that it is my business. L tells me everything that happens, so I text D about it. I tell them about me hearing it. D says they don't remember telling anyone and that they didn't. D then sends a conversation I had with B about liking R. I told her B should've not sent that because it is my personal info. and she agrees, but goes and tells others about it. D asks me who I heard it from but I didn't tell her because I don't like using people's names, and L told me to not use their name.

I also text B, but she hasn't opened my message yet. I told some people about it and if they are to hear about it for them to let me know. If this problem escalates, I plan on talking to a school counselor about it possibly but would rather not to. I also want to solve this issue without my mom finding out because I'm not ready to tell her I'm gay. What should I do and how should I do it? Thank you.",07Jan2020,1

I study BBL which is 4 days work 1 days school, I have been working for 6 months now at this company, I work in the logistics where we always have to lift heavy stuff but while I believe the rule are something like max 23kgs, it's is still to much for my back so after some heavy lifting for a couple of month I start to feel pain in my back so I go to my GP for advice the GP (Not my normal GP, he was off that day) said that my back is twisted and is not straight so I got a paper to request for a physiotherapy session.  


I have been to the session 8 times now and I'm still not feeling any better in fact I'm feeling worse because before new years I have to move an box to another pallets cause the pallet is not to requirement of the customer (Customer want it on a EUR pallets, while the stuff was on another pallets) So it was somewhere around 3+4000kgs together, it was also not the first time I have to do this *alone*, I have to do this before but that was around 2 Ton.  


So now I'm having a lot of back pain and it hurt to move or even lie down on my bed to sleep, I been of work for a weeks now to celebrate new year and taking some rest. Even though I say celebrating new year, it was more of laying in bed all days.  


 Back to the title: A week ago when I have to go to work as usual I already start having a lot of back pain right after I woke up, did not think much of it thinking it just me sleeping in a bad position, So when I get to my work that day we got an order where we have to pick up small stuff which is very light but it require you to squat down, a lot, we got some where around 9000 individual type of items in total which is then split in to a order which is somewhere around 40 to 300+ type of items which in turn can also be from 1 to 40+ items so thing add up pretty fast. So I just got to my work as usual and began picking stuff which are above me(1.84m) and then squat down to pick up stuff that is low to the ground, after doing that a couple time I already start to feel more pain in my back then in the morning and I starting gripping on stuff to help me get down and get up. So after doing for 3 hours, I feel pain with every movement I do. So to not make thing worse I go to my boss who was just walking around and ask to leave cause of my back, my boss then proceeds to speak to me in a passive aggressive tone saying that I look completely fine to him and that I was just lying straight to his face, he say that since he can't hold me at work (law) I can just go back home but he added that if my back hurt I should got to the hospital not laying on my sofa doing nothing(I never said I was going to lay on the sofa). While biking to home (I'm Dutch so yea..) hurt like something is piercing my back I still got home and the did get some rest, but after that day everything hurt, walking, sitting or even lying down.  


I will get the physiotherapy session again tomorrow after two week of not having it because of the vacation (New year+Christmas) and I will go to my GP again to get a new paper for hospital check to see if anything is really bad or not. And I have give my school a notice for transitioning to another stuff since this is to heavy/stressing for my body. But there is another problem, my father, he would not really believe me that I have back pain because I don't really show it most of the time I just endure it.  


So my question is what should I do next? my boss would not believe me that I a have a back problem. and how should I convince my father? should I just bring him another GP note?

184,"So it all started about a year ago, when my friend started to smoke weed more and more, I'd also smoke sometimes but I've gotten to like 1-2 times a week, but he, he's been baked for 6 months straight now, and I never thought I'd say this(because I'm pro cannabis and I think it has a lot of benefits)but I think it started to affect him a lot. Like he became more and more stupid, and I don't mean that in a bad way, just in the way that he can't communicate the same way again,he's just so distant sometimes, like spaces out even when he's not high. 

And what really worries me is that he found this ""law of attraction"" thing on the internet, and now he's been obsessed with it. He's been into it for like 4 months now but I've never given much thought tho. I thought its just a theory, or just an idea of some sort, no biggie, but he actually believes that if he thinks hard enough of something, it will really happen to him. And this started to affect his life, he doesn't want to start college anymore, because he's 100% certain (his words), that he's gonna be a millionaire, and he's gonna buy his mother a trip in the Paris. He began to really scare me, he's way too convinced that he knows the way of the universe, and what's really more disgusting is that there are a lot of people who are blinded by videos like this, like what the actual fuck!? It's like a whole ""cult"" on the internet where everyone talks in scientific terms without any fucking clue what they are talking about. He tried to convince me that this exists and all, he began telling me the ""scientific"" part from this story, that every object in the universe vibrates and if we vibrate on the same frequency as it we'll pull each other close. He asked me if I ever got a call from  someone I thought about a few minutes ago, and that that is not a coincidence, that's the ""universe"". He also told me that he's 100% certain he's gonna find money on his windshield at sometime, more stupid things like this. 

Now the worse part is that I try to help him and explain to him that its not so good to put your future in the ""law of attraction"", and its better to be skeptical and accept that there might be a chance to be wrong. But no, no no no, he PITIES ME, HE LOOKS AT ME WITH PITY. LIKE POOR ME FOR NOT SEEING THE TRUE COLOR OF THE UNIVERSE. I was originally very angry and we started to argue a lot but I really want to help him because he wasn't like this. I really think he might be suffering from some sort of psychosis or some shit. Obviously when I try to tell him to get help he gets annoyed like fuck.(i'd probably do the same)

I’ve been working at this job for almost 2 months now and she caught my eye when I first saw her. I get the feeling she might feel something for me, but I’m not sure.

She brought some papers to my office today, something that is usually done by other people, not her and I think I saw her looking at my fingers today, possibly for a ring. There have been other things I’ve noticed, like she laughs at every corny joke I make and even sings my name when she sees me despite us barely having said anything to each other. I’ve never seen her sing anyone else’s name.

Anyway, I’d like to get a chance to know more about her, possibly even hang out with her if possible. I just don’t know the best way to go about doing any of this.

I work in IT and have engagement with her from time to time for computer related stuff. She works in the lab in the back of our building. I can shift my lunch hours to be with hers, but I’ve never seen her go to lunch or where she likes to go. I’ve made friends in the past by going to lunch with them, but it happened mostly because we happened to have the same lunch times. I have no idea how to time mine at the same time as hers since I don’t know her time and I think it’d be creepy to ask when she goes to lunch.

Anyone have any advice for me? Thank you.",07Jan2020,1

Back story: Husband of 6yrs(together 10) walked out on us about 3wks ago and I(25f) was left to scramble(am still scrambling) financially and the future does not look stable for me and my kids. I don't see how I will be able to hold a job and go to school at the same time. Taking off from school is not an option because they help me with daycare but I also need some sort of income for expenses. I don't see how I'll even be able to work since I have no one to reliably watch my kids during that time(dumb teenage me flew from CA to LA for my husband) My family has helped me so much with the money aspect but I can't keep asking them for money I can't repay.

192,"So I play in a local band. In fact, I’m basically the ringleader—lead singer, lead guitarist and I write all the songs, the practices are all at my house, I’ve booked all the shows, etc. since we started the band about 7 months ago it’s just been me, my boyfriend and our two other friends. We haven’t recorded an album yet or anything but we’ve recorded a few tracks, and played many local shows, and I take it seriously.

Well I have this new friend and she asked me if she could come to a practice and play her banjo. I didn’t know what to say and so I panicked and said she could play on one song. Then when she actually got to the practice I felt kinda bad that she’d have to sit out for the rest of the songs so I tried to include her by saying she could play on all the songs. Stupid, I know. But honestly, I was also kind of drunk...off of beer that she brought. :/ Then she started asking if she was going to be playing live with us, looking super eager like she really wanted to, and I blurted our ‘sure, yeah,’ and invited her to join the band. I wish I could say it wasn’t my fault, that she pushed herself in, but at the end of the day it was me doing the pushing as a result of my nervous panicking. I never wanted her in the band, not even for one second, and I definitely don’t want a banjo player no matter who it is. Plus, I didn’t even get to ask the other band members how they felt about it (although the drummer is her best friend so I know he’s happy she’s in). My boyfriend admitted to me he’s not happy about it, and I literally just texted the bassist a couple minutes ago asking her thoughts. I never intended to add someone to the band now or ever. It just feels so weird and wrong.

But anyway, I made it even worse and harder to undo. This is also something I tend to do as a result of panicking, I dig my own hole deeper on purpose. I know it makes no sense. But I think it’s a way of trying to reassure myself that the way things are going is okay. But anyway, I made a new band group chat with her, posted pictures of her on our social media announcing a new band member, and yeah, it’s really set in stone now. Ugh. It’s my fault.

I’m realizing now that this is an unnecessary stressor on us all. She will have to learn all the songs. She will have to get a mic for her banjo. It will change the sound, and since I haven’t even heard her banjo with a mic yet, I don’t even know how it’ll sound. I fear it’ll sound bad, although I hope I’ll be pleasantly surprised and it’ll sound somehow amazing. But this is not a bluegrass band, so...I’ve never seen a banjo in a rock band. If you have let me know. She has to get a mic and says she’s broke right now so I have to lend her like $100 or I won’t even know how her banjo sounds. 

I would feel really mean and selfish kicking her out, especially because she has told everyone and she is clearly stoked about it, and it’s not her fault. I would feel really bad leaving her in since honestly I don’t want her in it. It just kind of happened and I don’t know what to do about it now. I could let it be and deal with the situation I put myself in. And we could just pour w bunch of time and money into figuring out the perfect pedal and amp situations to make her sound right with the band. I could kick her out but then not only would she be angry and sad, I know the drummer would be mad about it too. My boyfriend said he’s completely at a loss for advice. Please help.",07Jan2020,1
194,"Sorry in advance for the useless stuff

With the new semester, my first class doesn't start until 12:30pm. It only takes an hour at most for me to get ready fully. For my age group, 8 hours is the recommended amount of sleep per night. Me and my mom always have certain issues, namely me being logic based and her using phrases like ""I'm your mother, you'll listen to me"" for everything when she doesn't want to admit I'm right. 

I've decided that if I were to wake up at 10am, I could stay up till 2am. She is set on me going to sleep at 11, which my body always becomes restless in these cases. 

I've mentioned the time with her, the restlessness, me having to force myself to sleep so early. She still refuses to accept what I'm saying. If I were causing a problem at night then sure, but there are no issues at night, I stay quiet. 

What can I do to convince her to let sleep when i want, given i get enough sleep?

Forcing myself to sleep has the same effect on me as staying up for a few nights in a row, and ultimately makes me sick",07Jan2020,1
195,"So basically the title says it all, I know older folks must hate and get tired of hearing people in their early 20s complaining about life, but I feel like I’ve been stuck and on loop, if I’m being honest, since i graduated high school. Ever since then, I experienced major depression and MAJOR self esteem issues. After high school i really had no friends, even during. Yes i had people to talk to when I was on campus, outside of school life i really had no one to talk to, hang out, or feel comfortable around. Other than my cousin, but sadly moved out of state 3 years ago. Majority of my friends went on to out of state colleges, got to experience that lifestyle, and made new friends. I wasn’t jealous, but it made me so envious and made me feel like “wow, if only i had my sh*t together that could’ve been me in college doing great things and having a great time” on top of that, ive never really had a girlfriend. At least nothing official. So been solo since. Since end of high school till now I’ve struggled with being social, and comfortable with being myself or trying to find myself.... I literally feel like I do not know myself. I go to therapy and my therapist ask me what I wanna do with my life, if I have any interest, talents, hobbies, and i legit have to clue. With makes me even more depressed... I feel like I have no reason to live. Don’t get me wrong I’m in a much better mental state than i was before, but with the new year starting I just kinda got “triggered” and looked back at all the wasted years. I guess what I’m asking is, I know that at the age I’m at it’s a typical feeling/phase, but how does one cope?

So I knew g1 since 8th grade and was interested in 9th but thought to myself I was too young and she was already dating someone else. I was hoping to ask her out but I was too late if I had simply asked a month before, I could have had a better chance, but I’m too stooping to realize when the time is right. G1 acts like she’s a guy and she said herself, “I’m probably the most in lady like person you’ll ever meet”, which is true.

Every time it got too swollen for her to sit comfortably we would go get it drained, but now it’s about the size of a baseball and every time we get it drained it gets swollen faster and faster. In our most recent vet visit our vet gave us two options; start making plans to put her down or get a risky $1000 surgery to get the tumor removed that may work or cause her to have to be put down on the operating table. Originally they told us they refuse to operate since it could mess up the way she goes to the bathroom and she could die of sepsis.

216,"All opinions welcome! Is there proper etiquette regarding this? What would you do if it happened to you or you did this to someone?

Jist of the jiz... male friend was texting me about NYE. My interpretation was he wanted to hang out with me and my sister so we invited him over. I conveyed the two of us were staying in wanting to have a chill relaxing night. He came over after he’d already been drinking. Drank more, smoked a blunt, drank more, ate some cbd / thc edibles, drank more. I went to bed first. Woke up to him laying in my bed, peeing which his man hose out. 

Longer story if you are bored and want to read more...
I work at a bar and typically choose not to work NYE. Wanting to stay away from the daily chaos which can turn more chaotic on this particular night. 

We were enjoying our relaxing day, capping it off with my fanciest red wine I’d been waiting to uncork with her from local Williamson Wines. I figured if not tonight then when?

Texting with said friend we extended an invite if he wanted to come hang and enjoy the same. 

Once on his way he informed me he’d been drinking. He’d missed one train because he was on the wrong side of the road. 

Once he arrived we offered him a choice of wine, beer, champagne or something from the liquor cabinet. He asked for hard liquor and so the cognac and whiskey began. Moving on to marijuana back to shots and then insisting on  the Veuve bottle he brought for the midnight cheers. And then back to whiskey. 

I was pressured by him to a few whisky cheers shots and the champagne toast. I surrendered the night going to bed first whil they stayed awake chatting. 

You ever hear something in your sleep such as an alarm clock, door bell or even rain and not comprehend what it is because you’re half asleep and sort of waking up??? Well I heard something... it was waking me up. Once I was almost fully awake it sounded like rain but more of a rain falling on a tarp sound. A muffled, putter patter falling  at a fast pace. I sleep facing the window on the side of my bed closest to the window. I am realizing the noise isn’t coming from outside. I feel this is all happening in slow motion as I have an idea of what I’m hearing. I roll over, turn to my left and see my friend had crawled into my bed and he is holding his exposed man part. I see him laying on his back peeing. It’s expelling onto him and my bed. I can’t remember ever being in such shock. I try to wake him up and he starts to call me names and is clearly incoherent. I finally get him up and his urine is now going in all directions on to other items. He finally heads to the bathroom and is still talking shit out loud calling me bad words and still appears incoherent. I have started to strip the bedding trying to find non carpeted areas to pile the soiled items on. When I come back he’s taken my already dribbled on down comforter and has curled up with it on the pee spot. After a struggle I manage to get the comforter from him and help him undress to get into the shower. He ends up out of the shower plopping onto the peed on carpet and curls up. I find my least favorite blanket and throw it on him. The next morning he finds me downstairs says sorry and tries to hug me with the blanket he’s been sleeping in his urine with all morning. 

What’s your opinions on the proper etiquette for this? Btw, I attempted to sop up the urging and it wouldn’t un-absorb from the memory foam. The next day the foam had bubbles up and took a new shape of its own. The spot was a bout the size of a watermelon and not those small seedless ones. I’m talking the large and in charge good old fashioned watermelon.",07Jan2020,1
219,"I saw a guy posting a Nintendo Switch and Smash on OfferUp for $185. I immediately jumped on this deal and messaged him asking if he could send me a video of the Switch working. Since you can’t send videos on OfferUp, I gave him my phone number and he sent it there. The video showed this Switch working fine so we got to talking and he told me the reason he was seling it that cheap was because: 

A) He had a ticket to pay off soon so his license wouldn’t get suspended, and he wanted to sell it as quickly as possible, and

B) $185 was a lot more than GameStop was offering him for it. 

Now I know scammers love to play the pity game but he seemed genuine and sent me a screenshot of the tickets with the citation numbers. I looked them up and, sure enough, they were real. I was still a bit hesitant about the whole deal, but he then offered to send me a picture of his ID to prove he was being legitimate. The picture matched his profile picture on OfferUp and again, a check on the DMV website showed that his license was legitimate. In addition to this, his OfferUp page was user-verified meaning that his ID is verified on the app, and his account was 3 years old. 

With all this information, I had no reason to not trust him, or so I thought. I told him I would buy it but I would wait to send the money until after he shipped it (we had planned on making a FaceTime call so that I could see him ship it out). However, he told me his tickets were due to be paid by the end of the day and asked if I could send $60 that day (Sunday). I believed this guy and trusted him, so I sent him $60 through Apple Pay. 

Normally, this is where a scammer would block me and move on. However, he thanked me and we kept talking about the shipping arrangements and such. He said the post office was closed on weekends (which is true) and that he would ship it this morning around 9-10AM. I said okay cool and that was it for the day. Well, come 9AM, I send him a message asking if he was still going to be able to ship it out at that time. He said yes, and that he would FaceTime me when he got to the post office. I told him I had a dentist appointment and I may not be out until 9:45ish and he seemed okay with it. 

When I left the dentist, I got a text from him saying he had to go to work and apologizing for not being able to wait for me. I told him I completely understood (which I did) and he said that he could stop by the post office on his lunch break around noon. I’m like ok no worries and I send him another text around noon. This is when he starts becoming slower to reply, but eventually texts me around 1:30 saying he’s leaving work, and then again at 2:30 apologizing for not responding, saying he had gotten into conversation with a coworker. I say it’s all good and ask if he was able to make it to the post office. 

I don’t get another text until 6:30, and I’m just thinking “Well, okay, he was at work, maybe he’s just been busy.” He says that he’s getting off at 7:00 and he will give me a call then, and that he also went ahead and shipped the Switch. I’m surprised by this but I say alright cool and just wait. 

7:00, he tells me he’s about to leave work. I waited a few minutes, no phone call. I sent him another text at 7:30 saying he could call as I wasn’t busy. Nothing. Sent my last text at 9:00 asking if everything was good, no response. I figured I’d try calling him, no response. 

It’s been 2 hours since I last tried to contact him and I still haven’t heard anything back. I’m starting to feel like he just took my $60 and is going to slowly start ghosting me until I stop trying to reach out. But also I’m thinking, who scams somebody for $60 and even if he was why is he still talking to me? On top of that, he sent me a picture of his ID, I have his phone number and home address, and he’s verified on OfferUp woth good ratings. 

Am I overthinking this? Am I getting scammed or is he just busy? What do you guys think?",07Jan2020,1
220,"I’m on vacation rn and a guy told me he has a girlfriend. I asked if she knows and he said ni. I have his face pic. It seriously pisses me off that he’s doing that, but what can/should I do",07Jan2020,1
223,"(I’m writing this on my cellphone, don’t know how it’s gonna look on a computer, sorry.)

I am 18F and my sister is 22F. She’s my sister only on my mother’s side, but my dad raised her and considers her his daughter too. We have one brother (son of both my mom and dad) 29M, and then I have two brothers (20M and 24M) that are the sons of my MIL, we don’t share blood, but I consider them my brothers. Anyway, here we go.

Since I was a kid, my sister had always made bad things and put the blame on me. I could sit and talk about the several stories I have of her doing it. She always had a way of coming out as the “good and quiet daughter”, while I always came out as the “problematic one”. I won’t put all the blame on her, I was a really difficult child, but not problematic. When I was 4 and she was 7, my mom was once again struggling with her depression and had to go to a psychiatric hospital. Since I was his daughter from blood, dad took me and we moved to my grandma and grandpa house. My grandpa and grandma on my mom’s side were already dead, so my sister had to move to one of my aunts. When my mom would struggle with depression, my sister would have to move to one aunt to another. Idk if that made her hate me, since I had a pretty good life with my dad and my grandma and grandpa. But let’s begin with some stories.

When I was like 8 I had a “boyfriend” at school. It was a child thing, we didn’t kiss, we didn’t hold hands, we didn’t hug, just called ourselves a couple. For three years she blackmailed me with it, saying that if I didn’t do what she wanted, she would tell my father. She used to blackmailed A LOT, even saying she was gonna make stuff up to tell our dad. Several times I said (when I was a kid) that he wasn’t her dad. I know it’s a asshole move, and I regret it.

When I was 12, she started going out and getting drunk. When I was at mom’s house (usually weekends and vacations, bc my dad and my mom lived like 20min away) I always helped her and hide it from my mom and dad. I never, not even once, though of telling them about that. She started smoking cigarettes and weed, got pretty addicted and I still didn’t tell anything. When I was 15, I started going out and drinking too, and she always told my dad and mom. When I was 16, I begin smoking cigarettes, and when she found out, she ran to both mom and dad and told them. After that, when she was at my mom’s she would always go through my stuff to see if she found cigarettes.

When she came out to me as a lesbian when I was like 10, I was very supportive. Helped her hide it from our mom, after that helped her came out to mom, then helped her out on making our mom accept it. When I told her I liked girls, she said I didn’t. That I just wanted attention. I was like 13, and felt very alone. When I was 15, I was felling suffocated for being on the closet, and told her I would come out. She said it was my problem and she wouldn’t help me “ruining our mother’s mental health”. I came out to mom, mom didn’t accepted me (even though she accepted my sister), and then whenever my mom, my sister and I were together, the two would go for hours talking about how I really liked boys and just wanted attention. This messed my head really bad, and I forced myself to kiss boys even though I hated it, I even forced myself to have a really short relationship with one, which it was so awful that I hated to even look at him. After a while I told my mom to stop, bc me and a boy would never happen if I wanted to be happy. She still don’t accept me, but don’t talk shit anymore.

So now we are at the biggest event that made me think about not talking to her anymore. It was like September or October 2018.My sister went to my mom’s house to spend three days, and on the last day (friday) my SIL would come pick her and they would go to a show. The first thing she did when she arrived was ask to use my makeup on the friday. Now, I don’t like anyone borrowing my stuff. Clothes, makeup, parfum. I hate it. I just can’t. But I said I would let her, if she puts everything on the right packing (I keep EVERYTHING in the original packing, dk why). She said ok, Then she asked for a pajama. I gave her one. She asked for underwear so she could shower and change it. I gave her one. She asked for my parfum. I said she could take mom’s, I didn’t like anyone borrowing my parfum. She got mad and went showering. I got to school and when I came back, she had take my favorite hoodie to use while cooking. I got really mad, told her it was my favorite and she told to “get over it”. We where having dinner when she said “oh I will also need three pills of your contraceptive pills (I take bc of my period) bc I forgot mine and I can’t get my period till after the show, or I would have to use a tampon to go to the show”. I got so fucking mad, I said she was being disrespectful and cheeky (I believe that’s how you say it in english, idk). She got mad, said she was my sister and should give her anything. I said I wasn’t going to give the pills bc they were expensive. She said it was only three. I said (lots of I said she said ik) that I had a problem with my period and wouldn’t give her none, it wasn’t my problem that she came to mom’s house with nothing, specially her medication (she has her own stuff, she just didn’t brought with her bc she said it was “too much weight” to carry on the bus). Then she started a fake cry. Mom said to me just give her the pills. I gave to her. She said she hated me, that I was a bitch, a hoe and she never wanted to speak to me again. The story doesn’t end there. The next day, she got a call of a job interview, asking if she could go there the afternoon. Since she didn’t brought any clothes, she tried to go into my room while I was sleeping to take a few. I lock my room when I go to sleep. She noticed the door was locked and gently knocked and called me. I asked “what?” and she was like oh I need a few clothes bc of a job interview, let me in so I can see what i want to take. And I said that I was a hoe and since she didn’t want to talk to me again, she wouldn’t want my clothes either. She got out of herself, started slamming at my door, saying how she hated me, that I was a bitch, that she was DISGUSTED TO BE MY SISTER. When I heard that I said to me “this is over. I’m not talking to her ever again”. My mom gave her some clothes to the interview blah blah blah. Then my SIL and her started saying shit about me on twitter. My best friend saw and started defending me (but on her twitter, not directly to my sister, like she didn’t mentioned her on the tweets). My sister saw and showed it to my mom, who got really mad and said that my BF would never get into our house again. I said “if she can come to our house, neither can SIL” and showed her all the tweets. Mom said nothing. Friday came, my SIL shows up with two friends who’s going to the show with them. I was felling a little bad and, before going to school, I said “ok, you can take my makeup, but I don’t want anything out of the packing and none of your friends using it”. I came back from school and she was almost ready. She then came to the kitchen and using her baby voice said to mom “oh my skirt doesn’t match my shirt, what do I do?” Mom tells me to give her one of my skirts. I said I don’t have any, bc the only one I had was a leather one that I had never used, and I have always said I don’t let anyone borrow clothes I never had never wear. Mom’s remember the leather skirt and tells me to give to my sister for that night. I said I had never used it. My sister starts to fake crying again and I almost throw the fucking skirt on her face. She left and I go to my room, only to find my makeup throw all over my room, the packings crumpled. I got so furious I sent her a message, telling the next time she saw mom, I wanted everything that it was mine and was it her back. I said how the only thing I asked was the makeup on the fucking packing. She said that it was one of her friends and that made me even more furious. I didn’t talk to her until May 2019. My dad made me talk to her again. We had a few fights, small things, but things got really bad again at NYE.

At NYE I got pretty drunk, and she called my dad and told him. I leave with my dad, under his rules, and he hates when I drink, hates even more when I get drunk. She even made stuff up, saying that I had smoked cigarettes with people I didn’t knew (which I didn’t, I quit smoking a long time ago). So now I’m grounded. I am really furious at her. I know it wasn’t right to get drunk, but it happens, even her, who’s older than me, still gets drunk, and it happens almost every weekend. I’m grounded bc she told dad, and now can’t enjoy my two months of vacation. my dad doesn’t even let me go out with my friends to eat. Today she came by bc it’s her birthday and she came to get her present. I only sent her one word (congratulations) and nothing else. When she came by, I was in the pool, and she didn’t go talk to me, so I didn’t got out to talk to her either. Dad’s mad at me that I didn’t get out of the pool to talk to her. My mom says she was wrong for telling my dad I got drunk, bc it’s normal and I was with my mom all the time, so I wasn’t in danger. Also, her friends, who were together with us at NYE were also pretty drunk. One of my brother’s on my SIL side said she was a fucking asshole for telling my dad, bc it ruined all the plans we had for our vacations. My dad doesn’t even let me go to my mom’s house, which made my mom so furious she canceled my sister birthday barbecue.

Keep in mind that everything she made wrong these years it was hidden from our parents, so both mom and dad thinks she’s perfect and a saint. On the other way, all bad things I did she made sure they both knew about it, so now I’m the black sheep. I feel like she acts like she’s other person, so that everyone thinks she’s a role model, the perfect daughter, the perfect sister, etc. She also makes a lot of mean jokes about me when there’s people around us, specially jokes about my weight and my body, things I’m very insecure about. My dad thinks that the episode of she’s being disgusted of being my sister and every other fight we had was bc I did something to her first, bc oh the perfect daughter would never do or say those things if I didn’t do anything. Everytime we fight. he keeps telling me to apologize and talk to her again, and when I don’t, he begins to give me punishments. But now I don’t ever want to talk to her again. She’s mean, she’s manipulative and she’s toxic. I don’t want that energy in my life ever again.",07Jan2020,1

Recently, I happened to see a (fake but very realistic) video reenactment of a first-person witness suicide and my thoughts have been literally circling around it since. I was asking friends if they had a gun I could borrow ""for when I go to a dealer"", I was looking up the local gun laws to see what I would have to do to get one, I was contemplating jumping off the bridge down my road or in front of a train. I even sent a close friend of mine a long message explaining that it may happen soon and telling her how much I love her. I was having suicidal thoughts before, but this is the worst it's been.

232,"Just a heads up this is for parents especially moms. 
To start off hi my name is Ethan and I have always wanted to be a baby sitter. I volunteer at my local church and take care of 14-22 toddlers in a room each week with a few other volunteers. All of the other volunteers are female. Basically how it works so we get the children the parents go to the service and we take care, play, feed, and change the diapers of the kids. Out of all the kids one of my absolute favorites is a kid called Skye. Every time she comes in she wants me to pick her up and never wants me to let go until her parents get back. We just do things together like play with toys or I read her a story etc. whenever I give her to one of the other volunteers she starts to cry. I have grown a good connection with her even though she can’t really sprawl full sentences lol. Anyways I wanted to start to babysit because I feel like whenever I leave the church after 1 hour of volunteering I just want to do it again because how do I say it really just gives me a lot of joy and a warm heart. I asked my supervisor if I could ask any of the parents of the children I could baby sit and she told me I should probably only ask the parents of the boys. Now I understand her reasoning. But I just feel that Skye would probably want a male babysitter because she only stops crying when she is with her parents or with someone male and especially if they can’t stop her from crying they give her to me and she stops crying immediately. I really want to ask the parents of Skye if I can babysit their child but I am pretty sure they would rather have a girl babysitter to let me babysit their child for a number reasons. I wanted to know from the perspective of a mom with a young daughter on my situation and if there is anything I can do because I feel like I would really enjoy babysitting Skye. Also I forgot to mention that I will give out notes to all the parents of my kids and tell them if they need a babysitting service that I am available.",07Jan2020,1

235,"Hi I’m seeking advice to whether or not I should go after the dealership (buy-here-pay-here) that I was purchasing a car from.

My trade-in was valued at $500 alongside $200 cash. I drove the new car off the lot and was APPROVED for the loan. But for 2 weeks the bank that approved me tried to interview me to confirm it was me and not fraud. 2 weeks later the dealership is telling me that the loan is going to be taken back because there is a freeze on my credit (I have n/a credit cause I’m 20 and have never reported fraud) so I took the car back and demanded my trade-in value + downpayment since they already sold my car when nothing was yet finalized. They did not receive the money from the bank nor did they even finalize the registration transfer either.

247,"For year I have had a friend that the friendship has always been very one sided. She has severe self-esteem issues, mental health issues, and in general a hard time keeping friendships. From the start of the friendship it felt like it was something that would be one sided and I would give more than I would take, which I accepted. Recently I have realized that the relationship is incredibly unhealthy. For example: all of her sadness and her emotional needs to lays them on me, which even when I have told her I have my own life stresses and its unfair for her to burden me, she is usually good for about 48 hours before she once again weighs them on me. Another thing of the last few months is that she seems to be copying everything I do. Examples: I have gotten a few different tattoos, which she then immediately gets similar ones. I dyed my hair and then two days later she dyed hers. She has told me that my body type and size is exactly her goal. I am planning on moving to a different state, which she has now expressed she wants to do as well. Most recently, I received an awesome pair of leggings as a Christmas gift from my fiancé, which she immediately went out to buy herself. 

I just don't know what to do. I'm not sure if I'm over reacting, but I recently feels as though she sees that I am happy and content with my life and she is copying everything I do to try and achieve the same happiness. 

I do not like to hurt people, as it is not in my nature, but I am starting to feel the toll that she is taking on me. 

Any advice on how I can proceed with the least damage doing?",07Jan2020,1

Doubting myself and having no self confidence or self-esteem. All the things that I promised myself after graduating High school did not happen at all, and trust me I had a long list.

A bit about me: In my eyes, I would define my personality a “loner-type“. However, I have no problem accepting this because I spend most of my time being alone. But at some point in my life, I just want to change. Instead of asking for advice from friends I’m sitting here asking for advice from reddit. Why can't I be like the rest of the 'normal' people? Having a couple of good friends, building a strong relationship with someone that can end up in mutual love. Whats the secret? I would believe that I have a strong mind, I’ll accept being a loner without reasons to become any sort of addict or come across suicidal thoughts. But at some point I realized that I’m turning 22, close to my senior year of college yet no friends, no car, no money, literally 50 bucks in my account. Got rejected from several...SEVERAL  retail stores over the past years, to a point where I’m too deep and close to graduating, so I have to focused on getting an internship or a small job based on my major or else I won’t get a career. 

So I’m asking for any advice? I want to hear what you think about me and what would you do?

My new year resolution: like any other lose weight (broke thumb years back then pure lazyness later on), get an internship, and get a f*cking car. I have a list but I have to get to those 3 first so I can “unlock” the others.

268,"Note: A lot of context here, but I feel like it's important. *Thank you for bearing with me.*

Hey everyone!

I'm a 19 year old (20 in march) college student who's getting ready for my last semester of my sophmore year. Since the beginning of college, I knew that my degree alone wasn't gonna be some golden ticket to get a job, so I really drilled the mindset that I need to be productive now. The problem was that I still suffered from paralyzing anxiety in the start of college (had anxiety since before middle school yippie) and it's only recently that I feel I'm well-enough to be productive so that I can concentrate on more than my studies (my grades had to be high to keep a scholarship. not much of a choice there)

I have a lot of options for what I want to do. I'm considering getting a Masters in Health Administration (Uni doesn't care what your bachelors is, the MA course work is hefty tho), or doing Law School. I've been using my free time to learn animation, which I've gotten good enough at to the point where I've gotten some decent/well paying freelance gigs. I've also been testing out of a bunch of classes, to the point where I could totally graduate a year early. I'm also teaching myself coding and Spanish this year. My attitude is this: If I'm not 100% on whether I will get a Master's, I fuckin' might as well learn some marketable skills that I like as a backup plan.

My family has been trying to convince me to graduate early so that I can get a job. But my anxiety and car-less situation left me with no formal work experience. All I have is volunteer experience with 4 different organizations. And soooo many entry-level jobs ask for work experience. 

This is where I feel like I'm left with two options:

1) Become a part time student, and graduate at the ""normal"" time. And use my spare time to do contract work/get a part time job so that I can get work experience. And use those contracting jobs to learn coding/animation/design more deeply and build up my resume. 

2) Graduate early and use the gap year to work and make my final decision on whether I should go to Graduate School. I know coding/animation/design, but to a lesser extent with a lot less work experience.

What complicates this further is that, on top of having good grades, I need to be a full-time student in order to keep my  my scholarship. So it's like...If I'm gonna go with 1) and make my dad pay a few more thousand dollars, I had better be 1000% you know? He doesn't care about spending money on me, but I do. :I

My gut is leaning towards 1) just because I want to spend more time with my family, and it's never gonna be 100% that my job will be in my hometown. But I also feel like the pressure is on to ""get a move on"", and not be a douche to my dad who's helping me out.

270,"People tend to get relaxed because of who I am as a person. This is fine with my personal life but when it comes to work, I have to eat the hard end of the stick usually. I mean I am always on time, friendly, and make others laugh. I compliment others and make them feel appreciated. But I always tend to build this persona around me that Im a chill person that they can do whatever they want with me. My coworker who I work the nights with have a responsibility. I watch the desk (concierge) while he patrols. 

So as stated my job is to watch the desk, but because we work night I said we can split the duties. so in-turn he has shifted all the duties that were his by subtly saying I'm not doing it, and it was my job as concierge to do these. when in reality I told him several times I'm just trying to be helpful as our supervisor stated multiple times that it was his job to do and I was just being nice and helping, but it is primarily your job. This was annoying at the start but what ever? I still ended up doing it. so later mgmt tells him to do more work by finding defects around the building and report them. 

This patrol guard has been here for 4 years, and mgmt has been lenient however when the new mgmt came in, and started giving more tasks for us to do. He is annoyed that he has to do this new task which he, and did not submit these new tasks according to requirements. In his defense hes the only worker who has to do it, because he works night. So more work is being given to him, when really he wants as little work as possible. Recently there was a party and I asked him to do inspect the room for defects after (part of his job), he stated its my job. I did it, but hes just not doing his job. AT ALL. hes doing just enough not to be fired, but not enough to stay out of trouble.

Additionally, he is kind of annoying me now. He vents to me and and when I started to vent recently back about my shift changes that were unexpected he said that it looks like you're using me as a dummy to vent your problems out and thats not fair. Irony is he is doing the exact same thing. I called him out on it, and he was in denial and stated a small difference as to why its not the same. he justifies what hitler did, stuff going on in china and around teh world overall, and just nit picks things he doesnt like about my performance in the work.

It is important to note this individual works only 3 days out of 7. Guys the issue is my supervisors getting pissed that im leaving desk, he expects me to be at the desk most of the time. my coworker not being understanding at all of this.

I guess what im asking is how to be assertive, even when you are standing up for yourself.

**TLDR :** Coworker (patrol guard) whose working for company for 4 years is doing just enough work to get by not getting fired, but not enough to not get yelled at. He is shifting his responsibilities onto me, which I told him earlier I would help with. I stated that its not my job but still did them every time. He is very nitpicky about the way I do my job, and doesn't give me a break ever. He supports hitlers ideologies, and the stuff going on in china and what not.",07Jan2020,1

He told me that the girl that he liked started with an “a.” And my name did not start with an a so when it was my turn to say who I liked I backed out. 
“Wow I tell you the first letter that I like and you won’t tell me a thing” he said something like that.

330,"TL;DR Fat lesbian with rough past needs dating advice 

Heyo Redditors. I am a 33 yr old lesbian living in a new city for the first time in my life. I have not dated in about 6 years. This is due to a few significant reasons. I was drinking heavier and heavier, gaining weight and loosing control of my mental well being. I lost everything. I was in and out of hospitals on suicide watch. I had problems with lying, sometimes stole small amounts of money- even from good friends. 

Now, I am medicated for bi-polar, living with my sister, finished a quarter of community college with a 4.0, enrolled in the Honors Program and have my drinking under control. I just had minor back surgery that may help me with almost life-long chronic pain. I am trying to meet new friends, which in and of itself is new for me because I lived in the same town my whole life and always had a huge friend group. 

I have not dated, had sex or so much as a crush in so long. And for a while it seemed so far fetched that I really didn't think about it. Except for the sex. 

Anyways, I am looking for advice on dating sites or other ideas for meeting ladies. I have never used a dating site. I would maybe consider paying for one if that's the only way to use a quality one, but would really be interested in a free one. Any specific suggestions for sites? Or ones to stay away from? Sites especially good for lesbians? I am in Seattle area if that matters. 

I am also open to dating advice. I live with my sister and her kids, but I have my own room and entrance. I am overweight (215 lbs 5' 7"") average looking, smart, funny and friendly. I drink, smoke weed, read, watch shows and movies, love music. I have scars from self harm and obviously a very rough past. 

I appreciate any insight you might have. Thanks!",07Jan2020,1
331,"So this started about a month and a half ago. I was living on the second floor of my house in a single twin bed room. I started out of nowhere, I would wake up with these bites on my ankles and some on my leg. Not many like 2-3 on each leg. 

Then it progressed and got worse to the point where I washed all my clothes and sheets. 

Nothing changed. I was still getting bit. I had no idea where it was coming from. Both my parents and brother were not getting bit. I thought it was my chair, so I left it outside (during the month of December) for a few days to see if they would freeze and die. Still woke up with new bites. Then I thought it was my bed and ended up throwing it out. 

Still got bit. 

My brother moved out of the basement and I moved in. With a queen bed. My two cats lived downstairs and after about a week of being in my new room, I noticed that one of my cats was infested with fleas. Like 30+ so I gave her a flea bath and bought two collars for both of them. The weird thing was my other cat didn’t have a single flea on her. Not one. So I moved my cats upstairs into my old room. To keep them away until they don’t have anymore. 

I’ve tried everything. I’ve washed my clothes and blankets, sheets pillow/cases. Vacuumed my bed. Got rid of my rugs in my room. And I got a buzz cut. I feel like they are living on me.

I could feel them in my socks and pants. I could feel when they bite. I’ve pulled off a total of 20+ fleas of myself. I have no idea where they are from. 

I took a shower and was wearing nothing but ankle socks clean from a wash, and after 5 minutes later I pulled 3 fleas right off the socks. My family has a community sock drawer and I’m still the only one getting bit. I’m at a loss and I don’t know what to do. 

I bough Off: Into the Woods spray and would spray my bed and legs before I went to sleep. Which somehow made them bite more frequently. I have probably over 100 bites between both my feet/ankles/legs, and probably 30 more over my upper body and arms. I’m currently wearing a shirt and underwear out of my heavy clothes rotation and washing my whole closet. Planning on washing them three times. 

What can I do. I want them gone.",07Jan2020,1
332,"I (16m) have a crush on my sisters best friend (13f). I guess it might sound kind of weird but I’ve known her for 3 years and I know she also has a crush on me. I’m very conflicted, because I would assume that her parents wouldn’t like that, or mine for that matter. It’s not that I’m a bad person, they both like me a lot and we are very good friends with all of them. Obviously I’m not gonna do anything sexual, I know that age of consent but I just don’t know if it’s right or not.",07Jan2020,1

Right now I have picked to become a highschool history teacher. But further reasearch a teachers salary just isnt enough for me.

Im really not interested in a super high paying job, thats not my highest priority. I just want a nice job that I can live on and have a good work/life load. I just dont want a job ill regret doing for the rest of my life. I do not  want to be a computer programmer which was one of my interests, because I couldnt imagine typing on a computer for 8 hours a day.

339,"Right now i have to make a decission to either quit ballet or continue ballet. I'll lay out the reasonings bellow:

I want to quit ballet- because i feel like i cant keep up with my friends anymore. What i mean is i cant keep up with the grade i'm in, Advance 1. I took the RAD ballet exam for the Advance foundation a few months ago so now my class is learning movements fron advance 1. During this time after the exam, i had to skip ballet because it was finals week, and i had to focus on that. Fyi, my teacher teaches really fast- like we finished all the barre movements in a day. Imagine what i left out on after more than 2 weeks? (Class is twice a week). I don't sant to be a burden to my friends and teacher because during that time i did come to class even tho only 1 or 2 times. But i saw what i was left out- they were already finished with more than 5 movements in centre- and i havent even learn any. Let alone the barre movements, i only learnt it once- havent memorise the combos. I felt useless, like a burden, and not good enough for this grade. I felt like shit.

This feeling of burden/dread has been going on for years in my head. I felt like i couldnt do it- sometimes i'd come home crying because of the stress. Coming to class started to become a dread lately. But im conflicted because- not all the time i felt like that. There are days where i geniuenlly enjoy class. Days where i felt happy and rewarded after ballet. Now i'm just confused on how i feel about ballet because if you ask me ""do you enjoy ballet?"" I would still say yes, because i like ballet. Doesn't mean i'm good at it, it's just that i felt like 10+ years of ballet has been enough for me.

Fyi i only do ballet as a hobby right now and to keep me in shape every week. I kinda suck at it ngl- i'm not planning to be a prodigy afterall. Right now i'm starting to consider my decission because i've done ballet for so long.

Which is why there is a part of me in conflict with my other self:

I don't want to quit ballet- because of a simple and selfish reason. I don't want to lose my identity.

Because i've done this for so long (started at 4 yo and now i'm a sophomore in highschool, time flies), for almost 10+ years it has become a part of me, a part of my identity. I get comments like ""omg you do ballet?"", ""you're so flexible!"", ""how can you move like that?! You really know how to dance!"" And so on. Most of my friends i grew up with since elementary knew me like this. It became a part of who i am. Quitting ballet means i have to give up something i still hold dear to this day. I am scared of losing my pride.

Also i'm one of those people that ""likes"" to be busy. What i mean is that i feel like i'm an acomplished person by having other activities outside school- by being busy. Even though i hate not having free time to myself and envy other people who do nothing at school, i would honestly feel empty without the extra things i have to do. I feel like i'am a complete and acomplished person subconciously- because i'm busy. As counter productive this thing is, subconciously i felt like this. And ballet happens to be one of those activities afterschool that makes me complete as a person and as a student.

Honestly, i enjoy dancing in general and ballet is just one of the others that i kinda master. I KNOW qutting ballet doesn't mean i have to quit dance- but it still feels like it to me.

Tbh i've thought of other things i want to do if i have to give up ballet. I want to try other things i'm interested in such as learning another language, focusing on my english in preparation to take the TOEFL or IELTS if i need to, focus more on my drawing so i can take a major in art, and so on so i can fill that spare time. My mum even sugested i take yoga class instead if i still want to keep in shape every week.

But right now i have to make a decission after dragging it for so long. Because it's the start of a new year after our break in december, my mum is seriously asking me if i want to continue or not. The cost for these classes aren't cheap yknow?

I need anyone's opinion on my problem. Is it just me feeling and being a lazy ass? Or maybe it's time for me to try other things? Also sorry if this is kinda lengthy, it's the first time i ever opened up about my dillema (not even my mum knows about this, probably because i'm too scared to admit the truth to her which i probably should-)

If you want to give your opinion on this matter please do, i really need to make a decission. So anything is apreciatted :)

340,"Hi ya'll I want an opinion and insight from everyone of you that loves AKB48 and their sister groups or any girl groups on MNL48's situation.   
I came across a trailer of MNL48's documentary that exposed the truth behind the struggles, the downs, and shit MNL48 has been through. I watched it and noticed the color, the fun, and the joy of the signature 48 group had completely faded to something dark, dreary, and depressing. Skip to the premiere, I watched it and I was completely overwhelmed with tears from their issues, despair from their situation, and oddly inspiration from the girl's determination to keep on.   
Here's the summary of documentary from [tintedrhythm](https://www.reddit.com/user/tintedrhythm/)

Pretty scattered thoughts but here goes nothing:

Most of the talking heads are from the underrated or girls who aren't shown that much in management pick senbatsus(priveledge to present in performances) like the twins, Kyla, and Erica.

There was a scene from the backstage of their It's Showtime guesting during the PFC era where a member jokingly said that Belle looks like a drag queen. She then said that there's nothing wrong about that and that they support LGBTQ. I think it was Sela and Jem who said it. I can't remember much.

They talk about how a lot of them didn't know what they were getting into when they auditioned.

* Abby auditioned because she wanted to be in a girl group since her political dreams of having an SK position wasn't gonna work out.
* Dian auditioned even though she didn't know anything about 48g and was more into KPOP back then.
* Sheki didn't know anything about 48g but auditioned anyway since she wanted to be a star (as seen on her TnT stint)
* Kyla auditioned even though she wasn't knowledgeable about the idol industry and wasn't into cutesy songs.
* Sela was intrigued about the 48g world and looked up what it was all about. She liked the concept and auditioned. I think out of all of the girls who were interviewed on why they joined, she was the only one who did research.

Ash talked about her initial thoughts on the stark difference between the normal AKB auditions to how shit went down in Showtime. She compared it to PD48 where it really was just a Survival Show.

Aly's teaser was in the docu, Gabb's wasn't. Erica's audition for 365? was also shown but on that day she had a hoarse voice but believes that her confidence can outweigh that hindrance.

One of the twins talked about not knowing what to do anymore to look prettier so they can get in the senbatsu. Kyla talks about loving her skin color even though the system and the Filipino society favors mestiza or chinita looks. Erica mentioned that she thinks that she's not being picked to be in the senbatsu because she doesn't look Japanse/East Asian enough.

The BMI topic was also opened up with Quincy saying that's where she's struggling. After a screen test or audition of one of the twins she was asked what is her BMI, she said 19.1 and was told to lose more weight. The same thing happened to Dian.

Mari talks about how she had a hard time explaining to her family what an idol is. That they can't be touched or they can't just take pictures with fans. Her family and relatives couldn't grasp the concept because they said that they can just hold Mari's hand and take pictures with her.

The Asia Fest in Bangkok was mirrored with the performance at the Town Fiesta in Sta. Maria Bulacan. First Rabbit was played all throughout that part and was showing the difference between the senbatsu and the girls who aren't in it. I think it was Alice that said something along the lines of ""Let's perform as if we're in Bangkok"" to the girls who were feeling a bit down. After the performance the girls who performed in Bulacan were entering the van when someone in the background shouted that the girl near the door of the van was ugly. Didn't see who it was tbh.

One of the twins talked about how she's having a really hard time getting into the senbatsu while some members get in all the time. She said that she felt weird hanging around Sela because it felt like (to her) that Sela was a top tier member and she wasn't.

A clip from the PFC HSE was shown where Abby was confronted by a basher (who was actually in the premiere of the documentary) and asked that they shouldn't film him so they blurred his face. Abby was in tears but pushed through the HSE even though she was obviously hurt.

The first concert showed them praying and uttering the words One Dream, One Sound. This is where Alice is shown to be leading the group (in prayer) and also telling everyone to do their best because all of the people waiting for them spent their hard earned money to see them perform.

Then the GE part, they showed Andi's name being announced and the girls running to the ones who didn't make it. They also showed the eliminated girls saying thank you to the ones who survived and said that they're now signing off. Cut to Sha calling her mom to tell the bad news. The GE part really made me cry, I didn't expect to cry at a public place .

They also overlapped talking heads of the girls (who looked devastated) who didn't make it in the 2nd GE while playing a speech of someone who made it in the senbatsu (Rowee and Rans) as the audio.

There was a part (with the girls from that Battle Royale-esque photo from the ICYMI Instagram running towards each other and bumping other members along the way. It was a cycle.

They end it with that video of a school playing TaluSaku(Sakura no Hanabiratachi) at their graduation.  


To make it worse, MNL48's own country looks down on them considerably after they follow a cute and DIFFERENT concept on PPOP. They literally cringe, hate, and talk sh""t on them.   


I love MNL48 with all my heart because they are talented, have great personalities, and a group that represents the fun side of my country. They don't deserve the hate cause literally they haven't done any oopsies(except the fired aspirants) or anything that is worth hating on them. I want an opinion on their situation and please support the as well\~.",07Jan2020,1

342,"So there's this guy at my high school I've known him since we were freshmen (4 years ago), he's really kind and funny and sweet, and he likes me a lot. And he would be a great boyfriend, but I don't know why, but I both do and don't want to date him at the same time. I don't know if he could HANDLE me in a relationship. We have different tastes sexually (him being pretty vanilla, and me.......not), I'm also... I mom people a lot. I don't think our personalities would complement each other in a romantic relationship, yet I still find myself checking him out occasionally, and accidentally being flirty with him, and noticing when he looks at me. Here's the other thing, I can't just hook up with him, partly because I don't do that sort of thing and partly because we've been friends for years and my anxiety tells me that it would be weird.

343,"I spent the last 4 to 5 days enduring the ups and downs of a breakup; Now I lie awake thinking I am wrong in being the one left with no responsibility,  having a fresh start, he's left with pain etc I am just being selfish....

4 to 5 days ago, I accepted that I had been mentally abused for 8 to 9 years. Being called ""retarded"" for doing something ""wrong"" , being told ""great you're crying again"". , screamed at in a fit of drunken. Rage, ""fuck off, go to your moms"", when it wasn't working. Accused of cheating bc I didnt want sex, afraid of telling my answers in case they were ""wrong"" shutting down in arguments bc that was my method as I grew up with a mentally abusive father...Etc etc

4 to 5 days ago he begged me to come back that at the end of the year he planned to give me a ring, and a house and get out of him moms.....but its been 9 years? Why now...when we are broken up?

4 to 5 days ago I became homeless, carless, and single. Sleeping on a couch, and living out of a storage unit.

I got angry texts, calls, and confronted that I was being selfish. That I lied our whole relationship.  That I wanted this for a while, that I never did anything to fix this, etc etc

I then got apologies,  itll never happen again, I'm sorry for everything, forgive me etc etc

We had animals together,(farm and domestic) I was told ""you're leaving this family, they are no longer your responsibility "" and was left empty and heart broken.

2 days ago he apologised and told me he was going to get help. That he understands all he did, the abuse, the anger fits, the treating me like pure shit, over reacting, the selfishness, the childishness etc etc

Looking forward to my freedom and future accomplishments that I'd buy a car, buy a place and get on my feet..... I begin to feel the selfishness.  
1. Did I over react? Was he really that abusive? 
2. Am I doing this just out of selfishness?
3. Hes left with the responsibility of the animals. Waking up early, the feed , the time etc. Is that fair?
4. I left him with a large car payment, bc I handed mine back to him ( it was in his name)
5. I have a clean slate to start over and hes left with the same toxic environment that hindered us for so long...

I dont want to go back, but I feel like my freedom is unfair. Why do I feel this way? 

When we were good we were good but I got to a point where good wasnt enough . The love I had for him was lesser than the fear I had of him and what I'd get yelled at for 
What is the level of abuse that is ""ok""? Or forgiven? 
He never hit me... so. 
I still love him, and want him to be ok. 
No one ""knew this was happening "" , hes such a great guy. I ""hid it well"". 
What level of abuse is abuse? Am I wrong?",07Jan2020,1
344,"I'm a high school freshman and this little while, I've been constantly thinking about having sex with someone I like.

345,"Okay, so this is a throwaway account, because this whole situation is making me feel like a crazy person.

So I have this friend that I met over the summer. We spent a lot of time together and I felt that we were pretty close. This is because we both worked a seasonal job and were around each other a lot, but we also hung out outside of work. Well, this friend lives in a different state from me, so after the seasonal position was over, we kept in touch mostly over text.

Okay, so it's about Oct time frame. My friend texts me and says they have a new partner, which I was happy for them, etc, etc. Now, never met this person, obviously because we live in two different states. 


Now, about a month later, I'm texting my friend, just catching up, and they said that their partner was in some trouble. I asked what kind and they said that apparently partner's crazy ex broke into the partner's house. That the ex flew across the country to ""surprise"" my friend's partner and yeah, there was arguing, police were called, supposedly a whole mess. At the end of it, the ex apparently told police that my friend's partner had assaulted them and my friend's partner was arrested on these charges.

Well, they're my friend so of course I'm going to believe them. But as this story goes on, little details begin to not add up. Because after this happened, idk because of all that craziness my friend's partner's ex was put into protective custody (?) while the police apparently tried to figure everything out. And then while my friend's partner was in protective custody apparently the crazy ex shot my friend's partner while they were at a grocery store (?)

The only thing that seemed strange about that to me is that by this point I'm kind of skeptical. What are the odds that all this craziness would happen? So I decided to look up police records and if there were any news reports. I turned up nothing, even looking in local newspapers for that town. That kind of piqued my Spidey senses, so to speak.

And as time goes on the story just gets crazier and crazier. Apparently friend's partner now has a kid by the crazy ex, but that wasn't mentioned at all in any of our earlier conversations, and I feel like that's important information someone should know about their partner and more importantly, definitely something you would tell your friends, right? I mean I thought we were close and they would feel comfortable with sharing that with me.

Added on to this, well as the story gets crazier my skepticism increases, so I decided to check out their partner's social media. (And usually I'm not a crazy stalker person, I just wanted some answers) Well apparently they joined in the early days of FB, no insta I could find, but even so, there's practically nothing on the partner's FB page. No birthdays. No one (besides my friend) has tagged them in anything. No work. Nothing.

But even still, I want to be a supportive friend, I don't want to accuse my friend of lying because what if they're telling the truth?

And then I texted my friend again today and apparently there's more drama going down. Partner overdosed somehow, they have to be treated at a medical facility for a different reason in a major city close to where my friend lives. Apparently the other reason was a back issue, and the partner had surgery today (I guess?) But also had another surgery in the same day? Idk if doctor's even do that? Wouldn't that stress out your body too much?

And for the past few months, every time I text my friend it's some other issue with their partner. So I want to know, am I crazy for being suspicious or is my friend gaslighting me and making shit up?",07Jan2020,1
347,"i don’t know what just happened. it was not even 5 minutes ago and i feel disgusting, i’m crying as i’m typing this.

i met a guy online, and immediately asked me to facetime. i said sure because i love meet new people, and assured him several times i wasn’t looking for anything more then a friendship- i’m in a relationship!! 

i don’t remember how it got to the point, but we where talking when i heard something in the background, i asked what he was doing and said masturbating. i was horrified.

he asked me to take my bra off and i said no. he said please and i said no. he kept pleading until i finally said yes, but kept my shirt on. i don’t know why i didn’t end the conversation at this point, i guess i was just scared.

anyway, it ended with my shirt pulled up and him finishing. i was about to cry so i told him i needed to leave, but then he had the audacity to say i had used him.

i hung up, and began sobbing. it’s currently 1:40
in the morning so none of my friends are up and my boyfriend is asleep.

i feel disgusting, horrible and dirty. this is the worst feeling i’ve ever felt and i can’t stop crying. i feel like i cheated on my boyfriend but deep down i know it’s not my fault. i just want a hug and to be told it’s gonna be ok. i’m not even sure how i’m going to tell my boyfriend.

348,"Judging by the 'new' posts r/Suicidewatch is a deserted wasteland so I guess I'll post here because I'm kinda lost here. I'm fifteen years old and a male and I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. I don't even know where the fuck to begin there's so much stupid shit going on. I don't enjoy school it makes me want to fucking die and even though I used to do good (not bragging but somehow I managed to land 3 college courses in 10th grade) and my grades are just plummeting and I don't want them to but I just don't want to care? I like to come up with stories or write  stuff down and I like adding and dividing stuff I guess but that's it. And the teachers say they care but I call bullshit. My parents got divorced recently and there are already three other people and two more dogs at my dad's house and my mom is pretty much a mess half the time. I don't even enjoy playing video games anymore. My first relationship was  toxic on both parts and my second one was me being a insecure peice of shit and ruining litterally the best thing that every happened to me, this was almost a year ago now Im not over it. Every time Im nice and flirt with a girl and it seems like they're flirting back it goes nowhere and I don't want to push it further and seem like a creep and  it makes me hate myself.

And if you weren't sold yet I sexted my first ex while she was dating someone and I don't feel bad because I think he's a peice of garbage. And I've probably forgot a million other things.

I just don't see the point of it. Nothing in school interests me, I don't have really any hobbies and even if I was in love I would feel like I don't deserve it or that they don't love me at all.

349,"I’ve always been insecure, I can’t remember a time I wasn’t. Since I was little I thought about how big my nose was. It was pointed out so many times by so many people, and the people that hurt the most that it came from was family and friends. “You have a witches nose” it’s sticks to me to this day. Or how I was called Casper or disco ball for my very white skin. I was also shunned by peers for the majority of my school life, I always moved too which didn’t help with friends. I feel uncomfortable in the body I’m in. And I can’t help but become so angry when I see someone who, in my eyes, is perfect. They have everything, a mom and dad, a house, money, the boyfriend, good career, smarts. I’m not sure if I’m a jealous and envious person. I definitely don’t want to be. I always remember others that are so beautiful and so smart, the top tier people. The ones who’d do something with their life and become a somebody. I’ve never felt like I am that. I know the problem lies in me. I’m the way I am because of me. And I don’t know how to become someone I can handle to look at in the mirror. I’ve suffered from body image issues as well. It’s embarrassing, I was a lot worse off in the past. I saw a monster every time I looked in the mirror, I eventually covered it with a blanket. I didn’t take that off for an entire year.

350,"First off, school. 
I'm studying my butt off,
Because long story short, I've been homeschooled since the 6th grade, and
My Mama meant well, but she didn't realize how you have to learn as such as the kids, and between her working and wanting to relax taking care of me, she thought putting me in one of the online schools was enough. 

No. Everything lacked structure, unlike public school. 
I used to be lazy, and would never do my work. 

Now, not learning anything since the 5th grade, I teach myself through Kahn Academy. 

I'm planning to finish my final year 
(August 2020) in Public school. 
I feel like it would look much better than if I were to graduate via GED.
(and much cheaper, too) 
That leads me to my main issue. 
Money. 

I live in the country. 
The closet Walmart is a 30 minute car ride. 
I cannot drive a car, because of my eyesight. 
I'm blind out of one of my eyes for the most part, and I have poor depth perception in my good eye, so I can't focus where I need to if I do drive. 

Multiple doctors have told me this. 
I'm fine with it, I don't have to worry about car insurance or gas or anything like that, and I could save more money up. 

On the other hand, I couldn't want a job more intensely than I do now. 
My plan was to buy a bike and a helmet, and of course go to where I need to an hour prior, but everyone treats me like I'm crazy when I bring the idea up. 

Sure, the weather would be a challenge, but it's not like I can rely on people. 
I'm absolutely not allowed to take an uber. 
My Mom says she'll figure something out,
But I feel as if she says that to stall. 
She has nothing figured out in regards to that. 

I completely get where she's coming from, but she could only imagine my frustration. 
My cousin had gotten his licence suspended, and he has to rely on family, and I could see them struggle. 

Between their work, and this that and the other, it's virtually impossible, and I don't want to bring them the stress. 
I don't know what I'm going to do.
My Mom can't pay for college, let alone medical school. 

Neither can I, but a job would absolutely help. 

I don't care how uncomfortable riding a bike is, it's just something that I have to get used to, especially living with my condition. 

I just have to convince my Mom that. 
As for college, I have no idea what I'm doing. 
I want to go to a good college, but I don't know if I'm good enough, especially in my situation.
What kind of work would look impressive to the colleges that I can do in one year? 

I just want advice telling me how could I help my situation. I'm a blessed person, but I face frusterarions as everyone else nonetheless.

352,"So recently my friend informed me that he has severe depression and opened himself up to me because I currently have a very mild depression state.

356,"Hey, so my issues are sort of like this:

1) Masturbation. I know it’s widely believed to be normal and healthy, but I’ve been involved since age 13, and there’s just..a few moments of pleasure, then brain fog, slight pain in muscles, sleep, and generally lethargic attitude. I also become overly angry etc, emotional response is multiplied.
I generally masturbate every three days (x3 times) but it’s definitely taking my grades down. I’ve tried NoFap, highest streak was 34 days and I just..gave up.

2) Porn. I use Reddit for it, usually. I know, it’s bad. I started off with hentai, got into painal and dark stuff, now my preference is back to where it was (vanilla) only not hentai. I believe I spend at least six hours a week on it. My porn preference is beautiful women, unfortunately.

3) Lack of commitment: I was an excellent writer. I left a half finished novella. I started NoFap. I left it off. I don’t know why. I just come back to porn.

I’m good with people socially. It’s just..I’m tired of this life. What do I do?",07Jan2020,1

358,"So nearly 2 months ago I decided to stop talking to my best friend of 2 years. I had (and maybe still have, not entirely sure to be honest) feelings for her. We knew each other back in highschool before I moved down to Florida but we never talked much back then. It wasnt until a year or two after I left that we really started talking over snapchat and other means. We had been talking for about a year straight over snapchat because she lived in Canada and I lived in Florida. I was going to be moving up there around February/March (2020) to pursue a life and relationship with her up there. She knew that I had feelings for her and claimed to have feelings for me too. I had never felt anything like what I did for her before and decided it was worth the risk to move up. She also planned a trip down to Florida to come and see me in November (2019). Anyways, a couple weeks before she was going to come down and see me she starts to become pretty distant. When I asked her about it she claimed that she was just busy with work and studying for midterms at school. I took her word for it and continued as normal. Then after her midterms I expected her to go back to normal but that never happened. She continued to be distant and I was concerned. It wasn't until I started to insist that something was wrong that she had let up that she had started talking to someone else up there and had caught feelings for him too. I was upset that she had kept it from me for a couple weeks and avoided me exclusively to talk to him more. I told her that she was going to have to make a decision because the way I saw it she couldn't have both ways. At first I wanted a decision quickly but I then realized that this was probably hard for her and I hadn't even given us the chance to spend some real time together and see where things would go. So I told her that I still wanted her to come down and spend some actual time together before she made her decision. Shortly before the trip she said that she was studying at the library but when I accidentally saw her location (through snap on accident) it showed that she was at someone's house (I assumed it was the guys house, and I was right). When I confronted her about it she said that she was at the Library but he picked her up after asking to hang out. I also told her that it was an accident that I looked at her location (because it genuinely was) and at the time she said that she believed me (this comes back later). Anyways I gave her the benefit of the doubt (but even today the timing of the situation still seems iffy to me and I believe that she lied to me about being at the library when she was actually at his place.) Then came the trip. She flew down and she stayed at my place. I took the guest room (because the pullout sofa in there was really crappy in there and I wanted to be a gentleman) and she took my bedroom where the bed was much better. Before the trip we had planned on sharing a bed but I figured that that wasnt going to be the case when she got down here due to everything that happened, at least for the meantime. We went to the beach on the first day and I really enjoyed myself. She was the same person that I talked to over the phone if not better and I was head over heels. I decided to kiss her on the way home and left it at that for the night. I made sure she was ok with it later and made sure it wasnt too much. She said she was ok with it. Anyways throughout the rest of the trip she didnt seem to show any interest. The trip wasnt anything like I had hoped it would be. A day after she went home she finally told me that she had decided to continue with the other guy and that she had kinda made her decision weeks before she came down when I told her that she would have to make a decision but again like always, she kept it from me. She didn't even have the decency to tell me to my face while she was down in Florida with me. She also told me that if I was already moved up there then she probably would have pursued it farther with me instead of him. This told me that she made the decision that was most convenient and easiest for her. One where she didnt have to say it to my face. She could just go back home and then do it over snapchat. It was that day that I stopped talking to her. I was sick of the lies and it was clear that she had little regard for my feelings as her so called best friend. Ever since that day I have thought about her everyday. I don't know what to do. I feel so empty. I miss my best friend and wish we could go back to before everything happened and just start over but I know that's never going to happen. Sometimes I get the urge to text her again but I know I would regret it afterwards. I want to move on but I also don't want to accept the fact that its over between us. I just feel so distraught.",07Jan2020,1
359,"So I woke up the other day and like a ton of bricks it hit me that this whole time a childhood hobby should have, could have, been paying my bills. Oh how joyfully I sipped my coffee while I began to research just what exactly is required in my state to do this thinking the worst it could be is maybe an apprenticeship to show Im worth my elbow from foot in it. The information is all right there although NYC and NYS often have different requirements for the same jobs, this time its just the same minor details that dont affect the final outcome unless I move into the city which will likely never happen. What slams me the hardest is to realize that NYS requires Schooling... like actual institution, pack ya' lunch, dont miss the bus, hoof it across campus schooling... This is a problem for me financially. Ive already half given up, looking into loans, grants and all that is extremely discouraging (when I was fresh outta high school my parents just pushed me into college , pushed HARD, told me it didnt matter that I didnt know what I wanted yet but it was important to be there that Id somehow magically figure it out from a lib arts classroom...) and all this financial burden of barely finishing THAT mess dang near 20 years ago reminds me how I simply cant afford it at my current age and situation, I am too old to do 2 jobs and school,... I just simply cant. So what this all boils down to is , does anyone out there know of any sort of grants or possibly ways to cover a simple 11,000 dollar school program ? Im not asking for handouts, dont even try(lol ye right) ill return it to sender... but I have paid taxes my whole life so taking a bit back from ol Sam doesnt bother me in the least. Ive filled out countless forms in the last couple days and talked to a thousand recruiters already who are all trying to sell me the school... in the end THEY are there to make money though, as I am trying to save it. Loans are not really an option either as even if i was somehow approved I still gotta eat and that just barely happens as is, anyone know of a better way ?

As it sits, I make great money ( low six figures with ot) but unfortunately am still classified as a part time employee who is able to work as many hours as I want. My dilemma lies in the fact that I have a four year degree in criminology and used to work as a data analyst, and I'm slowly missing a more meaningful job. Unfortunately, my fiance is not of the best health and I am the main provider for our family. Most of the other jobs that I could apply to are full time, but I would be taking a significant pay cut (40-50%).

I understand that I should be doing a job that I am passionate about and should be happy at my work, however at one point do I just accept that I make great money in an okay job and stick with it instead of switching it up.

I guess I'm looking for advice from people who have left a secure well paying job for something that's more of interest but stresses them out more financially.

Ofcourse I don’t mind if he’s bi but I don’t know why I have such a strong feeling that he is fully gay...one of my friends he is bi and he said that he thought he was gay when he first saw him. My boyfriend and I rarely have the time or money to have sex but it concerns me that he’s not eager to do anything sexual anymore .. and trust me at 21 most people’s hormones are all over the place. He also dresses very preppy and wears really tight fitted clothing (especially pants) but this doesn’t necessarily mean he’s gay i know that. He also grew up with all girls and didn’t really have a great relationship with his dad and is a total mamas boy. Hell mention occasionally to me if I would ever try anal (although this is normal) I’m just putting it in here just Incase it does mean something. Today I mentioned to him that my friend thought he was on the gaydar (google it) when he first saw him, and he looked surprised.. but he didn’t say my friend was wrong. He just asked what made him think that. He also jokingly romantically talks about one of his guy friends and calls him cute and things like that.

368,"My daughter is 4, and is in early childhood special education for developmental delay. She has just recently started being able to communicate with me at all. 

There was an incident the day before her last day before Christmas break. A little boy had called her names. She came home and had a melt down because of it. In the morning, she didn't want to go to school, so I kept her home while I contacted her teacher. Her teacher claimed she didn't know anything about it. I mentioned my daughter had mentioned a specific name, and her teacher got quiet for a moment then said it made sense and it was probably said very quietly. I was invited to bring my daughter to her class Christmas party and stay there with her. I eventually conviced my daughter to go, and when she got there she was hesitant at first, but did fine as long as she could see me. 

Today was her first day back at school after Christmas break. She went the entire 2 weeks of Christmas break without having a single melt down. As soon as she got home from school, she had a melt down. I asked her if something happened at school. She said yes, so I asked her to tell me about it. She said she isn't supposed to tell me. She was sobbing at this point because she's so afraid. After much assurance that nothing bad would happen to her if she told me, and some bribing, she told me a kid (by name) was yelling and had hit her in the face. I have verified this with a parent of another kid in her class, and this did happen.

My problem with this isn't just that I wasn't notified that my daughter was attacked at school, but also that she was threatened into not telling me herself. I don't intend to send her back to school until this is resolved, and she doesn't want to go anyway. I don't think talking to the teacher again will be productive. Who do I go to about this? How can I protect my daughter?",07Jan2020,1

370,"So I recently just made an account here solely for advice on this certain thing. I'm 18, kinda a recent HS graduate, and a busser/dmo for a pretty popular regional restaurant chain, and it is the first actual job I have ever had. I've only been working at it for a few months and I've seem to have fallen head over heels for one of my coworkers, who is a hostess/server who's been working there for about 5 months and is also my age and is in college. We've gotten to become pretty good friends so far, and I've even stupidly revealed my infatuation a little too early by asking her on a date which then I thought was a good idea for some reason as I was just kinda in the moment. Plus I must have read her wrong as she would tease me and smile whenever I caught her glance which to me didn't seem like just polite smiles, as well as calling me cute in front of her friends once after I said something she does is cute. She texted me and she told me she has a strict rule against dating coworkers and I told her I respect that. We are still cool and I still compliment her and we tease each other friendly, but I still really like her. She still gives me those smiles and it always confuses me which brings me here. I don't know how to proceed and I really do respect her rule and everything don't get me wrong but at the same time people still fall for each there despite stuff like that right? One of the other servers who she talks to a lot figured out I liked her and tried to be a bro by asking her if she thinks I'm cute or something. He also overheard her and another hostess mentioning texting and my name in a bubbly kind of way which could still be anything. He told me to just take it slow if anything is there at all and she might just be one of those girls who wants to wait till college is over and her life is together before starting a relationship which he thinks is stupid but I wouldn't think it is. She's also a devoted Christian and I am also a Christian, but just not as strict as her. I don't know how to proceed here as my signals are still mixed and I really cant ever get her out of my head. I always think of what to say to her and she is one of the most beautiful and sweetest girls I have ever honestly met. I'm not exaggerating when I say I have never had my heart race as fast as it does just knowing she is gonna be in work that day or my mood to instantly get better when she is there or I'm texting her no matter what is going on at the moment. I can't be anymore truthful on how amazing this person is in my eyes. It'd be very hard to just drop it and move on and be her friend and I don't have any problem with taking things slow if there can be something but I'm just confused if there is or could be anything at all. I don't know if I should keep trying for her or just let it be. Oh and I think the reason for her rule as far as I heard from the server dude I mentioned previously is because someone hit on her and made her uncomfortable about it at her last job. I don't make her uncomfortable as far as I know and I try to keep my feelings lowkey even though she knows about them and still likes to talk to me and tease just the same as before asking her out, as well as give those soft smiles and glances at me whenever we lock eyes. God I have never been more confused. Help.",07Jan2020,1
371,"It was my second time closing at the pizza shop I work at and this disgruntled couple came and yelled at me because their order was 'too greasy' (despite them wanting extra sauce but I digress). It technically isn't store policy for me to remake something just because they didn't like how it turned out if it was made correctly, and I tried to tell them that, but being a new 18 year old manager, I kinda choked up.

Its my default and it's what everyone at work calls me anyway). He didn't believe me and threatened to come to the store every day until he gets my name.

2. There’s been an opening for a position that would basically be a promotion. She tells us she didnt like it but we discovered she applied for it anyway. Why say one thing and do another?

3. An opportunity presented itself for a business trip abroad, and she was invited for it. Again she tells everyone she doesnt want to go, but from past experiences, we’re sure she’ll accept the invitation. 

4. She goes around telling about her recent trips and things she just bought, but if you’ve been around really wealthy people, you’ll feel that her attitude is just pathetic. 

5. She’s making a big deal out of her being part of a performance in company events complaining about the little things when we really do not care at all. I get that she’s really into performing but it gets annoying when she thinks that we have the same level of care about these events.

382,"First off, I call these people toxic because I do not have a word in my vocabulary that can correctly describe how these people are. 

Now for background: I am a 6ft tall 270lb male that lives in a rural town with only 1500 or so people. I also am very sensitive about my weight as my mother has had me on and off of diets since I was 11 (now 16) and have diagnosed anxiety and depression. With my town having such a small population, finding friends was difficult to say the least. I developed my friend groups through sports such as hockey and softball and was very tight with these people. I shared every thing with them, from my lowest lows to my highest highs, but now they are using that information against me. 

My worries all started about a year ago when the people in my groups started to exclude me and call me a variety of things, from spider pig to twelve piece meal. During this time I believed that it was something that I had done as I had just got out of a very low point in my life, my grandpas death. See, my grandpa was a huge part of my life and was the lonely thing apart from my brother that was keeping me sane. I looked up to him and when he passed I lost my shit, excluding myself from the outside world for days at a time and only coming out to eat. When I was back to school i thought that I would get my mind off of his passing by hanging out with my friends, but I was no longer one of them in their eyes. This attitude stayed the same until the start of hockey season, about 3 months later. At the start of the season instead of making fun of me, they would send videos of me in the shower to my classes and even the classes of the surrounding towns. Now the harassment was not isolated to one town. They are now moving up to physical violence where they will shove me into lockers, pin me down and strip me, and even step on my feet with skates.

I need advise on what to do because this group is the root of my anxiety and my therapist has said to remove the root of it all.",07Jan2020,1

She can't physically do a whole lot due to her health issues (i didn't mention she was a heart transplant recipient), so we're more than likely temp moving to my home state in a few weeks. It's making me sad, because i love her right to death, nothing can change my mind about that. Seeing her cry makes me want to because i don't know what to say besides the ""no matter what, i love you"", ""i don't think you're a failure"", etc. She doesn't like the idea of moving away, but she knows she needs out also. It's just really difficult with her health, and that she doesn't want to leave the family that does care about her. I wish i could stay strong, but i want to cry, because it's extremely difficult. I personally don't want to leave either, because there's some family that cares about us, and our church cares also, but it seems like everyone else doesn't seem to.

But the Apple Watch... kind of sucks. The battery life is awful, so I can’t use it for sleep tracking, and it doesn’t track steps in a fun way like the Fitbit did. I feel like I’m just wearing it to make my mom happy, but I truly don’t like it. 

What do I do? Do I tell her, or do I just suck it up and try to figure something out? Do I wear both the Apple Watch and the Fitbit? I could really use some advice, because at the moment I just feel shitty for not appreciating the gift, especially given how expensive it was.",07Jan2020,1
386,"(30/M) A couple of years ago, I got cheated on by my partner(29/M). It ended our relationship but we became friends instead. I’m grateful  because we were ill-suited as partners. Our friend dynamic is good, and I do *not* want to be partners *ever* again.

Problem is: I held onto that pain and anger for so long that I don’t want to *ever* be in a relationship again. When he admitted to me (then) that he cheated, I didn’t yell or scream. I just... shut down. I should have yelled. I let myself carry the anger for so long when it was his responsibility to carry the guilt.

I keep trying to open up to new dates but then get repulsed and disgusted when things get past the “friend zone”. I get completely disgusted from relationships because they feel “unsafe” (like a Dr Pimple Popper video). For a while I couldn’t even enjoy any “private time” to myself. It can get bad.

387,My female coworker and i just switched companies. It was common for our old boss would have male and female coworkers clean the public restrooms together (they were totally closed off for cleaning nobody using them). This particular coworker never had any problems being closed in the bathroom with me in-fact she frequently requested my help. At the new company i have my own office that is actually bigger than the previous companies public restrooms. Last week our boss asked her to go get something from me i had in my office. She stood in the doorway and asked for me to bring it to her. I told her other staff was allowed in the office. She replied she knew she was allowed in there she just felt awkward being in there. There is no other strange behavior or awkwardness between us. we actually are kinda close friends and occasionally even text outside of work so i know she doesn’t dislike me or find me personally awkward it’s literally only when im in my office.,07Jan2020,1

389,"I guess I should start by saying I’m a 24 y/o male who splits rent on a decent apartment with my father. We both work two jobs to keep the roof over our heads and living with each other comes easy. We have a great relationship, but I feel it’s time I live apart from my family.

Recently and I mean like really recently, my friends came into a great deal on a 5 bedroom house that is in the next town over near the water that would only be $2000 a month. Split between us all it would be $400 which seems like a steal. Move in day would be as quick as February 1st. Living with close friends in a nice neighborhood for easy money? Perfect.

The catch is that if I were to move out, my father wouldn’t be able to keep the apartment we’ve had for the last 5 years. He’s a 63 year old gentleman who spends a lot of time at home.
That being said, my concern doesn’t just lie with him losing the apartment but also losing a friend to come home to everyday. I’m afraid he might become depressed after I move out and he spends most of his days watching tv alone.

So my question is, should I feel guilty about leaving my father to his own devices if it means I can progress forward in life on a great deal with my friends or should I pass up this opportunity and hold out for another one in order to keep my father under the same roof as the last 5 years?

Also, should I bring this up to him at all? I feel as though if I had a conversation about the struggles brought on by moving out he would feel like he’s trapping me there.",07Jan2020,1

395,"So I'm 29 and there's this girl I've known for the past year... she's pretty cool and we get along well.

We work together at this retail store, but hardly work together because she's part-time.. After talking for a bit, I found out that she is still in high school.

Now don't ever seek out people her age, usually people mid-to-late-20's, but it seems superficial to discount her just because her age...

So she has previously told me how she wants to switch departments, and so the other day I told her how that department lost an employee and might need some help..

long story short, she wanted me to email the manager on her behalf and ask if they have any positions available..

I did just that, and later this week when we work together I plan on letting her know what the manager said, and also asking for her number to keep her updated if any positions open up again..
I genuinely want to keep her updated, but of course my primary reason is to have her number to keep in touch with her..

She's about to be 18 later this year. and I just want to stay in touch and hang out with her at some point. She's really cool and it feels wrong to discount her due to age.

I would love to get coffee with her sometime down the road, get to know her better.. there may be something special between us at the right time.

Eventually, she goes to bed, and I look back through our Tinder messages and her profile. She changed her bio again...she recently wrote that she was trans.

398,"I made a friend when college started and we started having friendship issues recently. Genuinely not sure if they’re a toxic friend or I’m just a bad friend. 

I’d say I’m a pretty busy person. I go to school full time and try to work as much as possible to help out my family financially. Aside from this, I am also active at a couple different organizations on campus including some officer positions. 

A couple of things I’ve realized recently but not sure if they care considered red flags. 

- When I first met this person, they had a lot of friends but over the years ended up burning bridges with everyone except me  
- Would often get offended or upset when I mention my best friend and say how they consider me a best friend but I don’t prioritize them the same 
- Say I never make time to hang out with them but when I do, they would make up excuses saying it’s a lazy day or how they do not want to hang our with me because I do not prioritize them enough 
- often get upset/angry if I do not reply to messages fast enough or online but not talking to them 

These past couple of months, I’ve been avoiding them because I get so anxious and afraid of them lashing out on me for being what they claim a bad friend. 
I generally like to keep all of my relationships positive and hate breaking ties with anyone. I feel like having anxiety just when I see their presence isn’t a good sign but I’ve always tried so hard with my friendships.

So, answers that come from that kind of crowd would be preferred so I can try to make sense out of this mindset.

I'll try to make a long story short. There is an administrator on a social server for a fandom that I love that hardly gets any recognition. I truly love the franchise that the server is based on, so the admin and I got along really well.

But we had a strong difference in opinion in our private messages. The admin firmly believes that any form of animated perversion in general or romantic attraction to animated child characters is an affront against society and needs to be condemned. While I'd never want to take part in any of that, I tried to keep an open mind enough to not judge the people who do. I don't think there's any problem at all in having perversion in anime; just don't do it to the child characters.

When I first spoke to the admin, I also believed that it shouldn't be considered problematic for weirdos who were into that kind of thing to just fantasize whatever they want on ONLY the ANIMATED characters since that way nobody gets hurt.

The admin cut me off from the server and everyone in it (some of which used to be my friends, but since that server is the only place to talk about the franchise, and no apology I give is ever enough. Even after I vehemently took back what I said and provided strong, verbal reasons why I no longer believe in my stance. I know I was stupid to not pick and choose my battles, but I never imagined this level of intolerance from anyone. I later found out that I was warned by the admin to stop, but the message didn't get sent to my inbox until a day later. I tried to explain that, they don't care.

But then I find out that other people who don't think in the way of their hive mind mentality and show a strong difference in opinion.... get axed as well. This server tries to keep ""problematic situations"" out of it entirely, deleting every trace that they can find, and handling it privately with the troublemaker. While this keeps things tidy, it also makes it so no one who ever challenges their authority has a chance to defend themselves and will be screaming to a void. Is this an injustice? Is it hypocrisy? If it's not and I'm somehow the one who's wrong, please explain to me why?",07Jan2020,1
404,"Bit of a long one, folks. Tldr at the bottom.

I have a group of friends that I've known for 10+ years, since we were kids. One friend, we'll call her Hannah, is starting to worry the rest of us with her recent relationship choices. 

Hannah has been attracting boys since she was really young. She's always been very pretty. She had a several ""boyfriends"" from 3rd to 7th grade, though those can't really count as real relationships. 

Her first long-term relationship was in freshman year of high school, with a boy she hardly talked to (I'm talking once every few weeks max) because he moved to a different school. It took months of convincing to get her to end it.

Her next relationship was with a boy who started out nice, but started being hostile towards her friends and rude to her family for years before she ended it for good. We found out years later he sexually assaulted her.

Her most recent long term relationship started after graduation, with a man we finally thought would treat her right. And he did, for a year, until he started neglecting her and making her feel awful about herself. He broke up with her over text, and we found out months later that he had been treating her like garbage for months. It really affected her self esteem and hurt her for the long term. 

That was about 7 months ago. For the past month or so, she has been pursuing another man. Our friend, who we'll call Bella, goes to college with him, who we'll call Zack. Hannah only knows him through Bella. Zack is sweet, but he's also high maintenance, frustrating, stubborn, and completely unreliable. He also has never had a long term relationship, has no interest in marriage, and is a known player amongst his friends. Hannah wants to date for marriage and has virtually nothing in common with him. He lives 4 hours away when he isn't on campus. It greatly bothers her when he takes hours to reply to texts and she's jealous that he's playing a romantic lead in a play next month and has to kiss a girl onstage. Neither of them are bad people, but Bella (who knows him far better than Hannah or I) and I have discussed it and we both agree that pursuing this is obviously a bad idea. Hannah is clearly much more interested in him than he in her (she downloaded duolingo so she can learn his mom's native language. They aren't even official.)

My friends and I think that Hannah has a constant need for a boyfriend, and it is really starting to damage her mental health. She hasn't been without one for longer than 6-8 months. She was diagnosed with anxiety and depression during her last relationship. She went to therapy briefly, but hasn't been recently. Zack is the first boy in a while who is genuinely nice to her, and he is very attractive. He is attracted to her too, but Hannah doesn't seem to understand that a relationship needs more than that. And really, Zack is just the most convenient boy to start a relationship with, since our friend group has known him since Bella started college, and really the only male friend within her reach. He would have gone after a different friend of ours if Hannah wasn't single, and has flirted heavily with all of us, myself included. My friends and I have been wanting to express our concern for her, but we're afraid that she'll misinterpret our meaning, or feel attacked. How do we bring up our concerns without her feeling cornered or shamed?

Tldr: one of my friends since childhood has an unhealthy need to have a boyfriend, and it is causing her to make choices that will hurt her in the long run. How do I and her other friends bring up our concerns with her gently?",07Jan2020,1

410,"Okay so here’s the story: 

My brother, boyfriend and I decided to get an apartment together. We went to the complex to see if we could even get approved as it’s a nicer and more expensive place than the apartment we live in now. 

So, we get there and then apartment manager made it seem as though we had to sign a lease while we applied as well (and the way she was explaining things was super confusing and was talking in circles.. we’re not the smartest at these things either.) 

I was adamant about my brother not being on the lease. I liked knowing that, if he needed to, he could move out if it was too much (he’s only 19 and still lives with my parents). But she swore up and down that he should be and was kind of aggressive about it.. and said we could switch it later, which we found out we clearly can’t. 

We wanted the move in date to be a few days before our March lease is up at our current place. The receipt from my credit card payment for the for the application fees even says “March 2/2” meaning March move in two bedroom 2 bathroom. Yet, when I called last week to make payment on our deposit (which is 1350, a full months rent even though she SWORE it would only be 600 bucks 🙃) she said she “locked us in for a February date” so I have to move in at the end of February although I wanted a March move in because it will save us money with no prorated feb rent and not paying a full months rent for March.. the copy of the lease we signed also has the term dates blank.

We’ve just had multiple problems before even moving in. They seem shady and while we do love the actual townhome/apartment and all the space that comes with it, we don’t like the people who run it. We’ve been wanting out of this ever since we got approved and found out we’d be paying a full months rent for the deposit plus 500 pet deposit fee. My boyfriend also got his guaranteed overtime hours cut at work and our income is about $400 less a month and we’re super stressed wondering how we’re gonna pay for this. Also, my brother did back out so now I have to reply on my other brother to pull through to be a roommate. 

Does anyone have any advice?? I’ve paid 900 so far but at this point they can keep it as long as I can get out of this lease and find something cheaper.",07Jan2020,1

I have a friend who is a property owner. His grandmother died and he inherited a house right near our University. He uses it two nights a week, but lives in his family home the other two nights. It has a spare room. 

I think my only shot at getting a stable arrangement until I have employment and a paycheck, is if my friend allows me to rent the spare room from him at below market rent. 

He currently isn't a landlord and doesn't seem to want to be in a general sense (ie, I'm not asking his business to suffer). 

I think he may feel a bit awkward about accepting any money from me in my current situation/it may make our friendship weird, but I would feel awkward not paying anything at all. 

I would be happy to up my rent once I can pay something more usual, or to look at moving out once I can afford somewhere else if he would prefer that.

20mins later he started kissing on my neck and left a huge hickey and i felt like i was too scared to say anything because i didn’t want to seem like i was trying to ruin the night for anyone because i was already younger than everyone there and then he asked me to come to the bathroom with him and i tried making up an excuse that i had to call my brother and i went to an area away from everyone and just acted like i was talking on the phone and he followed me and asked me for a goodbye bye and i stupidly gave him one

He found an apartment that is 700 dollars a month. He told me that he will pay the majority of the bill and I'll cover the rest.

I wasn't always in a good place, but I was okay for the most part.

After getting off, I experienced my worst fear of becoming paranoid, extremely depressed and isolated. I didn't want anyone to see me so depressed and angry and insecure. Its okay for your friends to see you in a tender place, but I didnt feel or act like myself. I truly lost sense of myself it was horrible lol.

Before Christmas I received a Microsoft account alert saying someone had attempted to sign in and when I logged in myself, I found a few security events regarding auto-syncs and logins that weren't me. In fact they were based in NYC (I'm British). The same time, someone managed to get into my Facebook as well, possibly the same person but I can't know.

I changed all necessary passwords and tried to move on. Then later, on the 29th, I signed up for the online map creation kit, Inkarnate, with my Google details at about 8pm. Three hours later I got a Google security alert about an unauthorised login attempt from Budapest of all places. I changed those passwords too and went through all of my sensitive accounts like banking and the like and changed those, but I found no changes there.

As of now, nothing else has happened until this morning. Yesterday I enable two-step auth on my iPad and added my mobile number. This morning I received an obvious scam text to my mobile from ""google"", which I blocked and deleted immediately. 

I'm honestly quite scared that someone may be targeting me. Does this sound like it could be the case and if so, what can I do?
I welcome any advice.",07Jan2020,1

428,"A few days ago my good friend and I decided to hang out and she had asked me if I had done edibles before and I replied with I hadn’t so we thought it’d be fun to do that together. Something y’all should know is that I’ve known this girl for about 3 years and we’ve both told each other before that we have feelings for each other but to my knowledge I think those feelings have worn off for the both of us. So back to the story, we eat about two brownies each and she thinks that’s the okay amount because she’s done this before and I go along because I didn’t really care, and for the first two hours it was chill and we were having a good time. We chilled and nothing crazy happened but after about two hours she gets silent and starts telling me that she’s having a bad trip. I’m worried about her but I start to also have a bad trip so I’m in no position to take care of her really. Long story short is that we were freaking out a lot that night and not enjoying our time. I don’t remember a lot of what happened but I can say that we both are extremely embarrassed of how we acted. She eventually dropped me off at my place and I was still pretty high when she dropped me off so we didn’t really talk on the way to my house but that last thing she said to me was “be safe”. I wake up the next morning and text her “last night was crazy” but I don’t get a reply which isn’t crazy because it was early but time goes on and I try to text her later that day but I notice my message doesn’t deliver so I check to see if she blocked me on Instagram or anything like that and sure enough she blocked me on everything. I’m just kinda sad because I was really good friends with this girl and now I don’t have way to tell her that no matter what happened that night, I don’t think differently of her. I’ve thought about making a new Instagram just to message her and explain that she shouldn’t be embarrassed and all that but I think that might be crossing the line. I’m just curious on what you all think I should do at the point.",07Jan2020,1
429,"asically, I met this guy on bumble right! It was going pretty good, like conversation was going good then he told me he's bicurious and that's fine of course! We went on our first date and it was amazing! We were both open books talking about our life and everything, he told me that he was very into me and was willing to go on another date! I was extremely hyped because I was his first male date you know and it went well! And next week happens and I tell him if we can hangout on Saturday because I would like to see him again. Then he said of course! And he also mentioned that he like our first date. So at my state of mind I'm thinking to myself that he's totally into me and wants to hangout again and that's completely fine. Then he canceled Saturday for our date at the park because he apparently went to his aunt's house and had to help out. And of course being me, I said ""don't worry about it things happen :)"" and afterwards that he said ""what about sunday?"" I said yes of course! Then we left it as that. Sunday comes up and I ask ""what time should I get ready?"" I sent that text around2-3pm d he opens it around 11pm saying ""seems like not"" then he later apologized and said that he wants to meet tomorrow to hangout at the park. (I wasn't heated about this at all because I don't know what happened and maybe something came up) afterwards telling me to get ready around 5. Its Monday and I got ready at 4! I was hyped and everything until he said he would be late and will come around 6. (I was like okay understandable he is at work!) Then its 6pm until 6:20pm he comes and we head to the park. And we talk for a good 2-3 hours and it was awesome! Until we got in the car and he's driving me back home. I asked a question about what's this gonna turn out to and is this gonna head towards a relationship? Then he said that he unfortunately now doesn't want a relationship and would wants one in the future?( I respect that so much because of course it's his choice not mine) He also told me that he doesn't want to waste my time.( In my head I'm thinking.... how are you wasting my time? Because I definitely like spending time with him already) I just told him in the car that I understand what he saying.(I'm pretty bad at saying stuff atm I know, I know ,it seems stupid of me to not saying atm but it took me time to reflect on it) he gave me a hug at the end. Then he took off. Reason why I'm putting this our here is because I need help really. I'm not sure what to do because I seriously like spending time with his constant laughing,the sarcasm, his hilarious stories, and the fact that he was just so nice to me. I just wanted to tell him that hes not wasting my time because I truly wanted to hangout with him and if I wasn't interested I wouldn't be doing this. I also wanted to say that I completely understand on waiting for future on wanting a relationship, I just kinda want to be one of options on wanting to date someone, when he gets the idea of course. Now when I'm typing this I feel really weird. I would just like some advice on this because im not completely sure what to do! I'm wiling to text him on Friday about how I feel after the car ride. Because as I said it takes me time to collect everything so I could put it out there and not feel like I'm holding something back. I would really love some advice! Have a great day everyone :)!",07Jan2020,1

I don't know if I've been reading these signs wrong or what but this is what I picked up from her : 

1.) She constantly touches she , flirts with me when we are in a group , sits next to me when we are in a group and maintains eye contact

2.) She told me her mother likes me and that she is glad that her mother does . She dropped hints about guys who liked her but didn't make a move on her 

3.) She goes out her way to tease me and be with me. Recently we played Never Have I Ever and she drank to a question about finding someone attractive in the room (she only knew me there)

4.) She does many other small things , laugh at boring jokes , hangs out with me , builds sexual tension , when a joke is made in a group she immediately looks at me and she even said once that she knows I have a crush on her 

My friends said that she told them she only considers me a friend and that she doesn't know if I still like her . They were shocked because they too have seen all of these signs and thought that there was a mutual feeling .

Once I tried to ask her out but I didn't say date , she pushed for it to be a group outing instead so maybe she doesn't want to be a lone with me . Her words "" I don't want my mom to be suspicious and think that we are dating""

I was about to ask her out today but these signs and what she is saying , is giving me conflicting thoughts . Am I reading these signs wrong guys ?",07Jan2020,1

434,"I’m (22F) a college student sharing an apartment with two lifelong friends (20F &amp; 19F). These two friends only met one another just before moving in together but they immediately hit it off. Great, right??? Wrong. They eventually ended their friendship with me and we are now on bad terms. I need help figuring out the best way to go about this situation. But first, let me fill in some details:

We live in a 2 bedroom, 2 bath, 1008 sqft apartment. My two roommates share the master bedroom that has a large walk-in closet and is twice the size of my bedroom. Needless to say, we pretty much have an equal amount of personal living space. We all share the kitchen and living room, as well as hallway closets and in-unit laundry. 

Now for the tricky part. My parents fully furnished the entire apartment. . . That includes: the dishes and silverware, pots &amp; pans, microwave, coffee maker, large sectional sofa, large living room rug, living room tv and surround sound, etc. Oh and THEIR QUEEN-SIZED BEDS were supplied as well! One more thing, the deposit on the apartment was also paid for for them!

My parents saw no problem in helping out two young adults who have just moved out on their own and have been very near and dear to our family. And no, my family is not wealthy. My parents moved out of the country for work a few years ago and had to leave behind furnishings. These left-behind-furnishings are what is in our apartment right now. They were not bought new but were still in very good condition. 

Now, both of these roommates are extremely immature and very self-centered. They drink to the point of inebriation at least once a week. They invite reckless friends into the apartment without asking or even warning me. They’ve severely scratched and burned my pots and pans after I’ve asked them to be careful and use appropriate cooking utensils. They smoke weed in the apartment and don’t air it out so now furnishings have started to smell (I recently spent $250 to have our sectional cleaned). One of the roommates constantly has friends staying the weekend and monopolizing the living room. And they drank at least $75 worth of my alcohol without asking me while I was away one weekend and never paid me back. Honestly, the list goes on. 

Recently we’ve had a roommate (my younger sister) move out. My sister had planned on moving to a different city in December of 2019 and everyone was well aware of this prior to signing the lease. They were also aware that the rent would be going up for them when she left. We moved in to this apartment in August 2019. Since then, my sister and I have been paying half the rent and the two other roommates have each been paying a fourth of the rent. Sounds fair, right? After my sister moved out, my parents and I figured that I’d pay $50 more for my own room while also keeping in mind that we furnished the whole apartment and each roommates personal space is equal in size. 
After configuring this and sharing this with the roommates, they retaliated and said that I should still be paying half the rent because I have my own room and they have to share (even though they jumped at the chance to share a room when we were moving in). 

My family is so beyond baffled that these two lifelong friends would completely disrespect me and the things that they have been supplied with at my family’s expense. I’ve tried reaching out to them to discuss the rent and understand where they’re coming from when they say they want me to pay half the rent. They’ve begun talking negatively about me to other people and are avoiding my phone calls. 

To top it all off, I’ve been out of town the last 3 weeks to help my parents move. While I’ve been gone, they’ve neglected to feed my cat so I had to ask my grandmother that lives 40 minutes away to check on her every few days. They’ve been parking in my garage that I pay separately for, again, without asking. And one of the roommates started SLEEPING IN MY BED so that the other roommate could have alone time in the master bedroom with her boyfriend that lives out of state.

I’m so beyond done with this whole situation. How can two people that have been a part of my life for so long take complete advantage of my family and act so selfish and disrespectful?

The three of us roommates are signed on the lease as well as my mom who is a co-signer. 
I want them to move out. I wouldn’t mind moving out, myself, but they aren’t able to pay my family back for the deposit so it’s unlikely that I can leave. It’s impossible for me to live with them at this point. I know I don’t have the right to force them out since they’re on the lease. I also want to avoid getting the leasing office involved. 
How can I navigate this situation? What would you do if you were in my position? How would you go about getting them to leave?

Side note: they have been paying the rent, however, I highly doubt they will pay for their thirds of the rent this next month.",07Jan2020,1
435,"

So for basically the past 5 years of my life I have liked this one girl who I met in freshman year of high school. She is amazing and we both become close friends. Biggest regret of my life was not asking her out on date (little did I know she liked me) and fast forward she is no longer in my life and it’s impossible to speak to her. I don’t even know if she is alive and it desperately haunts me. Everyone I talk to has moved on and forgotten her but I can’t, she meant everything to me. Even not seeing or talking to her for 2 years now and I still deeply like her. I can’t move on, I’ve never liked anyone close to her and I can’t forget her, even though I think she forgot me. Am I in love or am I crazy? Please give me advice. Thank you.",07Jan2020,1
436,"I work for a motel in Oregon and when I was first hired, I was told I'd be full time. I was not, at the time, given full time hours unless it was needed. As time passed I was scheduled steadily for 40 hours a week, and once gaining the night audit position it wasn't uncommon for me to gain an hour or two in OT a month. Recently, my hours were cut since corporate said 10 hour days weren't okay (I was working 4 10 hour shifts a week) and I was not given a 5th day, so I'm down to 32 hours and will be unable to afford food/medication without that extra 8 hours.

After all this time, as well as being told over a year ago that I'd been officially made a full time employee by a former GM, I was told by our MOD (standing in for our on-leave GM) that I'm not full time and she doesn't think it would be ""possible"" for me to get those hours back. I doubt she has even attempted to make a change considering she has proven herself not trustworthy to all of us. Even so, is it legal for me to have been under ""part time"" all this time even if it's been nearly 2 years of working full time hours? I'm not sure if I've been denied any benefits, but honestly I don't care about that. I care about being able to afford to take care of myself. I'm very nervous about calling our area manager about it since I feel to a guy like him my problem is unimportant... But I think I need to at this point. And about more than my hours, this MOD has become a major problem for our workplace. We are all very close but she has damaged our morale so badly.",07Jan2020,1
437,"I'm no stranger to mental illness, I have depression, mild PTSD, and suicidal tendencies, I had my own suicide planned for March of this year but my two best friends (one of which is now my girlfriend) I dropped those plans, it's fair to say I owe them both my life and I wouldn't be here without them, or at least not for much longer.

My girlfriend and I started dating a month ago, we've been friends for many years but finally told each other how we actually felt, and it turned out we both felt the same, since then we've both fallen head over heels for each other, honestly, she's the best thing to happen to me in my short miserable life and I don't know what I would do without her, I want to spend the rest of my life with this girl, no one else makes me feel so safe to be vulnerable, I've told her things I've never even admitted to myself, I've never felt so genuinely loved and wanted by anyone in my life, I love her more than I love anything. 

Over the years of knowing each other we've been very slowly pulling down each other's emotional walls and dragging out our deepest traumas, it's been a good thing, we're helping each other deal with things we've both suppressed for years, but now that we're dating that emotional digging and wall breaking down has sped up to breakneck speed, and I think last night I dug too deep too fast.

She told me plain and simple that if I wasn't here she would have no problem ending it, now she didn't say she had plans to end it as long as we're together, and that's what scares me to my core, now it's worth noting that this was not said in an effort to manipulate me, or at least I'm very sure it wasn't, it was said out a genuine want to confess it and have someone else hear it. 

I don't know how to handle this, I can barely keep myself afloat, while I believe its highly, HIGHLY unlikely we'll ever break up, there's always that slight possibility, not to mention I could get hit by a bus tomorrow, I want her to be okay without me in her life, she says that the main thing that makes her feel like this is that she bases her self worth on how much meaning she can give to others, (this next part is me guessing at what's going on inside her head) she's given me a lot of meaning and helped me a lot, I'm the only person she's ever been fully and completely close to emotionally, therefore if I wasn't here (and the feeling that she's helping someone in a big way) she would have no reason to live, so it's not really that she can't live without *me,* its that she can't live without the *feeling* I give her. 

I asked her to promise me that she would try to find other reasons to want to live other than me, I told her I'm okay with being the only reason for right now, but eventually, I want her to be able to stand alone, just in case something should ever happen to me, I promised I'd help her with this as best I can, I also made her promise to tell her therapist about this, which she agreed to.

&amp;#x200B;

Currently, my only plan is to try to get her out of her shell a little and introduce her (and myself by extension) to a new group of friends, I'm hoping that getting to know other people and being close with other people outside of me will help give her meaning, but god if anyone has any more ideas of how I can help and support her, I'm all ears, like I said at the start of my post, I can barely keep myself from killing myself, I don't know how to hold up another person without drowning myself.",07Jan2020,1

Things have been progressing between us and i'm wondering if you think a long distance relationship could work? I feel like it can since we are both awkward so it makes it easier to get to know each other when we aren't actually talking in person.

I do want to meet her eventually though and potentially live by her in a few years if we do date, since i want a fresh start anyway.

441,"Good evening all! I am posting this in a couple other subreddits as well that apply more specifically to my position, but I wanted to open up all of my options and get as much feedback/critique as I could!  


Me:

* 26m
* High School Graduate, No Post Secondary Education/Training
* Currently working as a Night Auditor for a large hotel
* Excels in Organization, Customer/Guest Services, Proactive (I've been recognized at work for my protectiveness to guest's situations to prevent problems from occurring, as well as the needs of my hotel to prevent problems from arising in other departments when short staffed)
* Struggles with staying on task/severe ADD that I am on medication for, always stretching myself thin trying to do more than is necessary for myself/my position, doesn't handle customer/guest resolution well when being demeaned/yelled at (especially for problems outside of my control because it technically all is when you just work behind a desk)
* Interests: Computers (however, there is no way I can sit still long enough to learn programming in a college environment/apply it in a career field without staying medicated the rest of my life), Customer/Guest Services, Finances, Management, Business Administration/Clerical Work

Current position involves:

* 11.50/hr, +1 shift differential, full benefits, PTO accrual, possible growth into management role (but not guaranteed a management position unless someone quits/is terminated)
* 401 rooms that, when a large percentage are occupied, causes a lot of stress/headaches as guest call/come down to the front desk to complain/vent/yell/torment me because they are paying ""x"" amount of dollars to be here and shouldn't be dealing with it and it's in my hotel so I need to fix it right now before they resolve it themselves
* Normally little downtime when occupancy is increased (50% or higher), but in cases like tonight where it is lower (50% or below) then I am able to get on reddit, facebook, or do whatever I want to take some personal time during the night to breath and relax for once without getting yelled at and treated worse than dirt despite only wanting to help someone

(I am venting a lot, and keep referencing how I am treated, but with 3rd shift hotel, a predominate amount of my issues relate to noise complaints because it is a family hotel and for some reason, tired people become extremely cranky and take it out on us at the front desk.)

* I have some really great people I get to work with/communicate with on a regular basis, and that is always a hard thing for me to leave behind
* I am one of two current Auditors, when ideally we want three so we can have 2 per shift. My second auditor is looking at leaving, which leaves me, and if I left, there is nobody, and I would feel absolutely terrible about that!

Alternative position involves:

* $13.00-$13.50/hr (haven't been told a set number yet,) full benefits, I believe PTO but I don't have all the details, a set schedule, Franchise vs Corporate/Finance Investor Owned so little growth opportunity
* Closer to home vs my current position by at least 7 minutes (more depending on traffic)
* 108 rooms that is geared more towards travel/business folk (to my understanding)
* A lot of downtime each night (which would allow me to study something, work on my photography, watch plenty of Amazon Prime/Disney+/YouTube/whatever)
* I would have a set schedule of Sun - Thurs, and would be the only Auditor per shift due to the volume.

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly don't know what to do in terms of the position opportunity that I have. I love where I am at predominately, despite the constant headache of the guests we deal with when they are upset. However, I love the thought of having more downtime to focus on the things I enjoy.  


Career-wise, I don't have a clue what I want to do or where to go or how to even focus/figure this out. This is why I am ultimately posting this. I don't mind working the hotel/guest service industry, especially if I could ever eventually move up and eventually own my own one day. I just don't have a clue what to do, where to go, or how to find my passion/purpose.   


I greatly appreciate everyone's assistance in this. Your time, effort, and presence ultimately mean the world to me right now and I appreciate everything you do to help me find my way in life!

Cheers to you and a new year!",07Jan2020,1
443,"Complimentary heads up about being a first time poster, and not a native English speaker.

Well first of all, let me write a bit about myself.

Im a 23/M, living with my girlfriend of 2 years. 

As my family background, I grew up in a lower middle class family, where I’ve been physically abused by my Dad for the slightest mistake I’ve made, other than that he worked everyday til late night, so I didn’t have much contact with him, except on the weekends where the abuse continued. This might be relevant later on.

When I was a teen, I didn’t really have any friends, the one thing I could escape to was video games. When I started going to high school, I discovered weed as a new thing to escape to. I didn’t have to listen or care about anything, I was content if I had money (or stole some from mom or her bf) for weed, and video games. Eventually I dropped out of school, started working in a shoe store, and I didn’t care, I just wanted money for weed. No feeling of purpose. No dreams. No goals.

Now I didn’t really have to fight hard for anything in life. I learned English through video games or movies, I got a car from my dad in my late teens, but I just feel like he’s trying to compensate for what he did when I was a kid. One thing that stuck to me ever since then, was weed. I was an avid smoker, several joints a day, being high from morning til evening, but financially I just can’t handle it anymore, and my gf can’t either, since she can’t just watch me destroy my life, I’m trying to stop now, which made me realise the feelings I have, and I came down hard with the fact that I just wasted about 10 years of my life. 

I managed to get my High School Diploma in 2019, but then again I didn’t really have to study for it. Now, that I’m not smoking anymore, I have this overwhelming feeling of being behind, not having aspirations, not having any goals, or clear views on what I want my career to be. I never moved from my hometown. I feel like I didn’t achieve anything, meanwhile people my class are already graduating uni.

Putting the suicidal thoughts behind, I feel like a big part of the problem is that I didn’t really have to fight for anything in my life, or if I needed to be good at something, I just gave up. I played classical music for 9 years, but in those 9 years I switched instruments 5 times because I got bored, and I just couldnt be arsed to bother going to a higher level.

We had a big argument about all of this with my girlfriend last night, and I’m really feeling depressed and suicidal even as I’m writing this.

I don’t know how to work/try hard.

Where do I begin, would you have any advice for me?

445,"So earlier tonight my recently ex-girlfriend and I were having sex at her house (we have had a very toxic on-again off-again relationship over the past two years) and she said something that pissed me off to the point where I stopped in the middle of having sex with her and tried to leave to go home. She grabbed my hundred dollar vape mod off the bed and was standing naked in her door way and wouldn’t let me leave and wouldn’t give me the vape. I picked up her phone from the nightstand and told her if she didn’t give me my property back then I was going to leave with hers. She stepped aside and told me to go ahead. I did and told her not to come to come to my apartment unless she’s ready to be reasonable. 

I drove the 10 minute drive home, and when I got home she was already there. Do not ask me how, I haven’t figured that part out considering she was still butt naked when I left her house and I took what I thought was the quickest way home, I parked next to her car and she wasn’t in it. I tried to open my door but it was locked. I tried to start unlocking the door and when I did, she opened it in my face and stood in the doorway she let my two dogs out the front door into townhouse community I live in (getting almost 300 pounds of Rottweiler back inside when they don’t want to is an entire ordeal in itself). After the dogs were out back inside after chasing them down. I told her to give me my property back and I would give her hers. She wasn’t interested in that apparently. 

I continued to make the same offer. She started screaming at me in front of my neighbors, one of whom was outside taking her dog out. I told her that I would call the police so they could sort it out. She then tried to leave which would actually force me to get the law involved considering that we had each other’s property and I was honestly hoping to avoid that. I pushed her car door shut and she gave me a mean right hook to the left eye. My first reaction was to give her a little push kick back. Not hard at all. Just hard enough to put some separation between her and me. The neighbor with the dog cane running over because all she saw was her get pushed back and said she was going to call the police. I told her to. 

After that, we were standing there waiting for the police to come. I was standing behind her car and she was standing about 10 feet away. I told her we could avoid all of this if she could just put my vape on the back of the car. I then put her phone on the back her car and backed away. She didn’t move. After about a minute of both of us standing about 10 feet from the car, I went and picked it back up and walked under my balcony over the front door. She got into the passenger side of her car. I figured she was willing to talk, since she didn’t get into the drivers side, so I went up the the drivers side and tried to open the door. It was locked. I knocked on the window and told her I was willing to talk it out and hopefully by the end we would be cool with each other. She wasn’t willing to do that. She sat there blowing my vape into the window where I was standing. Normally my temper isn’t bad, but that set me off and I kicked the side of her car with the steel toe boots I was wearing. Dumb decision. I know. Luckily it didn’t do any damage. 

She left. I followed her home about 2 minutes later. I knocked on her door knowing that her room mate would be the one to answer. She did. She immediately got in my face yelling about how I needed to get off her property. I told her I’m not leaving without giving her back her phone and time getting my property back. She said she would go talk to her into doing that. Took about 5 minutes of me standing in the rain for her to finally agree. We made the trade and I left. 

THIS IS THE PART WHERE I NEED THE ADVICE.

As I was pulling into my complex, she started texting me saying things like how she was drunk and I forced myself onto her when we were having sex and that I was completely beating the shit out of her in the middle of my driveway. She wasn’t drunk whatsoever. I don’t even know if she drank. If she had been, it was a negligible amount. I have text receipts of her inviting me over, although sex was not explicitly mentioned. She told me to come over for an hour or two at around 11pm. After she sent those things, I asked her why she would try to completely ruin my life with a lie and she kept texting me as if I was the one lying. We both tried to draw a timeline of what happened, but of course she worded hers to sound completely like she was innocent in the situation and that she’s a rape and domestic violence victim. Even when I tried to reason with her she kept saying the same things. 

What I am now worried about is that she will get drunk and go to the hospital for a rape kit. And she will then file charges of domestic violence and date rape when those are not even close to what happened.

 I have never struck a woman until tonight and it was in self defense. I have never done anything where sexual consent could even be considered questionable. I now am going to have a black left eye and could be potentially facing prison time right before a huge job interview I have this week. 

What are my options? What are my rights? Should I preemptively go file a police report? Because that seems like it would help, but I could also see how it could hurt. Should I just wait and see what happens? I’m going to see if there’s any CCTV in the complex, but I’ve never seen a camera in the 6 months I’ve lived here. I am just completely lost and this is stressing me out to no end. Please help.

He keeps saying he will change and doesn’t change, and she keeps forgiving him and letting him back in.

454,"Starting All Over


I[31M] dated my ex [28F] for almost 5 years. We lived together for about 3 years of that time. She ended things with me in February due to my drinking and behavior. We briefly decided to reconcile in the summer, and it didn’t last.

I have two children from a previous marriage. I have joint custody(1 day during the week, every other weekend, Christmas breaks, summer break, etc.) My ex wanted to continue to stay in their lives when we broke up, but I wouldn’t allow it. I couldn’t handle her being in their lives if we weren’t going to be together. It was too hard for me.

During our time apart. We’ve both improved ourselves. She’s gotten a place of her own. She went back to school and is almost finished with her program. She spends a lot of time with friends and family. I’ve gotten a really good job. I got help for my drinking. I have been diagnosed with PTSD(due to a past accident) and depression. I’m about to buy a house for myself and my kids. My ex always tried to help with these issues. She did a lot for my family and for me. 

We didn’t speak for months due to my drunken behavior. But I recently reached out to her to tell her my diagnosis and all the changes I’ve been making. I wanted to thank her for all she did. She blames herself for everything and I wanted to apologize for the things I’ve put her through, because it’s been a lot. But most of all I want to start over. I want to marry her. I want to be a family again.

She says that part of the reason she left was that she didn’t want the kids to see an unhealthy relationship. She misses them very much but said she doesn’t know how we could ever explain her being gone for almost a year. She is very supportive of me getting help and tells me to focus on my kids and staying sober. We talked about PTSD and I hoped it explained why certain things happened the way they happened.

She’s the best thing for me and my kids. I want to completely start over. But she says she doesn’t know if it would be healthy. I want her to know it will be.

So there was a guy who had a group of friends. He was nice at first. We didn’t have any group to do a work project and I asked to him and he accepted. When I had problems resolving doubts he answered them nicely. His friends like and liked us too. But the problem is that he is the “leader”

But then is like he started hating us. He was not nice anymore. He didn’t look me in the eye when  I was talking to him. Another example is that my friend had a class with him and instead of staying with her he left her going to the next class completely alone. Another day a friend of his insisted about waiting for us to go to the next class but he didn’t want it.

Why this change of attitude?

463,"Triggers: Stalking, abuse
I feel super violated. I know it's a long text, but I really need help! 

A little context: 3 years ago I (33F) bought a car with my husband (34M). We wanted a brand new car, so we went to the dealership and made the deal. 
I was 29 and had 2 kids already by then. Now I'm pregnant with our 3rd baby. 
The car was bought in my name, since I was (then) the one who had the biggest income, but my husband made the whole deal with the salesman (40+/-M). 
From day one I found the salesman a little strange. I felt watched and that make me feel super unconfortable. He always tried to make conversation with me and eventhought my husband was the one dealing with all things regarding the car, he always found a way to come to me first (calling and sending messages). 
This situation went for about a month, since we chose a car with some extras and it had to be sent directly from the factory. 
When the car arrived he sent me a whatsapp from his personal number with car photos, saying something like ""It's here waiting for you! You can come and get it.""

I found it bizarre that he would send me those photos from his personal number, but I was so excited about getting the car and never have to deal with him again (as he always gave me the creeps) that I ignored the situation.

About a month later, we had a warantee problem with the car and had to contact him. I remember feeling a little weird about the way he looked at me, so I tried to ignore him. I was in the car with my kids and had just bought a new car fragrance. He put his head inside my window and started complimenting the smell. I gave him some cold answer and closed the window. I remember feeling weird about the whole situation. 

So...fastforward to this last november. 
I never thought about that guy again. But one day we were sleeping and my phone starts ringing at 3AM. It was him. I didn't even remember I still had his contact. 
I didn't answer and honestly just thought it was a mistake. Maybe he was asleep and his phone went crazy...? 

But the next day, around the same hour I got another call from him. I told my husband and during the day he called the dealership to ask if there was any problem since the salesman was calling me everyday. They told him that he wasn't working there anymore. 
I blocked his number and went on with my life. But as you know, even when you block a number, you can still see if it tried to contact you. So, over the last couple of months, I saw a few blocked calls from him. All around 3AM. 
Today when I woke to prepare my kids to school I noticed I had a unread whatsapp. It was from him. The message said “Hi you little horny whore!” and there was a photo of cum in a bed. 
I got imediatly nauseated and felt super violated. Who thinks this is normal behaviour?? I showed the message and the photo to my husband and he printscreened it and send it to his phone. I believe he is trying to figure out where the creep works to go there and confront him and show his bosses what he's been doing to the womem he sells cars. 

I'm alone at my home since I'm super pregnant but I can't stop feeling scared. That guy has all my personal information. Because the car he sold me is in my name, he knows my address, my phone number, my name, where I work, he even know my car (since he's the one who sold it).
This whole situation is making me sick. I don't know what I should do. Should I go to the Police? Should I go to his job? Should I speak to some friends who know people that can deal with shit like this?? I know violence is never the answer, but right now I'm feeling so vulnerable since he knows literally every personal information about me, that I wish someone would just stop him. 

This is making me remember a lot of memories from my teen years when a “friend” turned into a stalker and used to send me weird and scary messages stating where I was  and my address. He even treatened to kill my BF (who is now my husband). I was scared then, but we were kids and this was pre social media. Now all of my personal information is out there and I can't stop feeling that that guy is a complete psycho who can find me anytime. I don't feel safe at all and since I'm pregnant I can't even protect myself in case of confrontation. 

What should I do? I don't feel like I'm being dramatic or over sensitive. I truly believe I can be in danger and even if he never tries to come to me, I still feel super violated. It's like a violation of my personal space.",07Jan2020,1

I love playing video games and reading, while my GF loves going out with her friends. This would change massively if we had a kid. Kids take over your life and leave you with little social life or time for yourself. I'm not sure how we'd cope with this.

My dad wouldn't let me quit cause he'd say id embarrass him. I was so depressed at the time I wanted to just die or hide away for the rest if my life in my room. I would spend my days sleeping because I didn't want to face reality and just escape it somehow. Also just get high as shit to feel numb (weed). 2 year later I confronted her and the others who would bully me and told them how fucked up they would make me feel. I was tired of it, I couldn't take it no more. Every time I would turn around they would just look at me and laugh. It was hard. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't even be out cause all I would think about was work the next day. 

Then, once I told them they made me look like the bad guy and they started crying and told everyone how I made them cry and how they were only girls and I'm a man. Even my coworkers who my homies turned on me, The boss, everyone. Finally, I just quit even though my dad was pissed. I called the boss and said ""I'm quitting, I'm can't take it anymore. bye."" 

One year later, everyone who bullied me (12 people to be exact) had quit because they felt guilty and realized what they had done. The most fucked up part is that the two girls who were the instigators and bullied me got karma really bad cause someone important to her got a sickenss and the other one got a sickness herself. Few months later I went back to the job and I loved it cause everyone was gone. My dad understood finally and apologized to me. 

Now two years later everything is awesome but the only problem is that girl might come back because the boss found out about her family member and might get her to return and feels bad for her. it sucks because life was just going great. Im going to quit if she's comes back I already spoke to my parents and they understand. But the thing is I don't want to quit. I explained to my boss the whole situation. Were in good terms now, she's like a friend I guess in a way. I told her I'm going to quit if she comes back but I don't think she really understands how I actually felt at the time and says maybe it was just a faze they went through at the time. I pray every night she won't because I love my job now. I need advice.",07Jan2020,1
479,"I have a friend from the other side, he has anxiety, and I want to really help him but Idk how to. Something bad happened to him in the past and it put his self-esteem to sub-zero, and made him afraid of people. He is afraid that even when he types a message to me he feels scared. He told me that he tried to train himself to be good at several things but he feels like he is getting absolutely nothing back from people. He can't trust anybody because people don't give a shit about the efforts he puts into something. He does nothing=they don't give a damn, he does something good=they still don't give a damn abt him. He also said that he has a feeling of doing anything wrong because anything that he did in the past hasn't been appreciated. :(

I never disclosed I would have guests staying over and the owners found out via the housekeeper and they were really angry. According to the house keeper my guests swore at her and trashed the house which is not true but it's her word over mine. The owners also found out that we smoked marijuana on the premises, we also smoked roll up tobacco but we're being convicted of smoking weed apparently... Here's a thing, marijuana is not illegal in private use so a crime wasn't commited but they are religious. I realise I have made a huge mess. And they do have cameras in the house, but these cameras were never disclosed to me. I was never told once that they have camera surveillance in their home. Now there are all sorts of wild accusations going around about my guests raiding their daughters panties drawer which could have been spung by the housekeeper because she didn't clean the house properly and tried to find a cover story. I want to fix this mess really badly and am going to provide an apology. But why are there all these fake accusations coming up that people are saying are true when they aren't true at all? Apparently 5 neighbours are saying things happened which didn't happen?

487,"This seems simple but it might not be as simple as it may seem...

I've known this girl for 5 years now and although we say we're friends it was always complicated. She would date a guy for a year and we'd stop talking to until they broke up and then we'd start talking again. The last time this happened we hungout a couple times and I realized I had really strong feelings towards this girl. The other thing I realized is that she doesn't seem to feel the same way. Because of this I did what I thought was the right thing to do at the time and say goodbye to her once and for all because I didn't think it was fair if we started building this friendship all the while I secretly like her as more than a friend.

After I said goodbye I tried to move on but it's proving to be difficult. I liked being around her and even though she might not like me as much I like her I could tell she liked being around me. I don't want to lose her but at the sametime I don't think I can handle pretending to being okay with just being friends. I messaged her on facebook a couple of days ago saying that I was sorry and if she was willing to become friends again but she hasn't responded. But I messaged her after I deleted her (which I told her I'd do after I said goodbye) and I think she just never saw the message.

So should I text her to see if she got the message? I mean if I knew she actually read the message and never responded to it on purpose then I'd stop trying to pursue her. But I don't know if she saw it and I'm really starting to miss her again. Please any advice on this would be great :)",07Jan2020,1

497,"So long story short, I (F, 23) was a temp in retail over Christmas. I absolutely loved it and got on with everyone including the costumers who always told my boss I'm very helpful and enthusiastic (I even got a tip from one). I sadly didn't get kept on as in my bosses words ""be flat out with uni"" but kept on two other guys who were 16 and 17 (cheaper for the company as my boss had to work on a budget).

I asked my boss if there was anything I could improve on, which he replied no you went above and beyond for people, you are perfect.

On a night out, I bumped into one of the permanent staff (M, 22) asking him how his night is going and that I was out with my friends and boyfriend (M, 23). He then out of the blue started stating I was only chosen for eye candy for my boss who and everyone else thought I was 17, and was sad to see me leave as he wanted to drill me so bad and guaranteed he would be going with me by the end of the night. He said other vile things but they're too explicit for here. 

I tried to get away from him but he wouldn't let me leave and grabbed my arm. My boyfriend's friend (M, 29) then stepped in, telling him where to go. The guy stepped up to him, calling over one of his friends. I pulled my bf's friend away from them as I didn't want a fight and him to get in trouble for me.

I'm unsure either to report this to my old boss as there's a possibility I might be coming back in a few months as many of the workers vouched for me but I don't want to make this contributing factor of not getting it as I currently have no financial income and really liked working there.

The other day however I overheard him talking to a colleague that he has met a girl and has fallen for her and is seeing where it goes but she doesn't message him all the time.


She came into work and they had a date on his break. Another girl and I observed and it seemed to be going well but the other girl commented that she looked like she was just dressed like she was going to the beach and they didn't even hug or kiss goodbye which we found odd. She just touched his shoulder and waved goodbye like you would a friend.


Anyway, I've started talking to him more as he's become a shift lead and have been joking around with him. He always seems to come back to my area and walk past or hang around.


Also if he has to do something next to me he moves in right next to me and presses himself on me or if he has to move past he grabs/touches me lightly on the arm/waist and moves past which he doesn't have to and I haven't seen him to do it to anyone else. He also touched my elbow  and leaned in when I was telling him something work related the other day.

502,"I dunno if this is the right sub, but I'll give with a try.

So I'm a sophomore in highschool, and school starts at 7:20. I walk to school, so I wake up at 6:00 to leave out by 6:40. 

My sleep is all out of wack. I don't know when I go to sleep on any given day. Somedays its at 3 PM because I'm too tired to even stay up to finish homework. Like, I fall asleep at the table trying to do homework when I get home. Sometimes I'll go to bed at 8 or 9 PM. I don't let myself stay up past 10 because I know I'll never get any sleep that late.

No matter how much sleep I get, I still feel so freaking exhausted. I hate it so much. I'm pretty sure I (unintentionally) got about 13 1/2 combined hours last night, but this morning I _still_ cried when the alarm went off. It doesn't matter how much or how little I get, I still feel terrible. 

Over winter break, I stayed up until like 12 AM, and could wake up at like 7 or 8 with no problem, and I felt amazing when I woke up. Like, it actually surprised me how good I felt. And like, it took my body only a few days to adjust to staying up all night rather than going to bed super early. I had a three week break whereas I've been in highschool for two years, so why hasn't my body gotten used to it yet? Am I just backwards or something? Should I see a doctor?

Anyways, I do all the things that people always recommend. Don't play video games, no blue light, exercise, take a hot bath, make your room cooler at night, read a book, don't have lights on in your room, taking a nap so you're not too tired, not taking too many or too long naps so you're not messing with your sleep and energy too much, et cetera, er cetera, et cetera. NOTHING helps. But it's only ever when I have school. I don't want to sound like I'm just complaining because I don't like school, but seriously. I'm not making this up please believe me.

I told my parents but they either don't care or don't believe me and just think that I'm trying to find another reason to complain about school since on the weekends and breaks I have no issues with getting any sleep. 

Please help me. I'm so freaking tired. :(",07Jan2020,1

I don’t go to school much but I still make an effort to get educated. Recently I’ve been feeling really down, and I was hit with an epiphany. I’ve never had a girlfriend. I don’t know how to get a girlfriend, I don’t know what to do with a girlfriend, I don’t understand how you meet one, it’s so confusing to me. I feel as if I have a lot of pent up emotions in me and I have no way of being able to love someone.

I have too many feelings pent up inside and I just wanna hug something as had as I can for hours. I wanna be able to curl up into a ball and just feel happiness based on the fact that someone cares for me.

506,"He broke up with me on the week right before a very important exam over text. He flirted with other girls and shoved it in my face. He spread fake rumours about me. 

After a while of not talking at all, I thought this silent resentment was childish and proceeded to ask if he wanted to be friends. He agreed.

During the summer, we texted a lot and I felt like I could trust him again (he was my best friend before dating). So, I foolishly told him over text that I went clubbing during the holidays with my friends from another state. I also told him other secrets. Stupid I know.

After the disastrous events at the club and my horrible exam results, I realised that I really have to change if I want a good future. I was also going to change friend group because all of them were two faced.

When I came back, we talked a little about the details of that night I went clubbing. His friend was pressing answers out of me. I didn’t really want to say them because I didn’t want it to be awkward between me and my ex but then I gave in and told them - I got kissed by an adult and almost got dragged in to sex. At one point I think I saw that they were recording the convo. But I didn’t say anything because I wasn’t sure.

Today my friend told me that my ex has been showing people the screenshots of our texts with my secrets. I was very disappointed. She’s my best friend and is going to leave the school :(

I’m scared they are going to tell people I went clubbing. Because in my school, clubbing is considered as a heinous act done by disgusting hoes. Everyone will judge me like crazy if they find out.

I just made friends with a new group. I hope they don’t find out. 

All I want now is to concentrate on my future, go to a good uni and leave my past behind.

511,"To set the scene I live in a sharehouse with another M + F. There's a single common area/kitchen otherwise generally I'm in my room.

M moved in and we all got along pretty well (he had a long-term GF of 2 years). Irregularly socialising. He focused harder on F though (or their schedules lined up better). M asked me one day when we were going to the shops 'what do you think about hooking up with F' and I said no. Skip forward a week and we're all going out drinking together. After pre-drinking we get to the first bar (chill place no dance floor) isn't our place and move onto another venue. Once we're in straight away M takes F to the dance floor and starts spinning her around etc. Doesn't escalate much from there, eventually we more to another bar (pretty dead) then another bar where it heats up. They jump on the dance floor and after 30 minutes they're both hands around waist doing their thing. I'm doing my own thing irregularly darting off the dance floor as I'm tiring out. At around 3am I go looking for them and see them hooking up on the dance floor and decide to bail. Eventually the next day I start talking to M and he claims straight off the bat ""I blacked out last night, I don't remember anything"" and I play along. Coincidentally about 2 weeks later he tells me a story of a 'hot blonde' (fitting F's description) he hooked up with at a bar we were at when he first moved to the area saying he blacked out again and just remembers snippets (again he was in a relationship at this time) but I played possum. Not much happened M + F grew exceedingly closer to each other, I stopped getting invites to hang out or do things with them and started feeling like a third wheel. They'd stop chit-chatting if I came home or go out to the kitchen to make food. Occasionally when I was around there were a couple of sexual jokes, specifically F saying how she likes to use her mouth then a coy look to M. M talking about bigger than average with a casual blush from F. Bit of background on F she's pretty cold, not super interested in things but will humor chit-chat but never really engage back. F has self described being depressed, she's showed signs but never shown an interest in opening up and generally shifts blame if pushed to share. After a while F would start to ask how I was and when I'd next be working/arrive home/days off (these were brief convo's maybe 30-60 seconds after I started working night shifts). So I've started isolating myself, if I'm in the common areas while they're around it's pretty dead. I don't talk much beyond hi, how are you to both M + F. Particularly I don't feel comfortable around M. M and myself are getting petty with each other. Now M's gf is staying for a couple of weeks (M didn't let me know this) and while she seems nice she is very intense. I don't feel comfortable talking with her so much and M has become passive aggressive about petty housemate things since she's arrived (doing dishes on time, leaving things around). He's raised these issues via our group chat but hasn't complained about anything F regularly does (same stuff dishes, leaving stuff around). 
I'm looking for advice on how to handle this as I'm close to sharing what I recall to M if he chooses to keep pushing petty things. I feel awkward even trying to make conversation and typically avoid eye contact. An example of conversation I recently went to the kitchen where M + F were talking and the only question I received was ""when do you go back to work?""

tl;dr we all went out drinking one night and I saw my other flatmates (M + F) hooking up so I left. The next morning M claimed to have 'blacked out' and it was never spoken of in the house again. M + F got pretty close and I've become a third wheel in the house. Now M's interstate partner is staying for a couple of weeks and I can't look her in the eyes.

He literally has liked every single photo of his ex since they broke up. 

He never likes the photos I post of him or us together. He also used to post pics with her and of her and has never posted a picture of me. 

They’re both into film and pool and it’s how they met. He’s now on a pool league and he always is on top of it with the hottest films. 

I creeped hard at work when I had downtime and I am embarrassed to confront him again. I asked if he would still date her if he could and he said “No that was a quick thing. They came up fast and burnt out fast as well don’t think there was any staying power with it just both lonely and became single at same time guess it was like 2 years ago” and he also said “Just because I had other relationships before does not mean you a rebound I chose you and continue to love and build with you cuz I choose to. I dated other people too I was not just looking to fill a void. You had prior relationships as well... I dont like having to keep dealing with this type of stuff especially when it just arises out of thin air for no reason after we been going strong for a while now its just makes me think that you insecure about us and you and the reason why it seems its always these little things that always get turned into bigger deals. Like we hang out and have a great night goofin off and chillin and then you are away from me because of work and immediately negativity fills your mind”

He said it was because it was a wedding for someone he didn’t know that well. Apparently the wedding they went to was for his close friend. 

I didn’t specifically say that I see he likes every pic of hers and I’m afraid to bring it up again and don’t wanna less stuff up. What should I do?

So this morning I was talking to my dad about a trip away I wanted to do, I'm 22 and I wanted to go in my car across to England and he said ""no you don't know how to drive over there""  “no you’re not going “ I said I’ve been driving for over two years and also said why do you allways put me down, and he said “fine just fuck off then” 

He allways puts me down and I kinda lost it, I screened ""fuck off"" to him, I ran upstairs and he got out of his chair and grabbed me, he held me and I tried to push him back and just had a break down, he broosed my chin and broke my watch, he was apologetic afterwards and he said he doesn't mean to put me down and only because he cares about me and that I'm all he's got. 


 I just don't know how to feel about it, I know arguments happen but it’s just the fact he grabbed me, held and pushed me back when I was trying to get away 

We've never allways fully got on and I just feel like he's almost controlling, I just don't know what to do",07Jan2020,1
517,"I'm 17 (guy) and my cousin is 20 (girl).

I'm planning on buying my cousin a gift for 60$ for her birthday, which is in less than two months, and I've been thinking, if she still doesn't think like me a little bit more (as a friend, not romantically), I will stop eating and also hurt myself. I might even end it because I feel like my life is worthless if my cousin will hate me forever. I will also buy two tickets to a music festival (130$ for each ticket) and ask her if she will go with me. She hasn't said she hates me, but I'm very sure she does. She blocked me on Instagram in November because I had liked a photo on her friend's account, which was a photo of my cousin, and she also removed me on Snapchat the same month after I asked her if she hates me. I'm also really pissed at myself about this because I remember that in April, I told her I had added her on Snapchat, and she said something like ""oh I would gladly want to have you there"", and we even sent each other selfies, asked what we both were doing, had some other conversations, and I'm so pissed that I basically threw that all away because I'm so stupid. 

I regret it a lot, but I don't have the courage to apologise to her for asking her if she hates me and for liking her friend's photo. I told my aunt that she can tell my cousin I'm sorry, but I'm sure she didn't. 

There's also other shit I regret. I asked my cousin 3-4 times when she'd upload a new picture on Instagram, I told her boyfriend, also like 3-4 times that I miss my cousin a lot, and I also sent her boyfriend a picture of my hip which I had beat until it became red, and I did it because I was sad that my cousin hates me. My cousin's boyfriend told me my cousin likes me and cares about me, but that has to be bullshit. He also lied to me, as he told me that if I want to, we could talk, like if I was feeling sad, but instead he one day just decided to completely ignore me on Snapchat (I sent him a picture and he didn't see it for a week), and then eventually he just blocked me there. It feels like I can't trust anyone. I still think he is a really nice person, but I was once really, really happy when he told me we could talk if I want to, but now I'm afraid of apologising about what I had done and asking him if he could add me back on Snapchat, but it feels like it would be really awkward. I also met him right before Christmas with my cousin, but neither he or my cousin brought it up at all.

I don't know if I can reverse this. When I met my cousin right before Christmas she didn't seem pissed at all. We even hugged when we greeted each other and when we said goodbye. I talked to someone before about this and he just said that everything was fine and I should just forget what happened.

TL;DR I don't know if I should end it if my cousin doesn't want to be my friend. What should I do?",07Jan2020,1
518,"I met my girlfriend nine months ago. We had actually went to middle school together, but reconnected on Tinder. I was 18 at the time, and honestly, this is my first real relationship. We fell in love and connected with each other, and she became my best friend. However, her sexual past is rather questionable, and I think she’s lying about something very serious. 

When we first started dating, it was a frequent issue that she would bring up and almost flaunt her past hookups to me. She’d even show me their Instagram sometimes, and it was beyond a level of comprehensible annoyance. It’d get me infuriated, and it took 2 months of being together for her to get the message and stop. 

However, things only seemingly take a turn for the worst. About 5 months into our relationship, she confessed to me something that I do not take lightly. She was sexually assaulted, multiple times. Unfortunately, I have friends and family who were raped in the past, so I have somewhat of an idea of how awfully traumatic this is for someone to deal with, it disgusts me and makes me lose faith in humanity given how I’ve seen it effect people I love. But hearing about this coming from my girlfriend has not allowed me to stop thinking about it. Every night, constantly. 

She was big on hookups before she met me. She’s been with 12-15 guys (the number seemingly changes whenever it’s bought up) before me, one of which had an STD. But suddenly after I ask her to stop flaunting it to me, this came out. In fact, the story changes whenever I hear about it. We’ve been together for nine months, and I silently let it sit in my head thinking that she’s lying about it. I don’t want to get into detail about what her story is, but it is described to be AWFUL. It turns my stomach thinking about it, and I want these men locked up or dead. But, she doesn’t remember their names(ironically enough remembers the names of everyone else she’s slept with though) or what they looked like. 

What leads me to believe it’s fabricated is how inconsistent it is, and how it isn’t taken seriously by her at all. My initial reaction to hearing about it was being there for her and just wanting to know what I could do to help her. However, the way it’s told is just a different story every single time, and despite the times we’ve talked about it, something just isn’t sitting right about it with me. Anyone would think that this story is just a bit strange and fishy.

I’m still incredibly young, and I’m fully aware of how serious such a topic like rape is, considering how loved ones are effected by it. If I come across as an as*hole in this post, I swear it is not my intention. I just do not know what to do!",07Jan2020,1

My dad is a poker dealer and been gambling our money away for the last decade plus. The past few years, it's been really hard on my mom, who with her best ability to come up with $1600 for mortgage and $2000 for remaining fees like gas, electric, phone bill, TV, Internet every month.

Her working hours are inconsistent (part time) and couldn't find a full time job. Next Month we will not have enough to pay everything and my Dad refuse to come up with money. I never had a job before and been taking a break to refresh my mind from all the years in universities.

The issue is that I'm looking for a job right now, and my dad is rushing me to do so. He even said ""go to McDonald and get $500 and pay whatever you have."" I don't want to spent the next 25 years of life paying this while he get to blow all the money away. 

Divorce isn't an option right now because renting elsewhere after selling the house is about the same $1500 (LA issues). I don't want to settle for a job that I don't like and to go down the wrong path. Yes I do live in the house but I rather pay rent than do HIS job to pay the mortgage under his name. He always say this house is mine. 

I don't know what to do. I'm looking and writing my resume as we speak. It's been super stressful the past few days. How do we fix this? We have no problem removing him (dad) from our lives.

527,"Outside of working out, being on the computer, watching videos and playing videogames I don't feel like I have any hobbies. I do enjoy being outdoors, hiking, camping, fishing and rock climbing but I do it so rarely compared to everything else. I feel so boring, like I'm wasting my freetime because nothing ""productive"" comes out of my hobbies. Playing videogames and watching videos doesn't do me anything except maybe bring me instant satisfaction. When people ask me what I do for fun I honestly get a little embarrassed telling them.

When I think of hobbies I think of things like playing an instruments, painting, fixing or creating something to pass time and in return learn new skills and build character, but I can't really seem to get into any of that. 

 I did take guitar and some piano lessons when I was younger and still try to play some to this day but I just don't have the finger dexerity or patience to make anything off it (yeah, excuses). I like art and music, I'd love to create beautiful pieces of art so I don't understand why I can't bring myself into it.

540,"TW: Pedophilia, Molestation, Child Sexual Abuse, etc. -- I'm going to try and shorten this story as much as possible, for lack of time and I want this posted asap.

      I need help, I don't know where to turn or what do to. When I was 10 my mother remarried out of wedlock (got pregnant), she only knew this man for 4 months. She had been single a long time. He molested me at 10, while I was sleeping. I woke up and looked down and saw his hand touching me. I was diagnosed previously to the incident with PTSD from my biological fathers death, along with major anxiety disorder/phobias, chronic depression, and OCD. I was already going through A LOT and this only worsened and affected me greatly. 

       I want to make it clear my mom has bent over backwards for me. She has been my rock my entire life. She has sacrificed as a single mother and loves me unconditionally. But she did not leave my stepfather after I told her what happened. She did believe me, it was addressed and he denies it completely. He was kicked out of the house for a few days while mom handled it. Keep in mind my younger sister had just been born not too long ago, she was probably around 6 months old at the time. My mother was overwhelmed and didn't know what to do. Financially she would be hurting very badly if she left, also she didn't know about taking my sister from her father. And risking him getting split custody (being alone with her, fear something may happen there as well). So she stayed. He was allowed to come back. She watched like a hawk, we were NEVER left alone together and she yelled at him and threatened him if he was ever accused again or if anything even remotely close happened again, he'd be thrown in jail. (he works in law enforcement, this would be detrimental to his life and career)

        Fast forward, I'm 21 now. I still live at home. I still live with my abuser. I can't begin to tell you how taxing it has been on my mental health. Nothing ever happened again but I can't tell you how uncomfortable I am in my own house, I feel his eyes on me and I feel like a piece of meat sometimes. He disgusts me, I am so resentful. I can't sleep with my legs open or without pants on now. It's affected my sex life, if I am touched a certain way I get flashbacks. I still get nightmares. I am unable to get therapy because I live in Florida and there is no statute of limitations.  In other words, I cannot say names or address whom the person is in my life to a therapist, because it would have to be reported.

         My mother cannot afford one income right now, she's stuck. She doesn't want him to get partial custody and risk him being alone with her. My sister is in middle school now. (my mom has frequent talks with her about people touching her/keeping herself safe and nothing has happened as my mother is a fanatic about it) I know it's easy to sit here and partially blame my mom. But I love her and she loves me. And I'll be watching the post so if I see people being rude, I'll have it taken down. She's done nothing but try to keep me safe and although I do hold some resentment towards her for not leaving, I also understand why she didn't. We cry together every now and then about it and she apologizes constantly for failing me. That she was dumb and didn't know how to handle it. But that she by no means doesn't think I was lying, and always picks me over any man. She's been in a deep depression since the incident. It hurts me more to see her filled with so much guilt. She's gained weight, sleeps a lot, has been put on more meds for depression, etc.

       I think the incident affects me more now then it did before. As an adult, I understand more and it just makes me so angry. (at him, not my mother) and having to live with him is HELL. I have a boyfriend whom I've been with 4 months but have known for years. He treats me like a queen and supports my endeavors. We want to move in together so bad. I want to get out of this house. I don't want to ever have to see his face again. I just don't have the funds to move out. Even into a low income apartment. I'm going to college on student loans. (the kind you pay back, so I'm in debt) I don't qualify for the grants, which is basically free money, because I'm under 26 so they go by my mom and stepdads income. I want my own space so bad. It's just so taxing on my mental health and I feel like I'm getting to my breaking point. I wish I had money. Money would fix all my issues.

       I'm going to seek therapy and just sort of tip toe around the labels so they can't identify him. It would rip my family apart more than it already has.  I don't want to see my mother go through that. I guess I'm looking for comfort, words of advice, maybe if someone can relate to my situation, idk. I really need legal advice as well, I live in Florida. I can't really find anything solid on the internet about the statute of limitations. I'm scared if I reveal to my therapist that its my stepdad and I still live with him, along with my sister who is a minor, that they'll have to report it as it's technically ""endangering"" her. Is this true? I don't know what to do. I'm so stressed and I'm at my breaking point.",07Jan2020,1

543,"I have been having a few issues weighing in on me the past few months and I feel if I don't find an outlet to talk about it, I might just explode.

**Issue #1: Fat shaming within my own family**

I come from an Asian family and meal times in my household is often a chore to me because of the constant fat shaming happening around the dining table. When I say constant, I mean every...single....fucking.....day. Over the past 3 years, I have put on 15kg and this was due to depression. I was just wallowing away. Every time when I am having my dinner, my dad/mum/sister will go ""You are too fat. You need to lose weight. You need to lose at least 20kg by the end of this year."" I mean come on, who the hell would still have an appetite to stomach his/her dinner whilst having these words said to them. Over the Christmas holidays, I was at my grandmother's house with all my other relatives whom I have not met in awhile. Same thing happened, one relative went ""Wow you are actually so fat now"" I swear to god damn god those were his exact words ( and he is overweight himself). I mean it was the festive season, why do people have to ruin the mood like this. Over the dining table at my grandmother's house where all the food were, my sister said to my aunt "" My family is a family of fat while your is a family of skinny. Look at how fat we are"". I lost all appetite there and then and my Christmas was totally ruined. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Issue #2: Relationship with family**

Apart from Mum and Dad, I practically have no relationship with my brother and sisters ( there are 5 kids in total). We used to be close as siblings but once I hit 12/13 years old, everything just plummeted. My brother does not give a shit about this family and has become self centred as heck (he was not like this before). With my sister, she just does not want to do anything with me ( we are only 2 years apart.) I do get jealous of my friends when they have such an awesome relationship with their siblings. They can go out and have fun together, talk about anything and everything but not for me. My sister only talks to me when she needs something from me and that's it. When I talk to her, it's all one worded replies. She even blocks my number on her phone so I can only send her texts but I cant even call her. She often asks me to drive her to places and this frustrates me so much. Can our sibling relationship only come to this?",07Jan2020,1

I will get cast a side when I ""serve my purpose"",  and I've come to realize that you (person who's name I forgot.) were / are right. So my brother, mutual friend, and I are moving out sometime this year. 

This is where my question comes into play how the hell do I do that with out feeling like I'm abandoning my mom and grandmother? During some of last year my mother was sick in and out of the hospital and shit got difficult! But now she is in remission and back home, so great I can leave now right? Nope! Not even close! 

If I stay I have no life, I can't leave to go grocery shopping without my bitch aunt and grandmother guilt tripping my into staying home, I have very low vitamin D because I can't even step out side very often or I get accused of not doing any house work and lectured about leaving grandma alone! 

(I've said this before I think) I have a maid bell in my room that sounds like a door bell! And I hear it everywhere I go, even in my dreams, its gotten so bad that hearing one makes me cry and gives me anxiety! If I'm sick my aunt complains that she had to do the house work (even though she fucking doesn't.)  because I'm not and pretty much says that I'm faking. 

I almost forgot! I now have to take care of another elderly lady! The difference between her and my grandma is she (Elderly Lady) appreciates me and what I do for her and she pays me (Even after I said she didn't have to.) !

If I leave I'm worried about who will take care of my grandma while I'm gone, my mom has a hard time letting people go and seems like she wants me to stay all my life. I fear if I don't move out soon I will end up taking my own life, get violent towards my aunt or lose the only thing that makes me happy. It's a good thing I know how to throw around my weight!

Had a nearly 6 year relationship end, got diagnosed with OCD, was suicidal for months at a time, lost weight from not eating due to severity of OCD/anxiety, had to push myself beyond my capacity to finish uni and  help my ex when he got sick before the breakup, left my job due to mental illness, basically dragged myself through by my hair. I've also had depression since i was 16 and anxiety all of my life. I've been on and off medication for 2019, being emotionally and physically all over the place, trying to find the right one with my doctor and dealing with everything that comes with that. My new years resolution is to not kill myself, if that helps paint the picture. I have to use all of my available energy and mental space to fight my OCD and do my therapy, and i feel like i'm being dragged through life or swimming against  a strong current. I just feel like I can't keep swimming but i have to and it is incomprehensible.   
I'm so tired that sometimes I can't sleep. I'm physically tired all the time. I am mentally tired all the time too. I forget things a lot, i forget what im talking about as im talking. I am so irritable and when people talk to me sometimes I just want to stop listening and walk off. I'm just so tired. I can't explain it. I had to give everything I had and more in 2019 and now that it's gone i don't know how to get it back. I am just wrecked. No amount of rest is enough physically or mentally and I just want to cry but tears don't come out. **Sometimes I feel like i'm grieving but without a loss.**   


Does anyone have any advice for me and how to fix emotional burnout?   
I'm already in therapy and on medication. I just can't seem to catch up on rest.",07Jan2020,1

If you have time to check my last question I’d appreciate it but if you don’t I’ll give a brief details. My mother is sexist, abusive. She’s abused me physically and mentally for almost my whole life. Beat me and gave me bruises, called me names, called me a whore, controlled me, took my bedroom keys and forced me to keep the door open, told me to kms. Whenever I tell someone about how it effected me they tell me that I just want someone to blame for being a failure, is it possible that I have some mental problems that makes me blame her? Cause that’s what someone in my last question commented. I genuinely don’t know if I’m crazy. The only thing I’m sure of is that she abused me for years and won’t even admit",07Jan2020,1
551,"I have a habit on finding an interest in a certain hobbies and just spending money on it while I'm interested in it.
It first started with painting. I love drawing before so when I got into painting, I just kept buying paints. There were multiple times I'd lose interest and stop for a couple of months, only to gain interested again and paint while buying MORE paints. Then it moved into Markers, I'm a complete noob at using alcohol markers but I wanted to do art with some so I spent a lot on money on markers and I haven't really used them. I just wanted a LOT of markers. It then switched to colored pencils. I bought expensive ones because I wanted quality colored pencils. I only used them twice and bought a lot thinking I'd continue using them. I lost interest in art (I still love it but RN I'm not interested in painting or doing such.) And hopped into Aquariums. I've bought fish tanks which aren't cheap at all and now have 4. I love the idea of keeping fish and stuff due to me loving animals and all types of living creatures but I feel like I'm starting to lose interest in a way like I did with art, though I'm trying my best to keep myself interested since it's too late to back out now.

Is there a way to gain motivation to go back to these hobbies and ways to prevent me from hobby hopping and investing money on a hobby that I'm not even sure if I'll continue?",07Jan2020,1

554,"My junior year (this year) of high school, a new family of two kids started attending our school, and both kids are on the spectrum. One of them, we’ll call him James, is very autistic and also a very peculiar individual. He has a condition that means he grows no hair whatsoever, so no eyebrows, eyelashes, anything. He also wears leather gloves, a neck warmer, and leather jackets. 
He is very eccentric and doesn’t understand social cues or boundaries and for some reason, he’s taken a liking to me and started sitting by me in the morning, grabbing my phone out of my hands, and showing me anime and warframe YouTube videos. I don’t want to be mean to the kid because he already has it rough, but I feel like he’s become attached to me and it makes me uncomfortable",07Jan2020,1

556,"Long story short- My sister in law gave birth in May, baby was born with drugs in her system Children and Youth services (CYS) has been involved since day one. Last night SIL went to rehab. She has to get weekly drug tests and now had at least 1-2 positives or enough for them to force her into rehab. I have no idea what’s going on other than that. 

My husbands parents are enablers and have known and doing nothing about SIL’s drug problem. She is almost 40 and has lived with her parents for the past 5ish years, she’ll be okay for a while and have a job then fall back into bad habits and the parents just... allow it. They pay all her bills, always get her out of trouble, care for her baby (and 12year old daughter as well), ect. 

The issue now with custody (from what I understand), CYS said there’s a chance they will take my niece into foster care. Baby daddy is also a user and has refused to take drug tests several times at CYS. He is not allowed to be alone with her let alone live with her. 
My in-laws are both in their late 60s and have many many health issues that do not make them suitable to raise a child, their house is a mess, they live on social security and have said many times, they can help but can’t be the sole providers for the baby. 

Here is my dilemma: my husband and I want to get involved. We are married, own a small home but have enough room for a baby. We both have good jobs and stable incomes. We have no criminal records, no major debt other than a mortgage, nothing that would really prevent us from raising a child. We have said MANY times to the family that we would take our niece in a heartbeat if anything would happen. We are involved in her life and have been around since day one for her. 

We don’t know how to handle the situation. I know CYS won’t just give us info on their case, and my in laws are not the most reliable people to get information from. They like to play the victim and will spoon feed us bits and pieces to get us on whatever side they want. It is a very very messy situation. 

Pretty much I am looking for some advice on how CYS and these situations work- if anyone has worked for them or been through a situation like this, what is the protocol? What can I do to make sure my niece is safe and hopefully either with us or at least out of state foster care? Is there anything I can do in the meantime?

I love my niece so much and the last thing I want to see is her taken away, but I don’t want to see her hurt by her parents either. I’m not sure what would be our next step.",07Jan2020,1
557,"So some background, the three of us have different work schedules so we are seldom all home at the same time to really have a discussion in person about ground rules for the apartment and things that matter to us that we’d like the others to respect. We have only been living together for a few months since we moved in October 1. 

There was a major conflict that went down about a month ago with one roommate in particular leaving his window open all of the time (it’s winter) and refusing to get a doorsweep to keep the cold air inside his room — thus off setting the thermostat for our heat and causing the entire building to be of extremes temperature wise:  our floor, upstairs was freezing while the people downstairs were texting me constantly asking me to turn down the heat since the heater was over doing it to compensate my roommate’s window being open. The landlord got involved and put it on me to sort it out. After I continued to bring this concern up to him he since  bought a doorsweep but now completely ignores me.

When the new year started I really wanted for us to have some sort of rotation with doing basic  chores, like taking the trash out - since it is always me doing it. I texted both of them in our groupchat asking if they’d be comfortable with splitting up the tasks and no one replied to me. My other roommate is notoriously loud in the early (like 7am) morning slamming cabinets and pots and pans before leaving for work. I texted her asking if she’d be willing to work on lowering loudness from the kitchen because I work late and sleep in a little - no reply.

I just don’t know how to navigate this situation anymore. I feel I am not asking that much of them and largely carry most of the responsbility for this apartment. I do all of the cleaning, maintainence, handling of our internet and electric bill, and our landlord basically unofficially elected me to be the correspondant for everything. I feel like I am bombarding my roommates with texts and annoying them to the point where they ignore me and are resentful towards me, but I also feel like it’s not wrong for me to want to live comfortably just as much as they are (when I come home at very late hours I am tip-toeing around and being super cautious to be quiet not to wake them).

I would like some guidance on this.",07Jan2020,1
558,"If I explain each problem in detail we’d be here all day and I risk missing out on some advice which might really provide me with some much needed relief...

What I have on my plate as of today:

- A previously very successful and nationally famous father (as a result of his job), who suddenly lost that job, is starting fresh at the entry level in a new job, but through the journey of arriving here has become an alcoholic.

- A mother who is naturally extremely highly-strung, perceives herself to be the glue of the house, very highly stressed when dad lost job. 4 boys, me being the eldest, and dad was the only income. Has recently admitted to feeling as dark as experiencing suicidal thoughts. In really dark patches she has confided in me that she is likely going to leave my father and I’m expected to keep that private. It recently came out and she cleared that up with my father, but she felt I betrayed our mutual trust / safe space understanding, despite the revealing of information coming as a result of a blow up she had caused by stress. 

- I lost one of my job contracts just before Christmas. It filled 3 of my 5 day working week. It’s financially stressing me out and job hunting is proving difficult. I understand this is common for most people, so therefore a fairly regular stress, but a stress nonetheless. 

- On the weekend, my brother attempted suicide. He did not succeed but scared himself so much he had to tell me. We spoke and he revealed it’s been ongoing for 4 years. I’m the only person in his life that knows, and he’s made me promise not to tell my parents. They don’t have a relationship really, he shut them out as he became worse mentally and that’s been the case for years. I’m terrified of being the only bloke that can be the potentially life-saving difference, or be the one to find him dead if he ever tried again and I wasn’t around. 

- My girlfriend lives with me on the lower level of our family house. She cries a few times a week because of how stressed she feels being in this house. It’s stopped our sex life almost entirely, and I when I try and talk through my problems and feelings with her, she cries because she has no capacity left, it’s too much for her. I miss intimacy. 

- There’s so much going on that I am helping hold together silently, and my parents, in moments of their own stress, can often unleash that on me whereas my younger brothers don’t cop it much at all. I understand that being the oldest, I’m more likely to understand their problems and be more useful to what they want a hand with or want to talk about, but it’s feeling very unbalanced. 

Put simply, how the fuck do I manage this stress without losing my head? I let off steam when I know it won’t make my girlfriend cry, I know it’s healthy to discuss things like that. I play sport 4 days a week to keep my body healthy; it tends to help my head too. But this weight is becoming far too much for sport and letting off steam to continue carrying. I need some advice and tools that aren’t simply moving out.

560,"Hello, 

I didn't know how to tittle this I just don't know how to change my life around, I can't seem to catch a break.

 2 years ago, when I was 28 I took over my father's business to help him and Mom, he got sick and they needed help.  It's a small printshop in Argentina that was struggling but I was able to pay everyone and keep it afloat until the last few months, new government added some taxes that meant all imports got a lot more expensive so all my prices needed to go up, but so did fuel, food, etc.. so business has plummeted, I am sitting right now at the office thinking I have to fire 2 of our employees who have kids in college, are over 50 and probably won't be able to find a job because of their age. 

A lot of transactions in this country are still done in cash, so about 6 months ago I went to the bank to get about 5000 us dollars (my savings), which is a lot of money, I mean a lot of money in this country, I was followed home and robbed as I was reaching my house.

Having lost so much money and without the possibility to make it back my wife left me, I guess.. good riddance... We couldn't afford luxury , but had quite a few projects lined up.  When I was robbed they fell through and I guess that was all I was worth.

It's been weeks since I got proper sleep, I wake up thinking what this people that been working with us for so long are going to do, divorce and all the legal trouble that means.  Today for the first time in my 30 years, I didn't want to get up and work, I see no point... I honestly wanted to just stay there and expire.

566,"After a very confusing and sudden break up. one I accepted. I’ve been trying to process best I could. I’ve been venting to one of my coworkers, generally feeling a lot better about things. Even if nobody really cared about my side of the story, or asked if I was OK.

Flash forward to this week, I learned that the same coworker, who had ample opportunity to tell me, has been with my ex since before we were together. It’s painfully clear they attempted to pass off the break up and announcement as natural. Suddenly I understand why things have been weird. No one told me. to put it plainly, I have never had anyone hurt me this much.

This is not OK. I am forced to re-process everything again because nobody was honest. My other coworkers knew it, she knew it, he knew it, regulars knew it. No one told me the truth at any point. And we have to see each other every day. I had nothing but trust and respect in my community and coworkers.

Here’s the part that matters. I love this job, and I want to do it well, I care about the success of this local shop a lot. Always envisioned I would be part of it in the long term. Because of travel issues, not able to just move away or start another right now. Everything else is great. It’s pretty much the best thing that ever happened to me. Never thought I could have the skillset that I have now. it’s so important to me.

I never expected my trust to be completely broken in what is basically an entire community, particularly in my coworkers. Anyone could’ve told me the truth, but I was left in the dark. I deserved and expected better. Somewhere in this. I just feel like nobody cares about me now.

In fact, my coworkers kept pushing me to find someone else while this was all going on. at first it felt encouraging but now. I think it’s kind of fucked up. Everyone knew. I was confused and in constant pain for over a month. no one reached out, apologized. And I have to be OK with it. 

I want to let it go as soon as possible, but the dishonesty has sent me back to square one. The pain is unreal. Ex has been treating me pretty badly post break up, too. They frequent. Makes everything harder. my hands shake when I see them, I can’t couldn’t eat. it was a brief relationship, but it really affected me. This coworker knew the pain I was experiencing, can’t believe she didn’t tell me. I feel too old for workplace drama.

What do I do? How do you move forward from such a significant blow? onboard for half a year now. we’re a small group, and one of them is formally leaving after a near decade later this week. thought I was pulling myself together in time.

The worst part is I know nobody’s a bad person, but no one had my back. Or at the very least, some truth would’ve helped avoid future conflict. I feel extremely letdown, disappointed, and hurt. I really don’t know what to do at all.",07Jan2020,1

So straight forward, I am currently in my exam period (I study in an art school so our 'exams' are projects you work for a certain period of time and present them on the exam day)   
My teacher is offering a feedback sessions and I emailed him that I will attend so he could create a schedule of students who will be present on the feedback. He replied that he 'noted' that I will attend but also inquired why I missed the last classes before the holidays. (I think I missed about 3-4 of them)  


I had multiple reasons, but the worst reason was that I decided (horrible, really) to change the brand of the contraceptives to be able to control my menstrual cycle but it has only put me in a horrible mood. The type of mood everyone describe pregnant women have - I was a ticking time bomb. I knew I would not be able to hold 6 hour class every friday.

 That really made me mad and felt like they bait and switched me, but she said the needs changed so maybe she didn't know about it when I interviewed.
 Here's why I don't like it, it's 7-7 on the days I work and it's about 25 minutes away, so I'm home around 7;30pm

However...the work isn't the hardest ( it is physically demanding but I think I will adjust) and the people in my department are nice.

The pay is good for starting out, way above average.
They are also paying out a 1000 sign on, in various stages (30 days, 60 days and 90 days)

There seems to be alot of opportunities if I apply myself and don't do anything stupid.

So you can see where I may be conflicted and not sure of what to do.",07Jan2020,1
581,"This is going to be hard to explain and I’ll try and keep facts spectate from feelings but I really need advice and I have nobody to turn to and I don’t see my therapist for at least another week. 

I will refer to my girlfriend as Jane. 

Me and Jane met about 5 months ago at a party. We were instantly inseparable and since then have spent maybe 2 entire days apart since the day we started dating. Last month we both signed a lease for an apartment together, just in time for christmas together. She was kicked out of her own house and had been living with me at my parents while we looked for places together. She was tight on money. I have payed for everything she has needed and have gotten her most of what she has wanted. She hasn’t payed any money for the apartment yet. 

She started a new job at a restaurant out of town. She has a coworker named ‘John’ (I will call him John). She is friends with him, and she knows it worries me. I have been used and abused quite a bit in the past and I am a quite fragile anxious person. A few days ago he apparently admitted his feelings for Jane. And she finally told me that she told him that she has feelings for him too but she knows she can’t have both of us. They also told each other how attractive they are. 

I am so lost as to what to do. She told me she is going to go to a therapist so they can tell her what to do since she doesn’t know what to do. And that she is going for me. But she also seems to have prepared herself to leave me. She’s already talked to John about how if I kill myself it isn’t her fault. And that she will always love me “no matter what happens.” And that she would always want me in her life and she’d want to stay friends. 

I feel so hurt and betrayed. My first serious girlfriend cheated on me. My last one left me for her ex. This one is going to leave me for somebody better than me. I feel like such a fuck up and a failure. I am giving it my all with Jane and I don’t think I will have anything left to give if she leaves. I feel like I’m being taken for granted and used.

If anyone needs more info please just ask, I tried to keep this from getting to be too long of a post. Any advice is welcome.",07Jan2020,1
583,"Hey, my work is a pretty typical Microsoft-oriented office environment - we have Office 365 accounts so Sharepoint, MS Forms, Outlook installed etc. 

There is a series of optional training sessions being offered soon with limited places, e.g. a 10am session with 10 slots, a 2pm session with 10 slots, etc.

We'd like some way to send out a link for people to choose a session, which is then eliminated for everyone when it's full.

MS Forms is very basic and doesn't have any collaborative options. We don't have MS Bookings and this is customer-oriented rather than internal. Google Forms can't do it either.

It seems pretty simple but I can't find a way to do it without an expensive external system.

584,"So I'm a sophomore at University, and I caught feelings for someone for the first time since sophomore year in high school. I've had crushes but these were Capital F Feelings. 

In high school I was sexually assaulted (a lot) and my parents used to beat me (a lot). Person I had feelings for knew I had these scars as well as (apparently) knowing I had feelings for them. 

I figured out they knew this morning. It's all well and good that they didn't like me back, I'm not upset about that. But they were using me for homework, I helped them with a final, and stuff like that (while they knew I had feelings). So they used me, knowing how broken I am about relationships after the sexual abuse. 

I'm taking a non required class that I'm really interested in, they're in that class and I'm probably getting sat next to them. 

This has never really happened to me. I don't know if I should block them, act like I'm unaware as I distance myself, or confront them. Please help.",07Jan2020,1
585,"For as long as I can remember, I've always been the out-going, chatty person who gets along with just about anyone. I have a good relationship with my family and friends. But one thing I also remember is that I've never really developed any hobbies of my own. I've always just been invited by other people to join their hobbies/interests, and I've always enjoyed them too and had great fun. But now that I'm 33, it's starting to take a slight toll because I feel like I have nothing to offer. I'm really not passionate about *anything*. My typical day is: M-F work 10 hours, gym, and home to hang out with my pup (I also take my pup to work with me so I'm with him all day). On the weekends, if someone invites me to anything(restaurant, bar, etc), I'll definitely go but if I don't get an invite, I just stay at home all weekend or take my dog for a walk to the park.

I'm not a quiet, or lonely, person by any means. But I just feel like I don't have a whole lot to offer. My ex always used to tell me ""just start making plans.. invite friends.."" but other than the gym.. I've never been able to invite them anywhere. I'm also not a planner, so there's that.

Another thing.. I have never *really* done anything on my own. Ever since I can remember, even as a kid, I always did things with other people, so just the thought of me going to the movies alone, go ride my motorcycle alone, go to a bar alone, go travel alone just doesn't make any sense. Last year I bought tickets to Paris - alone, and in the end decided not to go because I would be by myself only and would have no plans. I felt like I would have just wasted time since I wasn't going for an actual purpose. I would just roam around and waste time or just sit around.

Honestly, I'm a pretty good conversationalist so I don't think I'm a boring person.. I just can't do things alone.. and I think that comes from because I don't have any actual hobbies.

My buddy described me as the old saying ""jack of all trades.. master of none.."" and I do feel like that.",07Jan2020,1

587,"TLDR : FEELS LIKE EVERYTHING IN COLLEGE HAS NOT BEEN WORKING OUT WHICH HAS CAUSED MENTAL FUCK-UPERY

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So just a little context. I am currently in my final year of college as an Eco major. I would modestly consider my self an above-average intelligence guy and what some would consider and introvert. So over my 3 years here I have come to feel as if I have achieved nothing in my personal life.

The society that I worked my ass off for and wanted to become its Secretary ended up (metaphorically) casting me out.I met people that I thought were friends ended up treating me like unwanted trash.  They don't communicate properly, even when i ask them for help or even try to text them in general.  I met someone who is my exact opposite in all  possible ways- mannerism,character, general behaviour etc. who ended up getting everything that I wanted including the aforementioned Secretary position given to her and the worse part is that it is not because of her skill (Which i will be the first to gracefully accept defeat) but because she was friends with the right people which is just hurtful to see for some reason.

The crush that I had developed  ended up going out with one of my close friend in College , which I dunno really hit me hard and at the same time rejected me really badly, which was definitely not helped by some people just belittling me in front of her.

My last semester went really poorly due to my inability to focus on my exams which i guess resulted from the build up of these small things and since my intelligence ipso-facto my marks are sort of my saving grace, it was really stressful

So Thanks for your time.Any help would be appreciated :)",07Jan2020,1
588,"So this is hard to express but I'll try to be clear. I've recently noticed a pattern of behavior that I've displayed all the way back to high school, maybe even elementary school. 

I'm a light skinned, black female, 25. Looking back, I've been in a lot of situations where race came up and I'm disappointed with my reactions each time. I can never stand up for myself. I can never offer insight or correct insensitive comments. When I do I dont feel confident and frequently back peddle. 

I'll include examples below but my question is has anyone else had similar experiences or advice on how to have these conversations, especially with friends. The intent often isnt malicious; a lot of it has to do with ignorance, upbringing and misinformation.

Alright, examples. For background, I was born in Canada and raised in a small, predominantly white town. Every adult in my life apart from my parents (teachers, coaches, family friends,authority figures) was white, as were most of the other kids. I was bullied a lot and I think that's had a significant effect, what with me trying so hard to fit in. Anyway:

High school picture day, a kid comes to class in a sweater and makes a big show of taking it off to reveal a confederate flag tank top. Some guys laugh and the guy seems quite pleased with him. The teacher doesnt react at all but I notice a number of people staring at me so I pretend I didnt notice. I was the only black kid in my grade (there was one asian girl and that was it for diversity). 

High school english class. Teacher is reading aloud from To Kill a Mockingbird (I dont know why she thought this was a good idea). She skips over the n-word as we're following along in our books. Two guys get rowdy and start telling her she missed a word. Then they start shouting ""my book says n*****! Why didnt you say n*****! The teacher yells at them and tells them to leave but they keep yelling the word on the way out. Again, everyone is staring at me and some are laughing at the scene. The teacher apologized directly to me which felt weird and I just said it's ok and pretended it didnt bother me.

High school prom. The prom committee decides everyone will get a prom award, a certificate with an achievement unique to them. A big task for a small group of popular girls but they have teachers helping and access to records like club involvement, sports and other extracurriculars. I played soccer for 4 years, basketball for 3, was a member of the academic excellence club (80% or higher average), was in concert and jazz band as well as jazz ensemble, I won an award for highest earning event at relay for life. I did a lot and was well known, even if I wasnt popular. But my award was whitest black person (keep in mind I was the only black person). It was really embarrassing but i smiled and laughed while i accepted my ""award"". Another kid won blackest white person and he threw up gang symbols on his way up and beat boxed as he accepted it. 4 years at that school and the entirety of the impression I'd left on my fellow students could be summed up to the colour of my skin. Moving on

Countless people have told me with varying degrees of intent that I dont act black or I dont sound black. My gay friends especially like to point out that they're blacker than me cause they're sassy, or have bigger booties. They're all white.

After high school more serious discussions came up about the confederate flag, confederate monuments and white heritage. I'm not trying to start a race fight with anyone who supports the confederacy, that's not a fight I'm going to have online with a bunch of strangers. But it came up in a university ethics class and I felt uncomfortable that the consensus was that getting rid of the flags and taking down the monuments would be erasing history. But museums are for history; monuments and flags are for honoring heroes and celebrating historic events. But I couldn't say anything.

A discussion I had with a university classmate who was trying to tell me shes proud of her ancestors, despite them being notorious slave owners. She said that doesnt make them bad people, and they were a product of their time and shouldn't be judged. It was uncomfortable again because you dont have to be proud of your ancestors. They dont define you so is is a big deal to say they're bad people?

I guess that's more political and less objective but this is white people telling me not to be offended by their ""culture"" and me saying ok, I guess I was wrong.

Another girl, a friend of mine, tried to explain the experiences of black people in the south. Shes from the south but is very white. She was triggered by our coworker and my friend who cares about social issues a lot but isnt always well informed and always takes her views too far. She doesnt like the cops and she doesnt like america. So the first friend was telling me that racism isnt a problem that black people face in the south and it's actually the black people who are racist. She says the media is biased and the hate crimes are blown out of proportion. But she wont acknowledge institutional racism, or casual racism. White people in Canada often say racism isnt a problem anymore and I can confirm this is not the case. I wasnt able to say anything but shes not in a position to speak about the black experience, even if she lived there. She also said the black people would hate me because I talk white. I hear that a lot.

I've also heard all the black jokes. People I barely knew would tell me offensive jokes based on stereotypes because I was ""chill"". I've only ever heard these jokes from white people. 

A lot of white have also tried to tell me why I shouldn't be offended when they use the n word. One of them was a teacher, and he made this point in front of the class. I didnt even put in complaint. I just stopped talking and let the subject die.

I really care about race issues and I dont want people to think I dont. I want to be able to speak to my experiance. I was bullied relentlessly as a child. I've been followed around stores. I've been singled out amongst my friends. I've been called all sorts of names. I want to be able to talk about the effects these jokes and attitudes have, especially with my friends. But I dont know what to say. I dont want to come across as oversensitive or dramatic and I dont want to tell people how to think. I just want to open minds a little. I hope I didnt waste too many people's time. Any advice on how to have these conversations would be appreciated, not for the jackasses who wanna be jackasses but for everyone else",07Jan2020,1
589,"My sister around 11 I think, started making friends wit outside cats, one cat gave birth to kittens and she the raised them outside our house, she even asked mom for catfood who eventually gave in after her begging, so she used to be very active and play with them but ten she started becoming more introverted and didn't go out at all, sometimes she didn't give cat food to them, I even had to give catfood myself sometimes because they were starting to look weak, our mom told us to stop giving catfood so much or they won't be able to survive by themselves, my sister sometimes used this as a excuse and just gave plain bread and went back to play games.  


 then at 13, some of the cats had went to other houses and started hunting for themselves, she obviously still gave food and cared for them but she stayed inside all day and would sneak chicken outside to them and give milk every morning, at 15 she mostly used to rely on the food given by the garderner since he liked cats too, he gave them a few pieces of meat mixed with some leftovers, she asked if they got their 'dinner' alot. But the cats outside still got weak, ( this is a differnt generation of cats btw) one used to e dirty and had some kind of disease, but we couldn't take her to the vet as it was exppensive in our country and our dad would never agree, she was very skinny and meowed all th time on the window, she used to give milk and sometimes warmed it, sometimes gave snacks during the day and was starting to give less attention.  


then we went on a trip,  around 7 days later we came, she petted the cat and went in, we were all tired and didn't give much thoug about the cat, it seemed fine, but later the cat was dead outside, I suspected it died of stravation or weakness, and the poor cat didn't even get to see my sister who she adored in her last moments, she was the most loving cat ever, and would rub against everyone, and always got jealous of other cats giving attention.  


it's cousin the other cat gave kittens, she of course also took care of that family, she tool extra care of them the first few months, then she had appendictis and couldn't move due to te pain after surgery, apparently her appendix had already burst and they were just in time, she asked dad and the me to take care of them and we did, mom was overprotective and never let her outside, eventually two of the kittens went outside the house, she strated missing them 3 day later and tried calling for them alot, on kitten stayed and she take alot of care, always asking about it going when it meows, but I've realized she still spends most of her time inside and just makes sure they're fed and their bed boxes are fine and ocansionally adds more boxed, she barely plays with the kitten though, and doesn't give attention that much

590,"I had this friend who I would hang out with at least 2 times a week and we'd talk daily. Then back in November I bought her a concert ticket for her birthday (she really wanted to see it and knew that I got the ticket for her). At the concert she didn't say much and was visibly upset about something. I asked what was up and she didn't want to talk about it and it's something that she has to deal with on her own, then hinted that she didn't really want to go anymore, but only did because I got her the ticket. Alright, no worries. Then a few days later I suggested a movie and she said ""maybe when I'm feeling better. Don't know when that will be"". We keep talking and a couple weeks pass and I ask if she wants to go to that movie sometime within the next week. She responded with ""what movie? You make it sound like we've talked about it."" I say ""I suggested it awhile ago. You said maybe once you're feeling better."" to which I got ""oh. Right. I can't seem to get out of sickness. I'm starting to get a bad cough."" (didn't add up to what she said before, but I thought oh well). Three other times since then I've suggested doing something and she said said she was busy. I didn't message her for about a week and a half to see if I'd hear from her (I didn't). We then did set up some plans after talking some more, but she cancelled last minute which she never did. Some more time passed and she asked if I was coming to her family's Christmas (we set up plans before any of this took place.) I didn't really want to go anymore, but I still planned on it... except it was on the 25th. I thought that it was on the 24th and I had plans with my family on the 25th, so I cancelled which she said ""alright, no worries :)"" to.

591,"I'm 17 yo and I'm in college. There's this one quiet guy in class who is a year younger than me, he doesn't speak much but everyone likes him.

This morning he sent a message in our classes group chat saying: ""I've done something illegal and the police are gonna come find me today or tomorrow, I'm really scared"". Everyone replied with something along the lines of: ""Dude, you ok?"". He later followed with: ""I don't want to talk about that right now I'll just see what happens today, I'm not gonna lie I'm kinda scared but well it's my fault"". He later deleted the messages. 

He came into college today for 45 minutes and didn't say much, although he looked really upset. I didn't know what to day or do. Me and a few of my classmates went to the library together along with the quiet kid. After about 10 minutes he just stood up and left without saying a word.

15 minutes later he messaged a classmate of mine saying: ""I've gone home to sort this fucker out, after all it's my fault so I have to deal with this problem myself"". This gave me a really bad feeling.

I messaged him on snapchat saying: ""If you need help with anything, speak to us. Please!"" He left me on read.

We haven't heard from him for a few hours and we're pretty worried. Since nobody in the class was close to him we dont have his phone number. Only form of contact is snapchat.

What should we do?

592,"I've been with my girlfriend now for over 2 and a half years, and honestly, I count myself lucky to be with her every day. We have a strong relationship, and we talk about everything. But I've had feelings for other people pretty much consistently throughout our relationship, and these always impact my happiness. I initially came out as polyamorous, around the time that our relationship started, and she definitely wasn't, but was initially okay with me exploring connections with other people. She tolerated it at least. (FWIW, I was always transparent with her about what I was doing, and never did anything ""behind her back"".) After we broke up and got back together, she said that she wasn't okay with it any more, so I've committed to her and shut out those other windows.

I want so badly to be able to forget about those other windows, focus on my happiness in this relationship, and move on. I know that time will eventually do the job. But right now, I'm unhappy. I'm still feeling a crush on a girl I've known for a couple of years now, who I'm not even sure if she lives in the country any more. She liked me, and I liked her, but that was while I was in a relationship and committed. She knew I identified as polyamorous and wouldn't have been okay with it any more than my girlfriend was, and I can't know that our personalities would even match up - but I'm sad that I never even got to date her, or explore anything with her. Every time I see a picture of her on Facebook, I just get sad straightaway. I don't talk to her anymore for the same reason.

I've had other crushes or attractions on and off, and most of them have gone away or faded - although at the time, I've felt just as sad. I felt like I desperately wanted to explore a new connection with someone else, but was constrained by my commitment to my girlfriend. This has happened many, many times. But for some reason this crush isn't going away as fast, and I really hate that it's impacting my happiness in my relationship now.

I love my girlfriend, and truly think we're a good fit together. We've talked about this lots, and I've been honest about the way I feel - that I love her, but I can't stop myself from having these feelings for other people. It doesn't mean I love her any less.

I just can't stop myself from feeling sad at all the opportunities for connections I never took. I was a late bloomer in sex and relationships - I didn't sleep around as a teenager, was/still am socially awkward, and never knew how to automatically attract people, so my first relationships were often people I settled with because they liked me, rather than because I was genuinely attracted. My girlfriend is the first person I've been with who I'm genuinely attracted to. But since meeting her, I've known other people who I've been attracted to and have been attracted to me in return, and I wished that I wasn't committed so that I could see where those went. At times I wish for being single again, just to make the feeling of longing and regret go away.

I don't really want that. I want to make my relationship work, but I also want to find a way to move on, be happy right now, and stop thinking about the closed doors.

Any advice whatsoever would be appreciated.

593,"For whatever reason I have been experiencing an intense upheaval and cleansing of my sexual energies. And I have been reminded of a situation a couple years ago where I was exposed to images of a naked underaged girl. From what my research has shown me, what I experienced was sexual non-concordance; I experienced strong sexual stimulation because of the sexual characteristics that were present, but felt internal conflict due to the face that I subjectively would not sexually pursue/desire someone of that age. (It is also for this reason that I would not call myself a Hebephile because I do not even remotely struggle with desire or fantasies toward that age group.)
I have come to accept the biological nature of being aroused by something like this situation, what I have trouble getting past is the shame I have felt. This shame is undoubtedly connected to my own puberty/adolesence, as I was raised in a very closed-minded and emotionally oppressive household - something that has contributed to a lot of sexual repression for me.
I have talked with close friends about the non-concordance and know that I'm not the only one to experience such things, and my research has shown that attraction to sexual characteristics is not something you can control or shame yourself for. I have also read extensively about CBT and ACT therapies to curb my anxiety.
But does anyone have any advice on how to release the sexual shame and better accept myself and my past? Not just with the instance that happened to me a couple years ago, but also the deep sexual shame that was rooted in me decades ago. Sometimes I can't tell if it's something that truly needs healing attention, or if it's just my anxiety digging its heels into whatever it can to keep me ruminating in the past (where anxiety thrives).

Is it weird if I go over tomorrow and introduce myself to her? It will probably go something like this.

""Excuse me, is your name Summer?""

""Yeah it is.""

""You play water polo right?""

""Yeah I do.""

""I saw you playing in that one game last season against [University of Whatever]. That game winning goal you scored was insane! How's this season going?""

""Thanks. It's going well and blah blah blah""

""Nice, that's all very impressive. I'm Ariana by the way. Nice to meet you.""

""Nice to meet you too.""

The whole conversation will probably go something like that. I have gotten better at reading social cues over the years, and I think I'll be able to tell if she's not interested in talking to me. She and I might even click really innately and become close friends.

She's an engineering major (plus internships probably) AND a water polo player, so she probably doesn't have a lot of time to make new friends. She's probably really busy with the friends she already has, and I know sports teams are usually really tight.

This might develop into an ""athlete-fan relationship."" That's pretty much all I want to get out of it. I'm not into her gender. I'm really just trying to fangirl here to be honest.

In high school, a sophomore was a little too excited to see me playing soccer, to a point that he was thoroughly researching me, going to all my games (home and away), and messaging me on Facebook about how great I did.

then we went on a trip, around 7 days later we came, she petted the cat and went in, we were all tired and didn't give much thoug about the cat, it seemed fine, but later the cat was dead outside, I suspected it died of stravation or weakness, and the poor cat didn't even get to see my sister who she adored in her last moments, she was the most loving cat ever, and would rub against everyone, and always got jealous of other cats giving attention.

it's cousin the other cat gave kittens, she of course also took care of that family, she tool extra care of them the first few months, then she had appendictis and couldn't move due to te pain after surgery, apparently her appendix had already burst and they were just in time, she asked dad and the me to take care of them and we did, mom was overprotective and never let her outside, eventually two of the kittens went outside the house, she strated missing them 3 day later and tried calling for them alot, on kitten stayed and she take alot of care, always asking about it going when it meows, but I've realized she still spends most of her time inside and just makes sure they're fed and their bed boxes are fine and ocansionally adds more boxed, she barely plays with the kitten though, and doesn't give attention that much

599,"So my girlfriend and I have been dating for a little bit over a year now and our relationship has always been amazing. As soon as I laid my eyes on her when we first met, I fell in love instantaneously. As time went on I have been falling for her more and more. It feels as if we are legitimate soul mates, the connection between us is unreal. Like we are made for each other. I love her more than anything. And I've never felt this way for anyone before, and that's why she's the only gf I've ever had. I'm 25, and she is 23. 

Just last night she pulled me aside because she said she had something she'd been needing to get off her chest for awhile. She told me that she's never told any man this before and the reason being is because she never felt she trust anyone to the point of telling, until me. 

She basically ended up saying that about 4-5 years ago she used to be a sugar baby. The first guy was older (maybe 50) and they only had sex twice. The first guy ended up blocking her and she then ended up going on some website called Seeking Arrangement? She said she heard about this site from a friend and that some people will pay over the top money for just feet pictures. Idk. But there was apparently some dude on that site that came over to her house one time (in his 30s she said) and had sex with her and didn't pay her any money and she says she honestly wasn't expecting to have sex with this man. An then after that guy, some friend ended up texting her and saying how her Uncle (in his 40s) was thinking about becoming a sugar daddy and was wanting to speak to her because he wanted advice on how to do it. So apparently they met up and they ended up having sex and as soon as the sex was done, the guy left $400 on the bed and left. After that time she said she was completely done with what she was doing. She said she felt so disgusted with herself at that point because it came off so transactional. She cut off all ties with everyone at this point and didn't even care if she lost her car because it just wasn't worth it if that was the price she had to pay to keep it. Keep in mind she said that all of this happened with within a month and a halfs time.

She mentioned how the only reason she did this is for financial reasons. She had a lot of bills for her car, license plates, insurance, rent and etc. She said she didn't enjoy any of it one bit. She had just gotten fired from her only job at the time and wasn't getting hired anywhere else. I can tell by the way she was speaking about it that she regrets her decisions a lot. She was shaking and trembling when she was admitting all of this to me.

I get that people go through hard times financially, but this is just really hard to take in all at once. Do you guys believe this is something that I should be able to get over? What would you do if you were in my shoes? It's just hard imagining her doing all of this.",07Jan2020,1
600,"I (M22) have a girlfriend (F18). Everything went smoothly until she confessed what she did in the past. She told me that she used to sleep around because she wanted love/affection from men because her dad never showed any affection or love towards her (she has daddy issues). She told me that few compliments were enough for her to jump on a dick. This was 2-3 years ago. She's saying now that she's changed, she's not like that anymore, she respects herself and that she's loyal and she never cheated on any of her boyfriends (one night stands were between relationships). She has that mindset that if you are single that you can do whatever you want, if you are not hurting anybody. We got together right after she broke up with her ex boyfriend. So how does she know she's not like that anymore since she wasn't single for 2 years.

And that's where my insecurities kick in. I freaked out a little (maybe not that little) about this part of her life and then she told me that she won't tell me the rest (she said there's A LOT MORE), because it will hurt me or whatever. So how should I don't have trust issues if she refuses to tell me everything. How can I believe her.

Also she started to act slutty (she had/has huge anxiety about some things, it's a long story), she told that's who she really is, that she's like that only for me and she wasn't like that because of her anxieties, which I understand. But how can I be sure that's not just her being slutty because she's missing her old life and attention from others.

She told me that I'm giving her enough love and she doesn't need that love from anyone else, but what if it at some point won't be enough or what if I won't be able to give her enough love/affection because I will have a weak moment. 

I also know she has a fetish for asian guys and she's watching asian videos (on youtube etc.) because of it and it kinda hurts me since I am not watching girls just because I like them (need the content to be good).  Am I insane over this part?

She told me to get rid of my insecurities because it hurts her that I don't trust her and it will eventually cost us our relationship.

Am I insane? Are my insecurities pointless and how can I get rid of them or overcome them?",07Jan2020,1

I was sexually assaulted a few years ago, it took a long time to process what happened and accept it. I've only told two of my very close female friends and am worried about how my close male friend will think. I'm not sure, I know everyone is different. But I've heard of girls opening up to these things to their boyfriends and them acting weird, feeling weird about it. Maybe look at you differently or judge you somehow. Like how I was in a position for it to happen to me. I'm not trying to make assumptions, this is kind of my fear speaking here. I'm hoping to get a few different opinions and see if it's worth opening up to him about it or just keeping it a secret.

604,"We’ve been best friends for years and have always communicated everything. I’ve just started discovering my bisexuality but haven’t told anyone because I like women more than guys and just don’t want the whole big thing of coming out, especially with the judgement of bisexual men, and I overall just don’t feel like people need to know my business. I’m FTM too and he’s always known this and he’s never showed judgement, but coming out as bi is harder for me and something I dont see myself coming out for.

I first found him on Grindr a year and a half ago. I didn’t have a face pic up and he had a photo that wasn’t of him but of a band logo I knew only he likes so I know it was him, and of course the profile info and him only being 20 feet away. At the time he was asking to only see MTFs, so I wasn’t going to think he was gay/bi or anything. But I didn’t want him to know about me, so I deleted my account. He had gotten drunk a few months later, and opened up to me about how he had hooked up with an MTF at a hotel, and liked it, of course I told him it didn’t make him gay. I dont think he ever remembers telling me this. I went on vacation in November in NYC, where nobody knows me, giving me the comfort of putting a face pic up. I forgot I had this up when I came home. I found him on Tinder again, a pic of just his torso with a shirt I know is his, and in his profile reading “looking for fwb/cuddle buddies, mainly into trans/fem” which sounded like now he was open to feminine guys now too, and not just trans. I had saw this profile again before my vacation but hadn’t had a profile pic so I didn’t panic as much, but did delete my account. When I came back and saw he was on there and online, and my profile was showing, I deleted my account again.

I felt humiliated because it mentioned me being a bottom, and overall I just felt stupid for ever showing my face, and for not deleting again before I came home. I figure he saw me, but nothing was ever mentioned. 

Now, he’s had a girlfriend officially for 2 months. She spent the holidays with us, she’s stays over almost every other day and we all hang out together once or twice a week. I like her a lot, it’s been a long time since he’s been in a relationship. They’ve gotten pretty serious. And of course, I thought with him having a girlfriend I was in the clear to recreate my account and start using Grindr again. Last night I logged in to find he was on there again, and was online 20 minutes before. Same profile and bio as before. I blocked him. We were both home, neither of us watching TV with the apartment dead silent. He didn’t come out to hang out with me like he usually would, so I think he knows I saw him and he saw me. I felt so uncomfortable, and angry at him for being back on there with having a girlfriend. I felt mad that I couldn’t just have MY secret to myself, because I didn’t want him to ever find out. 

I haven’t seen him since I found him on there again. His girlfriend will probably be staying over tomorrow, and she’ll want to watch movies with us. But now I feel like I’m lying to her too, but he’s my best friend, and I dont want to out him when he hasn’t even told me on his own terms. It irritates me because we’re both in the closet, I can’t confront him about this.

608,"I moved 6 months ago for work. We both agreed it was the right choice. He was supposed to come, but kept flip-flopping on his decision. I told him how much I loved him and wanted to come, but that he could go in grace if he couldn't make the leap - I just asked that he give me closure if that was the case. As this dragged on I also asked that we wait to get engaged due to so much uncertainty.

He then stopped talking to me for 5 days and sent me several angry emails accusing me of control issues. He asked me not to respond so I didn't unless he directly asked me a question. 

Then he sent me an email ending our relationship. Claiming my request for the courtesy of a closure phone call was just another facet of me needing to control everything. And that he would oblige me, but only in 6-12 months when he was ready to talk. After all this he said he would like to try again in the future, he still loved me, and signed it ta-ta for now. (Gag)

I am so angry.  Angry that he took my request for basic respect and decency and twisted it into a bid for control. Angry that as he made those accusations he made sure to set up the last week of our relationship so that he had control over every facet of our communication. I obliged without argument out of respect for boundaries and ended up alone and unheard. Without the chance to defend myself from his litany of accusations or share the deep hurt he had caused by his indecision - and now - 1200 miles away from my family and friends with no local network to fall back on for support because I spent every spare moment the last 6 months nurturing his insecurities, instead of making new connections.

I need advice. Advice on how to work through this anger and ideas on how to find support in a place that's new. I have a therapist I'm already seeing so I'm looking for something in addition that.

627,"**Context:**

Math honestly doesn't seem like her strong suit. She's had a lot of trouble with her grades and as a result, she was signed up to a math tutoring center a couple years ago. The tuition center's level of math is one level higher than her high school math class (advanced algebra vs basic algebra)

I would also offer to help her with her homework, however, she doesn't want to listen to me and just waits for me to give her the answer. This would result in me getting frustrated as 1) she doesn't actually listen to me teach her the concepts (just says i have no idea and stares blankly) 2) she would always ask for help late at night, thus saying that she needs to sleep and ask me to hurry up. This, quite frankly, has resulted in me getting extremely annoyed, and sometimes I would give up teaching her these concepts. 

The tutoring center initially went well. However, they provided her the copy of the answer books so she could check her work before turning it in. (She had to repeat the topic around 3 times, so I guess they decided that she could check it herself by now). However, as some of you may guess, this has resulted in her copying the answers down for entire assignments. Initially it seemed alright as she could do it but copying resulted in a faster completion, but now, she can't understand the problem/complete them without the answer key. Some questions have the answer pasted onto the next line with no work. 

**Problem:**

Last night, I just completely broke all patience I had with her. I straight up told her that if she keeps copying off the answer book like that, there's no way she can pass the next test they have in the tuition center. I told her that the only way she can start improving is to stop copying down her answers and actually try to understand what is going on. She argued that her grades were okay in school so it doesn't matter what happens in the tuition center. I countered by showing that she will definitely fail the next few levels if she wasn't going to put effort in what she was learning now. 

Our school requires that all students must take the math courses, and since I am two grades above, what she is learning in the tuition center will be tested in school soon. Recently she brought back her school assignments for me to ""help"" and she clearly didn't want to try to solve them. Granted her grades were average but if this ""helping"" continues, I'm afraid that the next few exams will be impossible for her to solve. Our mom suggested to get a special tutor, but quite frankly, I don't think tutors can change her attitude about completing homework assignments.

I'm not sure how to word it better to her or how to provide help anymore. She doesn't want me to teach her the subjects and I'm just about ready to chuck those answer keys into the bonfire and refuse all help.",07Jan2020,1

631,"Hi, so I am here for...advice!

So I am a young woman living in an apartment with my boyfriend. This is my first home outside of my parents house, and first time living in an apartment building at all so I have had to get used to dealing with annoying neighbours so close around me. The people that live directly above me are the worst. I hear them all the time doing things that make no sense in a small apartment. I'll hear crashing, thumping, and one day they were jumping or something and I didn't notice because of the sound, but because my whole place was shaking to the point of things falling off shelves. And no, I know it wasn't an earthquake. I have not gone up to asked them to stop yet, but this is my limit.

So yesterday at around 10am I start hearing...yelping? Not quite barking but same idea. I guess one of them got a dog for Christmas. I had to leave but my boyfriend was home all day. When I got home around 3pm I could still hear it and he said it hadn't stopped. He had his headphones on all day to block it out. It ended up finally stopping around 6pm. I was going to go leave a note on their door because I figured that they were not home (because who could just passively listen to that all day) but I heard them yelling inside at each other. It seemed like they were fighting so I didn't knock on the door because it clearly wasn't a good time. I just kept the note too. I thought it had stopped for good. This morning, I was woken up at 7am but the barking again. It's 9:30am now and I am going to drop off the note on my way to class. I tried to sound nice and just explain that it's really disruptive. I left it anonymous. I'll see how that goes but I need some advice with next steps. 

So I am nervous about talking to them because they are likely older than me as most of the residents in my building are older adults and not my age. I don't want to seem like a whiny kid, I also don't want to make enemies with any of my neighbours as I only moved in here 5 months ago and I will be here long-term. I also don't know if I should complain to my superintendent about this because I just accidentally broke a building rule like a week ago and he was very nice about it and actually made an exception for me just to help me out. Basically my boyfriend's truck is technically not allowed in the parking garage but we didn't know until after he bought it so he lets us park it there. I would hate to then turn around and whine about someone else after he helped us out. That's the other reason I do not want to talk to my neighbours directly, because if they find out where I live they could notice the truck in my spot and make a big deal out of it so our super would have to tell us to get rid of the truck, and we would absolutely have to. 

So yeah. I don't really know what to do. Also, I am very worried about the dog itself. Something is wrong if the dog is barking all day. I have always had dogs, I know them. That dog sounds like it is in pain. Also the barking is always in the same spot, so I think he might be locked in the bedroom all day or something. As annoyed as I am by the barking, I don't blame the dog, I am mad at the negligent owner. 

So, do I phone the superintendent, the police, the humane society....what do I do here?

By the way I live in Nova Scotia if that matters at all.",07Jan2020,1

636,"Hello, new to the sub.

I’ve worked outdoors jobs my whole life, and I never had a chance to be tired really - that sounds stupid, but if any of you are on your feet, constantly moving all day, you know exactly what I mean. Now I’m working a desk job, and have found myself having a hard time keeping my eyes open some mornings.

I quit drinking pop and energy drinks three and a half years ago, and have had minimal amounts of caffeine since then - the occasional Dr. Pepper or Fanta - and have never liked coffee. When I get tired while driving, I usually snack on something (like sunflower seeds, for instance), and I’ve been doing the same at work, but it doesn’t help a whole lot. I stand up and stretch every now and then, and walk around for a minute.

Anyone have any other suggestions? Thanks!",07Jan2020,1

639,"I work for a pretty great company, but I'm considering moving on because I need higher pay and better benefits, which I don't know if my current company will ever be able to provide. 

The company likes you to put in at least two weeks' notice before taking time off, if you can help it. But they are understanding if you have to leave with very minimal notice due to a family emergency, or an urgent health appointment or things like that. They definitely cut you some slack regarding the two week rule in that regard. But they can also be weird about you taking time off, so it's sort of a back and forth dynamic....sometimes they're ok, sometimes they're not. Also, I work standard business hours, so the only time I could really interview if I did decide to start looking at other jobs would be on my lunch breaks. And that would only work if the companies were within close proximity to my current employer. If they were on the other side of town, I wouldn't be able to get there in time,interview, and make it back within the hour.

So if I do decide to go this route, should I just straight up talk with my boss and tell her I'm looking at other jobs and that I will need to take time to go to interviews (and hope she doesn't get mad), or should I just say I have an appointment and not say what it's for, and hope they're ok with me not telling them in advance? I really don't want to be deceptive about this, but I feel like they won't give me time off to go to interviews if I actually tell them what I'm doing.

The other option is to quit this job, take a temporary job at my husband's work, while telling them that I will be actively interviewing while working there but just be there to have something so we don't lose income. Then I could interview pretty much whenever I wanted to, because they would understand, and I would already be going into that job with that expectation. However, this option is a last resort, which we would generally only consider if something happened to my current job that was out of my control. So I'd like to try and focus on other options of how I can stay at my current job while still interviewing without feeling like I'm being dishonest. 

I feel sort of trapped...like my hours and the work policy prohibit me from being able to actively interview...what are your thoughts? What should I do?",07Jan2020,1

Basically, I met a guy on tinder, he seemed super nice but had just gotten out of a long term relationship, and I kinda did as well,so I didn’t meet him until last week (6 months later)

The date went pretty well, he brought me chocolate that I said I liked in conversation, very sweet, very intelligent guy.  

Fast forward to him showing me pictures of his parents home in Greece, and pictures of him and friends at the beach.

There were about 6 or 7 pictures of women’s behinds that he had obviously taken without without knowing them or getting consent. He giggled at them and said yeah yeah booties booties 

Am I overreacting or is this a bad sign? Is this normal? Do men do this at the beach? It seems a bit creepy to me but I come from a conservative backround as well, so basically

644,"This is a suit that is currently active.
I am being sued by a web design company out of San Diego, CA. We will call them D&amp;R for now. I hired them to build a website for a new company I was starting and ultimately was unhappy with their work and had to hire someone to come in and redo it. So I proceeded to put a review accordingly, because that is how I found them in the first place. (But I didn’t realize he was working the system to maintain a good rating). Well he decided to promptly put a couple fake reviews on my new company with no reviews yet rendering me a 1 star company before I even open the doors.
He then proceeds to dispute the reviews constantly with multiple accounts that he has opened to be able to have an army of fake internet accounts. So he eventually gets it pulled down, and he also removes his fake reviews based on his lawyer advising him to do so. So some time, later I decide to put a new review (under an alias this time for fear of retribution), and a few months later I get court documents at my front door. To make a long story short, my attorney filed a SLAPP motion and we were successful on half, but half of it my attorney says the judge was lazy and will need to go to appeal and we should win it. Well through all this I am paying 10’s of thousands of dollars to fight this and to be able to keep my reviews up there. But now he has successfully gotten all the reviews disputed and removed, but yet the case is ongoing. I haven’t put any new reviews because of the lawsuit but I would really like to hear the opinion of some uninvolved attorneys to find out if I am approaching this in the right manner. Lastly I should mention, I was offered a 5k settlement in which I would pay him 5k along with removing all reviews. I declined that offer because I fee like I should fight for my right to free speech. Also note, my review was opinion based and I never mentioned any facts unless they were 100% true. Advice?

653,"Hello Reddit,

I  don’t know where to start. So, let me start from the beginning. I am 30  years old and I live in a major European city. My parents are  immigrants. They come from a place, where religion (islam), tradition,  and honour play a big role. However, they were quite liberal in the way  they raised me. Even though neither of them drank alcohol or smoked, I  could drink, party and be just a regular teenager. But I still was  exposed to the culture and the way of thinking within our community.

8  years ago, I met a girl (now 29 years old) and I fell in love with her.  She has the same background as me, but she and her family are more  conservative than me and my family. But I just fell in love with her and  decided to “be a better man” for her. We dated for 5 years before we  married. But it was not regular dating as other might know but dating  within our cultural boundaries. We couldn’t be seen together; we  couldn’t kiss or anything else. We only saw each other during lunch at  university and talked a lot on the phone. Anyway. We married 3 Years  ago, and all the problems started. First, we couldn’t have sex because  she was too frightened and tensed up. So, I waited, and I didn’t put her  under pressure. However, she still wasn’t ready to have sex. But then  all the problems within our marriage started to begin. Her mother  started to call me a wuss and that I was not man-enough, because I was  the one at home who was cooking and cleaning. My wife started to be less  and less interested in me and without ever having sex with her, I  started to sleep on the couch and am still sleeping on the couch for the  past two years. We decided that we are going to get a divorce but that  we should wait for another one and half years because of university. Our  parents doesn't know about our intentions. Within our community,  divorced women are ostracized. Therefore, she asked me to endure the  marriage and to wait until we both have finished university, so that she  can be independent as a divorced woman. She doesn’t want to depend on  her parents. And I agreed, because I get her: It is hard for women  within our community, and I still like her as a human being, and I would  like to help her.

But I want to be free. I want to be loved again.

I  have met another woman. She is 25 and I told her about my situation. We  talk with each other but sometimes I have the feeling that she is less  interested in me than I am in her. And I can’t help but be very clingy  and persistent. 90% of the time, I am the one who texts her.  I think I  annoy her sometimes. But the way I feel, I feel like a fucking teenager.  Butterflies in my stomach, constantly thinking about her, checking my  phone every 2 seconds, being sad about her not writing to me. I can’t  think straight and can’t concentrate on my work.  I even bought her big  birthday present that I want to give her on her birthday next week. But I  feel like my feelings are unrequited. I asked her about how she feels  about me, but her only answer is time will tell. And sometimes I think  she isn't honest because she doesn't want to break my heart.

I  don’t know what to do, I feel like being caged up and at the same time  unloved. I just want her to like me and tell me that I might have chance  and that she likes me too the way I like her. But on the other hand, I  am still married, and even though I sleep on the couch, I still live  with her. I don’t know what to do. Sometimes I feel like I fall apart.

What  can I do in order to be cooler headed and maybe even lose those  feelings that I have for the new woman? I need advice in how to handle  my whole situation.",07Jan2020,1

Some background. My girlfriend broke up with me around two months ago and I was very hurt by it. I didn't really see it coming -- our relationship was going great, but due to some issues of her own she broke it off. It really hurt me, but about a month later I got into the dating game again. I met this girl via Tinder, and we met I few times before Christmas holidays (I go to university, so I live in a uni-town and went back home to my hometown over the holidays, where she doesn't live). We stayed in touch via text and Snapchat, and what was just friendly talk turned into some pretty intense flirting at times. Things were feeling great with this girl -- we had lots in common and we obviously did like each other. We decided to meet up at her place for dinner when I got back, and so we did. It went great -- we had good laughs and good talk, which in turn developed into kissing, which developed into more intense kissing and later sex. It felt right in the moment. Mind you, I DID NOT do this as a way of trying to get over my ex or using my date just for sex. Even though I of course sometimes think about my ex and what we had, things have gotten much, much better. After the intercourse we were cozying up, talked and kissed a bit. However, it was when we went to bed I started having feelings of regret. I thought about my girlfriend and really felt that I couldn't handle a relationship like this with another person right now. The morning after we had breakfast and I parted ways saying we were going to talk and see each other again. The feelings of regret and also shame started coming more and more the day after, and I have decided to end it with this girl. I did tell her about my ex before and that I'm ""a bit scared"" of something big and want to take it slow. I'd like to tell her the old ""it's not you, it's me"" (which it is), that I'm not ready for a relationship or dating right, that I really appreciate her as person (make sure that she knows I didn't use her for sex) and that I'm sorry if I got her hopes up. I don't really know how to formulate myself though; also, should I do it via text or face to face? It feels cowardly to do it via text, but it isn't like we are in a relationship and I feel that meeting her would get her hopes up that it would be a date. Text feels more straightforward, but I'm thinking about offering her the opportunity to meet me over coffee if she wants to talk things through?

I recently relocated to a new city and signed a lease for an apartment. I moved in a few days ago and I realized I would have to pay an additional $800 per month for commuting.

We work at this retail store, but hardly work together because she's part-time.. After talking for a bit, I found out that she is still in high school!

Now I don't ever seek out people her age, it's usually people mid-to-late-20's, but it seems superficial to discount her just because her age...

She has previously told me how she wants to switch departments, and so the other day I told her how that department lost an employee and might need some help..

long story short, she wanted me to email the manager on her behalf and ask if they have any positions available..

I did just that, and later this week when we work together I plan on letting her know what the manager said, and also asking for her number to keep her updated if any positions open up again.. 

I genuinely want to keep her updated, but of course my primary reason is to have her number to keep in touch with her..

She's about to be 18 later this year. and I just want to stay in touch, continue talking at work and hang out with her at some point. She's really cool and it feels wrong to discount her due to age.

We hit it off fast, To the point to we talked every day. (Met her in November). However, the way I met her in a double date sort of event, which means my best friend had her best friend. My best friend is a really attractive guy and tends to lead on girls and get a lot of them. So eventually my best friend ended up rejecting her best friend. After this shit went SOUTH. She stopped hitting me up as much, took hours to answer my texts. She would have highly engaging conversations and literally the next day it would be dryer than a Desert because she wouldn’t respond. I honestly felt a connection with her, the first day I went out with her she grabbed unto and held hands. Even cuddled by watching a movie. This next part is a little hard to explain if you don’t have Snapchat. On Snapchat you can post story’s on your daily life and it will have time stamps of when you posted them. You can also remove people from your story, so they can’t see the story you posted that day. She lives a little far away from so we usually meet in the city. I saw him in the city because on her best friends story she was in the city with her best friend and some random other guy. However she didn’t post anything on her story regarding it. Later in the night, I noticed her story reappeared with all the time stamps of her day’s experience which meant she blocked from her story and just re added me. I didn’t mention anything about her doing this but she proceeded to tell me she couldn’t hang out with me because she had a time constraint limiting her hang out time.

Just the fact that she removed me from her story got me so mad, so the next day I posted a passive aggressive story stating my feelings and I don’t like getting played and said something corny of leaving you in 2019. However this is a story that hundreds of people can see so it wasn’t directed at her, however it was about her. After viewing that story she hasn’t texted me at all. We have this thing called “streaks” on Snapchat which I send trying to start a convo but now it takes several hours for her to open it even though I notice she’s online. My friends always tell me I’m a very attractive person, however it’s always hard for me to get girls, probably because of my game. I tend to get attached easily, probably their not being many women in my life. At this point I’m depressed and just want to shut myself in a hole and never come out. I know people can always tell me their are always going to be more girls, but these are always people who get girls on the regular. I’m such a stupid person, This girl looked very different from the rest so that attracted me. Yet I feel like I just fucked this up. I bet right now she’s telling her best friend how much I want her and both of them laughing at me. This sucks.",07Jan2020,1

I’ve been doing cute shit with her. We cuddle and talk everyday. We tell each other we miss each other. Sometimes I feel like I text her more and put in more effort but then I think we are just friends, she isn’t ready. 
I back off and don’t text as much and she would be like why haven’t you texted me all day. So I text her but I asked her once if we are just friends I’m going to back off the cute shit and she tells me she wants me to keep going with it, she likes it. But I think that we are just friends and I get a little confused. 

She likes to take things slow and ease into a relationship where it becomes a point where I ask her oh since we are doing all this want to go out. 

Instead of jumping into one as I’m not doing any cute shit then jumping into it. 

Thoughts on this? 
Every friend I asked get confused and ask why don’t we just go out where I respond I don’t know. She just isn’t ready. Like I don’t want to pressure her, and I don’t want to force anything she doesn’t want. But it just makes me think.",07Jan2020,1

Then I noticed everything went silent and my mother looked over to the corner where I was on my phone. I just stared at my phone and ignored the sudden tension in the room as it seemed like maybe they asked an embarrassing question about bowel movements or periods, I didn’t really know. 

My mother lowered her tone but I could still hear her, I had become hyper aware of the conversation at this point despite trying not to. I think it’s just because of how serious everyone has suddenly become. My mother told the nurse  details that I wouldn’t like to play as it’s my mothers privacy but then ended it with she was awaiting results and was due a biopsy. She then said she hadn’t told myself or my sibling yet. 

I could feel my vision going and felt like I was going to vomit but just stared intensely at my phone so my mother didn’t worry I had heard, she clearly did not want to tell me or my sibling yet and I didn’t want her have more to worry about. 

Now I am sick to my stomach and I haven’t told anyone, I really want to talk to someone about it because I’m terrified and since I don’t know anything concrete, my mind is racing. I wanted to tell my sibling because I feel like they should know and, more selfishly, I need to talk to someone who will understand this.

687,"Sorry if I'm doing this wrong or it's complicated to read. In September 2018 I went to a sixth form to do a levels. Most of the people from my secondary school went there including most of my friends. It probably wasn't the best sixth form overall and I ended up having issues with one of my friends in particular (who I've now made up with) so i got pretty down about being there. I was getting quite confused about my other sixth form option as my parents really wanted me to go there and I was starting to question if I'd made the right choice. 

In January my parents had got some advice and pushed me quite hard into quitting sixth form entirely for the rest of the year and restarting at a new sixth form different to either of the two before. I've now been at the new sixth form since September 2019 and, while things started well, I've come to hate it there and deeply regret ever leaving. 

The sixth form I'm at now is a school sixth form which means its attached to a secondary school and has a uniform etc. I really despise being treated like a kid and being mixed with lower years. I really miss my friends and feel like I've lost a year of my life and memories that I could have had with them if I'd have stayed. It hurts to know that they'll go through exams, results and going to university without me.

Overall, I don't think there's anything I can really do to fix the issue and I'm sorry if I sound like I'm making a huge deal out of nothing but i genuinely just feel nauseous all the time when I'm there and can't stop thinking about whats happened. I'm mostly just hoping someone can spin a positive look on the situation for me as I'm really struggling to cope.

I recently finished college and I feel so down and done with everyone lately and I feel like I don’t have good reason to feel this way. My nan isn’t a grumpy old lady however she can be snappy sometimes over simple questions or just likes to moan over extremely little things.

My mum has been with her boyfriend for about 9 years and he’s abusive. He doesn’t hit her often in fact I think it has only happened a handful of times. Still, he shouts and ruins everyone’s lives with his constant verbal abuse. I love my mum but I can’t go round her house anymore because of him. She always lets him come back. Even when the police got involved and sent him to prison... she allowed him back into our lives.

My mum takes a lot of her stress out on me and my younger brother, shouts at us for very small things and overall just makes everything unpleasant.

My little brother (17) has been doing drugs recently I found out. Not even minor things like weed... I found out he even did coke and other scary things.

695," My (26F) mental health is ruining my relationship. Anxiety is something that I've always dealt with but managed fairly well with medication. I started dating this guy (24M) a few years ago and he was aware of my anxiety issues from the get-go and was always fairly supportive of me in that regard. We ended up getting pregnant and I stopped taking all my anxiety medications during pregnancy. This was a really hard time for me because not only was my anxiety not being managed, I was extremely hormonal and insecure. We fought a lot throughout the pregnancy but ended up working through most of our problems and staying together. I was sure that after the baby was born things would get better because I could get back on medication and so on. However, I developed very bad postpartum depression and have pretty much spiraled out of emotional control the past two months our son has been born. My PCP put me on some antidepressants and I know that they can take a while to get into your system and have an effect. In the mean time, I have been following the advice of some of my peers and have been very open about my feelings with him. Mostly of insecurity and isolation. Every time I bring it up I try to be as non-confrontational as possible and just open a safe line of communication. I am aware that my feelings are not always rational, but that is part of having a mental illness in my opinion. So when I do communicate these feelings to my partner, he basically degrades/dismisses me I feel like. He tells me that it's not his fault that I feel that way, there's not always something wrong, if i know that these feelings are irrational then why do I bring them up, he just wants to come home and relax, I'm overreacting/being dramatic, etc... I feel like I get no where and I feel like things will never get better because he is not understanding at all. Every time he says these things I just get more down on myself and wanna close myself off from the world. I'm at a loss and don't know what to do. I love this man and I know it's my responsibility to work on my own mental health but I don't know how I can do that well without support from my partner/baby's father.

708," 

I've been constantly battling the thoughts in my head and trying to figure out what I want to do. Here's the background.

Currently Undergraduate in Computer Science (Graduate in Spring 2022)

Have a part time job on top of doing undergraduate research (basically two jobs).

Have a NSF Grant due to continuing undergraduate research, covers my tuition.

Barely scraping by each month and I hate it ( I know there are other people in a worse situation than me, I get that.).

GOAL: Graduate with a PhD in Computer Science or Electrical Engineering.

Which I'm fine with but I've been always wanting to be part of special operations (military) and I just feel like I would be letting my supervisor who gave me the scholarship down if I were to go. One of my friends told me school is always going to be there, which I agree with to an extent, but being able to finish your PhD as early as possible would be it's own benefit. Here are the reasons I've been debating the military.

1. I've always been physically active.
2. I have never given up.
3. Being able to do something for someone else is in of itself it's own reward.
4. Honestly it seems kind of cool.

Having been in the army reserves (discharged under honorable), I know the big army is horrible and hated it. I was going to enlist or go through with the special operations after this semester.

711,"Recently, after picking my son (8 up from school he starts crying in the car and then tells me his teacher smacked him. He said he was sitting at his desk working on an assignment along with the rest of his class. When the teacher came by she smack him, open handed, on the forehead/top of head area and said “get to work!”  
I should add that my son has ADHD and while on medicine he still struggles with staying on task.  I have no reason to doubt my son nor is there any reason I can come up with as to why he would make this up. 
He has throughout the year complained that his teacher is really mean (seems to be the general consensus about her), screams all the time and has grabbed him by the arm and yanked him out of line. He has never made any complaints or accusations against any of his teachers before.  He gets straight A’s, good conduct reports and is always on the schools honor roll. 
I have called his principal, who has informed me that he’s unaware of any conduct of this sort from this teacher and takes my concerns seriously and will look into it and get back to me.   So in the mean time I guess I need to decide what I want to happen. If you were me would you insist on your child being removed from the classroom or am I overreacting?

714,I'm from Asia and currently at a desperate time trying to figure out how to help my boyfriend pay for his rent. It used to be free because it belonged to his grandmother but since she passed away a few months ago it was given to an aunt. There was an agreement that he and his brother can stay for free til the end of the year. But now his aunt is suddenly asking for rent because she also needs the money. He is already experiencing depression and anxiety and I want to find a way to help him. His life has been a roller coaster one since he was a child. Always full of hardships and financial problems. He was financially stable 3 years ago but due to his generous nature he gave money to his parents (never paid him back) and paid a lot for the repair of his grandmother's house. He basically didnt leave much for himself thinking he has time to earn it back. He says I'm the only one he has left and it broke my heart because I know that he's at a point where he just wants to end his life because losing his grandma (the person he loves the most) brought him into extreme depression and financially he isn't very stable.,07Jan2020,1
715,"My cousin blocked me on Instagram in November, because I had liked a photo on her friend's account, which was a photo of my cousin, and she also removed me on Snapchat the same month after I asked her if she hates me. I'm also really pissed at myself about this because I remember that in April, I told her I had added her on Snapchat, and she said something like ""oh I would gladly want to have you there"", and we even sent each other selfies, asked what we both were doing, had some other conversations, and I'm so pissed that I basically threw that all away because I'm so stupid. 

I regret it a lot, but I don't have the courage to apologise to her for asking her if she hates me and for liking her friend's photo. I told my aunt that she can tell my cousin I'm sorry, but I'm sure she didn't. Now I want to ask my aunt if I should apologise to my cousin, but I'm really afraid my cousin will hate me even more. I'm also not sure how to phrase it. I would just go ""hey [cousin], I know I shouldn't have looked on your friend's account for pictures of you, I'm really sorry and I realise now that it was a stupid thing to do, would you please unblock me on Instagram and add me back on Snapchat?"". I think that that might however just make her remove me on Facebook too. In two and a half weeks, my cousin and my aunt will sleep over at my house for  2-3 days, but I don't know if I can wait that long. The thing is, if I want to see my cousin IRL, I either have to wait until she comes to me or I have to ask my aunt if I can come visit her with a bus because they live hours away from me.

723,"Back story: 
When I was in sixth grade I had a crush on this guy, after a while, it was apparent that he also had a crush on me. Soon after he asked me out, middle school style by passing me a note. I was 12 at the time and did not want to have a boyfriend at that age, so I invaded his question by saying ""maybe, I can't, I need to think about it"" but never saying no in the fear of hurting his feelings. He asked me out each grade and I kept on invading him every time (he had girlfriends in between this as well). After middle school, we went to different high schools and thought that was the last I had seen of him. 
 
Now: 
Around I want to say July 2018, I posted on my insta story if anyone wanted to play iPhone games with me since I had just gotten an iPhone and we were following each other and he responded that he was down. We exchanged numbers and started playing every day after that. After about a week or two the games kind of died down and we started reminiscing about the old days and joking around. We soon facetimed and slowly kind of confessed that we still had feelings for each other. He was in the military at that time and would be coming home for a short while, so we would get time to talk in person and finally see each other. 
The thing was that I was already talking and messing around with people before this all happened (not sex). We got to spend a good amount of time together and we really enjoyed each other. After he left he went M.I.A (figuratively)  and I figured he wasn't interested anymore, so I started messing around with the same people again. After some time he facetimed me and told me was going through some stuff and wanted to talk to me about it. I really appreciated his honesty and that he talked to me about it but I was in over my head with the people I was talking to. But as soon as I saw it going somewhere I started to cut some people off. But I'm not the best at breaking it off with people, in fear that I'll hurt their feelings, so I've kinda been stalling and drugging it off. We haven't set anything in stone yet however we do talk about having a relationship. He doesn't mind me calling him a friend or boyfriend, but the thing is I'm still talking to some other people, I'm trying to keep my distance and hoping they just fall off somehow. I have told some people that I have a boyfriend and that's worked for some but it's a little harder on what to say to the people I've told that I'm not ready for a relationship who thought that we were intimately talking.

724,"Hope everyone is having a good day!

I've known that I've had this addiction for a long time, i'd say for maybe 4-5 years and it started due to emotional trauma to which, i did get over, however the fast food turned from being a coping mechanism to something that I actually prefer having over my own mums food.

My mum makes good food, there are some dishes I outright hate and actually have a reason to buy from outside but almost every single goddamn day at the end of the night, no matter if my sleeping schedule is screwed up or fixed, I keep buying fast food. I want to stop, it's starting to affect me more than it has. I have, according to my doctor, a severe fatty liver to which they thought it was alcohol etc but I haven't drank alcohol in years, yet I'm still sitting there eating fast food. My mum would make one of my favourite dishes, I would eat the dish, but the next day even when there is an ample amount of leftovers, I would rather much prefer to eat fast food.

I don't have a job and get my income from welfare and the main reason why I don't work or study is due to poor mental health and anxiety and I spend atleast 70% of my money on rent and bills for the house. The 30% goes to fuel for my car and fast food. I'd say within 2-3 days of getting paid my money is completely gone.

728,"I know this sounds like a total scam or network marketing, and let me clarify that it’s not. This company operates in multifamily real estate across FL and is based in Miami, where I work from. I [24M] am a licensed real estate agent and this is obviously a commission-based role.

PROS
- I’m talking to legitimate business owners, real estate investors, and well-known real estate attorneys/brokers who own these entities and properties on public record.

- I am discussing actual real estate buildings and portfolios with them—portfolios that we are directly connected to and whom we know the legitimate owner. We can legitimately sell these if we bring a client to the table.

- The founder [33M] is very knowledgeable and savvy on the real estate market since he has been doing this for a decade. However, he has nothing to show for it. No fancy cars, no fancy bachelor pad, no office. He works from his apartment on his laptop and I work from home with my laptop as well.

CONS
- I haven’t seen any results whatsoever, we’ve been very close to making deals happen and most deals that we almost close involve a six-figure commission check or a mid-to-high five-figure commission check, which would be split evenly between the both of us. Please do not think I am trying to boast, that is the farthest thing from what I am trying to do here. I am honestly sick of being falsely excited and getting my hopes up, it has gotten to the point where the “sticker shock” of these properties and commission checks do not even phase me.

- It feels like most of our calls are about how “set” we are and how great this will all be when we close our first deal, but that first deal never seems to arrive. I’m not going to lie, we’ve gotten very close to getting some done and practically have one done as we speak (closing is in 90 days so I am not counting my chickens before they hatch).

- If I leave, I will be just another real estate agent on the streets again without the potential to make these types of sales on my own and losing my close relationship with the founder (aka my mentor).

TLDR: It feels like I am between a rock and a hard place. I do not want to keep wasting more time by staying without making a dollar but I do not want to leave the opportunity to make a sale that could literally alter the course of my entire career.",07Jan2020,1

742,"Two years ago I (22M) fell in love with my first ever girlfriend (22F) at the age of 20. I was absolutely enthralled with this girl, and she made me SO happy. Some of my favorite memories I have are with her.

Unfortunately, our relationship really suffered in its last year, and I broke up with her about 5 months ago. As I reflect on things, I know our relationship was unhealthy, and I feel used in a lot of ways. However, I want to know if breaking up with her was a good course of action to take. I’ll explain what dating her was like below: 

She became incredibly needy, and insecure. She was very demanding, and in a lot of ways manipulative. Constantly needed to text me. And Snapchat me. And Facebook message me. And she was very moody. Some days she’d be so happy, and other days talking to her just brought me down. She even began to push her own friends away through this behavior. I loved her very much, but it was super hard to cope with.

She really wanted us to move abroad together after undergrad, and pursue being missionaries together. I was very unsure about this, as she went through a huge crisis in her personal faith for about 8 months during our second year. I wasn’t sure if I could trust her emotionally, especially if we were somewhere in Asia right after college at the ripe age of 22. I also heard from friends of hers that she called me coward for being unsure if I wanted to be a missionary. She said this behind my back.

There were times she would have emotional shut downs in front of all of her friends and me. She’d just get very quiet, and would not talk to anyone at all in a social situation. Usually this was unlike her. 

Having hard conversations felt near impossible. She’d stay quiet for like 5-10 minutes, sometimes just staring at me. I’d ask over and over what the problem was, and it’d be so exhausting to get a response. 

When I told her I was unsure if I wanted to be a missionary, she proceeded to ask over and over again if I had made up my mind those next few following weeks. She even did this while I was on a vacation with my family. 

We went on a month long break this past summer, and she would text me multiple times, saying how hard the break is, and one time she went off and told me I only “sometimes” loved her. 

She was so depressed, and she believed everyone didn’t like her or wanted to talk to her. She believed this about me and all of her friends, when we would constantly tell her otherwise. This got so bad that self harm entered the picture. 

I tired hard to help her. After months of trying, I finally got her to agree to go to counseling. I talked to her everyday, always trying to help. However, she would insist I was never doing enough to help her. It became so draining and hard. 

She would walk all over me emotionally. For instance, there was one time she wanted to come visit me (we did long distance in our last year) and I explained to her that I wasn’t sure if the week we planned to see each other would work out, as I was very busy with school. I did promise to come see her later that weekend however. She responded by telling me I needed to pick what was important in my life, and she couldn’t be “patient” much longer. Another time she flew back to the states after being abroad a few weeks. I wasn’t able to come see her at the airport, but I was going to see her the very next day. When I told her this, she guilted me and texted me, “well now I’m crying on the plane” 

Lastly, when I finally broke up with her, she called me a coward, and said that I disgusted her.

747,"To try to make a long story short, here it goes. My wife and I have been married for two years,and I am very very happy. The problem is that I am VERY adventures in the bedroom. Things between me and my wife started out amazing while dating.  Sexting, flirting, fooling around everyday ect. 

The problem that I need advice is this, my wife has become very vanilla in bed not wanting to try anything or do anything. Due to that fact we fight and argue alot more and have not had sex in about a month it has become an awkward subject.

My wife told me flat out that maybe I could find someone who I could try different things with (kinks and what not) . I told her flat out no because that's cheating and I wouldn't do that to her. So fast forward a little. 

My wife's best friend who is smoking hot told me that she thinks I'm really hot and wants me in everyway. We started texting and what ever she sent me nudes and said she wants me and will show me all the things I want to try. Talking to her has boosted my self esteem I feel so good when I talk to her. 

I have never cheated and never thought about it. I love my wife with all my heart and soul. But as a human being I need love and affection and I want to not have to hide who I am and what I want in bed... 

I know all of you will probably say don't cheat.. and I'm with you but I don't know what to do .. some helpful advice would be so greatly appreciated

I know I am very dumb like not study wise ( I score good marks ) but my general knowledge is like really low and I am not street smart or anything.

I’m up every night trying to block out the yelling and it’s taking a toll on my mental health a lot. Problem is, I’m afraid to tell any friends for help. I desperately need support and I’m afraid to be a burden to them. I’ve spoken to one friend before and she did help calm me down and let my vent to her but I don’t like putting her in a position where she has to deal with my problems when she’s got her own shit to deal with. 

I see it as this, if I can’t help people who confide in me then why should I expect anyone to help me? My friends come to me with issues sometimes and I try to help them I really do but most of the time I don’t know how to help them. I try to cheer them up but I never help them response an issue or if I give advice on what to do they won’t use it which ultimately means the advice wasn’t so great.

751,"Hello,
My name is Grace Reyes (23F), from New York and once an Ivy League student. My life is currently a mess. 

I went to the University of Pennsylvania where I struggled with an eating disorder and stealing addiction. As a result people became interested in my mind and there is a company of people dedicated to reading and controlling my every waking thought and body. 

However, these people are incredibly evil. 
Their goal is to make me look like a paranoid schizophrenic in order to get me to hid the fact that an invasion of privacy exists in America This technology somehow bypasses MRI scans and CT scans but it does exist and I am determined to figure out how to detect it. Anytime I go to doctors they prescribe anti-psychotics that never work (probably because this technology is real).
I can feel placement of the technology working in my right ear.

After 5 years of this, I am certain that I am not delusional. Remember that I was an Ivy League student and not an imbecile. I’m genuinely scared for my life because these people send me death threats daily for trying to find justice. I don’t know where else to go. 

As a result of my “paranoid schizophrenia” I have been in psych wards where no amount of medications work and lied about still hearing these voices in order to be released. 

I need the people doing this to me to pay me for my thought. I’m fairly certain that this comes from the Government and I am having trouble convincing them that I am worthy of life since I am a small criminal.  However, I have an all star personality and I’m pretty good looking. 

These people get paid to watch me but do not support my lifestyle (I’m bulimic and have a small drug habit). Therefore they hesitate to intervene because they believe they will end up killing me instead of watch me destroy myself for the rest of my life. 

Again, please take this seriously. My life is in danger. Please help me clarify this story so that I can explain it and come up with proof that this is real.

752,"I live in the EU and I am currently studying medicine. What I'm doing this year is similar to the American med school - going to rotations and basically follow a doctor during mornings and learn whatever is possible. 


I have started my cardiology rotation around mid December. Let's say that the first days was intimidating. Our doctor seemed to be a nitpicking person that only wanted to show us how clever she is. But that was only a first impression. I think she did what she did because she wanted to impose her authority. 


She has a type of humour that I enjoy. It's very similar to mine - mainly dark humour and absurd jokes. She is pretty damn great at what she does. She taught us many interesting things, but she is also not afraid to admit when she doesn't know a thing. She cares about us a little bit - she helped us avoiding making certain mistakes in front of the head of department and she defended us in front of another doctor. She seems to be a calm and  composed person. She likes animals a lot and owns a black cat. 


Even if I can rationalize all these things, I can't exactly tell why I want to be friends with her. It's probably the second or third time in my life when I have such strong feelings for a person. Before you ask, it's nothing romantic or sexual. But i know i'd really love to hang out with her once in a while. I don't want my entire life to be wrapped around her, but I'd like to be closer to her.


If I ever bring up the idea of meeting her somewhere else besides the hospital where I'm making my rotation, I'd do it after I'll sit my cardiology exam. Otherwise, it might look like I'm trying to make her have a better impression of me and improve my grade. Is it a good idea to to hang out with her? If she was my classmate and not my supervisor, I would've invited her to a pub or eatery a long time ago. Should I just let it go? Part of my worries comes from the fact that I feel inferior to her.",07Jan2020,1
753,"So I’m posting this on a throwaway account because some of my friends may know my reddit name. 
Some background. I’ve been with my wife for 10 years, married for 8. I’m a 34 year old male and she’s 36. We have a 6 year old daughter together. 
So now for the problem: prior to knowing me, my wife was very promiscuous. She lost her virginity pretty young (14) and I’ve unfortunately heard stories of her exploits. One day, out of the blue, she told me that I was the 11th person she’s had intercourse with. However, I suspect the number is much higher. In the ten years I’ve known her, I’ve personally met 8 of the people she’s slept with. I think it’s pretty unlikely that there’s only 3 more. 
For the record, I know that this shouldn’t bother me. I have no reason to suspect infidelity, so what she did before me isn’t really my business. It does bother me though. A lot. I used to really like the song “I Get Off On You” by Halestorm, then I remembered how she accidentally let slip that she used to like to have sex with her boyfriend while other people watched. I once overheard her tell her roommate “you don’t have to like someone to fuck them”. I’ve at least had feelings for each of the 4 girls I’ve slept with. Not everyone is that way, and they don’t have to be. It’s not that I’m right and she’s wrong. Nonetheless, it hurts me. She has always had a much higher sex drive than me, and I’ve always strived to satiate her appetite. However, my hangups with this issue affect my sexual performance. It also hinders my ability to love her completely. 
It’s entirely my problem; that’s why I’m seeking help here. Please, if you’ve got any input, let me know.",07Jan2020,1
754,"I have BPD and my SO drove me to feel suicidal on purpose (he knows ghosting me causes this but has done it anyways) so he came to drive me to a hospital because I was experiencing chest pains. After that we spent days working on boundaries and him confessing his lies. I told him i had been feeling sexually taken advantage when he would emotionally abuse me (manipulate and gaslight me) in order to have sex with me. That when i asked about another girl and he lied about her, even though i made it clear he did not have my consent if he was being dishonest, and he fucked me anyways i felt violated. In my eyes, i asked him a question and said if he was lying i didnt consent to sex and to respect that. He lied and gaslighted me and manipulated my feelings so we would have sex and he came fast. Apologized for lasting less than a minute and said he knew i wasn’t into it and didn’t want to have sex. 

On my perspective of things, i was so scared to have sex, i didnt want to, i was terrified he wouldnt consider my consent or feelings... He said he was taking things slowly bc he wanted to have my real true consent this time before engaging in sexual intercourse since last time I felt sexually taken advantage of. I asked him before he put his dick in me, are you lying about the instagram issue we discussed today (him jacking off to his friends and flirting etc)? And i said if he wasn’r honest, to not have sex with me bc i wasnt consenting to it. I said i would consider it raping me if he forced sex on me if he was lying at that very moment. I was already forcing myself to have sex bc i wanted to spend more time with him and i knew that was the only way. 

He willingly and actively, knowing i’d feel raped, chose to disregard i didn’t consent and fucked me for like 20 seconds and bust a load. He admitted he used me for sex and did it knowing i would feel violated bc i said i didnt consent. I know its not 100% rape. But i do feel like me saying no i dont want to have sex if you are lying about this specific matter, and him ignoring my plea and doing it anyways is a form of abuse. Idk what to do. I love him and idk if this is me overreacting or if i have a right to feel this way. I cried to him begging to not do it again and he did knowing what it is.... what should i do? Is this rape or am I a drama queen?",07Jan2020,1
755,"Im not using spellcheck for any of this.

Currently in my last year of high school and so far I've been one of the few non drinkers in my friend group. I go to parties every now and then, but I dont drink at all. And big suprise I'm now considering breaking that streak, but I'm very unsure about it. 

I'll try to make this structured so you guys understand my issue 

My reasons for not drinking are kinda weird, atleast I get told they sound weird. First of all is the clear issue that I use a medication that I'm not sure should be mixed with alcohol (Not a weird reason, but I'll talk with my doctor before I/if I ever drink). 

Secondly, I might be scared that I'll do a bunch of stupid stuff while drunk.

And lastly, and this is the main reason, I consider alcohol ""cheating""... I've struggled with a lot of social things for basiclly all of my life and over the years I've slowly improved. I've become somewhat more confident, I have more friends than ever before and 90% of my days are great. But I'm still not where I want to be. 

And then when I see my friends and strangers get drunk and quickly become way more confident and seemingly have more fun than normal, I feel like they are cheating. I kinda feel like they are taking the easy way out, even if that mindset is quite stupid. 

I understand that I could also ""cheat"" like they do but I feel like that would make my past hard work kinda useless, or atleast it might prevent me from working as hard on myself in the future. 

That might have been messy so here is a quick summary list thing

Reasons for not drinking: On Medication, Scared of being dumb, and I dont want to invalidate my own self improvement.

Reasons I'm considering drinking: Relate more to my friends, Be more social at parties, hookups (I ofc avoid having anything to do with a drunk person when Im sober, yet Im a horny teenager so I want to be an idiot)

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah I guess what I'm asking advice on is; Should I start to drink and ""experience youth"" or just remain as I am but feeling like I'm missing out on something?

My dad is very controlling person. He controls everything I do and I can’t do that anymore. He chooses my career, what I do, if I can go out, if I keep a beard, if I can keep my long hair, and won’t let me get a job. I realized at college how much I really have no control in my life.

She’s everything I’ve ever looked for in a partner, but after going on a date and discussing it a few times over the course of the past year, it’s been pretty firmly established that she’s not interested.

I understand and accept all of that logically, but I find that I can’t stop feeling this way. My heart is in my throat whenever I talk to her, I regularly travel an hour’s drive just to spend a few hours with her, and I, quite frankly, have found I have no real attraction to anyone but her.

Let me make it clear: This is no one’s fault. She is, regardless feelings, a wonderful woman and that logical side of my brain wants the best for her with or without me. 

I have tried distancing myself but I always end up coming back. I have, as I said, talked to her about it before.

765,"Hey everyone, I apologize if this is long and rambling, but I'd appreciate any help.

I'm a 25 year old single guy, never had a ""real job"", currently living at home while attending local community college to transfer to local university for Business Administration degree.

I say ""real job"", because I technically am a co-owner of a family business(we own a small neighborhood bar) that I inherited when my father passed away 4 years ago. I'm in charge of most of the accounting, booking the DJ's for weekends, organizing special events. We have 3 employees, I've tried bar tending myself, I can make the drinks, but not as fast as our 3 long term employees, in addition to the clientele preferring to be served by them(bartenders all women).

After first graduating high school, I attended one of the better community colleges with great transfer rates, all was well for a couple semesters until I broke up with my girlfriend at the time(2013), causing me to fall into a dark place for some a year or so, my grades plummeting. Eventually got back on track with my schooling, as well as going on some dates, but pretty much haven't dated anyone since around 2015. 

Finally was back in stride excelling in my classes, when suddenly my dad passed away from a sudden heart attack in early 2016. I tried to continue my classes that semester, but I ended up failing all of them. In a sense, I lost a lot of my ambition after that day, since my father was often trying to encourage me to develop a fire in my heart to strive for something bigger, with him gone, I felt no desire, except to stick around for my grieving mother. I am only child, needless to say after he passed, it was up to my mom and I to take over his bar, learning how to manage it on the fly.

After a couple of years of poor performance at that community college, I decided to transfer to a closer community college. It was less prestigious than the first one, but it's within walking distance, saving money on gas. The unfortunate part is when I changed campuses, since they were a different system as the previous campus, many of my completed classes no longer counted towards my transfer, so currently I'm stuck with another 1.5 years worth of classes before getting to transfer to university. I'm really tired of school because I fail so much, but I know that's the only way I can have a high earning stable career.

My mom has recovered quite well from the loss of my dad, she retired the same year he passed, the house we live in is already paid off, except for property taxes obviously, she keeps herself busy with a bunch of different hobbies she has now. She is in her early 60's now, I feel like a burden that I continue to live here without much to show for it. Unlike my early 20's where I had more optimism, I no longer envision myself having a good career, rather working myself to death in some factory(nothing against factory workers, just from my personal situation where I wasted my opportunities) or just straight dying homeless on the street. The only good factor on my side is that I have a youthful face, especially when clean shaven(get mistaken for being 20), so I still get the benefit of doubt to some extent.

Ironically, even with all this failure and lack of striving anywhere, my family and friends will try to set me up with some women lol. I tend to stray away from dating and reject these set-up offers, as I know if I were a dad, I wouldn't want my daughter dating some unsuccessful slacker like me.

I've wanted to get a job just to show I'm contributing to the household and society, however my own social anxiety does stifle me a bit, I end up imagining myself screwing up on the job, being the worst of the work crew, and several other bad scenarios. I know these are excuses, merely trying to describe my inner thought process.

770,"There was a guy I thought was the one my freshman year of college. We both were emotionally damaged and found comfort in each other and I fooled myself into thinking we were perfect for each other. Well one day he stopped making time for me and out text messages went from being the highlight of my day to small talk stretched over a few hours.

I didn’t accept it at first because I know he knew I loved him and just wanted to help him become a better man, which of course I know now was childish of me. I learned you can’t change someone who doesn’t wanna change, you can’t force someone to love you, and all along I was just the freshman he got to have fun with for his last semester of college. When I realized I was never important to him, I got really depressed went on a rampage (meaning a lot of weed and having sex which people I didn’t care about) and in all that chaos I found the love of my life (yay, kinda happy ending)

The problem is, every time I see HIM whether it’s in person or in a social media post (we have mutual friends) I get immediately depressed. The first time I saw him in person after our final argument, i locked myself in my room for days, skipped classes, smoked, didn’t shower.  I didn’t realize that he could have such a negative impact on my entire mental state. My love noticed of course but I could never tell him that my ex has this much power over me despite me knowing I want nothing to do with him.

Well that was months ago. Recently he showed up on my TL again. I’ve been upset ever since and only today have I realized that that’s what’s caused the decline in my mood. I don’t want my mood about past bullshit to affect my love.

771,"tldr; coworker quitting, I don’t have time to take her project on along w/ the other stuff I do, should I tell boss no now or quit or what 

I wasn’t sure whether to post this here or on the graphic design subreddit but whatever. Point blank I just need some advice.

Like the title says, my coworker just texted me this morning she’ll probably be quitting due to some other obligations. Her project is a booklet of sorts - I used to do it before she was hired and it was a LOT of work, I did tons of overtime and was generally burnt out because I’m terrible at time management, something she’s much better at than me. 

My problem is that honestly I wasn’t planning on being at this job this long, I was going to quit around last August but stayed in order to train some new hires and because life fucked me over and I needed money. I stayed but I mostly work remotely on some smaller side projects that I’m assigned weekly.  I know that when she leaves, my boss will most likely give me back this project but I don’t want it. Also, I was going to be starting another part time job on the side as a way to ease out of this one. 

So sorry for this long ass background info, but should I let him know I can’t before he tries to give it to me? Or wait until he gives me the project to let him know I can’t? I’m not very good at setting boundaries or being confrontational but I’m not really in the position to just quit outright...",07Jan2020,1

Yesterday his meds weren't delivered on time so he was slamming doors and shit around the house as well as being mean to the dogs. No biggie I thought, as long as he doesn't hurt them. He then wanted me to take him to sell some video games so he could buy alcohol, and I just ignored the request and told everyone else to not get him shit and he unhooked the wifi so only he would have internet and I wouldn't. Eventually I asked him why it wasn't working and he said probably for the same reason my texts don't work, then he plugged the right ethernet cable into the modem and was acting better so I thought this was the end of it.

Then I wake up today and the dog is just outside by himself, idk for how long, and the ethernet cable is missing so I ask him about it, he says he doesn't know so I go and look in his dresser and it's in the top drawer.

784,"My girlfriend and I started having sex from the beggining of the relationship (which started in November).

We're having sex quite often (2-4 times a week) and from time to time, we have unprotected sex without finishing inside.

The thing is, today she told me she noticed a different smell and that her vaginal fluid is more consistent since we started having more sex.

I read certain things and apparently it has to do with infections and I plan to test myself to see if it's the case, but she said she never has itches, red areas, pains or problems when urinating.

The other thing I read is that during pregnacy the way women smell changes, becoming more sensitive to certain odours and noticing small changes in the smell of the vagina and the vaginal fluid becomes more consistent.

The thing is, since we've been together she had all of her periods on time, lasting as long as they usually last and presenting the same pain and the same amount of bleeding as usual.

Her last period started on 29th of December and ended on 3rd of January and it was normal, nothing seemed off.

I wonder if there is a chance she is pregnant while I cannot finish the job and ejaculate and rarely, when I manage, I pull put long before the sensation and just rub it for about 5 minutes with my hand outside of her vagina and finish away from the area.

One thing to notice: once she took an emergency pill (somewhere mid-way November) and yet again I read that hormonal changes might affect vaginal fluids and the scent, so the pill might be the reason of the hormonal changes, I guess?

I am sorry this story is oddly specific and I present myself on Reddit with things I read on different articles on the Internet.

785,"Essentially my (22f) (GC) family had a huge blow up about me dating and the way they found out. It got really bad.. Long story short (leaving out a lot of detail cuz it's not real important for this post but they may not be narcs, but they def have traits and got emotionally/ mentally abusive), I am moving out this weekend. 

My mom wanted to have a talk with me before I move out. Before I go into detail, the negative talk from my parents about how I'll regret my decisions makes me feel anxious and like i'll fail if I don't do things their way. I understood you have to make some sacrifices to succeed, but it's always been at the expense of my happiness and social development. I'm, only now starting to connect why i've been a perfectionist and would work myself into burnout, and cut everything out of my life that got in the way of school during undergrad. Sacrifice is necessary, but I had no balance.

The conversation was about me making sure my I stay focused in school (really intense grad program), talking about making a schedule and sticking to it (I already do that and quite meticulously, sometimes to the hour), thinking I'll have more time than I do since i'll be near the school, talking about not going out to a bunch of events, and that my social life needs to take a back burner.

She was using coded language about liking someone and whether it'll matter or I'll regret it 5 years from now, but was 100% talking about the guy i'm seeing who's now my BF and attends the same school. For reference, every time I tried to date someone in the past (this is my first real relationship), it always turned into this huge thing with pressure from my dad to stop.

She kept saying she can tell when i'm distracted and my head's somewhere else (even though i'm on break), that it isn't about being on break and I know what she's talking about (again totally talking about my BF, an she wonders why i never want to bring a guy home to meet them), that I get wrapped up in whatever's going on at the time (code for dating and guys). 

Mom said moving is not just about school, and to remember why i'm there and that i'll regret taking loans to move out (yes I will be in debt. Law school is expensive and I was commuting an hour + where I only had peace so long as I did what I was expected). (I would come home average 10 pm or later, quickly shower, pick out clothes for the next day, pack food shower, sleep repeat. The commute was awful with train delays and traffic was horrible driving to the point there were some days I was in near tears because I couldn't get to school early enough to prep for classes.) 

I've tried to explain that i've always felt immense pressure to be perfect to the point of being unhappy, sometimes depressed because it was so hard to make friends commuting in undergrad (something I did not want to do), and pushing myself to burnout to academically excel.

She told me to be analytical about it. I've lived at home all but one year (freshman undergrad). I tried to negotiate certain boundaries with them, but  I just got to a point with this last incident (see post history for details) where I just couldn't take it anymore.

I think I'm making the right choice for myself, but my parents tell me i'm making a mistake (taking extra loans to move out and dating while in school) and that i'll regret it. I have so much riding on my school career and them acting like I don't understand what's at stake just makes it work.

At first this made me feel awful and lonely, but I'm used to it now. I've never spoken up about this because I hate confrontation and they have a tendency to make excuses for each other, so it would be 2 against 1. But last week I made a comment to person #1 about how I didn't expect him to follow through, and asked him several times if he was sure he would do what he said he was going to do. The next day person #2 told me that person #1 was very mad at me because of this, and that it was rude of me to insinuate that they would not follow through. Person #2 would not listen to me and cut me off repeatedly when I tried to explain my perspective. 

I don't feel like I'm in the wrong here, and I don't feel as though I owe person #1 an apology especially if they won't tell me that I hurt them instead of communicating through another person.

When is it okay to forgive someone to talking to their ex?

I’m a 26F and he is a 23M (just turned 23) &amp; we have been dating for about six months.
Basically during the summer he ended a long term relationship in which he lived with his ex. Yes, I know we started talking in the transition of him moving back home and because of it we didn’t hang out until he moved out from living with her ( the relationship ended prior to this ). I met him at work.

Basically everything was going great ! He is definitely one of the most sweetest and caring person I’ve ever dated . I even met his family a month ago and he met mine for my college graduation, and we started to make it official with our close friends .

Well a week ago, he called me a 3AM to pick him up from a bar since he had gone out with some friends and couldn’t drive home . When I got there he was in his car dead asleep, and to my surprise he was on the phone with her . They weren’t talking , so I’m guessing he called her in her sleep.
Point is he saved her number under a friend’s name , basically to hide the fact that there had been constant communication (I’m sure , I’m assuming ). 
I drove him home and told him we were done .
He has been trying to make it better , but I just feel so upset about it. He does seem genuine about his apology and I know we have all been guilty about talking to our exes.

He said this just happened during the holidays due to them having friends/ gifting etc. (I call BS)

Idk , I just need a non bias point of view ....
Like should I even continue to try to work this out ? Or just let it go.

I’m fourteen btw. For some context I have always grown up in a religious household with my mom, dad, and younger autistic brother. 

The reason I’m making this post is that my mom discovered I sent “lmfao” in response to an online friend on discord. She confronted me about this in the car this morning. We had a long argument about the gravity of using abbreviations for curse words and she repeatedly said that my argument was invalid and the more times I argued against her the more “wrongdoings” of mine she would tell to my violent father. I of course stopped because my father always permanently grounds me if he ever thinks I’m doing things that go against god. Then she asked me if I had any fear of god and I declined to answer. I feel like anything I say to her will be used against me so I don’t say anything about myself. She said that my lack of an answer was an answer, and started yelling at me for my disrespect for the lord. She then accused me of being a smug brat and said that this attitude is why my teachers don’t like me.

I’m really worried about this because she said she would leave it to my dad to confront me about my misbehavior. Last time he suspected I didn’t believe in god he permanently took my phone, computer, and all other forms of communication until I lied my way out of it. My mom didn’t fall for the lie but my dad did. 

I’m also gay and I have been threatened with conversion therapy multiple times. This may be the final straw.

I’m also worried for my mother and I have every right to believe that she isn’t right mentally. We were recently on a flight and the pilot announced that we would experience some turbulence. Looking like she was about to cry she turned to me and said “In situations like these you have to think about where you’re going when you die. Please pray to god and hope that he will show you mercy in case you die.” I thought it was funny, but also a little scary.

She has had multiple “episodes” where she screams and thrashes about and tries to break my and my brother’s things. Some causes include finding out I was gay and sticking her finger with a stickpin while cleaning.

I’m especially worried for our church group trip to Israel. I’m likely going to have no internet for a week out in a goddamn war zone being saturated in religion shit. Usually the more “religious” the time is like during Easter and Christmas and whatever the more likely my parents are to snap and decide to cut me off from worldly influence. I’m worried.

797,"This is my first time posting here, but this sub seems like the best place for help. I'll try to keep it as short as possible but it is basically a life story.

I am 21 living with my mom (56) a sister who is supposed to move out the 9th aged 20 and one of my high school best friends also 21. My dad was kicked out when I was young for his crack addiction, though while he was living in the house he would constantly tear it apart to start new projects only to never finish. While he was a very talented man who helped build some of the nicest buildings in city crack is no joke. So the house is falling apart, boil water for heat, no drywall, black mold all over the walls of the basement where I live. Obviously a place I want to leave.

My mom was hit by a drunk driver at 17, thus re learned how to walk and has had a total and partial knee replacement. She had ovarian cancer in 08 ( I administered the shots) but somehow managed to beat it. Smoker all her life quit about 2 years ago but I fear way too late. She has breathing fits where a once active woman would walk miles a day no problem now has to sit down after carrying laundry up the steps. A bunch of other crap but basically doctors give her a year. So obviously she hasn't been able to work but for 3 years Indiana has denied her disability. So I've had to support a rotting house and my mother who I could never turn my back on. This has now ruined my credit which I once took great pride in, to the point where I am going to have to beg for 0 interest or file for bankruptcy. The roommate pays the bare minimum rent and then refuses to buy any food or cleaning supplies. My sister pays the minimum rent and then steals food and items from my mother to furnish her boyfriends parents house. His parents are both active crackheads so she feels bad or something. Literally right now I am sitting at the doctors with my mom since her car broke down. My sister was supposed to take her but if course bailed just like she did yesterday forcing me to take work off the drive her to her appointments. I guess basically no one is compent enough to take care of her.

I have been dating a wonderful woman for 4 years and 4 months now. Interestingly she lives in California so the entire relationship has been long distance besides the 6 trips so far we've seen to see each other and family. I am desperate to move out there and start my life but fear as soon as I leave everyone my mom depends on will bail and she'll just commit suicide. Its in my mind that I have to leave by March or April but she's been crying so much this week idk when to tell her. I suppose I really just needed to vent and collect my thoughts so thanks if you read this far.

798,"I grew up in a household/family that express “love” very different. The words “I love you” was never said in my family. Never. I rarely spent time with my parents. They worked 7 days a week, no holidays. When I woke up for school, they were still asleep; when they get off work, I should already be asleep. This was the norm to me. I know that a lot of Asian households had trouble expressing this type of emotion. As I grew older, I realized that maybe they didn’t understand it, just like me. Just like me, their parents didn’t show them what “love” is so they have issues showing me. Maybe there wasn’t ever any love, just tolerance. 

I didn’t think it affected me much, until now. April 2018, I gave birth to a little boy. When I was pregnant, I didn’t feel attached to my baby. After he was born, nothing changed. It was never “my baby”. It was always “the baby”. Now that he’s 20 months (a little over one and a half), I’ve started to feel small moments of “my baby”. 

I dated my current s/o for 4 years. I care deeply for him, but recently I questioned wether or not I really loved him. As I was questioning myself, I realized that I didn’t know what I was looking for; I didn’t know what love looked like. 

At one point, my s/o said he “love[d] me deeply”, and I asked him what that entailed. He said, “When you hurt me it affects me not just emotionally but physically. It’s heart wrenching. When you make me happy it’s not just the present that I feel. I reminisce of the past and think of the future. You have pushed me to be better and although my patience has been tested I know we’re not perfect. I love not the idea of what I think we should be, but you. I feel loving another is wanting to do and be better not just for them, but because of them. I think if we didn’t meet I’d be pretty stagnant. Other relationships I’ve had were similar in length but not nearly as rich in experiences. I didn’t strive to do and be better. So although I did care for them I can tell that I truly love you. It surprises me how much I’ve done and will continue to do.”

I felt something similar, but not that intense. I think my main issue is that I didn’t know what love felt like or looked like, but also that I was a selfish person. Doing something for somebody with no return just doesn’t seem right to me. I would feel cheated out of something. I am aware of this bad habit of mine and am trying to chance but it is INCREDIBLY hard. 

I didn’t feel love or see love within my family. My grandparents didn’t teach my parents how to love either. And they didn’t teach me. I want to break that cycle. But in order to do so, I need to know what is.  

Please tell me what does love look like to you.",07Jan2020,1
799,"Hi Reddit,

I (24F) currently share my family home with my father (56M). I'm an only child, and it's been just us two for just over a year now, following the sudden passing of my mother (63F) after a year battling illness. 

At 21, I finished university and returned home. I had thoughts of moving out when my prospects and financial situation improved - comforted by the fact that my parents would have each other - but these thoughts were swiftly cast away when my mother became ill.

My 25^(th) birthday is now in sight, and feel I'm at the right age to move out and rent a place of my own. I'd be better off financially if I stayed at home to save up for something more permanent, but I want to experience real independence - regardless of how well it goes. I've been lucky enough to never go without, but I want to see what I can manage - what I can make for *myself*, without relying on anyone else.

As sad as I feel that my mother won't be there to help me move - something I felt would soften the struggle of leaving - it feels like something I need to do. I've recently started a new job, but  feel my life could benefit from further change. For me *personally*, now seems as good a time as any to start a new chapter.

I feel my relationship with my father might even improve if we lived apart - while we love each other, we frequently clash - more so now as we try to navigate our new and unexpected way of living, and managing our hurt.

Regardless, I feel very conflicted about leaving him alone - even though I don't intend to move too far away - as the comfort of him having company with my mother is gone. Our house is too big for just one person, but due to sentiment and local property construction that could affect a sale, my father is very reluctant to move and downsize. He's always been a 'stiff upper lip' businessman, but the past year has made me see exactly how vulnerable he can be. 

So, I guess I'm just trying to weigh up if I'm planning to do the right thing before I broach the subject with him. If he's going to disagree with the idea, it'll be out of concern for my financial situation etc, and not openly for the sake of his own loneliness - although, as a generous person, he's previously told me I don't '*need'* to move out.

Am I right to feel guilty - is moving out at this point in time fair?

802,"I am a teacher at a public high school. All of my students are overall very respectful to me, and I cannot imagine any of them doing such a thing. I also asked my family members and friends from church if they did this or know of anyone who would do this, and they all said they didn't.

Anyways, I got emails saying that the sender wants to kill me, destroy me, and all other unthinkable things. I traced the email, and it ended up a local library. I called the library to ask them why they would write me these messages, but they said that they did not write the messages, and it must have been someone who was messing around at the computer area.

It's been going smoothly; however, recently he's been wanting to join the same online group chats. I've been in most of these groups longer than I've been with him. Sometimes I just want to talk about things outside of us. That and I just want to talk to my friends without worrying about what he thinks. I asked him not to join one specific group for this very reason. He joined it today, I reminded him and now he thinks I talk shit behind his back. Kinda of lost on what to do.

804,"My school offers parking to seniors, at. $100 parking fee. We all have assigned spots so the same time arson is next o me every day. I’ve had my car for a year and had NO damage done to it in all that time until a few months ago. I got out of school and driving home I looked in my drivers side rear-view mirror. To, you know, drive safely. The mirror was completely smashed, and it had not been like that driving to school. I’m still a teen and relatively a new driver so I am always careful to use my mirrors, etc. when driving. I believed that the person next to me hit Ku car be accident, since she parks right on the line of the parking spot close to my car. 

So, I went to administration. They said they’d review the tapes and get back to me. I was called into the office and shown the tapes, where I realized that my car was basically in a blind spot for the cameras, so if it did happen in the lot, they caught nothing. They said there was nothing they could do and I had to pay to replace my window out of pocket. 

A few months went by with no incident, until last week, when I left school and I saw my door handle had a deep scratch. For anyone who knows anything about car scratches, it wasn’t a clear coat scratch that could be buffed out, the scratch went deep into the paint and scraped the paint off. This means, I have to go into the shop again to have the damage fixed. 

So, I once again went to administration. Got the same “we’ll review the tapes and have the school officers take a look.” I wasn’t shown the tapes this time but I was told they didn’t see anything (probably because they literally couldn’t), and I was told that the scratch seems like it was caused by a blue car door opening up into mine. The person next to me has a white car. To them, end of story, nothing they could do.

Now here’s why I am annoyed and don’t know what to do next. 
- I had not been anywhere except for in the school parking lot for the past 4 days. It’s also the drivers side handle, so you’d think I’d notice before the end of that week there had been a scratch. 
- This is the same door that was damaged before in just a few months time.
- The person next to me usually pulls in about a foot or less away from me, and since it’s school they most likely had a backpack on that could’ve been hitting into my car.
- Their case about the car that hit my having to have been blue doesn’t make sense to me. Maybe I just don’t understand how that works, but the car next to me is white, and my car is literally blue. Is it not possible that the blue residue on the scratch is from the paint that was scraped up on my car?
- Administration screws everyone over on damages. Every person I know who had damage done to their car in the senior lot has had nothing done about it. 
- The security cameras literally don’t even see my car, how is that fair? 
- There’s nothing in the handbook or in the permit application that mentions the school won’t take responsibility for the damage done to students cars, or that they can’t ask students to be careful if it’s suspected they are damaging someone else’s car. (They told me they couldn’t even ask the student next to me to be careful without solid proof that they did it)
I am getting a dash cam as soon as possible, but administration has always been very helpful for me, until now. Also, there was nothing in the handbook saying that even though you pay for this parking premium, they won’t do anything if your car is damaged. I have not had any changes in my driving habits, no new places or sketchy parking spots. Since getting my car, I never had a new scratch, bump, or anything like that. Since parking in the senior lot, I’ve had two damages that I need to pay out of pocket to fix. The only other parking option is in a more unregulated and dangerous lot than the one I’m currently in. I don’t want to confront the owner myself since I don’t know her very well, and this is high school and I don’t want to accidentally start something and have it be school drama. I’d rather have it come from administration asking her to be more careful. 

Can anyone confirm for me how to tell the cause of the scratch, and how I can find out how this happened since administration is useless? Any other advice about the situation would be greatly appreciated.",07Jan2020,1

806,"Some background-I’m 19 years old and a sophomore in college. I live alone currently in a FAIRLY affordable apartment not far from the campus I attend and it’s very a easy commute to work. 

 Bills wise-I’m doing good. I receive help each month and I make enough at my job to cover my bills so I pocket that money and am able to use it on “extras”. School wise, it is paid for so I do not need to worry about that. I live on $500 a month besides my rent.

The three options I have for when my lease is up in July is:

Move in with my boyfriend, move in with a girl I met in college or continue living alone. 

Living alone:
If I were to continue living alone, I would more than likely want to move into a different apartment as my apartment is not extremely ideal. The price is right, however I have no heat or air (I live in AZ so it’s not a HUGE issue), I have been having issues with management and it’s in an increasingly more dangerous area. This would probably increase my rent from $900 to around $1,200 (not including my bills). I could afford this, but it would definitely be more than what I want to spend on rent. 

Move in with girl I met in college:
This option is something I am the most unsure about. I do not dislike this person however it is clear to me she only wants to be roommates because I am a convenient option (I will be able to be approved for the apartment). I am worried because she does not have an income. She continuously leaves me on read whenever I try and hangout and get to know her more (we don’t have to be BFF’s but I still want some type of relationship with her!). She only talks to me about the apartment. I have not fully committed to living with her, and I have only seen one place with her. Her “budget” would have us both paying around $600-$800 a month in rent, with no bills added in. Whenever I talk to her about the rent cap we have, she ignores me. 

Move in with my boyfriend:
This option I am sure and unsure about. My boyfriend and I get along amazing. If soulmates are a thing, then we are definitely that. We’ve been together 4 months, and it’ll be 9 months in July. It’s a young relationship, however it feels strong and secure (however I am not naive and understand this can change at any point in time). The rent would be $400 each, $500 with bills. I would be moving into a house with 4 other people (including my boyfriend). Unfortunately it would be all other guys, but I do like all of them. It is close to my work and has access to public transport nearby. I am unsure because I have never lived with anyone else before, let alone a significant other. I also realize I am not just living with HIM but with his roommates. The cost is extremely low and would allow for me to save more. Also, this would only be for around 6 months, and after that 6 months we could move into our own apartment. 

I’m torn because there’s pros and cons to each side. I would love any insight on any of these options because I’ve only experienced living on my own! 

Thank you!

TLDR: My lease is up in June and I have three options. Each of them have pro’s and con’s. I could continue living on my own, but I would more than likely have to love which would increase my cost of living. I could move in with someone from college, but she’s avoidant of me, and not respectful of budget and has no income currently. I could move in with my boyfriend which would be the lowest cost, but I would end up living with 4 boys for 6 months and I don’t know how that would work",07Jan2020,1

809,"I wrote and recorded the song as soon as I heard that my cousin had mononucleosis. The lyrics are basically me telling her to get well, and that if anyone deserves to get sick it should be me. This was during the beginning of December, so she has recovered now, but I still want to show her the song. I don't know if she will get pissed or not though, as I am a terrible singer. I did write and record a song however for her football team. At first, she said it was OK but it needed to be faster, so I re-recorded it and she sent me ""much better! 😍"", and I became really happy and proud of myself.

811,"19 years ago, my sister had all of her children taken away, for a variety of reasons that amount to incompetence in parenting. Recently her boys popped up in my 'closely related' feed on Ancestry. I reached out, because it seemed obvious to me that they might be trying to find their birth family. I acknowledge that was incredibly presumptuous, as they might have just been curious about their ethnicity. One stated as much.

Two have agreed to interact with me via Ancestry. One is an adult and the other has his parents permission. I would like advice on parameters. I know that I don't want to get into specifics about their mother, unless they ask. Her lifestyle hasn't changed much and I'm hesitant to be the person who provides any kind of conduit to her, but with that being said, I'd like to have a relationship with these boys. 

I have my own regrets about not having pursued them. I had three young children of my own at the time, and I didn't feel like I could reasonably handle six kids under the age of 5! Any advice on what should be off limits in terms of conversation?",07Jan2020,1
812,"I’m 22 and have been at my job for almost 2 years now. I knew going into it that I just wanted to have a job while I figured out what I wanted to do with my life after undergrad, and just before Christmas this year I was accepted into my dream graduate program at one of the top universities in the US (so obviously I am going!). The program doesn’t start until June, so I figured I would just stay until the end of March to save up extra money and give myself time to enjoy summer before beginning this next step. The only problem: my workplace is becoming insufferable and I don’t think I can stand being here another 3 months.

I don’t know if it’s because of my age or just because the women in my office are catty, but my workplace has really become toxic over the last 6 months or so, and my boss (the only person who actually values me here) told me in confidence that he can’t take it anymore either and is leaving in 2 weeks for another job. I’m scared that there will be no one to protect me once he leaves, and the president of the company already doesn’t like me so I feel like she’ll use him leaving as an excuse to disband our department (it’s only 3 of us) and put me back in my initial position of glorified intern.

It’s not like I’ll be destitute if I leave this job, but I make a decent salary and I want to be able to keep my finances strong before going into grad school. Besides that, I don’t think I’ll find somewhere that will pay me as much if they know I’ll be leaving in 3 months.

So I tried to get a job and well no one is really interested in hiring an 18 year old with very little experience.

Everyone calls me bad things. Like how high school was my high point in life and now I’m just going to end up in fast food or retail all my life.  The best only time that people looked at me was when I got engaged. But then that was short lived because the attention shifted to my sister when she announced that she was going back to college.

It doesn’t sound like it’s coming from inside our building (you can only hear it when near windows facing that direction) but perhaps the building next to or behind ours.

It’s not super loud but easily noticeable when the television or music is not on. It’s a series of 5 or so beeps followed by one slightly louder beep. It honestly sounds like someone is quickly punching numbers on a safe pin pad and getting the combo wrong. It doesn’t stop and has been going for 6 days now.

But fred for some reason finds it necessary to tell my wife that our baby is going to come out as gay, our baby will grow up to be a ""faggot"", that he will punch my wife in the stomach and make her abort our baby, he was going to trip her so that she miscarried or has an abortion, and just generally keeps telling her to abort the baby.

817,"Quite honestly do not know how to start this off, other than, I just realized my best friend lied to me and countless others about having cancer. I have caught her in plenty other lies but this one takes the cake. 

She told me and my partner in July of 2018 that she was in the early stages of kidney cancer. (Mind you, this was just 2 days after the one year anniversary of my grandfathers passing of lung cancer.) So it is personal to me, I was scared for her. Fast forward to now, she told my spouse that she is in the process of becoming a kidney donor. It made me curious, how could you donate a kidney after just one year of remission, and also chemotherapy? I started to research if that was possible. And quickly I realized, it’s not. (OR, if I’m wrong, if love to know! Please correct me.) I researched chemotherapy costs out of pocket (she claimed she was paying out of pocket so her parents wouldn’t realize since she’s on their insurance) and she would be in an insane amount of debt. Plus she claims none of her family knows. So I am not sure her story is adding up, yet again. Apparently she is going to the clinic soon to get bloodwork to see if she is a match to be a kidney donor. Would she even be doing bloodwork if the clinic knew she had chemotherapy for kidney cancer? I feel like she would have been denied, since she does not have two fully functioning kidneys. But any input is welcome. 

I’m not sure how to address it. I’m not sure if I should tell her partner, as they are suspecting she lied about this, too. They have caught her in many pointless lies, cheating, getting money from undisclosed people. My friend is really hurting people. 

There is one person who actually knows if she’s telling the truth about this, and for a reason I don’t know, they have completely cut her out of their life and will not talk to her or her partner. They have responded to my texts but I am afraid to ask them their opinion, I am afraid that she is blackmailing them. (I have watched her blackmail someone for money a couple years back, and I’m afraid that’s happening now.) 

All of that said, I’m just looking for some clarity, insights, opinions. I realize that said individual is toxic, and even though I care for them, they cannot be a part of my life. I do want them to get help, I do not know how to start that process.",07Jan2020,1
818,"im feeling super weird writing this but i told myself i would do it. So here i am. Im German btw (english not that great).

&amp;#x200B;

Im a 19y/o male and a few months ago i started working at a new place. Its a logistic/warehouse type thing. There is that girl. She´s prolly a little older than me. Im not sure though. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am half black. And you cant really do cool stuff with afro hair. So i finally, after years, started planting my dreads (newschoolrapper ish). They looked awfull on me. But i committed and hope its gonna look nice when they are actually long. 

  
When i got them fresh i was pretty new at that job. I wouldn´t really talk to people and log off every social situation pretty fast. I was about to make myself that quiet guy again.

&amp;#x200B;

 At some random day. I walked passed her. There was a LOT of stuff between us and i was minding my business and giving her the usual unsure/nervous looks/smiles. In my head, she already hated me. So i focus on where i wanna go.

&amp;#x200B;

""HEY (My Name)"" - i wasnt really getting why she would talk to me and i gave her a nervous ""hmm"". She had the most beautiful smile on her face and said: ""really cool hair"". (Dreads ar not that usual in Germany). I wasn´t processing what she was saying and said ""Thank you"" in an ironic-humble way. It wasn´t arrogant tho. Just playful. 

&amp;#x200B;

It clicked a few minutes later when i realised, she probably was hitting on me. I was new and didn´t wanna go back to her because all her co-workers came back from smoking. I would embaress both of us. 

&amp;#x200B;

She doesn´t talk much to people. Seems like a always alone type person. I really admire girls that are like this. she seems a little nerdy and kinda dreamy all the time. Its just super interesting to me. I´ve been single for a while and feel like im ready for a relashionship. Overall she seems like such an awesome fit. 

&amp;#x200B;

But that compliment is like 2 months ago and she been activly not looking at me since she gave it to me. When we HAVE to look eachother in the eyes we smile. I really like that smile from both of us. We do it sometimes. Rest of the day i feel like she is trying to get away from me. 

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like im creepy because im looking at her so much and even though she doesn´t ""catch"" me looking. I feel like she feels it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really wanna just talk to her. This hole situation of me not knowing if im creep, or crush, or nothing. Its weird. I never had something like this. Its not just because of the compliment. We were exchanging looks before that. I need clarity. 

I feel like we two got potential. I dont know why i think i know that. It´s just a feeling. I would hate myself if i let this oppurtunity go. Someone went through something similar? Can someone give me a other perspective on this?

821,"So I have an friend of mine from highschool (in our 20's now) let's call her Chloe and she had been dating a guy for 5ish years (we'll call him Josh). For most of their relationship they were good, all our friends liked him and they seemed really good for each other.  They hit a rough patch for a while and Josh broke up with her because he was stressed with work and thought they were the problem, but he quickly realized it wasn't her fault and they got back together.  Not ideal but we all still liked him and so we let it go. About a month ago however Chloe decided she needed to deal with some demons she had and broke up with Josh because she felt like she couldn't invest in a relationship so it wasn't fair to him, but had planned to get back together with him once she was in a better place.  He of course didn't want to break up but it was done and that was that.

After the breakup Chloe was a wreck, constantly texting me how much she was hurting and missed him etc and I tried my best to help her through it but it was really bad.  A few weeks later Chloe found out from another girl she had gotten close to that Josh had actually cheated on her with some girl at an event. She was crushed and of course texted me about it so upset, but she felt she couldn't ask Josh about it.  When they were together I had a decent enough friendship with Josh (to the point where after they broke up he told me to take care of her because he knew she was struggling) so I messaged him about it.  He lied to me about it and was not going to talk to her until I told him she'd rather hear the truth from you over anyone else.  He told her the truth and owned up to it so I'll give him that.  Chloe was obviously devastated and was giving the whole fuck him shit and I was again, trying to support her cause I don't think she told many people about it so I was pretty much the only person she leaned on.  I think in her mind him doing this meant logically there wasn't much hope for them to get back together.

Weeks went by and she was kinda meeting up with him to ""talk"" however every time she would do that they would end up sleeping together and then she would text me about how bad and gross she would feel about it, she knew I thought it was a stupid idea. It was hella frustrating to me cause like obviously it isn't ideal but if you're going to keep doing this either own it or stop doing it, don't tell me how bad you feel just to get sympathy then turn around and do it again. 

So cut to this week, she has just told me they are starting to go on dates again and she never thought she would be someone who would be okay with being with a person who cheated but her ""love for him and wanting to be with him is bigger than her being unable to forgive him"" and she's now making excuses for him. 

me: ""if he loved you why would he cheat in the first place""

Chloe: ""the relationship was in a bad place, we are the people or the relationship we were then"" (he cheated like under a year ago)

She says he feels SO remorseful for not telling her and that if he wasn't expressing so much guilt and sadness this would be a different story but I call bs that he is really that sorry but regardless they are seeing each other again. I have now texted her that I can't be the person she comes to anymore to complain about Josh because I have invested so much mental and emotional energy into helping her just to have her turn around and get back with him it's taken a toll on me mentally (she knows that to me, cheating is a huge no no and I would cut out someone and never give them the time of day if they were to cheat on me). I wouldn't say I feel betrayed or anything like that, I think I'm just frustrated that I feel like she got me this invested into it just for it to fall on deaf ears and for her to crawl back to him. I've asked my boyfriend what he thinks about this situation and he thinks Chloe is being ridiculous and Josh wouldn't have said anything if he hadn't been caught.

So here are my to questions: 

Am I in the wrong for telling her I can't be someone she texts about him anymore?

How can I ever be okay with him and seeing them together knowing what I know?

822,"basically im a motion deisgner/animator thats been working in industry for a few months now with a backing of 3 years degree. 

my job requires the use of 7+ software packages in addition to illustration skills. i learned majority of the software during my time at university and went above and learned additional software such as video and colour correction software. This was all fun and great while i was at university because i had nothing else going on in my life and wanted to put all my effort into my classes and future career.

now that i actually have a full-time job ive been trying to get my life back because not even kidding i am literally a workaholic and dont have a life outside work ( can check my previous post about it, got some great advice)

however recently ive been told by my boss that i need to develop skills in a 3d software, and honestly its like learning a whole new type of design it almost feels like learning the 7 different softwares in 1. I do have some knowledge in it but nowhere near enough compared to the other softwares.

because im working on other stuff during the 9-5 day the only times i actually get to work on learning the 3d software is during quieter periods at work ( which isnt often). this means in order for me to learn and plan projects around this new software ill either need to work outside work hours, which totally defeats my new goal of wanting to leave work as work.

honestly i know it may sound rediculous, but its giving me so much anxiety that i find myself shaking when wondering how to get around this, im even shaking as i type this. i really wanted to start a new life and leave work at work, my mind is so use to the constant work that i know if i only leave it to when i have down time at work im gonna feel shitty like im not doing well work performance wise....

i have some friends at work that also do a diffrent type of design but they only use 1 software package so its easy for them to call it a day when work is over. and if they are learning something new its more about improving what they already know, which they can easily do in considerably less time.

much appreciated in advance

thanks xx",07Jan2020,1
823,"There isn’t much to say. but for background she’s always been a messy person. however, she expects my siblings and i to clean up after her. i don’t mind doing MY share of chores, because guess what — i don’t make that big of a mess. she leaves her pads in an open garbage can in the bathroom which my dog chews up and leaves on the floor, she has pad wrapped ALL OVER her room, dirty dishes in her room, the entire kitchen is a MESS because she’s going through a phase of “decluttering.” my sister and i share a room and it’s so much neater than her room and our kitchen. that says something. i never wanted a dog — in-fact i’ve grown to resent them because of her. she expects us to feed the dog, let the dog outside, pick up its feces all over our house, has never trained the dog. KEEP IN MIND I NEVER WANTED A DOG AND NEITHER DID MY SIBLINGS—I BEGGED HER NOT TO GET ONE. 

before this—we’ve had over 20 cats when i was a kid that she’d get rid of, and of course they’d repopulate because she didn’t get them fixed. it’s not fucking normal that there’s feces in our house and she seems unfazed???? she expects us to pick up after the animals and when we tell her to do it herself she gives us puppy eyes and if we keep saying no she resorts to emotional blackmail. i’m so fucking tired of living in a mess, even if i cleaned it always goes back to being messy within a day. 

another disgusting habit she has is leaving the door open while she poops and does her business it’s fucking gross i tell her to close it and she just continues leaving it open. she walks around the house naked and doesn’t change despite me yelling at her OR telling her nicely that it’s inappropriate. what do i do ? i’ve told her nicely, i’ve lashed out at her, i’ve been calm explaining it—MULTIPLE TIMES AND SHE DOESNT LISTEN. 

tl;dr my mom got a dog despite my protests, expects her kids to take care of it and if we don’t there’s feces in the house. (my brother feeds it) she’s unbelievably messy/dirty and won’t change her habits. what do i do to make her change?",07Jan2020,1
825,"I have been nannying for years and, while I love the children and families I’ve worked for, I’m feeling burnt out. My passion for teaching them and being patient with them isn’t what it used to be and I fear that I won’t be able to enjoy my own future children if I keep going at this rate. 

After moving on from the previous family, I decided to take this break as a chance to “retire” from watching other people’s kids and focus on my ow businesses, as well as my own mental health and well being. However, I wasn’t financially ready for that break, so I decided to try a part time position that allowed the time for me to work on my stuff part time. 

Yesterday was my first day and I worked a total of 9 hours. I even drove the child 20+ minutes to and from the local play cafe, using my own car and gas, which I don’t mind if I’m reimbursed for. The job requires me to stay in the basement playroom several hours a day with no cell phone or tv. I know how it sounds, that I don’t need technology to watch kids, but this child did not want me touching any of his things, so I couldn’t even play with him. I was bored out of my mind, never have I had a family that didn’t allow me on my cell phone or laptop when the child was otherwise occupied. It’s not that technology is an issue, I could’ve brought a book and not been able to read it- they just want eyes on their kid at all times. 

I was completely miserable the entire day and decided there’s no way this will work out if I’m feeling this way the first day. I do gig work on the side so I can figure out how to float until my own businesses take off, so today I decided to let the family know that I’m resigning. I told them that I am not comfortable watching their child (and soon to be new born) while I’m on anti-anxiety medication and that I could no longer go without it. Basically I told them that out of safety for their children, I figured it to be more responsible to remove myself now before any more time passes. They weren’t mean about it, but they weren’t happy either. I brought them their car seat and credit card and wished them well.

Now I’m realizing that I have not yet been paid for the 9 hours I worked yesterday. At the rate we agreed upon, I should have made $135. I realize that I put them in a predicament with childcare, but the father did tell me yesterday that he’s off all this week, which is another reason I resigned sooner than later. I know they aren’t losing money from work to watch the son until they find someone else, but am I still entitled to the money for the hours I worked yesterday? I don’t want to confront them unless I know it’s the right thing to do. 

Please be kind, I’ve been having a 2 day panic attack over this 

Tldr; worked 9 hours yesterday for my first day, resigned today for mental health reasons. Wondering if I’m still entitled to the money I worked for yesterday?",07Jan2020,1
826,"I'm going to summarize the whole scenario.

&amp;#x200B;

I met a guy in a university class.  I make best friends with him.  We hangout everyday.  I'm over at his place consistently.  Over the course of 1.5-2 years of being friends with him, I also become friends with his girlfriend of 6-7 years.  Girl and I start talking everyday, and she starts using me for emotional support when she's not happy with him.  This continues for a few months, and we end up hanging out a few times when he isn't around.  One thing led to another, girl and I end up sleeping together multiple times over the course of a few months, in addition to other things.  Girl makes me fall in love with her, I stop being friends with the guy because I can't be around him without feeling like shit and sad.  She says that she's happy with me, calls me when she's sad or lonely, calls me for emotional support, tells me that I make her smile and laugh everyday, I begin to trust and open up to her, she opens her world to me, everything that love feels like.  We talk every single day for a year and never run out of things to talk about, never get bored of talking to each other.

Just this past holiday season girl goes on vacation with guy and he proposes to her on New Year.  She says yes.  Now she wants to put distance between me and her so she can try and be happy with him.  I asked her if I meant anything to her, or if I was only there to give her attention and she liked the thrill of it all.  Of course, it was for the attention and thrill of it.

&amp;#x200B;

What do I do.  I know I should leave it alone and move on with my life.  I never wanted to hurt her and I always wanted to make her happy, but I feel used and tossed to the side.  She says she cares about me, but on the inside she's terrified of me because I can spill the secrets.  I know I'm an idiot for playing into it all.  Tell me why I shouldn't tell the guy everything and watch her life fall apart.  We go to the same gym, and if I see him there and he starts telling me all about it, I'm not sure if I can hold myself back.  Help me please, Reddit.",07Jan2020,1

828,"This is strange to put into words but I will try. I have been somewhat socially underdeveloped (21M) and have been figuring out how to be social and react to social situations recently, like knowing what to say and what not to say, how to pick up on people’s expressions etc. I was pretty sheltered when I was young so I attribute this difficulty to that, not to anything like aspergers

Recently I have been very depressed, losing all motivation for school and not finding the will to go out and socialize which was once very important to me after I figured out that it was important for expericing life to the fullest. I have been sleeping until 2 or 3 and not caring, when before I would get upset if I woke up after 11 bc I would feel like I wasted the day. On top of that the fatigue is intense

But through all of that, I have not once lost my will to live or thought about killing myself. I have romanticized death somewhat often, but I think that’s more of an insecurity manifesting in my imagination. Regardless, I have never wanted to die.

834,"Hey. I'm 20 years old studying at university. I have a chronic illness that leaves me exhausted, and honestly really depressed, and am already two years behind my peers due to this. After a lot of indecision at what to do with my life, I restarted at university this year and moved to a new course. I got really good results in school, so going to university felt like the next logical step. Moreover, escaping my hometown and family felt like an amazing motive in itself. What I failed to consider was whether or not I would be happy at all - I never enjoyed school at all and found it extremely anxiety inducing, and it brought me a lot of unhappiness. 

I thought that studying something more artistic (English Literature) would make me happier, but my motivation has not increased at all, and I am finding myself still extremely depressed, which has a negative affect on my illness (M.E.). I'm barely getting any work done and I don't think it is realistic that I will finish the year.

I think it is sensible to leave university as I don't want to risk getting more ill, as well as staying in an environment that really upsets me. However, I will be hugely in debt with literally no money, and my only option is to move in with my boyfriend of only six months. He is wonderful and I don't doubt that we will get along very well living together, and that I would hugely enjoy it, however I am left in a really unstable position should we break up, as it isn't such an option to stay with my parents. The other issue is that he lives in quite a rural area where I don't really know anybody, with limited job opportunities.

&amp;#x200B;

Am I going mad by leaving university? I can't tell if I'm depressed or chronically lazy??

&amp;#x200B;

I know it is an amazing opportunity to save some money so that I can maybe travel or relocate to another city, but would it be far more sensible to have a degree behind me?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm so unsure of what I want in my life and future, as well as feeling tired and sick and depressed, that studying has become far too overwhelming so living with my boyfriend and working (something I do tend to enjoy more) seems like a much more enjoyable option. But is this lazy and short term thinking??

835,"This is not a post in regards to the legalities of the matter. I am not seeking legal recourse. However, I am seeking insight and gracious advice on how to handle his judgement in a conductive manner, person to person. 

I have just signed a lease into the second term of leasing with him. The first year was fine. Some usual landlord/tenant discrepancies as far as the relationship between us would go. We really do have little contact with each other. There have been times where he has had to enter the apartment to fix something. I have come to find that he's not exactly a Mr. Fixit. He does bare minimum and is fairly cheap. Fine, whatever. I'm not high maintenance at all. Like at all, at all. 

But I have come to find during usual landlord tenant interactions he tends to be incredibly judgemental. He plays himself off to be an easy going man but he has an attitude problem that is starting to make me uncomfortable. For example. He hangs up on me alot. The only way I can reach him is through an answering machine service on a telephone in his basement. So if we are speaking about something and he is in a mood, he will hang up on me and I won't be able to get back in touch with him on a matter. It's just rude. Other than that I can care less on the subject of matter that we were discussing. However, it just shows his rude character. And it's not all the time that he is like this. 

Some more for context. He's judgemental. The grouting by the bathtub in the bathroom isn't the greatest. If the smallest amount of water gets on the floor by the bottom of the tub it will leak through to the womans ceiling in her bathroom downstairs. However, I didn't know anything of this. Theres nothing in the lease about making sure the floor has no drips on it. I wasn't made aware of the situation. So one day I got out of the tub without drying off inside the tub and water got on the floor (I know this sounds ridiculous) and I guess it leaked through the crappy grouting and the woman downstairs got leak markings on her ceiling. I was made aware of this. He came over to check nothing was leaking. Nothing was actually leaking. And everything was fine. In my mind I figured that it was just because there was a little under an excess amount of water on the floor and it leaked through. So I figured, okay I will be super careful and it will never happen again. 

Well a couple of months later the rent check was sent through the mail and sometimes the mailmen in our tiny town really really suck. So he called me up one day and asked where the check was. I stayed on the phone with him and looked in the mailbox for it to still be there. Now, I'm not expecting any mail. Everything I have is done via email. So theres zero reason for me to check my mailbox unless I am expecting something. And as I usually just purchase the orestanoed envelope at the post office down the block and mail it from there I had zero clue that the mailmen in my new town just don't pick up the mail.  As everywhere else I lived it has been different. You put mail in your mailbox, the mail men pick it up and send it out. But this month I decided to he official about it and utilize what I had access to and decided to pick up some cute stamps and envelopes and start mailing it out only to find it was late. 

I told him it was in the mailbox still and I will take it to the post office immediately or stop it off in his mailbox down the block personally. He got really really mean with me and told me that I was being ridiculous and that I over flowed the bathtub. So now months later I am over flowing the bathtub? I also thought this was weird because my tent is due on the 1st however he never cashes my checks until the middle of the month anyway and is very nonchalant about recieving them. 

So then other instances where he gets super weird and judgemental with me is how I have the rooms in the apartment. Him and his wife told me when I first moved in what the rooms were. This one is a bedroom. This one is a dining room. This one is a living room. They wanted me to make a front room a living room when it's clearly a bedroom because of the closets in them but configured they wanted it to be a living room because that's where the cable cables are set up. I assured them that I don't use cable so it doesn't matter which room I choose to make the living room. I went ahead and made that room a spare bedroom and crafting room and made the designated dining room a living room, seeing as I am only one person and don't need a dining room.  It just makes more sense with the way the rooms go throughout the apartment. Why have a living room in a room with a door and a closet when you can put it in a room off the big kitchen that has door ways and open space. Anyways, whenever he's in a mood he has a tendency to go off on me about how I have the rooms. No direct comments. Ots8always just snarky backhanded remarks. And it's not all the time, again only if he's in a mood. 

He also went off on me about how I had tea bags in my sink. I was making pitchers of tea and decided not to throw them out yet and dumped everything in the sink while they cool. I don't know where a more appropriate place for them could possibly be. But if I threw them in the garbage right away they would have melted the garbage bag. 

He also just now went off on me about how I have water jugs lined up by my side door. I have them all lined up neatly by my door waiting to be recycled. I had literally just lined them up there. He started questioning me really rudely about why they aren't in bags and where am I putting them or bringing them. I was in the middle of sorting them by place. One kind you can money back and another kind you can't so I was ganna put them in separate bags. 

I don't understand how any of this is his business. I told him I was taking it to the place to recycle. If he shows up at my place and is asking me this it makes me incredibly uncomfortable that I am put on the spot having to answer these questions. I feel as if he is just picking fights with me because he's in a bad mood. 

He also entered my apartment on grounds of an ""emergency"" that a fan was left on and the lady downstairs could hear it. He said it was an emergency. Really what happened was is that my cat stole my electric toothbrush and was playing with it and what she was hearing wasn't fan but the vibrating of the toothbrush in the bathroom. I told him I don't have fans and he went in anyway to turn it off. He hung up the phone on me when I tried to explain to him that I don't have fans and he went in anyway. 

It's just little things like this that aren't okay with me. And it's certainly not appropriate. And it didn't start escalating until recently. 

Ive told him on two occasions now in the past couple of weeks that I'm not going to argue with him or deal with confrontation. How do I clear up with him that he is invading my privacy by forcing me to discuss matters that don't concern him in my private life? Like how I keep my rooms or why I have water jugs lined up by my door. Again, those are only two examples but I have much more and can provide much more detail on his rude demeanor as well.

She was my dream girl and I’m not just saying that, she was all I ever wanted in life. The red flags were everywhere but I ignored them because she made me feel happy. 1 year goes by and I learn that she’s slept with 2 other people while we were together and that she planned on adding to that list. She ended up leaving me and began dating one of the people she slept with behind my back. I was so broken I can’t even describe to you with words what it felt like. My head was in a constant state of darkness and I became suicidal. I have dealt with depression for my entire life but there was nothing quite as menacing as the feelings I felt during that year. My entire world became hell and all I could think of was her. My anxiety kicked up a notch and I started having chest pains and fainting whenever I thought too hard about her. 8 months go by without speaking to her once. She contacts me asking if she could explain herself and of course I jumped at the chance to see her again. She ended up breaking up with her boyfriend and confessed she still had feelings for me. I gave into it and we started another toxic round of bullshit. Recently she got a big job and moved to a different city. I’ve been trying to get over her for so long and it just won’t happen.

842,"Some background: I am 15, my brother, let's say Mike, is 17. We help in our family business for dat good $$. Our parents own the business and we have around 6-8 employees. Now, we are on a job site with our best employee, let's Jacob, and one of our lower-tier guys, let's say Ruben. Me, Mike and Jacob are in a joke where a septic tank used to be, and Ruben is outside the hole. There is a pile of old septic tank to our left and dirt from the hole on our right, with an excavator on the bank behind us. We are laser-leveling the bottom of the hole, but the laser battery is dying, so when we turn it on it stays on for 15-30 seconds then shuts off. Ruben, who is on ground level, is responsible for the laser, in theory. 

Here is the good part: Ruben is on his fucking phone talking to his wife (I did not know it was his wife) and A. Not looking our for Me, Mike, and Jacobs safety, and B. Not operating the laser, so I yell ""Wifey, Jacob is cheating on you! He has someone named Valerie in his phone (totally fake, he doesn't have that)!"" He then gets pissed off at me. We finish up the job and while I am putting the expensive laser away in the truck, he blindsided me and slugged my arm 6-12 times with real ass punches.

I play football and hockey, and the unwritten rule about fighting is: A. No cheap shots (or blindsides) and B. Let the guy know if you are gonna drop the mitts. The punches didn't hurt although the last couple hit right where I broke my arm last spring. I didn't fight back, because I didn't want any legal suits.

I struggle saying no as my parent's reasons for needing money is often, ""I don't have food for your siblings"", ""I have unpaid bills"", etc. So, important things. Which is what makes it hard for me to say ""no"", because if my parent was asking money for a new phone, I'd obviously and easily say no. However, my parent does tend to buy expensive things that are often unecessary which is where we (me, my partner, &amp; my psychologist) think is the reason for parent's lack of funds. 

Thing is, I want to start saving money for different reasons - to move in with my partner, to have a back-up account for sudden expenses, etc. But that would require to start saying no, but how do I mentally allow myself to say no to someone I believe needs my help (though they put themselves in that situation?) without feeling like I am failing as this parent's child? My morals tell me that it is my duty for my parent's sacrifice to help as much as I can, but I also know that if I continue like this, the future I may want won't be possible for a long time. 

So, how do I get away from that mindset? Or is it a reasonable mindset? 

 **TL;DR** Grew up with the idea that I should always help and offer money to my parent, which is now taking a toll on my future plans. Parent has a history of constantly not having enough money and loaning from others.",07Jan2020,1

Recently he and his wife have tried to get in contact and want to meet up. I’m all for this but kind of nervous as I don’t know what to expect. He works in the oil fields and got remarried and his wife has a kid. They’ve all been very sweet, it’s just a new situation to navigate.

852,"Hello! Getting straight to the point, over the past week or so I’ve had many intrusive thoughts about death, or more accurately, my fear of it, and I was wondering how I could get rid of it? I know it’s easier said than done but it’s really starting to weigh down on me.

I know death is inevitable and it’s just a natural thing, but I’m so scared of forgetting everything and everyone I know, especially my family. The thing that terrifies me the most is losing my family or losing myself to death and never seeing them again, or even forgetting about them, as well as the pain it’ll bring them/me and the fear of also forgetting all of my memories.

I’ve been reading about a lot of near death experiences and while many recall seeing some kind of lights and remembering that they are dead/memories of their past life, it does give me hope but there’s also people who remember pure nothingness and eternal sadness. 

It’s a very heavy topic but it scares me so much and I don’t even know what brought this on. Even though my family is healthy and happy I can’t help but feel like some kind of freak accident or an alternative such as being hit by a car will end us all soon and it’s making me feel really upset. I wish I could come to terms with all of this but there’s something within me so terrified of it that I just can’t. I’m a young student and I’m finding it hard to focus on my work when it always comes into my head, even at random times. Sorry for being such a downer, but any help would be really appreciated.

860,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

A few months ago, an elderly driver backed into my friends car while I was driving it in a parking lot. I was pulled out, she made it about 1-2 feet out of spot and right into my friends bumper. 1000 in damage and despite her protesting I called the police for a report. The report found her at fault. Despite her insurance company telling me on the phone (non recorded portion of course) that they believe she was at fault they would only pay 50% of damages. I am insured through a great national company but my friend has local crap insurance in which his deductible was more than the damage so they would not fight for me for the other 50%. I ate it and gave my friend cash and though that was the end of it. Well, I come back from holiday vacation this month and find a letter from a debt collector saying I owe insurance company 500 dollars for ""50%"". Doesnt say they paid this to their client NO DAMAGE, or if they are trying to recover what they paid my friend. Anway, they went around insurance and straight up told this debt collector i owe them 500. There is no judgement, there was NO communication from this insurance company and no claims against my insurance comapny or my friends. They simply invented this debt and the company could not send me proof of debt or a judgment saying this is a legal debt. While police reports may not be admissible in ""claims"" with insurance they are in small claims court so I think they knew they would lose and tried to pull a scumbag shady move. What allows a debt collector to try and go after credit? I am not under contract with this insurance company, I am in no agreement and received no service. There is nothing saying this debt is legal and I most certainly dont intend to pay. Going around insurance seems quite illegal and Im thinking of reporting them to my State's CFO office for this little trick. Do I have to worry about credit? If they did try and take me to small claims, Im quite confident I would win and I think they know this hence their shady run around.",07Jan2020,1
861,"So my GF of 3 1/2 years ended up having to move out of state because of stuff with her family. She then told me she needed a “break” from us because she felt she needed to be “alone” for a bit. So we were on break for about a month and we texted and even FaceTimed a couple times a week. We were telling each other we weren’t doing anything with anyone else, and promised that we didn’t even want to. But I had picked up on random queues that made me suspicious, like a random guy would go over and she would be like yea I’m gonna help him wrap Christmas presents or some BS, weird things like that happened all the time. Then about a week ago she called me and said she was excited to tell me about something, then laughed and said we’re not getting back together and hung up then disappeared for a couple days. She then texted me a couple days later, wanting to come hang out with me. I was reluctant the whole time because I knew it would hurt me, I had been in so much pain the whole time we were on a break. she knew but didn’t care. but we made plans anyways, I was gonna go meet her and we were gonna hang out for a few days. Then I had decided not to do it, and I messaged her and I said that something else came up and we’re not gonna hang out anymore, then I blocked her to protect myself and I was going to move on. I then got texts from her friends over there, one of them was a video of her having sex with the guy I was suspicious about, and they sent me texts saying it had been going on for a while and trying to rub it in and stuff. Later on that night, she emailed me the video herself I guess to make sure I got it. I didn’t watch it of course, but I saw what it was. The guy then texted me trying to rub it in. I didn’t respond to either of them. How do you guys suggest I go about dealing with this? It’s super painful, sad, and made me angry.

862,"I’ll try and keep this short, but when I was 22 fitness was my entire life. I worked at a gym, trained daily, and eventually became a NASM certified trainer as well as a competitive bikini bodybuilder in the IFBB. During this time though, my mental health was complete shit. I loathed myself, hated my body, was obsessed with my social media presence, and was battling suicidal ideation. Not to mention I was having the most extreme manic and depressive episodes of my life (I’m bipolar). It was a very dark time for me, while I was involved in the gym.

I began seeing a therapist who completely saved me, and we came to terms with the fact that the gym was not a healthy place for me to be in at that time and a lot of my issues were being stemmed from my environment. I quit my job, gradually stopped working out and dieting, and regained a healthy self esteem away from how fit I was. I started living a normal, mentally healthy life and for the last couple years I’ve only had a couple manic and depressive episodes that were quite maintainable.

I’ve gotten to a point though where I feel like I shouldn’t be neglecting my physical health anymore. I don’t sit around eating Cheetos all day, but I’m not as active as I should be and do miss feeling strong. I went to the gym the past couple days and could only last 20 minutes lifting weights. I’m so physically weak, and being in the gym environment that I’ve been running away from for years has spiked my anxiety to uncomfortable levels. I don’t have insurance anymore and have stopped seeing my therapist so I don’t have anyone to talk to about this.

I don’t know what to do, I want to rebuild a healthy relationship with the gym but I’m scared of being back in there and also feel like such a piece of shit not being able to lift as much as I could.

We have been living together for over eight years. Things have not always been easy. Actually, we have been arguing quite a bit since the beginning. Before this relationship i had never really been arguing with my partners before.

Things have been said - mostly by him. Things that he only meant in the heat of the argument, but things i haven’t forgotten. I’ve also said things. None of us have been the best part of ourselves.

We have had whole weeks where we had little arguments every day. Just plain bad energy between us. Whatever one of us said the other one misunderstood and the we argued.

Both my best friend and my mom have seen him not being so nice to me. Not abusive or violent but unfriendly and a rude. He is a nice guy but he has issues.

We have i child. She’s five.

**I don’t love him anymore.** I want all the best for him and i do deeply care about him as the father of my child but i don’t love him as a partner.

We’ve had “the talk” quite a few times. A few months ago he acted out and behaved quite badly towards me. I took a long walk with a lot of crying and when i came home i ended it. I said that i couldn’t take it anymore. It was harder that giving birth! It was the hardest thing i’ve ever done. At first was cold. He said that i’m ruining our family. That the worst thing that can happen to a child not having parents that live together. My parents got divorced when i was little and of course i was wounded but as i grew up i realized that the wound healed nicely without leaving scar. My parents were great at being parents separately.

We talked a lot, i cried a lot and somehow we ended up with the agreement that we should try a few months more. He gave me a way out. I was a coward. He said that i was giving up too fast. I couldn’t stand that thought, even though it was not our first talk. It wasn’t the first time i had been crying and saying that i almost couldn’t take anymore of this. I’ve really tried to make it work.

Since then he has tried a lot harder. We haven’t had any major arguments but my feelings haven’t changed.

I’m at a point where i feel numb. It’s like my state of mind is flatlining most of the time. I feel sad. I have a lump in my tummy. I don’t have much appetite. It hurts me so bad to hurt him - cause i will. It hurts me so bad to break his heart and to rip our family apart. I feel like i’m ripping the carpet from under his feet. He has a kid as well. That’s three people that will get hurt, plus me.

I give all my love to my daughter and i shield her as much as i possibly can. We play and laugh but…

I just can’t breathe. I feel so sad in my soul. Devastated. I feel like a tiger in a cage. When he touches me i freeze. I’m devastated that i feel this way. That i can’t find the feelings i once had. I really wish that i could find the feelings again but i feel like it’s too late. We walk around ""pretending"" that there's not a big fat elephant sitting in our living room. 

We’re not ourselves anymore. We have changed from all this. I’m not the best version of myself. It’s like i don’t really know who i am anymore. I’m in my thirties (he’s older) and i know that there’s time to find myself again. There’s happiness out there.

Sometimes i feel selfish. That i can’t put my own well-being aside for our daughters. That i should stay and “suck it up” for her. But i’m not sure that this is healthy for her nor me.

I also think: Is this what i want her to see that love is? Am i being a good role model? Wouldn’t she understand later on?

I’m actually not sure what i want from this. I just feel like i can’t hold it inside anymore. I’m on the edge of crying several times a day.",07Jan2020,1
879,"I made this anon account so it doesn’t trace back to my other account. I’m 16F living in a Scandinavian country.

My father has had anger issues all his life (my parents are divorced) and has made decisions and actions that I really dislike. He has taken his anger out on me and my sibling but there’s nothing we can do.

I want to live with my mom full time (currently; one week with mom then one week with dad) and I have to tell him about it but I’m bad with having his anger taken out on me and the consequences of this.

He’s much larger than me and I feel awful every day when being here with him and school is my only escape. He’s currently a NEET and probably will forever be unless in a situation where he’s forced to work. 

Should I tell him that I don’t want to live with him anymore? He seems to love us but all of his actions make me really upset and I don’t want to handle the stress of it anymore. I don’t know how I should go on. Should I keep it in for two more years?",07Jan2020,1

882,"At the moment things seem fine but it's come to my attention that a lot of things that happened in the past haven't been resolved with myself. There are some parts that I don't know if I'm being over dramatic about or if it's worth talking to anyone, I don't know if it's normal. I really have no one I can tell about these problems, I do have a loving family but for specific reasons I really can't share that I think I may need help with them. One of these reasons being well, everyone in my close family has had extremes in terms of mental health, there's no way I can tell my parents that every single one of their kids is dealing with stuff. They'll definitely think it's them, and they don't need anymore stress. 

Maybe it's possible there's people I can tell but I just don't have the courage to. It's problems like this, the fear of asking for help, that I think I need some stuff sorted out. Yet I'm not even sure how I'd go about that, I think there's a school guidance counsellor but I don't need guidance, I need someone to help me order this, because I feel like I might be missing out on courage that I used to have or a part of me that used to be there but is covered up from some past events. I'm wondering if it's possible that there's a solution with some of things I put up with in how I act and think all the time. I can't ask my parents to let me see someone and the guidance counsellor likely won't help me, I don't know what to do. 

I know at this stage I can't rely on helping myself. I know because things that have been pretty bad have started fading in my memory, I've just been ignoring them. I'm too much of a pussy to face them to be honest and I know that I'm not worth anyone's time and that self pity is stupid but I'm feeling quite lost",07Jan2020,1
883,"Hello, 
Thank you for visiting my post :) 
Now, to clarify, I have a friend group outside of my boyfriend’s. But I’ve recently realized that one of my big interests is gaming and with that, I have no group at all except my boyfriend’s. Personally, I know this could (or maybe already has) spark a problem, such as me becoming too attached to my bf. I want to have a group of my own as well, so that doesn’t happen. I’ve already noticed this attachment, because I have started to grow sad when I game with the group, and he is not there. I’ll have expectations for him, that are not possible to have in the first place, because I have a tendency to overthink. In order to counter this, I want to get away from the group, so I can become more sure of myself, and minimize my habit of doing so.
The trouble begins when I try to find other people with the same interest. I’m a quite introverted person, so I’ve failed miserably a lot of times xD I’m also not experienced in gaming at all, so skill-wise i am probably not very desirable to game with. I’ve tried to talk to a few people online, or join a few groups on twitch, but more often than not, I get too shy to even comment anything. 
Do you guys have any advice, or maybe even other methods, in which I could find new acquaintances, and maybe even have a game or two with them sometime? :-) 
Maybe this has been quite long, and I apologize, but I had to explain everything, so I could clarify. Thank you for any advice you may have :))
Also, excuse any mistakes, English is not my first language!
Lovely day to y’all :)",07Jan2020,1

I am disabled so I cant just grab it out of hands. One day he was joking around and he didn’t realize how much flex the toy had so it literally was a slap in the face. I got pissed and I realized it was a accident.  When this happened I was like no more this shouldn’t even be a thing anymore. No,I was wrong he is on a  Cruise so he recruited my lil sis to do it for him.  One day my older sister did it. Then my lil sis came home does it I get mad and go off on her.

So here is my story. I moved to a different city to go to university. My parents decided that it would be a good investment to buy an apartment that I can live in now and even rent at some point.I've lived for two years here already. The issue is: it is the noisiest place in the world. It is on the first floor, the walls are thin, and there are plenty of cars passing around. Also it is near a hospital. So guess what: ambulances. Also let's not forget the cherry on top: there is a bar, a non-stop store and a very small parking lot right in front of it.I used to love winter since because of the snow and cold there would be less people here, now there isn't even snow or that cold. How in the world was I dumb enough to let them make this purchase I don't know. Only one thing's certain: I'm miserable. I need good sleep in order to study and be a fucking functional human being.
It's 11:10 p.m. here, I've been lying in bed since 9:50 p.m. and now I'm writing this post out of frustration, despair and sleep deprivation. Right now I hear two drunks arguing and some lady laughing out loud and a small dog barking.

I am open to any: noise reduction ideas, sleep techniques, life hacks and sorcery (note: no blood sacrifices allowed).
P.S: I have tried earplugs but they don't do much and are kind of uncomfortable. Still using them sometimes tho.

889,"Hi everyone, so my coworker and I have been working in the same office for over a year together.  I’m kind of an introvert and am not really the best at reading social situations sometimes.  So Friday night we all went out for dinner and drinks with other coworkers and all had a great time.  My husband and I had never hung out with her outside of my work and we seemed to be connecting really well.  After we went to a bar, and we both revealed to each other that we smoke cannabis at the same time.  She got drunk, and started dancing on me and my husband.  Shortly after she asked if we wanted to go home and smoke, and I was looking forward to breaking the ice with that and also a little concerned that she would make it home okay because she was driving.  We made it home and she invited us in and we had a few beers and smoked.  I did accidentally see a dildo she had in the living room when we walked in, she seemed a little embarrassed but I assured her it was no big deal.  We all talked and were having a good time when she broke down crying about her ex.  I hugged her and tried to cheer her up, but she just said I have work tomorrow.. in a tone that implied we should go.  We went home and I was off for the weekend.  Sunday my husband helped her move some boxes and she seemed fine, but later he got really upset about something and started yelling and threw a can of beer at our house.  She was home and it’s a possibility that she heard, but I’m not sure.  Now at work she won’t talk to me when I speak to her or even look at me.  She just turns away and doesn’t say anything until I leave.  I don’t understand what went wrong, and I’m worried she will tell me coworkers (the wrong ones) that I smoke weed or that my husband can get aggressive.

I am male, 27 guitarist playing in a duo with a female who is 33 for about a year. Couple of months after starting up our band, we dated for about 2 months. But it didn't work out, it felt a bit off.

We put our giggs and rehearsals on hold for about 2 weeks and then returned to playing together. We talked about us, our band and how we enjoy gigging and writing music together. We attended few festivals, shows and had future plans for the band, so decided to continue playing. 

I guess I should also mention that both of us don't have many close friends and people who we can hang out with due to their schedules, kids, work etc. So we quite often went out together, before dating and after it. You know, bars, clubs, movies, park, dinners. We also had sex I'd say 8/10 times if we met up, including rehearsals. At some point I talked to her that we need to stop as it won't lead to anything good. We are not in a relationship, we tried already and it didn't work. And this friends with benefits situation is depriving both of us from dating other people and moving on. She was okay with it. Fast forward another month and we are back having sex. 

I haven't seen her for the last 2 weeks as I was away and will be back home in a week. We are going out for few drinks and might end up in bed together. 

Now, I'm not blaming her for wanting having sex and initiating it because I do it to. I am thinking with the other head sometimes.

Anyway, I know it won't lead to anything, us as a couple won't work, so I have to stop. But I don't know how to say it or do it. If I'll be distant she'll notice it, saying again we have to stop will sound like a joke at this stage.

893,"I'm 24M.  
Partner 21F.  


I've had some really bad past relationships, my first serious one ended up with me being cheated on and finding out I had been being cheated on the entire last year of the relationship. My last one ended with the girl going back to her ex.  


It completely knocked me down given how open I was about myself to her, and how she threw it all in my face.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I've been cautious with the current girl I'm with, We've been going out for a few months and have settled that we need to make things more serious. She always insists on me talking and being open, communicating basically.  


So today we were talking about a post I saw on here about a guy who went through the same as me, and that the girl he was with now just developed feelings for a co-worker, so I sent it to her to get her opinion.  


She didn't say much aside from the fact she read it.

So I send her a message saying the following:

*""I'm sorry I'm so scared all the time, it's just, I've been hurt so many times by people. And I really like you. And I like where we are going together, and I'm just scared to death I'm going to have to watch you leave me too...I wish I was a stronger person for you. But I'm just so tired and fragile from people beating me down all the time...I'm just scared it happens again. And I know you've said you aren't going to, but I'm still scared to death. So I'm sorry I'm like this.""*

&amp;#x200B;

Yes, I know I shouldn't apologize for what people have done to me but it's the way I am. I feel like I'm to blame for it.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway her reply was the following:

*""I understand where you're coming from. Some Advice though, Don't show your weakness to others, ever, people take advantage of that, You're too kind and sweet, almost naive I feel like. For your own sake, be a cold bitch. Not to me ofc, I'm different lol.""*

Obviously, I'm going to overthink the hell out of that (I have an overthinking problem, along with chronic depression and anxiety, thank my ex for that. So my therapist says), and I'm almost sure I'm right to now?  
She does live by the fact she says she's a cold bitch, due to her ex and how he hurt her, which I can understand, and I've slowly been getting her to feel more loved again with me and it's shown, but that just came off weird I dunno...  


I replied:  


*""I'm not like this to other people...I don't open my feelings up like this to anyone Jess (We'll call her Jess). The only reason you are reading that and seeing me like this is because you're my girlfriend...At least to me you are* (I know how this comes off saying that but I want to see if I get some sort of answer out of that specific line)*, and I think you deserve to understand I'm not as strong as I should be...because it only matters to you to see me vulnerable, because supposedly you'd have no reason to use it against me....    But you've given me something to think about after that.""*

She hasn't seen it yet, and is offline(Instagram)...(actually just checked whatsapp and she is online there)

My therapy isn't until Saturday because I was supposedly getting better since the last session but I need someone's help please.

  
**Am I overthinking what she said? Or am I right to think she said what I think she said which is she might use it against me in future?**

She also makes comments about a closeted friend and even tries to out her. She’s even personally attacked me for my acne/scarring when she knows it’s an actual problem and genuinely bothers me when i can’t help it. She has no filter whatsoever with what she says, no matter if it is about another student in our class or next to us. She’s even called a class stupid to a teacher's face(the teachers was rlly passionate abt what they taught). For the past year, every other week she causes issues and makes rifts between our friend group’s dynamic.Everyone wants to kind of get rid of her, but the problem is that we’re her only friends.

All the money I’ve saved up I used to buy a car.  A 2o year old car but still something.

I have a graduate degree and work a job making $12 hrly.  A little overwhelmed because I have no place of interest to me I want to move too.  No real spiritual communities or town in my state but I don’t want to leave the state because I have a sober network of a couple of people as well as family and friends, so does this mean I suffer, find a shit hole to live in, work 40/50 hours a week and go to school at night for a different field.

Moving back in with parents would save me money but they said that I have to make it on my own.  With love they said it and they are right.  The excuse is “ but I can save money, not work so hard, do school quickly, and be in a stress free environment”
But others have been successful without that crutch, so I have to as well.   It’s overwhelming.  One year ago I was a homeless drug addict, now it’s like boom, real world still turns with or without me.

I just don’t know how the next move I make will be the right move.  Masking emotions and not really being a man the past 20 years due to drug addiction and using family members, I’m scared that I’ll struggle to pay rent and also try to go to school.   This rehab has been great, it got me back on my feet by giving me life skills, and I found a decent job, not in my career but relatively allow stress.  I want to leave the state and go to a more spiritual town or city, but that sounds so dumb when I type it but for me, connection with people matter, and In this area, people are beautiful but it’s just not what I vibe to.

One thing is, I have no desire for drugs.  But now it’s like, oh shit, life is almost too open.  What do I do? Breathing, meditation, and awareness can only go so far.   If you have practical advice or have known someone in a similar situation, I would be graced to here about it.

I just don’t want to struggle with meaning and purpose anymore.

For context, this was a guy I met in high school and talked to nearly every day. We weren't best friends, but we had good conversations and AFAIK we mutually enjoyed talking to each other. We lost contact after high school (he had no social media for a long time) until I saw someone with the same last name under ""people you may know"" and clicked it to find a profile for him in their friends. I sent a message saying hi and asking how things were. He ended up blocking me.

I can't think of anything I might've said or done in the past that would have him upset with me. I know it's been awhile since we talked, but I'm just confused and wondering if I did something wrong.

Is it possible maybe he has a girlfriend who got jealous and doesn't want him being friends with another girl? Do you think maybe he thought I was making an advance even if I was just trying to catch up? Was it not cool of me to message him after several years?",07Jan2020,1

I have so much dreams and wanted to start doing something with my life. Working out, then going to school to graduate then work after school. I also want to learn things such as new languages, cooking and relearning musical instruments.

After the first day of work I was in so much pain in my whole body especially my lower back and legs and now I’m sore. It was a 7 hour shift in a really busy fast paced  store.

905,"Throwaway account before we begin. 

So about 4 days ago, my (ex) friends who I recently removed out of my life started spreading rumors about me. The reason I ended friendships with most of them, was because of this very same reason. However, the rumors they were spreading were off of my reddit account. Which prior to us going our separate ways, they had no idea what reddit even was. 

They were taking my post, and sending them via everyone they know who knows me... just so they could make fun of me. Now what makes this all the more dumb, is everyone in this post I will be talking about is at the ages of 24-26. Yes that's right, high school drama in your mid 20s. 

Now normally I would let this go, usually when these kind of drama flairs start up I typically just walk away. This time though, someone was actually trying to bully me via through reddit and telling family members... 

Come to find out, my Ex girlfriend stalked me on social media and somehow got ahold of my reddit account and has been tracking me for over a year and a half. She's been saving post after post, and holding onto them for I dont even know how long.

To give some context, this girl I dated was a huge mistake on my part. I talked to her for over 4 months before i even started dating her, and found out after a week of dating that she was to be engaged that summer. The relationship ended poorly, and she ended up cheating on me at the surprise of no one. I didnt get petty with her, because I loved her deeply, and to this day I still care about her (obviously not as much). 

The reason I'm here, is because my blood is boiling and I havent been sleeping. All I can think of revenge that would end her career, her current relationship, her college scholarship, her parents trust, tell her ex fiance the truth, and would destroy her mentally. 

Up until this point, one of my current friends had asked me if he could try and date her for the past two years. I warned him not to, but he did it anyways. He was lead on for idk how many months, and just remained friends with her. That being said, he was the one who told me everything that she was doing, because it made him feel sick to his stomach. 

Now the post on my main account have no real juicy secrets to hide. Mostly, I ask question to some groups about relationship advice, upvote memes, and occasionally give out thank you posts to team liquid when they have a good week. The fact she is trying to tear me down a peg even though I'm not talking about her behind her back, or even doing anything to shame her.... it has me beyond angry. 

She doesnt know, that I know what's she doing. She also has no fucking clue that I've been friends with her ex fiance since we broke up. I know so many secrets about her, and all her bullshit... so people of reddit, I ask for your advice  do I ruin her life? Or do I turn the other cheek? 

For any of those who say I'm a shit human being for not telling the fiance the truth... the guy went through therapy, and had more than enough done to him. They were together for 4 years (high school sweethearts) I saw no point in telling at that time.",07Jan2020,1

907,"I was working a full time job that was extremely toxic and I couldn’t take it anymore and quit before the new year. I live in New York City so there a lots of opportunities but very high rent. I wasn’t making enough to have a lot of savings, so I’m working with very little money. 

I have chronic, major depression. Part of why I quit my last job was that it was making my depression significantly worse. I don’t regret quitting but I’m feeling extremely overwhelmed with the reality of being unemployed and my depression is becoming crippling. Finding a job is hard work, and I’m having a hard time getting out of bed and eating meals, so focusing and dedicating myself to applying and networking is extremely difficult.

In the application, I listed that I had completed writing a script for a film but have since scrapped it into a million pieces and have been reworking it into it's own new thing and into other projects. 

Would it be so detrimental to my chance of getting accepted if I selected ""unable to provide document"" on the audit? This option is separate from ""I no longer wish to participate in university admissions"" for context.

912,"I am not very good with grammar so please forgive me....

This is something that has been laying on my heart and soul for the vest week since it has happened and I just can't seem to get over it. No matter how hard I try to tell myself to.

My vest friend and I have been good friends for over 10 plus years and we usually have a rough patch once or twice a year. (Gage is his name) 
Gage is a only child on his mom's side. So in a sense you could say he has been a bit sheltered and he has a bit of a gaming addiction and a obsession with anime. Lol. 
But that isn't what I need some advice on. So I am just going to go straight into it and try to put as much details as I can. 

So about a week ago I got a message at about 4am when I was in bed sleeping cause I had work and only glanced at my phone before passing back out. But what I read was that gage was drinking and was in his feelings and was wanting to harm himself and jump off a bridge.. But I was so exhausted from work that I fell back asleep and a few of our gaming friends was already talking to him and when I woke up to get ready for work I was updated on what happened. And they said that he was okay and I talked to him a few hours after I got to work and he was very distant only said a few words and then he said he was ""planning""......planning what I asked, then I ask planning to hurt someone or harm yourself dude. And he replied with ""both"" and at that point I was annoyed with him (cause everyone something in his life doesn't go his way or he gets angry/emotional, he goes straight to wanting to hurt someone and sometimes wants to end his pain (mainly cause he misses his mom that passed away a year ago). 
I told him that it's not okay to constantly go for the wanting to harm someone and/or yourself. And I told him that if he doesn't stop his shit right here and now that I would call the cops to have a paramedic go out and check on him cause I am a hour away and his girlfriend didn't seem to take it seriously. And his response was that I was a snitch and he was in a fb messenger group chat and said some mean things about me and was lying saying the cops were at his job to take him in and then his gf messaged me trying to fight me and being all sorts or disrespectful and I I messaged a friend of ours that was in the chat who is from new Zealand or something and she added me to the chat so that me and gage could talk it out as adults. But at that point I was confused on how It went from me trying to get my best friend some help since his gf thinks it's all about him seeking attention but I seen him act like this on multiple occasions but not as bad till his mom passed away.  
(I know that this is very confusing) 
But anyways. Gage pretty much called me a snitch for trying to say that I would call the cops to have someone go out and evaluate his mental health. And he just blocked my messages (not fully block on fb) and his gf messaged me saying I am a idiot to think gage is stupid enough to harm himself or someone. And I said once you hear it enough you start to worry. And I was worrying about my best friends health and that his gf was claiming it was all about attention and I get it but he needs someone to talk to and his gf isn't doing a good job and i worry about him. Cause him and his girl just had a baby a few months back and I just want my best friend I call my brother to be alright and that's like a crime only because I brought cops into the equation. So now we're not friends he has me blocked on everything and has been telling people I tried to get his girlfriend and him put in jail and his son taken away.......

I lost my best friend cause I cared about his mental health. We always been there for eachother but I just feel like his gf isn't trying to help cause her response is that her life was 10x worse and that he should suck it up butter cup and that is what she says when he is down and missing his mom. It's like she is passive aggressive towards hos feelings and likes making it about her as gage makes it about him.....and his girlfriend says he is just trying to seek attention. And this has been eating me up cause I lost a lot of my friends to some stupid petty crap and it's just not right to lose friends over petty things 

I apologize for repeating a lot of what I said. But that's just some of what is running through my head. Any advice helps please.",07Jan2020,1

923,"I just need some advice on how to go about this! I moved into my new apartment about 5 days ago. I live in one of those big, old Victorian houses. The house is split into 4 different apartments. I live on the top floor of the house. The top floor is cut into two different apartments, I’m on the right side, someone else is on the left side.
A couple days ago, I was out in the backyard and I noticed a small window, directly above my front door. As far as I knew, I lived on the top level and there were no visible staircases to get to the attic of the house. I assumed it was just an attic (I was right) and I assumed that there was probably a pull down door with stairs somewhere. I looked in my apartment and didn’t see anything out of the ordinary, so I just brushed it off and assumed the entry way to the attic was probably in the other persons apartment on the left side of the house.

Today I had family over to see my apartment for the first time. Someone had pointed out that there was a board that had been screwed on to the wall in my hallway. They knocked on the board and it was for sure, hollow. About an hour later my boyfriend took a screwdriver to the board to undo the screws. The board came right off the wall and revealed a set of stairs. We walked up the stairs and found the room with the window I had seen previously. There was another big room with black and grey tubes on the floors. The ceilings looked like they were almost ready to collapse in that room. However, the other room we first walked into was pretty decent. 

The walls were high, there was a working ceiling fan and light. All the outlets in that room are functional. The only thing is that there were a couple floor boards missing, but not many. The room definitely looked usable, the walls were clean, it looked as though it used to be a living room back in the day. 

This might sound crazy, but I think it would be awesome if the company I’m renting from would do some renovations in that room. There’s a door that connects to the second room (the one that’s falling apart and definitely not usable) all they would need to do and add 3-4 small floor boards and replace the door. Then that could lock that door so nobody can enter. 

I almost want to bring it up to them but it was boarded off for a reason. I’m sure they won’t be happy to hear that we undid all the screws to get in. How should I go about this? I think it would be perfect for a living room, second bedroom or a study area.",07Jan2020,1
924,"My father is an almost 60 year old divorced alcoholic with currently no family or income other than from me and my sister. The only reason we are so young (21&amp;18) and are able to support him is because my older brother died leaving me and her some money under his life insurance. It has been a few years now and he has gotten and lost several jobs throughout. But now he has stopped applying and responding to jobs entirely. 

My father is mostly a good man but he has some history of guilt tripping and lying to me and my sister. Recently we have been telling him we are going to stop supporting him if he doesn’t at least attempt to get a job. A few days later he asked me for my brothers shotgun I had and shells for a friends turkey shoot that was going on. I brought the gun but forgot the shells and about another month has gone by. On a few occasions he has asked me to bring the shells he originally asked for. I am thinking of moving to Hawaii and discussed bringing him with me. Then I decided I would want to do this alone at first, then bring him out there with me. A few days after telling him this, he asked for the shells again. What I’m thinking is if he actually did want to kill himself, he wouldn’t be asking his son for the shells, he would just go buy his own. I don’t know if he is trying to guilt trip me and my sister into freely supporting him or not.

Well my sister called me today and said dad went missing last night for around 2 hours. He typically never leaves the house other than for liquor and cigs. She tried to have a serious conversation about his current state when he came back but he would refuse to respond to anything and at one point he randomly broke out into laughter which is extremely strange behavior from my dad. Eventually he admitted to her that he had gone down to the river planning to kill himself. He said he stopped himself because he cares about us and didn’t want to do that to us. And that it felt unnatural to die like that. Obviously I want to help my dad, but I am refusing to just throw my brothers money at him until he eventually dies as he is already in somewhat poor health ( high blood pressure, daily heavy smoker). What should I say to my dad when I eventually sit down and talk with him about all this?",07Jan2020,1

926,"We started feeding her as a stray when she was young (but not a kitten). She lives outside because my mom is allergic. She was being fed by a few people in the neighborhood I think, but mostly us for sure. When she had kittens, she brought them to us. After a while we moved and brought her with us.

It's been about 10 years since then. A while ago, my sister moved out. She has two cats that live in her house and we tried to have our cat live there too, but after a few weeks-months (I can't remember), she was not happy. She is mostly blind and was having a hard time there.

So now she's back in our backyard, and I think she has an eye infection. We're about to move again and don't know what to do. We're moving in with our grandma, who has a dog who would not be a good fit with her (he's bigger and playful, he would almost definitely hurt her). 

So we can't take her there, my mom is convinced she won't do well in any house (I think if she was in a quiet house without other cats she would do okay). But my mom doesn't want to risk it and have whoever take her to the shelter, where she would not do well.

Now my mom is asking when one of us (me or my brother) can take her to have her put down as if it's a sure thing. I don't know what to do, I feel horrible. Are there options I haven't thought of, or any way I can convince her not to put the cat down? She's only 11 or 12, and she's so sweet.

927,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. And since it's a throwaway I'm just gonna go ahead and be upfront and blunt.

So I frequent the NSFW subreddits pretty regularly and masturbate to the gonewild ones multiple times a week, sometimes every day. Here and there I leave a comment or send a DM, but that's rather rare.

The way I usually proceed is to browse the subreddits for a warm-up, scroll through them and see what's on the menu today. When I see a post that I like, I open the profile of the poster in a different tab and keep browsing other posts. After that is done, I go through the tabs with the profiles and again open the posts that I like in new tabs. Finally I go through the open pictures and finish to one of them.

That's how I did it the other day. But after I was done, post-nut-clarity kicked in and I noticed something familiar in one of the photos I just jerked off to. I went to that girls' profile and started taking closer looks at the photos. Surely I recognized parts of my sister's bedroom and bathroom in the background. Some of them were even taken in her High School washrooms.

I'm very confused and conflicted and I don't know what to do or how to feel. I'm pretty shocked as I wouldn't have expected that from my rather shy, well behaved and modest little sister. On the other hand she mentioned in a number of posts that she's a virgin and wants it to stay that way, so I'm pretty proud of her in that aspect.",07Jan2020,1
928,"It's going to be my 4th year living with this guy and my last. I was living at a house with him and two other guys and moved out of there because of an awful roommate (The irony). Now it's just me and him living at a 2 bedroom apt and the things that bothered me about him before are now tenfold. Like he's extremely dirty, never cleans, leaves messes and doesn't do anything to help the apartment (if let's say the toilet is clogged.. if I didn't take care of it, nothing would ever get done. out of trash bags or dish soap, I need to get it. If I tell him too, he will say ok and just forget) This guy is walking trash. He has food sit months past expiration to the point where maggots grew on the food. I've seen him do his laundry once since we moved here and that's only the first week. Now all these things are annoying but I can kind of live with. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now the thing that bothers me the most is that he has a dog and doesn't take care of her. He works 3rd shift (2-11 pm) and works about an hour away and I work a regular 9-5 shift. I take the dog out when I get home from the gym so about 7:00. If he walks her before he leaves for work, she should be okay just til when I get home but clearly he doesn't. If I didn't take her out, I don't think she would be walked more than 2-3 times a week. This is a black lab/german shepherd mix so not a small dog that could just stay indoors. Like she has gotten use to just going inside that his room smells like dogshit and his bed smells like dog-piss. This guy is so disgusting that I've mentioned it to him that she's been doing on his sheets as if he didn't already know, and he tells me that he's just so exhausted after work he just tries to find a 'dry spot' to lay on. One time he just threw another sheet over the already soiled dirty sheet so the new sheet starts soaking in the dog piss. She needs to go out not only for the bathroom but for her well being. He forgets to fill her water bowl and when her food runs out, he's not getting it right away.. he waits a day or two taking his freakin' time. His excuse? Because he works a lot and is tired. He sometimes works doubles so from 9am-11pm and goes straight to bed and wakes up to do it again probably expecting me to take care of her when he doesn't which I try to do. The thing is I go away on weekends and spend it at my GF's which is 2 hr's away and I don't know how the dog is getting adequate care. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have another friend who loves animals and is willing to take her from him and even pay him. When I brought this idea to him mentioning that and that he lives 10 min away he can visit her whenever he just repeatedly said ""fuck you and your friend, you don't know anything"" me out and ""stay in your lane"" and not worry about the dog. Telling I don't see half the things he does for her and how it's none of my business. But I live there and I have to take care of her since he's so irresponsible. He says he works long shifts and doubles, the problem is work and he's going to move closer so this wouldn't be a problem. He lives at max an hour away... like that's not an excuse. He shouldn't be working doubles either if he has a dog and no-one to take care of her. He says she only pisses/shits in his room which isn't true. The only reason he doesn't notice it out in the living area is that I'm constantly cleaning it up. I really want to call animal abuse services but I still live with him and he would make my living situation hell. I own my own small cat and seriously be afraid he would be resentful and let him out. I wouldn't want her to end up in a bad situation either. I'm livid by his childish and selfish nature. I don't know what to do. I don't know why I thought he would've said yes to giving her away to my friend.. I guess figured it was such a great situation where he could see her whenever and still not have to worry about the responsibilities of taking care of her. But he's just so fucking selfish. He wants her all to himself yet doesn't want to do what's necessary when owning a pet, especially a dog. What should I do...",07Jan2020,1
929,"I need some advice on what to do with my life. To be more specific, with school. I'm in university currently, but I absolutely despise it. I entered university with an open mind, and tried extremely hard but it just went downhill. Pretty much all of my schooling experience has been pretty hard. I ask for help/attend all the classes, but it feels like no matter how hard I try, I still fail. I'm technically in my 4th year, but missing a lot of credits due to failing courses. It has taken a hit to my self esteem and confidence, so I'm just very much depressed.

 Anyways, a week ago, me and a guy  from that group kissed, he used to have a thing with one of the girls I'm ""close"" to like 2 years ago, and she had previously told me that she didn't love him anymore. They never dated, they were never in a relationship.
I told her about what happened and she was pretty upset with me, then she told me that she didn't want me hanging out with her because ""she can't even look at me"".

I'm not really shocked they haven't contacted me, I'm moreso disappointed with the guy and girl who are close friends of mine. Why didn't they ask me about what happened?

Probably a month or a little under at least which I understand is not the longest time, but the night they broke up she went and slept with her ex that she dated before my boyfriend so them getting back together really was out of the question. 

To make this easier I am going to use letters not names. 
 ex girlfriend - EX
her mother- EXMIL
boyfriends mom- MOB

There have been a few incidences so I’m going to start from the top but separate them so I don’t have a huge paragraph because no one wants to read a novel.

1. EX talked trash on me and tried to make the rest of my senior year hell calling me a whore and telling people he cheated on her with me (false information). Eventually, I confronted her and told her if she needed to talk to me she could and I’m always available, and recommended she quit talking bad about me because I had done nothing to her. she claimed she never said anything but I am for sure she did because the person telling me would gain absolutely nothing from me being mad at EX. This seems less terrible than it was, but it did suck being the talk of the school. Thankfully, I’m in college now so if she’s still obsessed with me I don’t know about it. 

2. EX instantly befriended my sister whom she was friends with in third grade. They stopped being friends (not sure why) but as soon as I started dating BF she became friends with my sister and insisted on getting information out of her which my sister supplied because my sister is jealous of me. This is just more information, there’s nothing I can do about this but this is useful later on.

3. EX came to boyfriends baseball games that I attended and would watch him play. At one game she sat by his mom and talked to her the entire time which maybe should not have bothered me but it did. She texted BF after that game and said something along the lines of “I hope I didn’t distract you, I came to watch you play because I promised I would”. 

4. MIL (boyfriend mother) commented on a picture of EX with another of BF’s EX’s and said “I will always love you two and wish the best for you” so on so forth. This bothered me because she knows how badly EX was talking about me, but still felt the need to comment. She is always commenting on one of their posts - I know I need to quit looking. 

5. Ready for my favorite? I was at BF’s sisters game sitting by MIL and she started having a conversation with me.

MIL - Have EX and your sister always been friends? 

ME- sorta, but my sister likes to be friends with people that don’t like me because she thinks her friends choose me over her.

MIL - oh.... not that I have a problem with EX.

ME- yeah, I didn’t either until she was spreading rumors about me saying I was a whore and that BF cheated on her with me.

MIL - Well, EXMIL told me that you two were texting before they broke up. 

So basically, the EX girlfriends mom was talking to BF’s mom about me. I excused myself to the bathroom then left the game which maybe was dramatic but that made me feel like she didn’t like me and that she was talking bad about me.

6. Lastly, MIL tagged me in a post about a gift I gave their family for Christmas that was an ornament with their deceased dog on it. Their dog passed a few months ago and they took it hard so I knew they’d love it. On the post EXMIL comments a GIF of Mickey Mouse that said “merry Christmas”. I don’t really think that was the best post to comment some cheesy picture of Mickey Mouse but I know the only reason she wanted to comment on it was because I was tagged in it.

I just don't know how to continue. I study electrical engineering and last 2 years were just one big mess. I don't know, when it started but i just was going on 110% in school for maybe half a year then i remember just ""snap"" and i can't remember anything to school i can't even keep focus in school i just go to school, sit there sometimes for 12 hours like an empty shell looking into nothingness for the whole time and then come home to family that yells at me, how big of a dissapointment i am and how bad i am at school. Friends are ignoring me just because how unhappy i look all the time.

After i failed that year summer break started. I hoped that i could regain some of my previous energy back but didn't. I was just The example of a failiure in my family in any reunion.

Now i am repeating that failed year and i got those same teachers i had previously and i just can't continue like this. I don't want to lose 4 years already spent in that school and just go somewhere else.

HOWEVER

It’s a month of studying and paid training and then I have to take a test to see if I pass. But if I pass and get my insurance license Im locked in for a year, or If I quit I have to pay them $800 because they paid for the licensing. 

My friend recently offered to put in a word for me at a call center that starts at $14 and then goes to $25 an hour with yearly raises and it sounds like such a great deal to me. But It won’t start until April if I get it.

So this is the thing

I can get my license and be an insurance agent and hate it but be stable, or I can work at the call center and live boujee but have to pay the $800ish to my current job. And I would have to wait 4 months for them to start their training.

I’m guessing my anxiety is somehow caused from all the drugs and everything that comes with it .Constantly short of breath and shakiness whilst breathing out.Shakiness in my hands and constant worrying about nothing.

I havnt told anyone about how I feel , although my mother over the past few years has told me that she thinks I have anxiety but I never payed attention until this past year.

We are painted as a beautiful, rainbow nation. 

Rich with Diversity.

A Democracy.

But in Reality we are no better off than a Communist Regime - And that Scares me. 

It scares me that my only option is to run. 

We get to vote - but a large majority of this country votes out of fear for a Return of Apartheid rather than for a government that actually semi works towards a brighter future. 

The blatant corruption and cover ups within our government. 

The pocket lining to an extreme scale. 

Land grabbing.

And the worst of it all - Eskom.
Our one (1) power supply in the whole country. 

For years now we have been experiencing planned blackouts to alleviate the loss of power we are experiencing due to the gross mismanagement of the plant. 

And we are given the most outlandish excuses each time as to why it isnt the people in powers fault. 

The coal conveyer belt broke. 
No money for upkeep. 
Sabotage.
The latest one - High school seniors school end marks are being released and they need to cut our power for the Results Release. 

This is just a few of the myriad of unbelievable reasons to cover their butts so that they can continue to mismanage and line their pockets. 

We need to shed the load to avoid a complete collapse and a nation wide blackout. 

Every time they implement Load Shedding there is a loss of near R1bn/day. 

We have a schedule that tells us exactly when what are of the city will be without power at any given time when load shedding is implemented. 
They have recently added up to Stage 8 which, in one (1) day will leave a single suburb without power for 15 hours.

To keep the plant going they have borrowed and put themselves into near R600bn debt. 

Debt that us as South Africans are now expected to pay. 

On top of all this gross everything, Eskom also announced that they want R1bn in Performance Bonuses for the work they do. 

They have covered up loss for literally thousands of Kw's of electricity. Saying it has disappeared, but us as a country know it has been sold for the benefit of the people in power. 

One proposed solution was Privatization, but was shot down because, unofficially, how will they line their pockets that way?


We are in a constant fear of a nation wide blackout.

Maybe we need it for the world to take notice of the Trouble we are in.

Why do we need to wait for complete breakdown and complete Anarchy to realize our Problem?

947,"I posted something similar in another sub, but didn't get any responses, so here I am and going to keep it simple/re-word it this time.



My best friend (F) and I (M) have been through a tough time last year. We were both to blame for what happened. We always said we didn't want to lose our friendship though. Well that's exactly what's happening right now. 


I care for her more than I can explain and I know that she still cares for me too, she's just less upfront with these things/shy/reserved whatever you want to call it. She's also very independent and doesn't like receiving advice, but loves to give advice to others. (Even today, she was still shut down to not just me but others, however she did something that really showed that she cares for me deep down)
Well, I'm concerned for her at the moment, she's out of character and something is bothering her. When you know someone as well as I've known her, it's all the small things that show it too.
I suspect it might be related to her bf and that would explain the reason for her not talking about it. (I must add that there is no real proof, just that gut feeling from knowing her so well and the little signs someone that knows her well would notice).



I've been upfront and reminded her that I'm always there for her if she needs anything or wants to just chat and I'll listen as we used to do for each other, however she doesn't like me saying these things anymore as she says she is fine and I'm overreacting. Again, I just know she isn't herself though and it's her independent side putting a barrier up to help.



I gave her space, I took it as a hint and stepped back for a while. It didn't help. She is still the same.



So what little things can I do to show her that I still care and support her subtly? I want to make things easier for her even if she doesn't want to directly tell me what's bothering her. We work together too, so I'm back to seeing her everyday again and I hate seeing her down.",07Jan2020,1

949,"My brother (M27) has been a ticking time bomb for most my life. From a young age he was a trouble maker. He failed his exams at school. He got involved with gangs. He’s had serious anger management issues. My family had him tested when he was younger but the doctors claimed there was nothing wrong with him. As he got older his anger issues got worse. He would hurt his partner (who he has two young daughters with) so she kicked him out. My parents are divorced (they do not get along and constantly argue). My father refused to house him because he has a history of stealing from him, my other brother (M22) and my sister (F26) so he has been living with me (F16), my mother and step-dad. 

He has been living with us for 18 months and has been kicked out multiple times. He has accumulated a debt of £50,000 (estimated). He is unemployed and smokes weed which makes him aggressive and paranoid. Recently, my mother has had enough and kicked him out for good. She has coddled him for long enough. However, he’s been messaging me and guilt tripping me into attempting to convince my mum to let him move back in which she continues to say no (which, admittedly, I agree). 

He has threatened suicide multiple times through the past few years but has never made an actual attempt on his life. He just uses it to scare my family. However, I am worried he might do something. We have told him to go to the council to give him a council flag but he refuses to do it. We’ve told him to go to therapy to sort him behaviour out which he refuses to do. We’ve told him to go to a homeless shelter which he also refuses to do. Some people might think we are being heartless but he is truly a horrible person. He has told me to kill myself multiple times. He has hit his partner and my mum. He steals from us. But he’s still my brother and I love him. I can’t help but feel sorry for him. I seriously don’t know what to do. 

We have contacted the police multiple times but they’ve told us that there is nothing they can do for him as they have offered him help but he refuses to take it. They can’t force him to do anything because he is an adult.

951,"Hi guys! First of all, thanks for reading this. In October, I started a new job, teaching in a school which I had reservations about from the start of the application process (I basically felt pressured from other people that I had to apply, both family and colleagues). This was to be my second year teaching and my second teaching job. Anxiety was building up in the run up to starting, and exploded in such a way that I only lasted three days before having to leave. It wasn’t traumatic in comparison to a lot of things on here, but they were a few days I have really struggled with going over and over in my head since then, and has taken me a long time to come to terms with. Since then, I have been subbing in two schools that I have worked in previously and am therefore comfortable with, but only been offered between 4-6 days of subbing a month. I’m a bit worried about how comfortable I am with this. I’m 23, living with my parents, and have no real pressing financial responsibilities, so I’ve been letting myself get a bit “lazy” with this amount of work. 

I’ve been attending counselling (I’ve been very up and down, thought I was feeling really good recently and then have had a very down night) and set the goal of letting other schools I’m less familiar with know that I’m available for subbing, in the new year, but I’m yet to do it. I have subbed in about three weeks because of the holidays and I’ve been having thoughts of whether teaching is for me or not. I’ve been hearing of other people in jobs and thinking they sound appealing. This time last year, I couldn’t imagine doing anything other than teaching, but recently I’ve been thinking that it feels like a prison sentence with the amount of workload involved. But I’m worried I’m letting anxiety drive my thoughts, and I’m blowing things out of proportion because I haven’t been in a proper teaching environment in a while. 

Basically, has anyone else been in a similar situation that they could give advice on this? As someone objective, does it sound like this is just anxiety fucking with me?

Everyone at work loved her because she always gossiped and always had something horrible to say behind peoples back, ESPECIALLY ME. She started to tell people that I tried getting her dad fired. I worked with her dad one day (both busboys at the time) and I never noticed him in the restaurant. He was at the local Macy's for two hours talking to his wife and friends. This happened often... then I told the owners sister that I couldn't find him. She then realized that he wasn't around. She talked to me and then everyone thought I was trying to fire but that's not the case. I'm not gonna bust my ass off and making the same money as him when he's not doing shit. There was a time before when I went to a coworker gathering and got drunk (only us young coworkers), we all had drank a lot and next thing you I sit on the couch for a second and I ended falling asleep. They all took pictures of me and sent them to everyone at work. They even sent them to my dad. After that everyone at work was bullying me all the time for the next two years. My dad worked there and so did the girls dad. I would talk to my dad about it and he would just tell me to grow up and suck it up but it went that easy. He told me to man up. He doesn't understand cause he's from third world village where you have to fight al the time. He never listened to me and I felt like no one would hear me out. Not even my mom. My dad wouldn't let me quit cause he'd say id embarrass him. I was so depressed at the time I wanted to just die or hide away for the rest if my life in my room. I would spend my days sleeping because I didn't want to face reality and just escape it somehow. Also just get high as shit to feel numb (weed). 2 year later I confronted her and the others who would bully me and told them how fucked up they would make me feel. I was tired of it, I couldn't take it no more. Every time I would turn around they would just look at me and laugh. It was hard. I couldn't sleep, I couldn't even be out cause all I would think about was work the next day.

Then, once I told them they made me look like the bad guy and they started crying and told everyone how I made them cry and how they were only girls and I'm a man. Even my coworkers who my homies turned on me, The boss, everyone. Finally, I just quit even though my dad was pissed. I called the boss and said ""I'm quitting, I'm can't take it anymore. bye.""

One year later, everyone who bullied me (12 people to be exact) had quit because they felt guilty and realized what they had done. The most fucked up part is that the two girls who were the instigators and bullied me got karma really bad cause someone important to her got a sickenss and the other one got a sickness herself. Few months later I went back to the job and I loved it cause everyone was gone. My dad understood finally and apologized to me.

Now two years later everything is awesome but the only problem is that girl might come back because the boss found out about her family member and might get her to return and feels bad for her. it sucks because life was just going great. Im going to quit if she's comes back I already spoke to my parents and they understand. But the thing is I don't want to quit. I explained to my boss the whole situation. Were in good terms now, she's like a friend I guess in a way.

My girlfriend was supposed to start her period about 6 days ago and it still hasn't come yet. My girlfriend and I also only had sex once since her last period because we've been away from each other during the winter break. During sex i pulled out before I came and it was clear i didn't cum in her,but it wasn't until she wasn't getting her period that we began to get nervous. We were extremely confused why her period is late because we knew I didn't cum in her. I began to research and people were talking about precum having sperm in it. So yesterday morning which was 5 days after missing the expected date of her period, my girlfriend bought a pregnancy test. It came out negative which was a relief, but she still has not had her period and it is coming to the end of the 6th day after expecting.

Have we taken the pregnancy test too early to get the correct accuracy?  Also, am I overthinking this?

I was forced to play piano, not for fun, but for three rigorous exams. Since my cousin completed the hardest exam, my family expects me to do the same. Along with that, I have weekend classes to learn Chinese language and culture, but the constant pressure to work on it as much as piano and my school life has caused me to be unfocused while trying to learn.

Between this, I constantly go to doctors and this forces me to do more work into shorter amounts of time. My parents insist that since it was managable before, it should be easier now that I'm more mature, but it isn't. The standard keeps getting higher and they keep saying that if I don't succeed, then all they did was a waste.

I've had to give up almost all my hobbies and free time to accomplish what they expect and I really feel helpless.

964,"Hey Reddit! I’m using throwaway account because I don’t want others at my high school seeing this and tracing it back to me. I’m a senior at a small high school, and would consider myself semi-popular. I’m friends with the majority of my class, yet I’m not the “top of the food chain”, so to speak. 

Anyway, I, however, am probably the smartest kid in my class. 35 on the ACT, captain of my scholars bowl team, already 30 college credit hours, full-ride academic scholarship, and I tutor a lot of kids through their classes, helping them pass. A lot of my friends have thanked me and joked that they wouldn’t pass high school without me. A common thing you’ll see it people asking me for answers on tests (the teachers at my school are very lax on this stuff for some reason). It’s important to note that I don’t do this for recognition or “clout”, I do it because they’re my friends, and I want them to succeed. I’m sorry if it sounds like I’m bragging or anything, it’s just somewhat necessary information for my problem.

Also, something very very important to note, and the reason why I’m making this post in the first place, I’ve been diagnosed with moderate generalized anxiety disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. By this point in my life, I’ve learned to control my anxieties and compulsions to a point where everyday things don’t bother me near as much as they used to. But today made them come rushing back.

Today, we were voting for senior superlatives. I thought I was a shoo-in for “Most Likely to Succeed”, hence the information above. After voting, I had found out that I got 5th out of 20. The girl who had won, I had tutored through physics and statistics, and basically took her finals for her, as I had a massive crush on her. Well, needless to say, I was heartbroken. I felt snake-bitten to put it best. The only high-profile title that I thought I had in the bag was swiped out from under me. I’m not vindictive about this loss, more just disappointed.

I know the top comment will be, “Dude calm down, it’s just some dumb title that will be forgotten in a few month, relax.” I get and understand that. Trust me, I do.  It’s just that I need that validation that other people recognize my accomplishments because of my mental conditions. I need someone to just hear me out and understand that this is a lot more to me than a dumb title. If you think I’m just being selfish, I get that too.

965,"Hello, Reddit. For two years, I dreamed of moving to Japan to live and study there with the goal of eventually working in the country. After one semester, I packed my bags and moved back. I have not been able to stop thinking of the life I had there. I feel like many of the problems I had with living there were just what life as an adult is like, such as not seeing friends all the time or living alone or days being spent simply working. I have been avoiding Japanese things in an effort to try and clear my head but I went to a Japanese market today and spoke in Japanese for the first time in weeks and I got ""homesick."" What do I do? Should I reapply to the college in Japan I just left? Do I stay in the U.S. and get over it? I don't know what to do. It feels weird in my own hometown. I feel like this whole ordeal has given me a bit of anxiety. If you have any questions, please ask. I need advice. Thank you.

966,"My girlfriend has been suffering from severe depression for the past couple of years. Only recently, her family has discovered it. I am super worried about her. As of right now, she has lost interest in everything. She says she doesn't feel anything. She has told me about her parents having a large influence on her stress and depression. She only feels like she is doing things because her parents want her to and not for herself or her future. 

She does have a therapist, but it doesn't seem to be working out. She convinced her therapist that she isn't suicidal however, she still is. I talked to my school counselor three times already and nothing has seemed to improve. He recommended to her parents that she take antidepressants, and even my girlfriend agrees that could be one of the only things to help her however, her parents declined due to family history in depression. They thought it would make it worse. Her mom offered the idea of family counseling, but it was later put off. She is also afraid of her dad. There was an instance where she fell asleep with her laptop on and her dad walked in the room and started yelling at her and slammed the laptop on the bedframe. The next day he acted like everything was normal. All aspects of her life are controlled by her mother specifically, which makes her feel like she has no control over anything she does. I believe she wants to be free of their control. She is also very stressed about school and her parents keep pushing her to do school work. She gets very stressed about her school work and gets overwhelmed with homework. Over the last couple of months, she has gotten very suicidal and I witnessed her cutting her wrists. She eventually stopped cutting, but a couple of weeks ago, she tried drowning herself in a bucket. It's gotten even worse recently. 

I'm very worried about her and want to help her. Do you guys have any advice for this situation?",07Jan2020,1
967,"Hey guys! This is the first time posting on this subreddit page, but I have a few questions regarding language discrimination at the workplace, especially in New Jersey. My mom has a problem continually occurring at the workplace which is affecting her greatly. Right now, my mom works in an office job at a company where a majority of the employees speak a secondary language besides English. Anyways, there is one particular employee, the quality control clerk, who is ignorant and hateful towards those who speak another language besides English, specifically Polish. I understand that some business places use the ""English-Only"" Policy to ensure that English is spoken when necessary in the workplace, but the extent of this policy at my mom's workplace is violating. Both my mom and her fellow co-workers are afraid to casually converse with each other in fear of the clerk rushing in to verbally retaliate by saying something hateful due to their national origin. In one instance, the clerk threatened my mom to speak English to a customer who was not fluent in it. All in all, the multilingual employees are treated rudely and forced to only speak English, even during breaks. And it's not only the clerk who is behaving this way, there are three other co-workers who act the same. My mom wants to do something about but isn't sure who to speak to or what to do? What is/are the legal approach(es) she can take to confront this constant issue of language/national origin discrimination? Should she bring this to human resources and what should she bring up?",07Jan2020,1

970,"I barely see her maybe every three years as it is. Me and my other sisters are now having to pay money out of our pockets for my father's medical issues but this one sister refuses to pay, claiming she doesn't have the money (she does)- yet she just went to Texas to visit a friend and she drives a very expensive car. In reality, she doesn't want to spend money she could be spending on booze and other stuff for herself, she's very selfish.

That said, I am considering not inviting her to my wedding because we are having a very small and short wedding with a reception after - no speeches. We are making it clear, no speeches.

However this sister get drunk and will end up dancing on a table at some point (which she did at my other sisters wedding), which we don't want and she'll do the ""I don't care, I don't care, I want to say something"" and will try to do a speech because it's all about her.

979,"I will preface this by saying- If I need to elaborate further on the actions and behaviors this person has engaged in, I will. Otherwise, please believe me when I say that I am a very reasonable person, and conduct myself in a polite while moving through the world (For fear of confrontation, honestly, and then also bc it's the right thing to do yadda yadda)

My parents have an awful neighbor. They live in the US, specifically in Maine. This neighbor has made actual threats against my friends at points in time, he has threatened our other neighbors' (On the other side of his house) teenage child and his friends. The outside of his house is absolutely atrocious (Which, I'm not bothered by it but others are, and to their credit the city government did actually post a notice on his door after complaints and he did have his lawn mowed regularly after that point, at least). He has a girlfriend, or she may be his wife, and the only time we see her outside is walking to her car/to the front door from her car, before and after work. I know it seems dramatic, but because of a past event we are aware of with him, everybody on the street is entirely under the impression that this ""girlfriend"" is actually being held against her will (Again, I can elaborate about the previous event but for the sake of time, I'll leave it at that for now). In addition to all of this (And this is my main concern) he has three full grown German Shepherds. Which, the only time they are given exercise is when he slides open his back door, they sprint out into his (Relatively small) backyard, and they are out for about 15 mins tops. This happens maybe two times a day. Usually, they are brought back in because they are going NUTS in the backyard in response to something. What's scary is I have been in my parents' backyard when they are out, and I have seen them jumping against the fence, and I have seen the fence wriggling a bit. Now, my parents are not the kind of people that can go out and get a steel fence or something, so I am terrified that one day they will be out there (Or God forbid, even just our little Bichon) and these three beasts will come crashing through the fence, and tear everybody to pieces in their path. It's not entirely impossible for a situation like that to happen, somebody inside my parents' house hears the commotion, opens the back door to the backyard, and then the dogs at that point are rushing into the house as well. That last bit is a bit much, but you see what I'm saying? Oh and as a final, final note- Again, I can elaborate, but we are under the impression that he has a firearm ""collection"" in the house, also. I know that makes it seem like I'm trying to pile it on, but short of seeing the collection myself, we all believe this to be the case. 

So, any advice on how to deal with this person? As in, how to get some police in that house to see 1. The deplorable condition I am sure it is in, it probably should be condemned, and 2. Whether or not this poor woman is being held captive? That's really what I want- Something like a wellness check or something? Something that will force his hand a bit, and that puts this situation into the hands of people who have the sanctioned use of force in their tool belt. Or, I suppose if that is out of the question, how to deal with the dogs? It's not an option for my parents to not use their backyard, and the fence is not dilapidated, it's just a wooden fence though and it's not going to be able to, in the long term, support the weight of three full grown jumping, excited, Shepherds.  

The police have been notified before when he made threats against my neighbors teenage son, but it was essentially hearsay and I'm sure it only served to fuel this guys fire that they had the balls to call the cops on him.",07Jan2020,1

985,"PREFACE:  My moms kinda shitty. When me and my two older sisters were younger she’d leave the oldest to care for us (I was in diapers, oldest maybe 10) while she was out cheating on my father. She married the man she cheated with, had another kid, (my youngest sister). Growing up from 13-19 I was in an abusive relationship that she knew about and allowed where I was almost killed twice, hospitalized, she would pick me up from school when he’d smash my head into desks. She did nothing. I basically ended up living with him. Younger sister roamed the streets at a young age until midnight. Mother was locked in her room drinking, sad, and cheating on my then step dad with his coworker. 

Fast forward she’s with a new man. He has a drinking problem and drinks wine when he’s driving. I scream at her for allowing him to drive my youngest sister to school like that. His daughter moves in. She’s a literal piece of trash and bad role model. We all get in a huge fight where I’m defending mom and my sister and I get kicked out. Now I have to dig out how to support myself.  Me and oldest sisters cut ties with mother. Mother uses youngest sibling as a scapegoat lures us back in. Other oldest still refuses to talk to her for unknown reasons; she probably did something to her too. Youngest sister getting involved with kid who’s abusive, having problems in school that the school doesn’t address when it should have . After all the family badgering at her and me mostly for allowing her to repeat what happened to me when I was younger it’s decided that she moves to Texas to be with her dad to get away. Mom brings her back a year later. We badger her about getting my sister back in school; a different school. She avoids it. Ends up she’s having her just get her GED now instead of her diploma. Would only take 1 more year for her to get her degree. 


Lashed out on her today for not caring about my sister. Not caring about her future. For never encouraging us or her like she should have. Told her I wasn’t going to speak to her again. Told her she’s never cared, setting my sister up for failure. More concerned about being a friend than an actual parent. What is wrong with her. Blocked her. She told me I had some nerve.

Youngest sister messages me calls me a bully and all I do is hurt mom. Says shouldn’t lash out bc I don’t agree with her decisions. I tell her she’ll understand when she’s older. Moms decisions led me to getting raped and beaten at a young age. Moms never had our best interest and is lazy. If she was a parent she’d protect you and do everything she can to set you up for success. It’s not that hard to enroll u in school? Blah blah blah. 

Told her I’d always be there for her. She’s more than what a GED is worth and she’s brilliant. Talk to other sisters when your older. She’s mad at me now but if she ever needs anything I’m here and love her.

Sisters understand where I’m coming from and are pissed at mom. Also they expected it. Grandparents and other family pull the she’s your only mom and she’ll always love you and is the only one you’ll have.

988,"My boyfriend (20) and I (F21) have been dating for 1 month, but have known each other for 1 yr prior as friends. Since we've been dating he has been very upfront and honest with me about everything. For example, he had a fuck buddy who he used to be with before we got together and he told her that he would not be seeing her because he is trying to build on our relationship. He even told me when she asked him to come over to have sex with her and he told her ""no"". He has also told me that he may have unintentionally flirted with someone, but he asked me if I was uncomfortable with it and to tell him if he does anything thing wrong so we can work it out. Furthermore, i have opened up to him about my trust issues and fears of being cheated on.

He has told me on numerous occasions that he will not cheat on me and is very big on communication before making the decision to leave a relationship. He has also come from other relationships that we're as healthy and communicative as ours is. He also told his friends that he really likes me and enjoys the fact that our relationship is healthy and affectionate.

He has also told me that I make him extremely happy and he would not want to fuck up what we have going on, the health of our relationship is a good change for both of us. He has also gone from a very emotionally distant friend to an affectionate man, who compliments me all the time, gives me attention, affection, and reassures me all the time, and is also very honest.

I just need assistance with my insecurity. I am constantly insecure and scared that he will cheat on me. for instance, if he tells me he didn't go to a family dinner i automatically assume that he is doing something sketchy, but he hasn't given me a reason to think that he isn't being truthful. I try not to bring these anxieties and fears into our relationship because i don't want to ruin what we have, but the anxiety is very irritating and annoying, it disturbs my sleep and my ability to concentrate on other things. I trust this man with my life and love his honesty and I believe what he tells me...

So do any of you have any way to combat this? Because I am now irritated with myself. He's literally doing everything right.",07Jan2020,1
989,"I (25M) have a friend (22F) who recently broke up with her boyfriend. She loved this guy very much, but had to let go because he cheated on her, and also, her family wasn't comfortable with a douchebag being around her daughter, so she finally took the decision to end the relationship, eventhough she still wanted to be with him.

She says that he made the mistake of cheating but redeemed himself, he was good to her, he pretty much (as far as she says) became a whole new good guy, but I personally have my doubts.

Anyways, she's been struggling 2 months with how to get over him, she has nightmares about the guy, whenever we hang out most of the time she talks about the guy, whenever we try to watch a movie or a tv show together she starts crying because of the guy and well, it's not that I don't want to be supportive, the problem is that I don't know how.

I've told her that she must not stalk him on social media nor trying to send him a message or anything (she talks alot of thinking of doing that) and whenever I tell her that she gets all defensive in a sense like ""I know what I should and I shouldn't do, cut me some slack, nobody gets what I'm going through, y'all so insensitive, you wouldn't get it, I'm more on the emotional side while y'all more on the rational side!"".

Also, whenever I try NOT to say anything, because I want to avoid conflict and I'm just listening to her, I feel as if she might feel that I do not care about how she's feeling, I do, I really do and I want to see her okay, but I'm too blunt, so whenever I say something along the lines like ""The guy didn't deserve you, you didn't do anything wrong, and you'll get through this"" I get a reply saying ""No, he was actually pretty nice, you don't know what you're talking about!"". Maybe she's right, maybe she's just making up excuses for being so hurt about such a douchebag, I do not know, and It's not my place to judge. (I apologize if this last thing sounded too harsh, but I hate cheaters, and whenever I remember how she cried her eyes out whenever he cheated it just makes me wanna punch the guy...)

So I don't know how to be there for her, I can't say anything (maybe I'm too blunt? I don't know...), but if I don't say anything I feel that she might think I don't care. I've heard that just being there for them should be enough, such as getting them out for a meal, or watching a movie or just hanging out, but whenever we try something along those lines the guy comes up so I end up stuck in the same situation in which either I say something and get her all pissed, or I end up quiet while she sobs then stays quiet also and we have an awkward silence.

Concerned, I look at the tab and it’s some website instructing someone how to make a helium suicide gas mask thing. I immediately went to history and it had been cleared earlier that day. Can’t be sure how long ago the tab was saved, but it was among many. It was the only tab relating to anything serious.

I’m not one to snoop through her personal stiff. In fact, I asked her before unlocking her laptop to use it. I know the password, but I respect her privacy. A part of me is conflicted. I don’t want to question her on her personal online activity that she clearly wouldn’t have wanted me to see, but it was out in the open. I saw it, and it’s serious if she was seriously looking that up.

She’s taken anxiety medication from before we met, but she’s never mentioned anti depressants, or does she seem particularly depressed or manic. Though she does have emotional stints, that I always assumed are hormonal. 

Perhaps she’s fighting some sort of hidden battle. I don’t know. I just don’t know how to bring it up with her. I feel like, even if she is depressed, she would just slough it off and say it was benign when it isn’t. I mean, why else would she search that?

I almost want to hold an intervention, but that would be too extreme. I just need to get it through to her some how that I would like her to see a mental health professional about it. But I also don’t want her to feel like I invaded her privacy, which I kind of did.",07Jan2020,1

996,"I’m sorry this might seem selfish or foolish even as I’m just a teen, but school feels terrible. I never felt this way before, as I get decent grades and have friends but this year feels very bad. Firstly our day consists of 11-12 hours with commute, so 9-10 at school and 2 on bus, 1 there 1 back. We have 8 classes (plus after school activity on Tuesday and Thursday) of which I enjoy only two, others being very boring and imo useless to me (mandatory but I’m uninterested ). I have friends and don’t feel bullied at all. At school, I feel a sort of permanent exhaustion, like I am lightheaded and fatigued mentally and physically. I don’t bother to listen in class but our school is super easy so I get good grades anyway. The only way I deal with the fatigue is music and other attempts to zone out to make time fly by faster. The teachers are fine, especially since I’m doing okay in classes, but some are terribly boring. I wake up at 6:40 to catch the bus at 7:15 near my house. I return at 6:20-40 on the extra activity days and at 5:10 in the short days. 

I have a bunch of hobbies such as piano guitar drawing animation and games, but I don’t feel engaged at school as the subjects are mandatory but simply irrelevant to me. I want to further pursue the hobbies but since I’m “good at math” my parents want me to do other things, though I consider computer science as that’s pretty interesting. During school though, I can’t practice much at home as I get home at around 5-6:30 and need to go to bed around 10 to get 8 hours of sleep. I feel like that isn’t enough time for homework and the hobbies. 

If I try to speak to my parents, it turns into an arguement and they generally respond in a mocking demoralizing tone to poke fun at what I think is a major problem in my life. I feel like I’m wasting time at school and the hours at school are just crossed out of my life without anything. I don’t learn anything as the subjects are brain dead and irrelevant.

It's not immediate family and I know if nothings written down she would go to my father in law which we both dont want to happen or my mother who isnt fit enough to raise a child.

998,"So a friend of a friend beat up my younger brother I’m 14f and my brothers 11 or 10 or 12 I don’t remember but if ur in England he’s in y7. I reckon the friend of a friend hates himself so much for existing cos he knew what he did was wrong like he’s not a big kid he’s literally so bloody weak, but my brother is still younger. My advice I need it do I shame him in front of his friends(I’m stronger than him so if he asks for a fight I can beat him up to a point where he loses memory if it comes to it)  or do I start a fight and obviously win and just make sure he never tries to beat anyone up again.?

Also if u see this let’s say his name is josh, I will beat the shit out of u I pretended not to care so you’d slip up, no one would care abt it they’d probably give me an award

1000,"One of my big goals this year is to start liking myself more, and to also start sticking up for myself instead of always being a complete pushover.

I started doing this late last year, but I feel like I'm not going about it the right way. I think my biggest problem is that I take people's criticisms about me too seriously sometimes, and other times I can't take jokes about myself too well.

For example, the other night I got really upset with my friends because I apparently smelled and didnt realize it. They weren't super tactful when telling me but it wasn't super malicious. I didn't shower that morning because I had work early that day and didn't have enough time, but I had showered the previous morning. It upset me a lot, and it bothers me that something like that upset me a lot.

Another example, my friends constantly make jokes about me and I just don't like them. They tend to make these jokes more about me than the other people in my friend group, but they apparently do this because I'm ""the only one they can joke about this with without being incredibly offended"". Although the times that I did bring up to them about going to far, they flipped out at me for ""not being able to take a joke"".

How do I start training myself to take jokes made about myself without feeling offended? How do I start liking myself without being an ass to people about what they say to me?",07Jan2020,1
1001,So I have never penetrated her but we have both been naked together before on two occasions. The first I fingered her and then she (with pants back on) sucked me and I came. I wiped off all the cum with a napkin and then fingered her again (not very deep might I add). Is it possible there was some residual cum on my fingers that could have gotten in? The second occasion was about a week later. I fingered her (possibly with precum on fingers) and then masturbated and came. She was naked but I don’t think any cum was near her vagina. A week later her period was due but it was 3 days late and she said it was shorter than usual. Could this have been “implantation bleeding”? Is it likely that she is pregnant? When would be the time to take a pregnancy test (as in when would it give an accurate result)? I’m freaking out about my life basically coming to an end.,07Jan2020,1
1002,"Long Context...

I was ""friends"" with these two girls for eight years. I'll call them Sally and Claire. Sally mentally and emotionally abused me all throughout part of middle school and high school. She would partially cease the torment when Claire was around but still made me the butt of all the jokes. Claire was a lot nicer to me but when I told her about what Sally was doing and that it upset me and I was considering reporting her but she didn't believe me, and said I was being dramatic and that I need to take a joke. She was always closer to Sally.

Sally made my life a misery. My mental health hasn't been the same since. She spread rumours about me, tried to blame me for things she did, humiliated and bullied me, etc..... Claire always forgave her, passed it off or had an excuse for her. But that's besides the point.

After high school, the three of us went to separate colleges. I remained in occasional contact with both. After meeting new friends, I realised what Sally did was not right. Sorry, I didn't have much friends growing up so I didn't understand what was a healthy friendship. One night, Sally called me on my phone and berated me again, accusing me of lying about how good college was and insinuating that I was a soon-to-be dropout with no friends. I finally got my act together, hung up and stopped answering any messages or calls from her.

However, I remained in contact with Claire as I figured that now she was in another college, she'd be more neutral and besides, she was my friend who was still kind to me and she hadn't done anything wrong.

But after a month of not answering Sally's messages or voicemails (not that she was apologizing), Claire started to act weird. Her calls and texts became less frequent and when she did contact me, it seemed to be only for wanting to know what was i doing and planning to do and when I asked about her, or answered her questions, she'd excuse herself or not answer altogether. I gave her the benefit of the doubt but I'd a bad feeling. She would only respond to some of my messages. Okay, maybe she's just busy. Maybe we were drifting apart anyways.

Then, in September 2019, Sally transferred to my college. She tried getting in contact with me again after nearly a year and of course, after realising how good life was without her, I ignored her.

Then it happened. 

Claire had stopped calling me months beforehand but would send the occasional message. But after Sally transferred, she messaged me soo much more. And these messages were... a bit off. They were phrased like she was trying to get me to confess something scandalous like, ""My brother (same college as me, in a different department on the other side of campus,) saw you with a boy."" and ""Did you have trouble with any of your exams?"" They seem normal but they weren't the typical messages she sent. They weren't as caring.

Maybe I'm paranoid. I dunno. But her brother is definitely not the one who saw me on campus. It was Sally.

I saw Claire a couple of times in public also and she'd either wave or a few times, she saw me with other people and started texting on her phone rather frantically and never approached me. 

During Christmas eve, I had an epiphany after she sent me another message, asking ""when are you back to college? when are you getting your results?"" not happy Christmas, how're you, or anything. Then I saw a pic of them two together put up that same time, at a sleepover, I realized, or came to the conclusion, that she was more than likely messaging me on Sally's behalf for gossip, and maybe to slander me.

Due to this, I'm considering cutting off Claire too. I plan to just stop responding and if i get any abusive messages, I just blocked them. I just don't see her as a friend anymore... Am I paranoid?

I feel guilty doing this but I'm also worried that if I stop responding, Sally will actively seek me out, and try to make my life difficult. I feel like I'm walking on eggshells. My friend said to maybe just give her the odd message to maybe boast about an achievement and another said to message her a bunch of lies.

1003,"Hey, internet. 

Every couple years I seem to shed another emotional layer (getting closer to total enlightenment and purity, right? Haha). Well along with that often comes realizations about how I could have handled myself better and that often leads to me reaching out to apologize for my mistake/s. 

Well, I’m shedding a layer and I know I have to apologize to someone. The thing is that my behaviour was a symptom of childhood traumas and I want to apologize fully to this person and accept my behaviour fully but I keep wanting to flag “but wait, poor me because I was traumatized. Please cut me slack!” 

How can I apologize gracefully while communicating effectively and honouring my past hurts. This one ain’t feeling so straight forward (because I’m not quite there I guess but fake it until you make it).

I had initially gone back to school to be an elementary teacher,and after two semesters of taking elementary education courses I felt like it wasn't for me. So then the semester after that I went ahead and I finished my general courses, so then last semster I decided to take some social work classes and see if I want to go that route but I quickly realized it wasnt for me either. So now I  decided to give it one last shot and try a different major this semster. This is the first week back of school and I'm not motivated whatsoever and  I want to call it quits. I'm currently 23 turning 24 next month and I feel by now I should have figured out what I should do with my life.

The end of last year was rough. My mom went to jail, I have sick a few time and I didn’t have enough PTO. I was up to 10 absences. I feel so utterly shitty about myself because I work from home so I seriously have no excuse to miss work but I’m a lazy piece of shit I guess.

1015,"Throwaway account, lots of personal info. Dunno if he has reddit so 🤷‍♂️ This is long, i'm sorry. It's a complicated situation...

My boyfriend and I have been dating long distance for 1.5 years, I love him deeply, i've seen him about six or seven times since we started dating. He has severe (and I mean fucking severe.) mental health issues including BPD, OCD, PTSD, Schizophrenia, probably others I can't remember... Plus chronic illness, but that's not important.

I have my own issues, including ADHD, MDD, GAD, DPD (dependent personality disorder: causes me to attach myself to people and depend on them and deeply fearing being left alone and taking care of myself. People with DPD tend to attach themselves to one or two specific people. Mine is my boyfriend, no surprise. I'm learning to manage it but I struggle a lot) and my own chronic illnesses. A match made in heaven (note the sarcasm, lol. Our issues clash A LOT)

Now for the grand problem:

His symptoms get so much worse right after visiting me/me visiting him. I don't know if it's me, or the change of routine, whatever, but for whatever reason, he can't handle it. One time he got back into drugs for a month after seeing me before he was able to quit again. Just this last time he relapsed into alcohol. I fear so much more for his safety after a visit than I do when it's been a month or two since seeing him. 

I don't know whether he just doesn't notice or whether he doesn't care (unfortunately, it's very like him to stay in a situation that's unhealthy for him. It's common for people with BPD unfortunately) It's not like i'm abusive (or if I am I genuinely do not know what I am doing) or like he DOESNT want to see me. I'm not forcing him to do anything. 

I don't know what to do. He tends to withdraw from me right after seeing me which severely triggers my DPD, but I know he can't help it. I feel like we're just triggering each other's issues over and over again, with no end.

My main issue is that I feel like i'm not good for him. Right after a trip with me he ends up not being able to get out of bed most days.

I really don't want to break up with him because that would absolutely destroy me because of my DPD.

TL:DR: My long-distance boyfriend has severe mental health issues that get worse right after seeing me. This has caused relapses in drugs and alcohol in the past. I'm not abusive, or if I am I genuinely do not know what i'm doing.

Should I bring up the possibility that i'm not good for him, or is that his job to notice and decide?",07Jan2020,1
1016,"Good Evening everyone! So my best friend and I. She lives across the country (I’m in the mid-south and she is closer to the western part of the US). We text/talk all day every day (not an exaggeration). I love it, &amp; as does she. We talk about anything and everything and it’s just nice to have someone close to you who isn’t a family member who loves you unconditionally. I love and appreciate her so much. However, I noticed within the last maybe 3 or so much that I’ve become too dependent and attached to her. Examples include: 1. getting peeved when she doesn’t answer a question a certain way; 2. asking about me and I give her all the details, but when I ask her the same she’s extremely short 3. waiting to hear from her throughout the day and letting what she says or does affect my day 4. Getting oddly jealous of her a few times over the most random things. 
So in an effort to not be a toxic person and also to take some time to myself and examine why and how I act this way, I decided to create some distance. Specifically just text maybe once or twice a day. I politely explained to her this morning that I love her and am thankful for her, but I feel I’ve become too attached and I feel as though I am bothersome when we talk lately so I  prefer to take a step back.

A) I'm a trans man, it's not a big deal but  it can cause issues. It has caused me to not get jobs in the past. Also because my legal name hasn’t been changed yet, it also leads me to having to be picky about WHERE I apply.

I’m gonna need you to tell me what around it because I will not bloody see it.  If however something catches me attention, I’m on it.

\-I hyper focus on something and not at all on others. This probably also ties into the whole time issue too. If I’m focused everything around me is gone, not completely but I lose the flow of things that are not what I’m doing.

\- I lose stuff. I know that seems like an obvious thing, but it still needs to be stated.  Unless I can get myself trained into a pattern or can make things stand out, I can lose stuff  that was literally in my hand a second ago and I have not moved. It’s almost a magic power at this point in my life. 

\-What feels like a good day to me, where I feel like I'm on task and on point all day...isn't always that. I DO have good days, great days sometimes! But I can't always tell the difference.

\-I have worked many jobs, and due to some of the issues I have listed above I have either been forced to leave ( literally I had a job PAY ME to quit) or have been forcibly fired, so I’m a little sensitive about being coached. It's not because I think that I don’t make mistakes, rather it's an instant knee jerk reaction. I’m used to one small problem snowballing into me losing my job so..yeah I’m defensive sometimes.  I’m working on it, and I’ve gotten better, but if I’m spooked, I’m gonna react. 

\-Also do to these issues I tend to be the person that people take their frustrations out on. I am used to being yelled out, being told by managers that  'this job may not be for me' , being dismissed when I bring up the issues I mentioned before. I’m used to being told I'm not fast enough, that I’m not good at what I’m doing, or that I don't know what I'm doing. I have been straight up called an idiot in front of customers before in prior jobs because I take a moment longer than 'I should'. I had an old co-worker literally ask me if I knew how to read because she mis-marked a cup on a drink I was making. 

\- Due to the above, my self-confidence is shit. I ask alot of questions because I want to be SURE that I'm not fucking something up because I might have blanked out at some point, or forgotten something important. I know this can annoy my co-workers and I take notes when I can! ( but then I forget the damned notebook at home) And with the position I'm currently in if I mess up something, it can cost the company A LOT of money.  I want to be sure I'm doing things right.

D) I am aware this makes me sounds like a bag of snakes, but I give my job everything I can, everyday I'm there. I arrive on time and don't leave early, I don't call out. I like a challenge and one is given to me I put everything I have into it! I like working with people! If I have a job that gives me that and people that will work with me I am a hard fucking worker and do not falter. The best day I would have is one that makes me have to think to solve problems and fixing people's problems on top of that?! I ENJOY my job, hell love my job! 

Okay so with all of that out of the way, let’s get down to the actual situation. So I started with GS in...September I think it is. I had been working a shitty little dish washing gig before this and honestly hated it with a passion. I have a few ARA friends and one of them mentioned I should try for CA at one of of my local stores. So I did, got the job, and promptly quit the shit fest that was the dishwashing job without a glance back. 

Training was a thing, the BBY training was ...eh, the Apple training was interesting. I'm not really a big Apple guy so learning all of that was a lot but was also really fun! Shadowing was also really interesting, I got to meet my coworkers and got to see how things REALLY worked. Not gonna lie I was nervous my first 2 weeks, even more so when I started taking my own cliented.  But I felt like I was doing good! After my first month I knew I loved the job.  

However even then things were not perfect. Considering that I work in a very busy location, breaks are sometimes questionable. Which for me I've always used breaks to reset my head. I'm also a smoker ( very common in  the adhd world I have learned.) and I've found that after a smoke I come back a little more focus and clear headed. I also may have rubbed some of my coworkers the wrong way, I can't say that for sure, but were getting to that point. 

So mid november I get pulled into the conference room and my senior agent and GS manger are there. Both are rather stoney faced. Cue me starting to silently freak the fuck out. I have no idea what's going on, to me yeah things were a little rocky the few weeks I was on my own but by this point everything is fine, or so I thought. I was quickly corrected.  For the next 30 minutes ( or what feels like it, again time isn't my best subject here ) I am chewed apart. I am called selfish because of my need to take breaks ( yes I was timing them wrong newbie mistake but at that point I didn't know how to read Nova), I am told that my co-workers think I’m overly defensive and or aggressive, that I take too long with clients. I am told that I’m lazy and don’t like my job.  Just generally making me feel like I’m shit at my job.   My big manager basically tells me that the only reason why I'm not being fired at that point is because my coworkers whenever they would come up to talk to him about me referred to me as Agent 'insert OP's last name here'. So to him that made him feel that I was already part of the team, but this if the issues continued it would be a problem that he would swifty deal with.  

I'm be honest ..it was a tough meeting to get through, because on top of all the negatives, he did something that no manager has ever done before. He gave me positives as well.  He told me that I was the first person he hired in over 6 months, that he saw something in me that he wanted to build on. He mentioned that the clients liked me, that I was great with dealing with them. That he was rooting for me, however he still hasn't made up his mind about me either.  ( At this point I still don't have my uniform btw, I was still in blues and when I asked was told I hadn't earned it yet - this is important later) It is at this point that  I brought up the adhd thing then and I still don't know if either of them really took what I was saying to heart there. 

So after a good cry ( yeah I ugly cried, the first job I've liked in years was being threatened, it's a thing ) and a long talk I was sent home as was basically told to get better.  

Fast-forward through the holidays because HOLY FUCK were we busy and I really can't fully go over much because it was all a blur. I did end up learning how to read nova a lot better when it came to breaks and lunches and I also got myself some nicotine patches because serious I knew there were going to be days that I just couldn't go out other than my lunch and I didn’t want to turn into a raging bag of dicks because of withdrawals. 

Oh! I should mention, at this point in time I have an ARA that I’m completely avoiding whenever possible because I get shouted at whenever I ask a question and a fellow CA that I’m weary of because he is unpredictable toward me and I really just don’t want any issues or hassles that will cause problems down the line. 

But let’s go to about a week ago.  I’m not going to go to deep into this first part but I was closing with said CA, I was told to turn away clients for the last two hours of the night because of the fact that we had open box in the back. I get chewed out for asking to take my last break by said CA when we had no client’s waiting, and then things just exploded. I was trying to do receiving the way I was TAUGHT to do it and he goes off the handle, nearly charged me and screaming at me. I talked to MOD, he talked to the CA. I go back, the CA is snarking at every chance he gets, I eventually get fed up and instead of snapping back I go talk to the MOD and I’m allowed to go home 15 minutes early. 

Roll to the next day, and I pull my Senior aside and we have a long talk. I tell him about the issue that happened the night before and he takes it Very Seriously. Which pleased me, then we go over some corrections he want to me to my performance. While have felt that I am getting better and better, I apparently am still not there. He is kind as he tells me this and I accept what he’s saying. I explain in depth about the issues with the adhd, explain that I am unmedicated, and we end the conversation with me offering to being in some articles and what not that I had pulled for such moments. And holy shit guys, he’s the first boss I’ve had that said yes, please. That he would like to read them.

Towards the end of the day when I was packing up to go home  he smiles at me and says ‘ you had a good day today’ and I honestly blinked at him confused. Because to me, that day felt just like the one before it, I didn’t feel like I had worked any different, but when I told him that he said there was a clear difference, told me to have a good rest of me day and sent me home. 

Guys I wish the story ended there, but clearly I wouldn’t have taken this time if it was. 

So let's go to the next day and were everything goes completely sidewise and leads to where we are now. 

And fuck guys, this part is also the hardest, because I will tell you now the impulsiveness I mentioned before? Yeah that's a thing. 

So the next day I roll into work and the big GS boss  of the location is there, lets just call him Boss to make it easier. Normally Boss pops his head in to make sure everything is going already or to help out if were understaffed, and this is partly what his doing. He’s helping up catch up on labor in Nova ( closing tags and what not, and working on the schedule for the week. He’s a kind of intense guy, but honestly I have a fuck ton of respect for the dude because as far as I can feel he’s never once lied to me or sugar coated something, but he’s also never been a complete dick to me either.  Like when he found out I was trans because of my paperwork  he pulled me to the side and VERY POLITELY and CAREFULLY asked questioned to make sure he didn’t mis-step or offend me. He has this way of trying to teach you a lesson about something,  but I can’t always figure out what he’s teaching and instead of getting annoyed he just tries a different way.   

I guess what I’m trying to get across is this guy isn’t a run of the mill dick bag boss. 

However today;  today his attention was  zero’ed in on me. I wasn’t pulled off the floor but he had me doing things in the back, asking questions about how long did I think a task would take and then telling me how long it actually took me. It’s one of the ways I found out my sense of time is actually really fucked when I’m focused on some, and I was focused as all hell  because I was stressing out by this point.  I would go handle an appointment or two and come back to the back and I would be asked how long each appointment lasted, when I answered that he would give me exact times, then I would be sent back to doing another task.  

I do not think he was doing this to be a dick or an ass, again, that is not what I think he was doing here. However everytime he opens his mouth I stress out that much more. 

This goes back and forth for most of the day. Me doing appointments and tasking and him timing me on all of this. Towards the end of the day he pulls me closer and starts to go over everything with me. Different things I can do to create more labor..and fuck I honestly don’t know what even brought it up guys but he asked me something about the team and my mumbled response was something along the lines of ‘they don’t like me’. He asked me to repeat myself and I did with a little more confidence. 

Now here's the thing I need to explain when it comes to the team and where I feel my place is/was with them.  During most of this story there are a few agents that have been nothing but friendly towards me. However there are a good number as well who seem to have decided that I am a good person to take frustration out on. I have literally had conversations start with me asking where I could help and getting the answer ‘ Here's what you did wrong’. I am STILL to this day in my blues, and every time I have asked about it, I have been told that I’m not at 100% yet so I haven’t ‘earned them yet’. When I ask about this and what those expectations are  I’m am told that no one can be at 100% and it just circles from there. I am constantly left out of lunch runs, I am constantly told no on my breaks ( when there are no clients ) only to have the person that came in after me take theirs. I am constantly told that I’m doing things wrong but when I ask for correction I am told to to it the same way I have been. I am constantly told to do something one way and then a day later told off for doing it that way and that I should do it yet another way.  I am yelled at and scolded and it just… It doesn’t feel very good at all. 

Again THIS IS NOT ALL MY COWORKERS, JUST SOME OF THEM. But still when you’re already damaged and expecting a fight, it’s a thing and it can get to you quickly and easily.

Jump back to the current story. Boss frowned, promptly stood up and had me follow him into the manager's office, he went rooting around the drawers and pulled out a voluntary separation form. 

Guys, I mently shat brick, I panicked and I completely and utterly freaked out. I got the in building hr person in the room and then proceeded to lose my shit. I can’t even remember everything I said, but I vented all the frustrations and upset I’ve had about my position until that point. I vented about how frustrated I was about this being the ONE job I liked in a long time,one that I could have seen myself doing a long while. That I thought it was stupid that I was being punished for something I can’t control, but the people who yell at me, hell one of which yells and disrespects the other agents as well don’t seem to have any repermands. How stupid it was that I still didn’t have my whites, and how a part everything made me feel from my ‘team mates’. 

Guys there was more ugly crying and general blathering on like a fucking idiot, but I HONESTLY fucking LOVE my job and I was freaking the fuck out at the thought of losing it. And that’s not even thinking about the financial side effect.

The whole time Boss sat there quiet and listening. Basically just letting me rant myself out. I think I ended with something along the lines of ‘ So I can’t do every appointment in 20 minutes, what am I supposed to do?’

I shit you not, Boss just looked me in the eyes and said ‘ Just say that, that was literally all you had to say.’  Dude is fucking unflappable. 

So after a long and drawn out talk, I found out a lot of things I wish I had been told before.  It was explained to me that the only reason I hadn’t gotten my whites was because it just takes THAT LONG for them to come into a big store, he had ordered them three months ago. It was explained that Boss was trying to figure out how to HELP me keep up on labour because my numbers were starting to affect the rest of the team. It was explained that Boss has worked with workers with ADHD before and was trying to get a level on me. It was explained that some of my more ‘lacking in explanation’ coworkers were still in a rough spot themselves and he was working with them as well.  He understood that I was kinda getting targeted with people's frustrations and was trying to figure out ways to fix that. 

However, it was also agreed that finding a new store would be the best option. I was reluctant to fully agree but I also knew that would be the best choice. I believe the conversation was along the lines of Boss ‘So what do you want to do now?’  And I said, \`It's not what I WANT to do but I think the smartest thing to do would be go for that transfer.’ He gave a weird little smile and agreed. Said that the location I’m in not isn’t ideal for me and that another store might be better. 

After all that I got sent home with the promise that they ( Boss and in house Hr ) would start the phone calls and that was the end of that shitty day. 

I had the next two days off and let me tell you that shit was rough, I mentally hurt. I STILL do. 

Next day in, was an alright day. I get pulled to the side by Boss and he lays on this speech about what’s going on. How hes gonna try and keep things floating but it might be wise for me to take a look at outside options, because he’s not sure how long he has to a) find me that transfer before he has to fire me and b) how long before his bosses tell him to just cut me loose. He states that I might want to quit because at that point after 90 days I could come back to the company and reapply somewhere else.  That he’s not able to force another store to take me in because if he makes that phone call and something goes south there, it's his name on the line as well as mine. He states that that if I feel like I need to I can fight him on this with corporate hr but he wouldn’t recommend it, that he has enough to fire me on spot.  I understand what he’s saying, I do! But still I’m not sure what I'm supposed to be getting from this.  Am I being told to quit? ( I CAN’t do that I live paycheck to paycheck), is he telling me the transfer won’t go? Is he telling me he’s being pushed into firing me? 

I honestly have no idea here. 

That was two days ago,  I found a store that has a full time slot open ( different position but I need fulltime to be able to actually keep a roof over me head. I refuse to do another homeless stint because I do not see myself coming out of that.  That is something that I will not allow to happen. Take that as you will. ) and shot Boss a text stated as much, asking if I should be the one to make contact or him. No answer but it's his day off some I’m not expecting much until probably tomorrow. 

So at this point I guess I what I’m doing is getting this story out there and asking for help. Any advice, any thoughts on how to go about things. What do I do with all of this? Where do I go from here? 

All I know is I’m mentally twisted and have no idea what to do at this point.",07Jan2020,1

1039,"I have known this person for approximately 6 months. We met on an online gaming community and within about a month he began to open up about his struggles with both his physical and mental health. He told me he had recently been diagnosed with a number of physical conditions which I was told led to him having a very short time to live. Recently I have begun to question whether or not he is telling the truth to me about this scenario for a number of reasons.

* He tells me his parents are abusive (telling him to cut deeper when they see him cleaning up afterwards etc.) except he also talks to me about how his parents are often questioning what he is doing which to me sounds as though they do care and also has many expensive technology devices with no decent explanation of where it has come from
* Last night he told me he tried to commit suicide by overdose and was in hospital. Today he told me about his day at college after he got home. I am not entirely sure of the protocol in such a situation but I have a feeling that you would normally be kept in hospital for longer than a night after an overdose. He also said this is the 5th time he has tried to do this which adds to the fact that you would think he is going to be kept in hospital for a longer period of time.
* He is extremely open about his feelings. He tells people who he has spoken to a couple times at most which to me is unusual as the main people I know who have undergone similar experiences are the exact opposite (Hiding it, closed off, withdrawn etc.)
* He refuses to talk to anyone he knows IRL about this and I know this is likely due to an anonymity thing but it certainly adds to my questioning.

I really don't want to believe that he is lying to me about this but it has gotten to a point at which it almost feels ridiculous and I am seriously considering whether or not this is true.",07Jan2020,1
1040,"Hello reddit, this is my first post, sorry we couldn't start on a happier note :/

Now, I'm currently in high school and wholeheartedly believe that I am suffering from depression, more specifically, atypical depression. I have not been formally diagnosed, but I've done research and I line up with a lot of symptoms. A few of those are increased appetite, sleeping too much, feeling rejected, being oversensitive to criticism, etc. The part that stand out the most being that my depressive mood brightens in response to positive events in my life.

I dont know what to do or even who I should tell. I dont know if I want to see a therapist or counselor about it in fear of being put on some sort of medicine that could alter my personality. I have known people who have depression and were put on antidepressants who said that it made them feel like a totally different person, in a bad way of course.

I've dealt with this for some time now, and I have no idea what to do. Should I tell someone? See a doctor? I really dont have the slightest clue.",07Jan2020,1
1042,"I paid £100 on a deposit for a full day of tattooing, and was reassured the artist I booked with knew what he was doing. I sent him a picture of what I wanted, pretty much exactly like the image. Anyway, he didn't send me any pictures beforehand of what it looked like, so when I went in on the day of my appointment I was confused as to why he set up BEFORE showing me the design he'd come up with. Anyway, he eventually shows me the design, and it's NOTHING like what I asked for. It just seems like he got the reference and chucked it away. He stencilled it on, just so I could get a proper idea of it, and I said no. Then he assumed I'd want another appointment and he would change the design. But I've lost faith in him and just don't think he can do the style I want, and I was given the wrong artist. Unfortunately, I'm shy and felt pressured because he was basically telling me I was having another appointment. Then, he tells me I have to pay £40 for the day because he set everything up. Explained like this, I just believed it was fair, because I'm naive. However, I later found out this £40 was payment for the day, and the £100 I paid before was a deposit towards the next appointment. But I don't want the appointment, and I felt very much like I was pressured into it. I got in contact with them online, and they said they would refund the £40 (because I left a bad review). I was just wondering though, if I explain how I was pressured into the new appointment, and have technically paid for ""wasting their time"" (although he wasted mine because he should have shown me a design beforehand), is there a chance I can get my £100 and cut my losses with the £40? Even an artist at the studio at the time said it wasn't my fault, that the artist should have shown me a design of the tattoo beforehand. Honestly, it looked absolutely nothing like what I'd asked for.",07Jan2020,1
