2,"Hey! As you read from the title, I’m experiencing a bit of a moral struggle.

My friend is an absolutely lovely person, one of the sweetest people I know. I love playing games with them or watching shit with them or generally just being around them, but lately it seems that every single time i talk to them they are drunk. I care about them a lot and I don’t wanna hurt their feelings, but it’s making me extremely uncomfortable being around them because I have issues being around drunk people (past experiences kinda ruined it for me). I don’t want to lose them as a friend, but whenever they’re drunk I get really anxious and either have to leave the call or get more irritable than I’d like to and feel really bad about it.

Any tips on what to do (whether it be about my mentality or how to handle it as a whole) would be very appreciated, thanks guys :)",20Aug2020,1
3,"I'm not trying to shame her or anything, but honestly, I'm starting to get concerned. She doesn't shower or wash herself and she keeps stuffing her sweaty clothes into bags just to put them back on the next day, and then she tries to cover up the smell with a ton of deodorant and just sprays her hair with dry shampoo. I just want her to realize that deodorant and dry shampoo can't replace an actual shower. Any advice on how to adress this?",20Aug2020,1
4,"I’m an absolute mess right now, and this is done on mobile at 2am so forgive the mistakes. 

College starts in 1 month. The place I applied for is 6 hours away and I don’t even know if I want to do the course anymore. It’s veterinary bioscience but I don’t think I want to become a vet or go in that direction at all.

It’s a big move for me at 18. I’m not excited to go like I thought I’d be, I’m just dreading it. I see absolutely no pros to going so far away to study. My problem is that there’s no animal related courses near me. 

Do I just get on with it, go and try it or should I give myself another year off to figure out what I want?",20Aug2020,1
5,"For context I work in a chain restaurant/bakery with a shared bathroom

So my boss yesterday (female) told me yesterday that whenever I (male) have to use the bathroom (to pee) I have to do it sitting down. It seems like that is way out of line to give orders of how male employees can and can't use the bathroom. Am I wrong for not listening to her on this? I don't want to get in trouble, or have to go to HR, but I feel like this is an abuse of power. She hasn't threatened anything yet, but knowing her she's going to do write ups if we don't listen to her. Any suggestions?",20Aug2020,1
6,"So basically I’m about to move into a new place, just started online school for the semester.

I want to get in better shape but the more I lounge the worse shape I’m in and the cycle continues. I want to develop new skills but same cycle.

Few months later she messages me checking on me and seeing of I was ok because we hadn't talked for a few months. We talk a few nights goes well. I ask her out. Admittedly it wasn't a good time and I was being really dumb. I get what I'm guessing was a polite no and basically stopped the conversation. After that I kept getting left on read so I gave up again. Basically forgot about her. Now she has text me hello and I said hey hows it going and she hasn't answered or even read my message after 4 days


Idk if we are friends or not. She is always very nice to me when we do talk. And has shown/said some things to me that were very caring that made me feel special. (It might just be how I'm not very popular and it's just a normal thing) but yet she leaves me on read and never talks to me.

stressing out a lot about my future. So I’m in community college right now and I have been doing pretty bad to say the least my GPA and grades were good at first when I started and now are pretty terrible. I’m majoring in criminal Justice which I switched from Computer science and I thought that’s what I wanted to do but I’m not so sure anymore. And I have had no motivation at to do any of the work. I recently got a job it’s in Fast food at Chipotle but I’m liking working and doing something with my time. I know I’m not a bum or lazy because I wouldn’t be looking for a job or have one.  I’m just utterly lost right now. I know I’m young and have a good amount of time to figure things out and have a successful career it’s just I’ve been thinking a lot about this. Like I don’t want to be a failure or someone who isnt self made in the future. I want to be successful have a career and be stable it’s just i don’t what I wanna do. I guess I’m asking for is what should I do now? Should stay in school get my grades up get a degree or drop out?

10,"Sorry for the long text, TLDR at the bottom. 


So this has been happening in my house for almost a month now. Me and my parents are living in the ground floor and the entire first floor is under construction.


This lockdown has transformed my entire schedule where I work all nights and sleep in the morning. So, I work at the dining table which is in the hall area beside the kitchen.


Imagine the dining table is in the North of the house. So if you're facing South sitting on the table, the kitchen is on the left, my parent's room is in South-East and my room is in South-West. The main door of the house is in South and the back door is on the West.


So then, there's this fluffy beautiful cat that comes into my house from my room's window. He'll roam around the house in front of the dining table area and then go away after a while. Sometimes it exits from my parent's bedroom (door is usually open and so are their windows), through the kitchen's window or lastly, climb up the first floor.


I have tried pspspsps but he only looks at me but doesn't come to me. I tried to approach it and it fled away. I'm naturally a dog person so I do not know anything about cats. This routine happens exactly between 3-4 am and in the same fashion. He doesn't try to take anything from the kitchen or knock down anything. He simply comes and goes.


My parents are strictly against pets and my mental state has been deteriorating every since I was let go in June. Freelancing is very hard and I envy each and every person who has a pet right now (Thanks reddit people for your cute pet pics).


Now that I have an opportunity, I really hope to maybe bond with this cat so that my nights are at least lively for me. I am low-key certain that the cat is already adopted but not sure which neighbour it belongs to. I am ready to try anything to befriend it. Any help or advice is appreciated!


TLDR - Every night - Cat come, cat go. Me wanna pet, Parents say no. Me and cat night friends - How? Help.",20Aug2020,1
11,"TL;DR - I am too overbearing and needy. Stepped over her boundary unwittingly when she first broke up with me by reaching out to her dad. Now I'm blocked everywhere as I tend to go into ""fix it"" mode and try to reach her on multiple platforms to try to fix the relationship. I know that I should give her space and go no contact. I am just chasing your views on my chances of her coming back.

I'm with my ex for 1.5 years where I'm 42 M and she is 27F. She broke up with me 2 months ago but came back and then broke up with me again. She is very mature at her age and we clicked very well. She had an ex for 5 years whom neglected her (giving her lots of space?) and basically is a child, which she eventually left. After meeting me, she was so blown away by my personality that she made the commitment of wanting to spend her life with me. I showered her with nothing but love, words of encouragement and thoughtful gifts. We never fought or argued. We met each other's parents (big step for her) and talking about marriage and kids. I am in her inner circle which consists of her parents (fell out with her mum recently) and 2 of her childhood friends. She trusts me so much that she leaves her dog with me while she goes to work as I'm working from home. I am pivotal in her life as I'm the only one that believed in her and encouraged her to go back to studying. She hates people generally and we both are on the same page whereby we are sick of starting over, getting to know someone again, getting comfortable and baring our souls to someone new again. Hence why she wanted to spend her life with me and change her last name to mine - big big commitments she has never made with anyone else before. She was surprised herself.

I have insecurity issues whereby I am always asking incessant questions about her exes, how they fucked up and soothing myself knowing I didn't. I became so needy that she wants space and I casually accused her of cheating. I am seeking therapy for it and **she first came back understanding that I'm actively seeking help**.

I made the mistake of reaching out to her dad, seeking advice. I did not trash talk her. She eventually found out I called her dad. I admit I was frantic and lost but that's because I lost someone I truly love. She would've done the same if her dog which is completely her world, gone missing.

I managed to get her back by begging and pleading (mistake) but she came back because she missed me a lot. We were fixing our relationship but I pushed too hard in just wanting to see her over weekends where she said no and I kept trying. She then used me calling her dad as an excuse and broke off with me, then immediately blocked me everywhere. Completely. She did so because I have the tendency to go into ""fix it mode"" where I will try to set things right by contacting her via any means possible and not giving her space.

I'm now being blocked coming to a month.......It went from wanting to spend her life with me to this nightmare.......I pulled a ""stunt"" which I regretted a week after she blocked me - trying to call her from my work phone and send her sms from my work phone apologising over calling her dad. Nothing. Emailing her, no reply. I didn't know her attachment style but this month of self reflection and growing, I only just found out that she is a dismissive avoidant due to her traumatic childhood. I want her back and I know she still loves me but I don't know if I even have a chance anymore :(

Somehow at the back of my mind, I'm still holding on despite knowing there are not much chance. What we went through in the relationship was something she had never experienced before in terms of stability and love. Hence why she wanted to spend her life with me, which is a massive decision.

Next week is her birthday and I know she won't spend it with her parents cause they fell out. That leaves her with 2 of her childhood friends as she does not have any real friends. I wonder if I should send her a gift via online order to show I care as I'm blocked everywhere but I don't think I should at all.

Please help if I still have a chance......",20Aug2020,1
12,"So this is a pretty complicated situation with lots of blurred lines. My bf (20) and I (20F) have been together for about 7 months. Something to note: he has pretty bad schizoaffective disorder. It causes him to mistrust his friends and family often, but rarely me.

Another piece of the story: he had been a dealer for 6 years making a lot of money, but recently stopped and hasn’t had any money because he is a compulsive spender due to terrible spending habits, his bipolar 1 disorder, and being used to being able to make $100 in 10mins off of a deal. 

He is also very addicted to weed and does not have any money to spend on it right now. He also does not have any weed whereas up until a week or 2 ago before he stopped dealing he would have a surplus. I also always have a lot of weed because I use it to sleep at night and I have an ever growing tolerance. I usually have an ounce on me at a time, and I’ve never owned a scale. He scaled it out for me if I’m trying to limit myself or whatnot (I do not sell; not for that reason)

2 nights ago 3 of his close friends came over who he is always accusing of stealing weed and money from him. They also all owe him money right now. BUT, this time, he told me that when he was scaling out my weed (like I’d asked) after they left, he noticed that some was missing. He said it looked like there was 3/4 of an ounce left. Mind you he dealt weed for 6 years so he can eyeball it very well. He also said they stole $60 from him and that was the last of his money. He said they got really drunk (I was upstairs while they were drinking, he was talking to me at times while they were alone near his and my stuff), and so they probably stole our stuff while he was with me or he was drunk with them. His friends didn’t even know where my weed was though, and it was hard to get to packaged in many bags and Tupperware, so even if they did know I doubt they’d take the risk of spending minutes trying to get to it then put it back together

So, today he buys $50 of weed from me because he has none for a trip this weekend, but he had told me yesterday that his friends had stolen the only $60 and he had no money now so this makes no sense to me. Also, when he scaled the weed today to take on the trip (he scaled it when I wasn’t with him), he comes back to me and says “dude they took so much of your weed. There’s only 3-5g left after I took out the 7 I bought from you.” Like, he’s so good at eyeballing, how could he mistake 21g for 10-14g? 

The last thing is that he’s so caring I want to give him the benefit of the doubt. When he had money he always gave me free weed and randomly bought me things, payed for our dinners, etc. Now I’m in school and working full time, paying my bills, really struggling to stay afloat. He lives with his parents, spoonfed, and isn’t motivated to find a friggin job so I offer him gas money to come see me because he can’t even afford to come see me. His friends aren’t the best people, but they’ve ALWAYS been there for him. They’re having a bit of a falling out rn for other reasons, but I still don’t think they’d steal from him. Especially not me. I confronted him a little today, but he deflected it and said why would I tell you it’s gone if I stole it so I was at a loss for words, even though I know that’s what someone who steals would do, right? What should I do? Do you think he’s stealing from me? He’s been so good to me in the past and he still is but this is so odd, and right now as opposed to the past, he’s an addict (as addicted as one can be to weed) with no money or weed.",20Aug2020,1
13,"I have been friends with a guy since a year now.
After he came into my life, I am just getting bad experiences and nothing else. Every sort of happiness literally faded away. 
I am an introvert so I don't make much friends but this has all happened after I have been friends with this guy and made him my only friend.

There are 3 people in particular; my colleague, my partner's father and my partner's best friend who have always gone out of their way to avoid/keep their distance from me whenever I am in the room. If I'm near them at all they would move several steps away or even to another room. I'm fairly young and have never experienced this with anyone else, but it makes things awkward and I always feel uncomfortable around them now.",20Aug2020,1
15,"
I’ll try make this brief. He’s 37 in 19, he’s engaged with 4 kids and his family is relatively close to mine hence why he’s friends with my parents. I’ve had a crush on him on and off since I was like 16 and always used to fantasise about him liking me back. I know it’s bad withhold the judgment I was young. 

anyway I was in a relationship for a year until March so I forgot about him. he followed me on Instagram in April which obviously got my attention. his family came round mine in June and that’s when this started, he gave me a few looks while he was here and we had a long hug when he left. I was super drunk and feeling friendly so I messaged him saying ‘get home safe guys’ as they had to walk late at night or whatever. He replied with a few flirty emojis and I was kinda shocked, he then messaged me a few days later apologising and said he was embarrassed. I said don’t be silly it’s fine. 

Since then we’ve been messaging quite a bit. He always messages me first and even admitted he shouldn’t be messaging me as he’d ‘get shot’ if anyone saw. He replies to the pictures I post calling me gorgeous, commenting on my outfit, or saying I should be a model. We also have general conversations about our day etc, I do enjoy talking to him. 

My friends even notice how he stares at me or looks at me in certain ways when we’re all out together. 

But obviously he has a fiancé and he’s close friends with my parents particularly my dad.. and no one knows about this. I’m not planning to tell anyone because I feel like it’s quite a big deal and no matter how bad it is I do like him. My question for adults is how would you react if you found out your friend was acting like this with your daughter? And has anyone else had a similar experience?",20Aug2020,1
16,Me (20M) and my gf (20F) have been dating for around about 11 months now and everything is amazing. I know she loves me very much but since this quarantine we’ve both been very busy with our lives and try to message each other as much as we can throughout the day. On a good day we’ll probably text each other maybe 30 times throughout the day and on a bad day it’s even less. The only time I really get to talk to her and ask her about how her day was is at night when we both head to bed. But recently she doesn’t stay up with me very long like maybe 30 minutes at max and she knows I have really bad insomnia and struggle with sleep I want her to at least keep me company for a little longer like maybe an hour or so but she always says she’s super tired and will rarely stay up with me for longer than maybe 40 mins and since I have such a soft spot for her I hate saying no to her and let her go to bed. (We normally head up to bed at 11PM). But on the rare occasion where I sleep before her for more than two days in a row she’ll complain and say that she really wants to talk to me and that I slept earlier the day before and should stay up with her until she sleeps at which I always say fine because I love her a lot and hate seeing her upset. But my anxiety sometimes digs at my brain and I keep thinking what if she just doesn’t like me as much as I like her and idk whether this is sometimes I’m just over thinking or not and I just want somebody to tell me whether or not I am and I would appreciate it a lot. thank you.,20Aug2020,1
17,"# The relative I speak of is one of my siblings from another mother, whom I haven't seen or spoken to since I saw him one time 12 years ago (I'm 24 now, he's 40).

He's the eldest of my half siblings. I have 5 half siblings and a younger brother that I share a mother and father with. Dad wasn't exactly responsible so most of us hardly knew him before he died, and we mostly grew up apart because we had different mothers who didn't get along.

Time passed, life was tough for all of us being fatherless. There is mention of a house my father built before he died, which everyone knew about but was a problematic issue because one of our horrible uncles was named executor of the estate and no one had the energy or resources to fight him in court at the time. My older half brother is the one who fought him over it when his finances were strong and he got the house from him.

He tracked me and my younger brother down recently and we met in person (it was tense, for me mostly). He's being nice, he's introduced us to his family (a wife and 4 kids) and he's pretty well off financially from what he says, and shows (gold tooth, benz, gives gifts like its no big deal, etc). And he's made this whole speech about wanting to share what he has with his family, wanting to get to know me and the others, which should sound heart warming but I don't feel warm at all.

**Why is here? Why after all these years is he showing up out of the blue? Why so generous and eager? What's he after, what's he hiding? Is this some sort of trap? What if there is something to do with the house going on and he's trying to do something illegal?**

I've heard that he tried to sell the house but failed (didn't say why), I've heard of his past run ins with the law, which he doesn't deny (he was young and apparently he's different now), but I can't shake this anxiety I'm feeling. I just can't quite process all this.

I dismissed his attempt to reach out it when he made the 1st call after tracking us down coz I thought he wasn't serious about reconnecting, probably just another ""father figure"" wannabe I'm related to whose talking big, making promises and offerings but isn't actually gonna do anything but disappear (happened before, I'm related to alot of people I've met for the 1st time only recently who have done exactly that).

Now its full frontal in a way isn't sitting right with me. My senses are on high alert but I don't wanna be one of those crazy people who assumes the worst of everything and expects danger where there is none. I've been paranoid before but this is having an effect on me like nothing else.

He gave me and my little brother some nice gifts yesterday (phones and some clothing) at the time of writing, and I can't bring myself to look at them. I accepted because I was raised not to be rude to turn down a gift and I've tried them out because he and his wife seemed genuine when they gave them to us (they seemed to be answering questions that were on my mind before I even asked them, like they were written on my face or something), but now I'm strongly considering giving the gifts back (trying to come up with excuses in the back of my head).

My younger brother isn't feeling the way I am (he responded 1st when the reaching out happened, he has the most questions because he's the youngest of everyone and was 2 when our father died) , my mother is skeptical yet on the fence but that's another story. And I am, well uncomfortable. Possibly hyerbolic and a tad xenophobic. I don't want to judge just because of somone's past and partially because of their appearance (he has a lot of jewelery and tatoos, which is fine, its what I would do but why am I getting a vibe from it), but I don't want this to turn ugly if there is anything nefarious going on.",20Aug2020,1

19,"Hi guys. I just got admitted into a good CA University, but I hate online classes. Most of my professors don’t even know how to properly use canvas or zoom. I’m getting bad grades because along with going to school full time I work Fulltime. My family is lower income (that’s being modest) and needs my salary. Plus my stepdad and my mom are splitting and my mom works minimum wage. On top of that we are in the process of moving. Quitting or working less hours isn’t much of an option at the moment. I am currently majoring in Literature and plan on going to law school after. However, I have been working in a medical facility and I quite enjoy it. I am worried that law isn’t the career path for me and am considering working in the medical field as either a pathologist or OBGYN. But that’s a whole other type of major. Since I am currently studying humanities and that is STEM. 

So I’m thinking about dropping my UC classes and taking stem community college classes. I already finished my general ed classes so I wouldn’t be there long. I’m just paying 900$ a unit for classes I am not learning from for a major and career Im not sure I want anymore. I dropped hints to my mom about wanting to take some time off from school, but she freaked out. She dropped out because she got pregnant with me. So technically I’m a first generation student in my Mexican family and they take so much pride in that. My mom thinks if I take time off It will be a big mistake, but I honestly don’t and I feel like my mental health is really suffering because of ‘grind’ culture. You know work full time, go to school full time, be amazing at everything. I haven’t had a free summer since...we’ll probably grade school. I honestly can’t remember. 

I feel like community college during the pandemic will be better bc their professors are more attentive and teach much better (I am a transfer student so I know this). The classes will be cheaper. I will be on my way to a degree I actually want. And I’m not technically taking a year off. I’m still going to school. What do you guys think? Should I temporarily halt my University education?",20Aug2020,1
20,"I’ve been working at a non-profit for about a year now. I’ve always known my boss didn’t care for me personally but up until the last month or so thay have at least been professional. I have a disability, but I don’t “look like” I have a disability. I disclosed in my initial application process that I was disabled but did not openly discuss it in any interview. This is important to know as the story goes on.

We had a new employee start about a month ago, and about two weeks into me training her this new employee told me that my boss had informed her that I’m dishonest, and she shouldn’t trust me. She expressed to me that she felt I was genuine person, and though she didn’t believe what my supervisor said she thought it was only right to inform me. I let it go, maybe I should’ve stopped it there and confronted my boss but I’m honestly a very passive person and don’t enjoy confrontation.

It’s only gotten worse since then. My boss has made a number of scathing comments to me and my co-worker and has set some weird boundaries:

· I must be forgetful because of the medication I take. My other co-worker (also disabled) takes a lot of the same medication (how my boss would know any of this is beyond me) and that’s why we can’t remember anything.

· She wouldn’t have hired me if she knew about “all my problems”.

· She can’t hire anymore disabled people because they couldn’t do the job (there’s nothing in any of our job descriptions about having to be on your feet, lifting requirements, ECT.)

· She has announced my health problems to a room full of people because I was wearing a brace and couldn’t help with a major moving project.

· I’ve heard her discussing my health concerns with other employees and volunteers.  

· I’m “slow” and my other co-workers are able to do things faster than me, and she doesn’t understand why I can’t be faster.

· I work under multiple supervisors, I’m not allowed to contact them in any way, shape or form without notifying her first or including her in e-mails.

· She’s walked into my office when I’m on the phone and the door is closed without knocking to make sure I wasn’t asking my other supervisors questions without her knowledge.

So, I finally contacted HR. I called in tears because this is all starting to affect my mental and physical health. I dread going into work somedays. I was asked to write a letter stating all of the above, and my other co-worker also voluntarily wrote a letter. The HR representative told me to reach out to her if I needed anything, even if it was just as a soundboard and stated she would bring the letters to the “higher ups”.  It’s been over a week since the letters were sent in, and I haven’t heard anything from HR since then. I’ve sent an e-mail asking for follow up and received nothing. 

I’ve never had to deal with anything like this before, so I don’t know if HR is trying to brush me off. Am I supposed to get follow up information? Do I need to escalate this further? If I do need to escalate this further who do I go too if HR won’t help me? If anyone could give me any advice about what to do, or where to turn that would be extremely helpful. Thanks in advance.",20Aug2020,1

I feel like a complete idiot. I never thought one of these things would happen to me. I’m so angry with myself.

I  posted a selfie on tumblr last week and an artist blog that seemed  legit approached me and asked if I could be a nude model for their art. I  was hesitant at first because obv that involves sending nude photos of  myself but they did have several pieces they did, their subjects were  happy with it, and they promised me they’d delete the photos when done. I  always wanted a nude portrait to be done of me (bucket list stuff) and  it was free, so I agreed.

They  told me they’d be done in 2-3 days to a week and they’d let me see it  first before they posted it. A week went by and nothing. I contacted  them but they didn’t respond. I managed to find a bunch of other people  the person had contacted  and they told me that this person has gone  from a range of three weeks to two years without contacting them with  the finished piece.

I don’t think there’s a way I can get them to contact me back or delete the photos.

I  was scammed. And I feel like a complete fucking moron. I’m already  struggling with mental health and this is making my anxiety so much  worse.

I don’t want to hear I  learned a lesson. I was stupid to do it to begin with and I knew it was  stupid in the moment. Idk why I agreed. Some rando out there now has my  nudes and god knows wht they’re gonna do with them. I’m hoping I, or  someone I know, doesn’t come across them at some point on the internet. I  hope it doesn’t affect my job prospects. The other ppl and I have  reverse searched the images we sent this person, and nothing came up,  but idk if that means anything.

I’m  so ashamed. I can’t tell my parents. I can’t tell my friends. I can’t  tell my therapist. I’m in complete fear. I’m so upset with myself. I  don’t know what to do. Is there anything I even can do at this point? I’m an absolute idiot.",20Aug2020,1

27,"First of all I am an introvert. I literally avoid meeting people.But a year back, I have been friends with this guy who actually was my only friend for a year.

The story begins like this, I had a break up last year, so I was in depression for a month maybe. I started doing all stupid and ugly things I never thought of doing before.
I fucked prostitutes, snorted drugs, etc.
Whenever I used to do all these stuff, this friend of mine used to accompany me but he never did all these.
After taking some therapy sessions later, I came out of this behavior.
Later when I asked him, why didn't he stop me at that time, he said ""I tried stopping but you won't listen"".
What I remember is, he always used to stop me in a normal manner , and after 2-3 times of my excuse, he used to peacefully accompany me. 

Is this what a friend is supposed to do ?

Well he claims to have anxiety which I'm not doubting but like all the friends I try to meet he keeps showing signs of attention seeking. Examples: changing pronouns every few days, venting about his sucky mom just to start a conversation dispite the fact I barely know him and saying sorry and apologising every chance he gets. 

I dont know why, I just haven't responded to his message in 10 minutes because I'm typing something long in another chat and I get a message saying ""Sorry"". I answer the message every single time with ""You're fine/we're cool"". But keep in mind this isnt like a once or twice a day occurence. He has done this nine times today and every time I reassure him we're good.  I dont wanna abandon this friendship because I think I can actually make one with this dude so how do I politely tell him to stop constantly saying sorry?",20Aug2020,1

And he doesn’t text me good morning until like 2-4 pm, we only send one message per day. We haven’t spoken on the phone and he hasn’t asked to see each other. This happens a lot. He’s never the one to ask me. Or speak to me. And it feels really lonely. Like he truly doesn’t care. Well I gave in and called him. And he spoke like everything was fine. All sweet like and for. A moment it made me happy. And I asked if he didn’t want to see me and he said that he did and then proceeded to ask if he could come see me and it bothered me so much because he never asks unless I bring it up so I said no And he said ok. And it annoys me because we’ve argued about this before. About his lack of communication and it feels wrong. Like I shouldn’t have to ask to be loved. But he calls me clingy. And that also makes me feel bad. Like maybe I am clingy. Or maybe he’s just not loving enough. Either way I fell into a pit of depression haha. It feels like we broke up. Maybe I’m in the wrong idk.

I’m overthinking now and worried that it’ll be perceived as inappropriate! Help! First post below:

ORIGINAL POST:
Is it ever OK to give a mental health therapist a gift??

I’m 32F, and I assume my therapist is in her early 40s, if that matters. 

Anyway, I made my therapist a gift. I’ve only been seeing her for about 2 months, but I literally searched for over a decade to find a therapist I finally clicked with. I’m so grateful to have found her and she’s already expressed that she’s in this journey with me, for as long as it takes, to help support me to my goals.  

My question is, is it acceptable to give her this gift, to show my appreciation? Or would it be weird or cause problems? Is she even allowed to accept it? It’s homemade; I didn’t spend a ton of money on it (just supplies to make it) but I spent hours and hours making it. 

Thoughts please? TIA!",20Aug2020,1

35,"So, I recently turned 21, and have never had a problem moderating my drinking before (I've been to places where the legal age to drink is 18, without my parents around. The first time I ever drank in fact, I was 19, it was a few weeks before my 20th birthday, and I was in Europe). I had drinks there, moderated fine, and never touched a drop when back in the USA. Now, I'm back in the USA, 21, and since my birthday, have thought about drinking often. I had a drink *on* my birthday, (the 6th), I had a few drinks a few times in between (my own bottle of rum), and I had one last Friday, the 14th. Now, I can't stop thinking about drinking. I've told myself ""You can't drink until the weekend"". Wait til Friday. Wait til the 27th, even. but I'm still thinking about it. How do I squash that desire to drink especially because I was underage, I never felt like this before?

Is this normal? Am I just desiring it because of the whole ""forbidden fruit is no longe forbidden"" thing and I need to just get rid of it? (I had extremely controlling parents, beyond just ""no drinking in the USA until 21""). Am I a burgeoning alcoholic?",20Aug2020,1
36,"Alrighty. So I've been identifying as aroace for quite a while now, same with my current partner. We've both been together for around 2 - 3 years now, and I really do love him dearly- just not in a sexual or romantic way. But we both accepted that, as we thought it is only going to be that way anyway and it wouldn't change our relationship.  
The problem comes to hand is now there's this girl in my class that I have quite a strong romantic attraction to, and I've realised I've had moments like this before with a few of my previous mates as well. In the past I've never understood how love felt, and when I met my partner I would just brush it away until I realised it was actually love- just in a different manner.  
But now I can recognise that feeling and it's towards this said girl.  
Unlike my current partner, I want to cuddle with her. I want to kiss her and have romantic dates and more, y'know?  
But I also love my partner, just not in the same way. I don't want to hurt him and I've already brought this up to him previously and tried to suggest  to try a polyamory relationship, but realised I'm only thinking of myself and not him- so he shut it down, and I accepted that.  


I don't know what to do, because I love him, I really do. I want to live with him in the future and continue life as it is together, but I also want to do more with this girl.

I'm a Femboy, and I'm bisexual, but I don't know what to do. I've had open talks with my girlfriend many times about this, and she's nothing but supportive of me seeking to find myself and express it but has expressed worry in our relationship. 

Basically, she worries about still being attracted to me if I change my lifestyle like I've been wanting to (HRT, feminine clothing, voice therapy, etc...) We both love each other so much, and I really don't want to lose anything here... I'm incredibly proud of her for being so honest with me, though (it took a lot of convincing).

43,"I’m a guy in college who has just begun the process of becoming more independent (i.e. moving into my own place). In social interactions I always try to be as agreeable as possible, and when something happens that hurts me I just stay silent and let things happen to me.

I’m too afraid that people will blow up and I’ll lose them. I place too much weight on other people’s opinions. When I need to stand up for myself I just start shaking pitifully, unable to say a thing.

Despite being tall and somewhat intimidating, once people realize that I won’t stand up for myself, they just silently test my boundaries, and I find my quality of life or health go down to accommodate. 

After getting the short end of the stick in my living situation, I guess I realized that if I continued letting this happen to me, I would eventually not even have somewhere to sleep.

I’ve reconsidered everything that I’ve done up to this point. I don’t know who to trust anymore. I feel so lonely for some reason. I really don’t know what friends are, or maybe my definition is just wrong.

She was near to tears begging me to forget about it and i told her that i wouldn’t say anything to anybody, i wont forget about jt, and i’ll always be here if she needs to talk. She left the room.
I went to check on her and asked again why she asked me to forget which she didn’t explain anything at all, just asked me to leave her alone.

I couldn't get the courage so i talked to the psychiatrist only about ocd and she diagnosed me and perscribed me some medications for ocd(fevarin). 

Last few months i had to to alot of the blood tests and neurologist checkup before i could take the medications, and i did and now i have been taking the meds for about a week, and they should start working 2 weeks after i started taking them, so one week more. 

In about 10 days i will go to the psychiatrist again for a checkup, and i don't know if i will be able to mention the depression and self harm problem. 

Another thing to note is that the medications im taking for OCD(fevarin) are also antidepressants but they are not meant to be used as antidepressants if a person is younger than 18, which means that they can only affect my ocd and not my depression. 

How should i go about this? I am also having a hard time asking for help because my parents don't really believe in mental ilnesses and my dad yelled at me because my mom had to spend money on a psychiatrist. I didn't tell my parents about depression or self harm but i did tell them about ocd because the psychiatrist told them first. 

I really don't know what should i do from here because if i tell the psychiatrist about self harm and my parents find out they will probably be furious and won't let me have privacy to stop me from doing it because they always believe that forcing something will solve the issue, they already mess up my stuff that i keep tidy because they think that thats the way to cure ocd.",20Aug2020,1
69,"I am a left-leaning Jew living in Israel.

I try to avoid reading too much about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict because it tends to raise my blood pressure. But whenever I do I am astounded by the amount of hatred I encounter.

A few dynamics:

* Israel, in my opinion, is quickly becoming an authoritarian far-right state. As a left-winger, I know that I am hated by countless Israeli Jews just for having difficult political beliefs than that. At the moment, it feels like the majority.
* I only appreciated recently that there are quite a large number of Israelis that hate Arabs and hold ignorant racist attitudes towards them. This really saddens me because I love world cultures.
* To even the playing field here there are also Palestinians that absolutely hate Israelis too. Not to mention non-Palestinians.

Are there any secrets to encountering daily hatred and not becoming depressed by it? I feel like avoiding social media flame wars is probably a good place to start. But every time I see a poster spread racist half truths just out of spate and hatred for the other side I feel a bit sad inside and bleak for the world.",20Aug2020,1
70,"Hi all,

I recently moved into college. This is my first time away from home, so I’ve always been under the rule of my parents. They are very nosy and controlling, and they have to know about every aspect of my life and butt their heads into it. 

I came here with my partner, who (of course), they do not approve of. Back at home, they set up very many rules regarding him, and it messed with me a lot. Whenever I see him here, I get a pit in my stomach and I feel like I’m doing something wrong, thus leading to punishment. They are also religious parents, and because of what they said, I’m always afraid that I’ll be “cursed” or a “sinner” if I spend time or be intimate with my boyfriend. 

I have to constantly lie in my texts to them about what is going on. I’ve been told to just cut them out and/or tell the truth, but both of those options wouldn’t work because 1) I still love my parents and 2) I am afraid of what repercussions or harsh treatment I could face if I told the truth. This is eating me up inside and I don’t have many people to talk to about it (many people I’ve spoken to just don’t understand). 

What are some things that I can do to help me fix this mentality and live comfortably and to the fullest?",20Aug2020,1

Any time I try to engage past these remarks I'm left with immense guilt because either my mom leaves by just saying ""fine"" and then threatening to stop paying for my college (a whole other issue) or she just laughs at me for explaining how she is unfairly dictating how I want to be perceived. I have been living at home most of this year due to COVID as my college went remote and am staying for at least the fall semester at home and don't know what to say to her to stop this endless cycle. This issue has become a daily argument at this point as I applied to a barista job in my town and she has decided to edit my CV the way she wants it and argue with me to get a haircut the way she wants it to look (something I care extremely about which she is aware of). I love my mom and I know she loves me but this is just getting repetitive at this point, she grew up in a household where her parents didnt really care about her so its my guess she is trying to make up for that by looking over what I do 'out of love'?",20Aug2020,1

Firstly, she's been threatening since I have an ""attitude"" and am constantly crying, even though both of these only happen with her because she's so difficult and toxic. I never want to talk to her or spend time with her because she always brings out the worst in me. I am now eighteen for a month now and still living in the house, but just tonight she wanted to kick me out, but I tried to convince her to give me another chance.

I really want to not like them, since I've had trouble talking to crushes in the past who went to my school, and would have even more difficulty with someone who has no clue who I am.

80,"I don’t know if this is the best sub for this and this is the stupidest fucking dilema but here it goes. 

I ordered an item on Amazon about 6 weeks ago. It retails for $60-80 depending on the day and is sold and shipped by Amazon. When I first ordered it I got the notice saying the shipping label was made but after that every time I checked the tracking it never changed. 

About two weeks later after the possible delivery window elapsed, I called and explained. The guy said the label probably fell off the box and therefore the item never was really processed it happens yada yada we will send you a replacement. I ask for a courtesy credit for the inconvenience and he gives me a $20 Amazon credit and we’re all good. The new item arrives a few days later. 

The other day I got a shipping notification for the same item and I’m like “hmm...maybe wires got crossed idk let’s see what happens” and sure enough the same item shows up a few days after that. I’m thinking, “cool now I have two”.

THEN a few days later I get an email from Amazon saying they accidentally sent me the duplicate and now I need to send it back and that the CS rep on the phone told me that may happen. I know for sure that was never discussed on the phone. And it’s kind of annoying that a TRILLION dollar company wants the item they accidentally messed up and sent twice back. 

So I’m debating whether I want to pretend like I never got the second item or not tempt karma and just send it back. My fiancé said not returning it is fraud and that was a scary word. Dramatic for the situation but technically true.

What should I do?

If I don’t respond at all within 30 days they said they will just charge me card for the item.",20Aug2020,1

Anyways they started posting stuff on their Instagram spam accounts, well some of my friends are following those accounts and sent me a ss of the post, messages about them talking shit and calling me slurs. I decided to message the one who had tried to do the most damage, and told her that she had no proof. She then started calling me more slurs/slanders/etc and told me I was stalking and harassing her and her friend, for literally finding out they were talking shit about me on their spam accounts.  Later I was sent more screenshots of them continuing to call me slurs and try to make me look like a stalker on social media for something I didn't do and with no proof. I messaged her again telling her to stop as there is no need to post it on her account, she continued to call me slurs, accuse me, spam my phone with calls etc. I eventually got fed up and called her a bitch after she called me numerous things even worse numerous times. She then proceeded to tell me that she wanted to ""beat my pussy little ass"" etc and got her bf and some of his friends involved, they started calling me nonstop wanting me to ""pullup"" to fight etc. And even she was sayig she was gonna hit me etc. I eventually told them to fuck off and blocked them. I decided to get a little revenge and made an anonymous account to expose her. She tried to blackmail me saying she would report me to my university for harrassment that I did not do and get me ""arrested/fined"" etc, obviously an empty threat with no proof.

87,"Hi everyone, long-time redditor but using a throwaway because I am very embarrassed by this. 

I am currently 27 F, but when I was a kid I frequented a lot of random chatrooms. There was one I went on often that I, as a naive 14 year old, felt was safe. You had to register your account and I never gave out my address. 

I frequently chatted with one guy and ended up asking if he had MSN. He said yes and we started talking there. Me and this person spoke non-stop for almost ten years. He never wanted to meet or go on cam, I assumed that he was likely faking his pictures after awhile. However, I never assumed he was faking his age. All of the timelines for being a teenager seemed to line up, he graduated at the right time, went to university for the right amount of time. He sent me pictures of his day-to-day life and I never questioned anything because I thought maybe he was self conscious and I just enjoyed having him as a friend. 

One day when I was 22-23, he disappeared and I never heard from him again. Every couple years I’ve tried to sleuth to see if I could find him using the information he gave me and never could. Until today. 

On a fluke I put the email I have I to Facebook and found a profile connected to it. I thought maybe it was a mistake because this guy was considerably older but after some digging, items on his profile aligned with emails I still have from back in the day. 

I’ve realized that the person I started talking to when I was 14 was 37, not 17. I feel very stupid and I’m wondering whether I should confront this person. I am confused as to why this guy lied for nearly a decade. He could have at any point disappeared but kept it up for YEARS. This is someone I stupidly trusted with pictures of myself as a minor and an adult. In fact I could be in the wrong sub, I may need legal advice. I’m not sure how to go about this.

91,"For as long as I can remember my parents have hosted a great deal of our family for Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners. This means there was usually upwards of 50 guests in our home to share the holidays with. I am 23 now, moving out of my parents tomorrow, and they have decided they will do this no more. I understand why they are stopping. Between the two days they usually spend $800 just on food for our guests. My mom has requested that guests bring a dish to pass, but I would say less than 30% of guests actually bring something. My mother is quite anxious so this means she covers all the traditional dishes that have come to be expected. Additionally, family is not respectful of our home. They will track in mud, drop food on the floor and fail to pick it up, leading to it getting smushed in the carpet. They fail to use coasters or placemats for their hot plates and sweaty glasses, wrecking tabletops. My parents are also not the most social people and like to be in bed early, so they are often frustrated when guests stay around longer than a few hours. So instead my mom and dad say they will be going on vacation. That's fine, I'm happy for them... But now I don't know what I'm going to do for the holidays.

The rest of the family simply do not have the space or funds to host others. I expect everyone will celebrate with their immediate families, or head over to a siblings home in smaller, more intimate groups.

My boyfriend was born and raised in Cuba, so his family doesn't celebrate Thanksgiving or Christmas. They are also on the other side of the country.

I am exactly no one of any renown. Just a few months ago, I accidentally discovered a way to design and create a universal language. I use the word language loosely here since you can't speak it or write it. It might sound superfluous but its usefulness is endless... 

COVID has given me a lot of time to dive into the projects that I have always wanted to try and learn from. These include AI, NLP/NLU, programming, and others. On my way down into the abyss, I happened to stumble across something that appears to me, and confirmed to the best of my ability later, as something incredibly useful and valuable to everyone. Any tech companies like Google or Microsoft would see this as a huge windfall...perhaps after I explained it. 

I have already considered that I could be insane and ignored noticing it. But, after seeing it the thing has turned into a heat-seeking parasite and has hit me in the face over and over again. After more research and finding many different projects that can benefit from this, I now feel like I just need to do my due diligence and check with people who'd know better. I have made calls, sent emails, stalked people on Linkedin, and other embarrassing things. I have gotten almost no responses from anyone. 

I am not ready to give up. I can't on this one. I just need some help changing my approach. I know this can help a lot of people and that is what I want to do. I've simply just run out of ideas and I really need help to move it forward.

106,"I also posted this to the Cash App subreddit, but I figured this sub might be able to help more with just general advice.

So I met my roommate at the grocery store after work, and once we loaded her car with the groceries, she left and I walked back to my car alone.  When I got into my car, two guys pulled up beside me and offered to fix my hood, which had been dented from an accident.  The one guy was really putting on the pressure and I’m super bad at saying no to people, so I just kinda fish-gaped at him and he ended up fixing it.  Tl;dr it was fine and the hood was fixed, and so I made a cash app to pay him and left.

Well, the payment got “refunded for your protection.”  He requested it a few times as well and I tried to pay once more, but it didn’t work.  I have his number and he told me in the cash app notes to call him but I am absolutely not comfortable giving him my phone number.  My roommate is telling me to just block him because he did harangue me into the whole thing but I really don’t want to feel like I’ve scammed him.

I’m also just wondering how I learn to say no, and be more assertive in general.  I’m a 23 year old 5’4”, 95 pound woman, so I’m a relatively easy target for people when they’re trying to sell stuff or bother someone.  I *was* worried about potentially being followed or something, but my roommate came back and we took a look at my car and we’re home safe now, so.",20Aug2020,1
107,"I had a friend I was really close with in high school. We always used to hang out together and I could tell her anything. We both considered each other to be our closest friend, besides her also considering one other of our friend that way too. I was really good friends with that girl, but my friends was closer to her. We were all in the same group and all were very close. She wasn’t the only friend I had, but we were close.

In our senior year of high school, I had a psychotic episode which kinda affected all my friendships. All my friends thought I was crazy and at the time all my delusions revolved around a boy in my grade. 

Summer happens and we all have a good time. 

University then starts, my friend goes to a party college that out of the city and ends up rooming with the same girl she also considered her closest friend. I go to a school in my city that I could easy commute to because I want less debt in the future. This school has a reputation for being a boring commuter school, where student just go to class and leave immediately. There’s not social life at this school, unlike the school my friend goes too.

I didn’t really have any opportunities to make friends at university. I was had psychosis and whoever I talked  I probably scared them away. In my second semester I had to drop out (for that semester), because I was involuntarily hospitalized for a month and then returned. So I had zero opportunities to make close friends, but I did make a lot acquaintances though facebook study group chats. 

My friend and the other friends (her roommate), became very close. They end up making new close friends, while I had depressed, lonely and dealing with serious mental issues.

Summer comes around and we videochat three times, but haven’t hung out once. She’s only been hanging out with her new friends. I haven’t been completely lonely, but been hanging out with three of my other good friends. I did ask her to hang out but she said she wasn’t available for two weeks because she was hanging out with her other friends. She’s going to a cottage with them for a week but what are you doing the other week. She invited me another day with her roommate (which is also my old friend), but they ditched me and went with a guy on tinder.

Maybe I just need to come to terms that our friendship isn’t going to work out long term, she clearly doesn’t want to put any effort and prefers hanging out with her new friends. I still go have my three other friends that I’m close to and do hang out with. It’s so sad because we have been good friends for 7 years and she’s been one of my favourite friends.

I think my anti psychotics are making me depressed (which is a common side effect), and got me thinking dark about everything. Me and my psychiatrist were talking about prescribing antidepressants, but I wanted to wait to see if it gotten worse. Now I consistently think about having no friends and this is the first time I’ve had thoughts like these, because this never concerned me before. I know in my school it’s hard to make friends and I’m pretty sure I won’t make any good friends there for the next four years. I still have my three friends but somehow that doesn’t satisfy me. I think if I take antidepressants I’ll stop overthinking this.",20Aug2020,1

I have cousins and each have children that could be the spitting image of their parent.

113,"TW for suicide attempts and abuse.

My mom's unwell. She always has been, and it got to a point where something in my mind just... shifted.

I'm 20. I moved with her and my step dad from Canada to Kentucky January 2019, and now I'm planing on going home. I have my dad and really close friends to help me out.

A lot has happened, and I've learned quite a bit. And I'm starting to come to terms with the fact that my relationship with her might be a lot more problematic than I thought. I think it's had some serious impacts on me over the past few years, and I need to get out and be with different people. I'm working out plans for travel with my friends, and I'm going to talk to my dad again tomorrow to work out more details. I have no idea how to navigate this.

I don't want to make this long, but I think a little bit of explaining is necessary about where she's at. She's told me multiple times that the only reason she's alive is because of me, otherwise she would have probably killed herself (this usually comes up when she's explaining that she loves me). A few years ago she took all her pills at once then decided not to break at an intersection. She's mentioned self harming. She seeks out harm from others, verbally or physically. I've heard her say things to my step dad like ""why don't you tell me you hate me,"" and although I'm less certain about it, I think she's also said things like ""why don't you just hit me"" kind of stuff. She had a physically and sexually abusive partner a long time ago, and from what family has told me she would sometimes actively seek to provoke him (no, it is not her fault she was abused, I absolutely do not think that). I don't know. She's got a lot of baggage from her entire life and won't get help. She just says things like ""I'm depleted"" or ""I can't anymore"" or ""I just need someone to help or tell me what to do,"" but when someone tries to say something as simple as ""do you want to talk about it"" or ""what do you need"" it's met with exasperation, being overwhelmed, anger, or more about not being able to. She has gone to therapy, but she isn't right now I don't think. She seems unwilling to take part in her own betterment. I'm sorry if this was described poorly, so please let me know if any clarification is needed.

All that being said, I actually don't talk to her a lot. I've never opened up very much at all because she is very hard to talk to. And for the past several years I've grown pretty apathetic about life and sort of emotionally repressed. But I've changed. I'm trans, I finally accepted that, and that little act of being myself kind of broke down a bunch of walls. I want to do things in life again, have goals and pursue them, and overall I'm feeling so much more confident in myself. But I don't think I can do that living with her anymore.

The plans look to be around early September. I haven't even remotely hinted at having plans to leave, and I feel like it's going to seem very sudden to her. She does know I don't want to be here though. On the other hand, I don't even want to say anything until last minute, because I'm not sure how it's going to affect our relationship and I still have to live here for a few weeks, but that would be shitty of me. She might think it all has to do with being trans (which she's not completely on board with), but it doesn't at all. I don't want her to be angry with me. I don't want her to become emotionally overwhelmed. It's so hard to tell what will set her off. And I know she needs help. I don't think my step dad really knows what to do. I don't know what to do. And at the end of all this she's still my mom and I love her, and I feel terrible for potentially adding on to everything negative she's already dealing with, and I have no idea how she'll react.",20Aug2020,1

116,"My wife works at 1 location of a 2-branch daycare center. The owner of the facility wants to retire and sell us 1 of the branches. Both branches share the same name and are within 3 miles of each other. Average tuition across both branches is ~$9000/child. Branch A (the location where my wife works) has a capacity of ~100 kids. Branch B has a capacity of ~50 kids. The owner wants to sell us Branch B. It seems that the owner wants to split up the 2 branches and sell Branch A to someone else, but hasn’t yet decided who she wants to sell Branch A to. The daycare as a whole is well-established, and has a great name in the community across both branches. Both locations are always filled to max capacity from year to year.

It sounds like a great opportunity, but to me, the glaring issue with all of this is the fact that the owner wants to split up the branches and not sell both together. By splitting them up and selling someone else Branch A, it will create a new, direct competitor for us, who is using the same name as us and will create confusion in the marketplace. 

Not sure what her motivation is to split up the 2 branches, but will need to have a conversation with her about it. But I’m lookIng for some advice as to if this concern valid? What would be a good way to present this to the owner to persuade her to sell us both branches?",20Aug2020,1

120,"TLDR: A good job offer from a good company, but at a bad location. The schedule should allow for me to continue my education while working. It’s not where I want to work forever, but would be a good place to get my foot in the door to this career.

I’m 22 and in school to become a power plant operator. I’m currently in my internship and they are going to offer me a full time position at the place I am interning. This will let me start work a semester earlier than the earliest the school allows. I will still be able to finish my degree.

The job market for power plants is a little right and it’s hard to get into a job without prior experience.

The location is 6 hours away from my closest relatives/girlfriend, but I should be able to go home once a month. I think this will be satisfactory for my standards. The company only offers jobs that are far away from my hometown. 

The pay will be better than anything I’ve seen and the company culture is good and the company has a future. The benefits are good.

My boss is very intelligent and I can learn a lot from him, but he lacks proper organization. He is a single man running this whole place and a lot of industry standard organizational things have been neglected here for administrative tasks. I’ll spend a lot of time reorganizing everything.

This is not the exact type of plant I want to work at. It’s the most simple design possible and I want to eventually learn all the complex systems involved at other styles of plants. This plant very rarely runs so I will not get real daily operational experience to know instinctively what to do when something goes wrong.

The schedule here is 7:00am-3:30pm and on call all the time which is great considering most power plants have rotating 12 hr shifts. This Provides time for me to do homework after work. I plant on completing a bachelors after I finish this degree so that would be super helpful as long as I’m not called in too much.

My thoughts now are to take it, get experience, finish school, and then find a new job. I hate to lie, so should I tell them when they give the job offer that I don’t plan on being here in 5 years?

The company only wants me to work here, so I don’t think I can get a job at another location within the company (which only come
Around rarely because people like the company and stay here a long time).

Let me know of any other questions you have.

Mainly these tesrs have all said I was alright, apart from my existing, rheumatic damage.

I saw the report and it was very detailed and left very little question as to what they found. A mass affecting at least 2 areas. Yet, when I went to the specialist to be assessed further, they claimed they can't see anything, at least not in the area they examined, and basically sent me away empty handed. They made no further recommendations and seemed to want to wash their hands of me. 

As I have never been in a situation like this in my life, I can't say if any of this is regular behaviour when specialist A disagrees with Radiologist Bs assessment, but it feels very, very weird that I was treated that way.

Ages -&gt; Im 17th and the girl is 17 too

About 3 years back, I fell into love with this girl. I'd keep thinking about her everyday. I don't think it was plain infatuation, I was pretty head over heels over her. 

I never spoke to her for like 1.5 years. I had confidence issues (Not anymore :) ). So then in the december of 2018, we started to text, pretty casually. It was going super well, it seemed as though she was into me too, she even asked me for my number (we texted over instagram). That kept going on for like March of 2019 where the conversation slowly went dry. Until then I only spoke to her in person 2 times. Never got into a relationship with her.

Sadly, it turns out she and her family transferred to another country. By then the texting totally ended and for the next 3-4 monthes I kept thinking about her. Then I decided to try and move on. Occasionally I keep getting thoughts of her and of scenarios I could've done better in. Its only getting more frequent now. Its as though I've not completely moved on. 

Just today, which looking through her posts (I had unfollowed her in an attempt to move on) I got pretty jealous when I noticed one of my friends who has never spoken with her (as far as I know), had commented in one of the posts and recieved a reply.

I haven't texted her in the past year and now Im considering sending her a birthday text in the coming monthes. Im not sure whether texting someone out of the blue like that is creepy or what, I havent been good with social interactions. But then thoughts of her keep coming up. 

So should I text her, or try my best to move on.",20Aug2020,1

The moment the pandemic started, things changed. I fell out of my routine and I lost my job. I think those were my triggers to start this feeling of being inadequate. 

I was struggling with the fact that I couldn’t get a new job. My logical side kept telling me to give it time, it was normal considering the situation. But my insecure side kept telling me things like “I wasn’t skilled or resourceful or any good”. Luckily I was blessed to finally get a new job, that I’m happy in. I thought going back to work I’d start feeling better. I was wrong. I keep feeling like an absolute failure for changing my course of study and school resulting in now delaying my graduation, even though deep down I know it was the right decision (having done very well this past semester). 

Then comes my body image issues. I’ve never been confident about my looks, and even at my most confident, I don’t think most would’ve considered it truly confident. I recently took photos of myself because I felt that I was making these feeling up, I am not physically ugly. But the moment I saw the photos, I just started to cry. I try to find the source of these emotions and I maybe I shouldn’t, I should talk to someone about it but I’m not sure who. I’m tired of hearing the “beauty is on the inside” “start a fitness journey, it’ll change you”. I want to feel pretty and confident. I sent my partner a few nudes, trying to not let myself retreat and hide. Their reaction was a compliment to my smile and then changing the subject. I was already uncomfortable with how I looked in the photos because 1) i have let myself go a little and don’t feel so in shape anymore 2) I feel like part of my partner is disappointed (for the lack of a better word) with my physique. Not that they make me feel ugly in any way, I’m not sure if it me or reality, I feel that if they could change my body they would while I find them to be utterly perfect physically (and every other way). It’s not just with them, which is how I now it’s not their fault/intention to hurt me. It’s always. I wore a dress the other day that I used to love, but the moment I was out in public i felt ridiculous. The moment I got home, I changed.

A lot of my childhood seems foggy especially from 4-12 years old and honestly I’m not really sure I can remember much specifically about my home / school life from then. So I was thinking perhaps I may have some repressed memories.
There are some specific things that cause me emotional/ physical distress: even the mention of animals suffering traumatises me (to an unnatural extent) and any idea about physical attraction between people also distresses me and somehow makes me hate myself.
Perhaps an important thing to mention even though I feel bad about it is I feel really uncomfortable around my dad. Has hasn’t been very present in my life (he’s in the army) and I barely remember him in my childhood. But especially in the last few years I’ve felt specifically uncomfortable around him . Sometimes he does weird things like stare at me for a prolonged time like he doesn’t notice it and doesn’t get that I don’t like being touched ( I’ve specifically told him that I don’t like being touched by anyone) he won’t listen and has jabbed me in the waist.

I’m 19 years old and I’ve just left home for the first time in my life. 

My parents are extremely religious Muslims who raised me conform to their beliefs and values. 

Growing up, I slowly detached from my parents’ faith and realized that I didn’t really agree with a lot of Islamic teachings, and eventually realized that I wasn’t really a Muslim. I kept this all hidden though, because if they knew they’d go ballistic and probably kill me. I’d always fantasized about leaving and starting a new life somewhere but given my limited prospects I didn’t really see much opportunity for that.

I was forced to wear a hijab when I was 10, then a niqab at 14. I dropped out of school when I hit puberty at 13 because my parents didn’t want me to study with boys. I studied online for about a year before I got caught watching a movie and talking to friends on Twitter, and then I was forced to drop out of that too. I basically haven’t studied past the 9th grade. I don’t have any friends, because apparently “your parents are your friends”, I’m not allowed to pursue my hobbies (reading and writing) unless they’re compliant with Islam, and I’m not allowed to leave the house, or drive, or do anything unless it’s with my family. My whole life I’ve watched people do the things I love without being able to participate. I’ve watched countless opportunities fly by just because my parents made all my decisions for me.  

Three days ago, they found my browsing history. They figured it all out, that I was watching tv shows and talking to people online, etc. and I got my laptop taken away from me. My father said he wanted to kill me, and he swore he’d never let an electronic device touch my hands again. He said he’d make me suffer until the ‘sin’ was forced out of me and he didn’t care if I went mad or died in the process. He said he wasn’t going to let me live my life like that under his roof. They called me a whore and said I was “sick”. I was kept under 24 hour surveillance, they timed my bathroom breaks, they forced me to sleep in their bedroom on the floor. I wasn’t allowed to be alone for even a minute. And after all of that they said they were really hurt because I lied to them and that they loved me very, very much.

I could see literally my entire life playing out like that until I died. I’ve been suffering in misery for almost 7 years now, forcing myself to stay and do what they said because I didn’t wanna hurt my parents and make them sad. I guess this was the final straw, I dunno. Last night I just packed all my shit and grabbed all the money I could get and I left at 3 A.M. I’ve checked into a hotel and I left my parents a letter explaining everything. I don’t know if they’ll read it.

I’m trying really hard to remind myself that this was necessary for my survival, but holy shit I am freaking out right now. I have my passport and my birth certificate and a fair amount of money and that’s pretty much it. When the money runs out I’ll be homeless and that’s a terrifying thought. I’m also really scared my dad might call the police and find me. 

I was just wondering if anybody knows any resources that might help me leave the country and find asylum somewhere? I know it’s not a simple process, and with COVID everything is like, 10 times more difficult. Still, though, if anybody knows of anything or if they can do anything to help, I’d really appreciate it. Any tips or general advice for situations like mine would really help. Stuff to just make me stop panicking lol. I don’t have anybody to go to and the money will only last me for about a month or two, max. After that I’ll be fucked, pretty much. Hoping I can somehow make it out by then.

I want a life that I love and people that I love and good memories and COVID-19 is preventing me from pursuing goals to better my mental health. 

Instead of living at college for my senior year, I’m stuck at home with my family where there a lot of negative vibes. I love them, but I think it would be better for my mental health to get out. I also can’t drive or go anywhere. I hardly leave the house or see/call anyone. I’m also not doin well in school. I feel lonely a lot and want better friends and a relationship. At school before my attempt, I had friends and I was generally happy, dating and getting involved and making memories, although I do admit I did still need therapy that I wasn’t getting. Right now I’m trying to find a therapist to get my life back on track. But I really wish this pandemic would be over because I missed most of college life due to either health issues or the pandemic and now I won’t get a senior year. Sorry if this seems like complaining I’m just devastated. Right now it’s like I’m doing nothing in life and the pandemic isn’t helping. I’m still recovering.",20Aug2020,1

138,"Hi

I live in a super nice building that costs $2500-$3500 per apt to live in, in a 60 unit building. There is one maintenance guy who lives on the premesis - and the rest of the management company is in another state. The pool was closed at the beginning of a pandemic, but he and his family still use it all the time without masks on. They never wear masks. They want to get onto elevators without masks on, and he lives with his mother a few doors down from me. They leave mops out in the hallway, hoses (like a big thing that a hose gets put on that holds the hoses, large trash cans, and right now there are cleaning products and a dryer plugged into an extension cord - running in the hallway. The guy and his mom are starting to use the area back where they live (which has a common area for tenants) as a storage space for their dirty mop water and various other tools, and they trickle out into the hallway that I share with this apartment. 

I know it's not life ruining, but I have never paid this much to live in an apartment and I think it's gross seeing this stuff all the time.  The maintenance guy smokes in the parking garage (it's a non smoking building) in his car, and there are cigarette butts now by his apt. There are sometimes alcohol cans in the pool area (which is supposed to be closed) - and just, I just don't want to walk out of my apt and seeing a maintenance shed.

What is the non-asshole thing to do? I mentioned this on the phone prior to the one woman I speak to in the management company, but I did not specifically ask for it to stop. The woman who lived in the apt directly across from the maintenance guy just moved out, so I think that's helping him feel comfortable leaving stuff everywhere still. His mom also leaves carts with dirty rugs and trash on them out there. Not for an hour - but either a full day or more. One thing will go away (trash cans with rakes and brooms sticking out of them with flies everywhere, for ex) only to be replaced by something else.

Also still not sure why there is a need to run a dryer in the common hallway with 3 empty apartments just on our hallway alone currently. 

I have had a leaking a/c unit since I moved in and have had a lot of issues getting this fixed (thankfully right now it's working), so I was trying to pick and choose my battles. However - if I came to look at my apartment with how this hallway looks right now as a prospective tenant, I would never move in to be honest.

They didn’t even care to take the time to talk with me. I don’t have a good relationship with my family and I don’t have many friends. One is someone I have known since kindergarten and we only get together once and a while because she is always so busy (and willing to drop me for someone/something more interesting). My coworker is a pretty good friend of mine who tend to offer me shitty advice (like how I should have stayed with my abusive ex) but, we talk often. She actually was very bitchy and distant with me in the days/weeks after I told her I broke up with my ex. That hurt me a lot. I just feel so angry about everything, about life and I just want to push everyone and everything away so I can be alone and not feel any judgement from anyone. But being alone is scary and sad. I know that we, as humans, need support and we need friends. I’m just so fed up with my shitty friends and I have no hope. I’m not a fun person to be around.

146,"My parents got divorced in 1996 and my mother later remarried. They divorced because my father was irresponsible with money and alcohol; a lovely man and dad but just irresponsible. My mother met someone, had twins in 98 and got remarried in 2000 whilst my dad was starting a relationship with a lovely woman in the town he lived in.

My dad eventually told us that him and his partner were having a baby. I was about 7 at the time and was so happy, ever since my parents split up me and my older brother had stayed with my dad every weekend so we knew this woman well. When our brother was born we weren’t there and she instantly kicked my dad out. He was given no explanation from her. My mother emailed this woman telling her that she understood her because she’d divorced my dad and knew him. She told this woman that she had allowed my dad to have a relationship with us because me and my brother had done nothing wrong and shouldn’t be punished by taking their dad away. She urged this woman to allow me and my brother to have a relationship with our brother but she responded with threats of calling the police if my mother tried to contact her again. For a few years we would send birthday and christmas cards until we got a letter asking us to stop.


Fast forward to late 2018. I had found the woman on facebook a few years prior and had messaged her every now and again pleading with her to let us meet our brother. By now, our sisters were 20yo, I was 24 and our brother was 26. I finally found him on instagram but as soon as I messaged, he showed his mother and she sent me a lot of scathing messages about disrupting his life and that he knew about me, our brother, our younger sisters and that I need to leave him alone.

I made a deal with her, that I wouldn’t look for him or message him as long as she messaged me privately about him and his life. She told me what she’d told him about his dad not wanting him (not true, my dad loved him and you couldnt even speak his name around him or his heart would break). She told me why she left my dad and basically everything. She gave updates every now and again.

In November 2018 my dad got diagnosed with two late stage cancers and were told he had 9 months. Both sides of my family didn’t want this woman to know anything about my dad and didn’t even know I’d been in contact with her. She’d told me that if I told any member of our family about our contact and they tried to contact her she’d block me and never speak to me again.

By mid 2019 I realised I couldn’t not tell her or I would forever live with the guilt. So I told her my dad was dying and didn’t have long. She at first thanked me for telling her but then was angry at me that I put that on her and that she wish she’d never known. She decided not to tell her son. She decided not to tell her son that his dad was dying and that this was his last chance to meet him.

My dad passed away late 2019 and as he died he asked me to tell Daniel that he loved him. I want to be angry and say the worst things to this woman but I can’t because she will cut off contact. He is 16 now and one day he will decide for himself to meet me and his brother but his mother controls him right now. He is going to hate his mother so much when he finds out his dad never left and always loved him.

I have always wanted to meet him but now it’s different... I want to meet my brother and my dad’s son, I miss my dad and I want to see my brother and see how much he takes after him.

Now to my problem. Since a few months ago I have this weird pain in my chest. More like my heart area, my left arm and left shoulder. When I sit straight it's all good, but when I move or lay down, it's really bothering me. Can't really sleep most of the time because of that. A few weeks ago I got really sick. It wasn't covid ( that I got checked), but it followed me 2 weeks and since then i still cough and my lungs feel ""dry"". I know that I probably should go to the hospital, or at least to a doctor, but I have 2 problems. My first problem is that I really fear going there and getting some kind of diagnosis like : You need a heart surgery, or cancer( big possibility, because many in my family died to cancer). My second problem is: everytime since ever, when I had a medical issue, or problem, my Family rediculed me. ""oh common, it's not that serious to go to a doctor."" or ""I really think youre overdramatic. You just have a cough. Drink some tee."" ""you're young, you can't have any serious problem."" because of that I feel really guilty going to a doctor, or even think about it.

154,"I (25F) can't stand birthdays. My birthday, your birthday, the dog's birthday, anyone's birthday. It's a pretty simple thought in my mind but I don't know how I compare to other people and their perceptions of the holiday. I don't think it's something special, I think it's a waste of time and money, and I wish birthdays didn't exist. This is ruining my relationships with friends and family and I don't know what to do anymore.

Details: I grew up in a *flawless* home as a child. I had a loving mother, a hard working, caring father, a kind and caring older sister, a dog, a cat, a nice house in a nice city, with a nice living style and standard of living. Lots of family, friends, and anything I could possibly think to be happy with. Around 10 years old my family started falling apart. The ""festive"" grandparents I had both died within 3 months of each other, parents divorced, sister developed an insufferably narcissistic ego (because my parents seemingly fought over her and not me in the divorce), we lost the house in the '08 housing snafu, cat and dog both died, dad lost his job because of depression, mom moved away... blah blah blah... By the time I was 12, I had become a miserable wretch and hated just about anything that acknowledged my existence. Everything began to feel fake and forced. Birthdays were still met with ""Happy Birthday"", some gifts, and cake. Some were better than others but they all felt so fake because nothing about the event actually mattered and it was obvious that people said it out of obligation and not because they actually cared. Especially when it came to my parents as they felt they had to prove they were the better parent by sucking up to the kids in the hope that they'd choose to live with one over the other. There was no flair like there had been. For the next 10 years, I basically portrayed a greater apathy towards birthdays because of the toxic environment I lived in. I hung out with scummy people and barely had a family anymore. It wasn't as much as that I had never had something, but so much had been lost. Through some degree of introspection, I decided to turn myself around and go to college, learn some stuff, and get myself on a decent path. I did all that but I never found myself able to shake my distaste for birthdays. I healed my relationship with 2 of my family members and made some new great friends (left the old scummy ones). Lo and behold, a birthday arrives and I tell my friends I don't like birthdays and I don't want any gifts or celebration. I told my family members as much, as I do every year, and I received a mix of responses. A handful of my friends wish me happy birthday, some of them even sent me cards through the mail. This just makes me feel like filth because I can't find it in myself to reciprocate without feeling/sounding like a hypocrite and because I truly care about my friends and their feelings, I worry that no matter what I do isn't enough. My family members (those I have reconnected with) sing of happy birthday and some send me gifts/cards in the mail. One of the 2 family members I recovered actually started yelling at me because I told them I didn't want anything and they got frustrated because they always spend so much money buying my sister gifts and not buying me anything makes them look bad. I didn't even know what to do with that conversation. 

I understand that some of you will probably tell me that I have good friends and family members who care, but this is a *deep* honest disdain for birthdays. I always tell people I don't like birthdays and would prefer that nobody did anything for me. The single holiday is probably the one and only thing I now truly hate in the world after changing my life in the way that I have, and I can only imagine I'm lucky enough in that regard. I just don't know how to move on from this. I've tried embracing birthdays but it puts me in such a bad place that I end up in a type of psychological trap and can't function.

155,"alright. So this is going to very descriptive,  so I'm adding a trigger warning here, read at your own risks. I am 19 years old now, When i was around 8 years old continuing on till I was 12, my father molested and raped me. He put it all over the internet, and the feds caught him for it. He was put a way for life, the judge said it was the worst case he'd seen yet. I forgot most of it because of trauma and what not, sort of holes in my memory. Although all the legal crap involved after his arrest was tiring for me as a young teen. I at the time was also being molested by my uncle who lived in the same household as me and my dad. I never told anyone, because unlike my dad's case, I had to be the one to tell, not the police, and it scared me. After the arrest I moved in with my mom and i never spoke to my fathers side until last year when I turned 18. 
 I had tricked myself into thinking that maybe they had changed,  that maybe my uncle(lets call him jack)  wouldn't do the same things he used to do. I visited him in his home state, and before I knew it he was finding excuses to feel me up on the couch, and more. Now I dont know if many people would understand how I reacted unless they have went through similar but I had reverted back to a very Stockholm syndrome-like state, as i had with my dad. And I basically went along with it, to the point where I was just going along with him telling me he wants me to be his wife etc, over text and all. And it wasn't until I felt some escape (when I came back to my state) that I would start to freak out and relive what happened. It made me feel disgusted that I had literally let it happen, over and over, and pretended I was okay with it. Well skip forward some more. A few months after that had happened I couldn't bear keeping it secret, I almost lost my job because of the emotion involved.  I told my mom, who in turn told me that I should tell my aunt and uncle (lets call them jill and luke) because they had direct association with uncle Jack, and therefore I wouldnt be able to escape hearing about him and running into him when he comes to see Jill and Lukes'. So I did. It went on for quite a will that everyone kept quiet about it, until recently. My mother told my aunt Tracy about it and she flipped out, and is pushing me to act while I still can. I just wanted to ask, because of my going alone with it, would I have any chance bringing it to a court setting, without it being considered consensual? I want to see him punished for molesting me not once when I was little girl but twice when I was a grown adult, but i dont know how to go about it. Would It be worth it?",20Aug2020,1

159,"I'm about to turn 30 and my sexuality, since a really rough period (psychotic episodes) last year, completely changed. I didn't had a nice childhood and was sexually taken advantage by a guy since I was 8. I kept shut my whole life about it and was living normally I had crushes on girls, jerked off to girls etc. But I feared that what happened to me affected me badly. So in actual sex I always got panic attacks when with a girl and stressing out what if it doesn't work. Am I gay. But I would later jerk off to a better version of what happened with a given girl. But since last year I noticed a sharp decline in my libido which I attributed to stress. Then came the psychotic episode and my life went upsidedown. I thought I will go crazy. I started noticing guys. Which made me more anxious and crazy. I couldn't jerk off to girls anymore. I just couldn't. It stressed me out too. Now a year later I still haven't regained my sexual attraction to girls. I recently started jerking off to imagining guys which feels creepy. But my penis oddly works better. One solution is that is HOCD. And the other one is that I am actually gay. It freaks me out. And since it all began last year I fell into depression. I see my friends living life to their fullest and I can't be with a girl because it won't go hard anymore. I still love women but what do they need me if I can't get it up?  I am even starting to forget how horny I was for women. If there weren't pictures and screenshots that remind me I would have forgotten. Women were my driving force, now I don't have anything.

163,"Hi everyone, I would really like some advice about what my career options and life path might be. I graduated as a chemistry major with a concentration in biochemistry. I finished with a 3.91 GPA with multiple awards in my department. I did not get research experience, but worked as a volunteer EMT part time for a year, on top of various odd jobs.

My plan was to apply to Medical School. However, due to severe depression and anxeity, I am currently unsure and am taking time off. I am going to apply this cycle and the next, so I would hopefully start when I am 25 and 26, which just seems so old to me. However, I have a lot of mixed feelings about whether this is right for me. But I also don't feel like I can really do anything else I am interested in with my major and experiences.

If medicine does not work out, I would have liked to do things with the environment or animals (or anything that is in demand that pays well), but I don't know if there are suitable programs or fields for me and my major (I would HATE to go back to undergrad, i want to move forward). I would really hate to spend my life working in a lab, which is about all else I feel like I can do with what I have. 

I do really like medicine but am very scared about if I fail somewhere along the way and then I'm drowning in medschool debt. But at the same time I feel really locked in with no other options and feel hopeless. Im 24 and don't know what else I could possibly do. Any advice, reassurance, or potential resources would be SO HELPFUL. Looking at things online just makes me feel more and more depressed about my future, and I'm not getting any younger.

167,"Okay, please hear me out.

I know i've been bisexual since around 2018 when I was 18, when I thought fuck it, and started watching some different kinds of videos on the internet which sparked something i didnt know I had in me before. I'm 20 now and since then I have been with a few men and trans people and can safely say that im not 100% straight. I am having trouble deciding on whether or not I should come out and need advice.

The first reason is obvious and easy to explain, my parents are christian. My dad wouldn't care but my mum is a little homophobic. (She'd never treat LGBT people like shit or abuse them but she definately doesn't want me or any of my siblings to be gay and has made that very clear). This doesn't bother me too much; if I ever wanted a boyfriend in the future then I guess it would but rarely do I find myself romantically attracted to men/trans. It's mostly just sexually attracted. I don't see myself marrying someone male since I do eventually want to have kids of my own with a maternal figure but hey I'll cross that bridge when it comes way later in life.

The second reason is the big one: I dislike the LGBT+ community. 

**This is coming from my experience**, so your experience may be different**. In my opinion**, LGBT people are less tolarant of others than conservative people. I see them (and mainly just other white women) ""pushing for freedom and equality"", proclaiming that they are progressive ""activists"" and the ""opressed minority"" in a ""patriarchal world dominated by old white men"". I live in Melbourne, Australia. This is undoubtedly one of the most progressive left-wing accepting cities in the world. When I see people protesting in this city, demanding ""change"", I really don't understand why.

Don't get me wrong, I do think that corruption and opression exists, but to say that all the burdens to LGBT people are the result of old white men frustrates me. I don't see why people would push for acceptance in what is objectively one of the most accepting cities in the world.

It is still illegal by the death penalty to be gay in many countries such as pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Afghanistan. I don't see LGBT people talking about that. Surely that would be the first thing on the list to cover? Maybe the fact that Nigeria recently passed an anti-gay law that means homosexuals can be jailed? Instead these ""activists"" are getting offended over tweets celebrities made 10 years ago where they use the word 'faggot'.

What deters me even more is that these people don't push for change, they follow trends based on what they see in the media, reposting something they see on social media and call that ""activism"". Reposting things on social media does not solve problems, it just makes you look lazy. 

My LGBT friends are all like this too, and while that doesn't necessarily make me want me to stop being friends with them, it just makes me cringe. It is also so common amongst the gay community **where I live** that they have no skin and can't take anything that will hurt their feelings in the slightest. Straight people I am friends with joke about each other, we laugh and poke fun. But LGBT people I know have such a sooky hissy fit when someone, for example, jokingly calls his friend gay. 

I can understand that people might not want to hear things that pokes fun of their identity but it reaches a point where it's just a bit too far.

I cannot give my opinion on how the LGBT community is treated in other parts of the world, this is just my perspective Have any of you experienced the same thing as me? Should I come out of the closet?",20Aug2020,1
168,"I am a USA resident and am pessimistic about the trajectory of the country, especially the prospect of it becoming a police state. I am thinking about taking a direct flight out of the country to Albania (one of the few countries still accepting USA citizens) the day before the election and waiting to watch the aftermath from overseas before deciding whether or not to come back. There are a few concerns I have though:

(1) I have enough money in the bank to last me a few months, but I will eventually need to find a job.

(2) I would essentially be an illegal immigrant to some other country, so I don't know how that would work out legally.

(2) Guilt. I'm a coward for leaving and not standing up for our country.

169,"I don’t feel safe in the house with my older brother. 

He is bigger than both of my parents and is autistic but but in the low spectrum. He causes a lot fights, not physical.

He has gotten worse as the years go by.  I don’t feel safe with him because about 1 month ago I found his journal (by accident, he has the same type of journal as i) containing a lot of hate for me, and saying I should watch out and he has something coming for me. The next day some full on pissed on my bed. We believed it was the cats but they have never done that for the 10 years they have been living here. 

One time he got angry while he getting closer to my mom. It was so bad I tried to grab a knife but it out of my reach so I yelled “fuck you” to distract him.

That one time is the only one out of a hundred like that.

A few minutes ago I heard my brother talking to himself so I snuck up to the door.(I know it wasn’t right.) 

I couldn’t really exactly hear what he was saying but I THINK I heard “I might kill off the family” and saying my name in other sentences. 

If I talk to my therapist about this am I going to be removed from my family? 
Because the rest of my family is functional.

I don’t know what to do, some nights I stay up because I’m afraid he’s going to do something. I’m 13 and he’s 16.

For some context, my friend's Aunt died a few months ago and it's definitely taken a toll on his mental health. Something is obviously going on in his family that is making me believe he's being mistreated but he wont tell me. I've been trying to be a good friend while simultaneously managing my own mental health, but sometimes it just feels like too much.

He's is a great friend IMO and I wouldn't trade him for the world, but sometimes, having to monitor both myself and him puts a strain on our relationship. He told me how he's actually homeless and lives in a car with his Mother; he wont tell me who he is living with now.

172,"I hope this is the right place to ask this question, apologies if I am in the wrong place. I included a TLDR at the bottom. 

I believe I have some more severe anxiety related to noise, in particular, music. It really bothers me, on a level that I'm starting to think is rather unhealthy. If I am just at a mall, walking in a park, etc., music is totally fine. But when I am in my apartment or working at my office, music has started driving me completely nuts. 

While there are plenty of times throughout my life something similar has happened, I'll use today's issue as an example. I just got some new neighbors. As my partner and I were starting to go to bed, I realized I could hear their music playing. Loud enough to hear slightly but not loud enough to ask them to turn it down without seeming like a total nut job. I have ear plugs that I use when I sleep, and my partner said he could sleep through it fine, but I became (and still am) completely stressed. Even though I couldn't hear anything through my ear plugs, my mind started wandering...

What if it is like this every night now? What if they have parties on the weekend? What if they play music during the day and it interrupts my work? Where would I livestream (my job has me on live video every day)? I can't afford to break my lease, and even if I could, where would we go?

This cycle of thoughts is keeping me up and I'm so worked up I'm not able to sleep. I just found myself pacing around the living room listening to the music. I recognize the behaviors as not normal and irrational, but I can't help my heart from racing and my anger from boiling. The situation is made worse by the fact that I just discovered I'll be working remotely full time until at least March 2021, so having a quiet office space is really important me. My partner and I are not in a place financially where buying a property is financially responsible (and prices for single-story housing around here in general is ridiculous). This is all to say: the music is something I need to get accustomed to. If it is not egregious, I need to learn how to cope with it and not let it completely derail my life. I don't know how to do that, though. 

TLDR; I am extremely 'triggered' by unexpected music in my apartment/work space and I don't know the right coping mechanisms to handle my stress, anxiety, and anger.",20Aug2020,1

My attitude and approach to taking care of my dog is being calm and assertive leader. There are things that I have built up with my dog. His trust is there and he is usually very calm around me.

176,"So I just bought a house and moved in a week ago. I had been letting my dog out in the backyard and have had no issues until about an hour ago.

I let the dog out as usual and was scrolling my phone for a few minutes when I noticed my dog sneezing and drooling/foaming pretty bad. I immediately grabbed the spray hose and began flushing out his mouth. 

It wasn’t until I grabbed his face that I noticed an extremely pungent chemical smell I have never experienced. It smelled almost acidic, kind of like a burnt chemical. 

After flushing his mouth for a few minutes, he didn’t seem to have any more physical reactions but the smell stuck to his snout area like gasoline. I took him inside and bathed him and after a thorough scrubbing the only areas it still lingered were on his nose and tear ducks.

It’s been about 45 minutes and I’ve been closely monitoring my dog and he’s had no excessive drooling, abnormal behavior so far other than rubbing his nose on the carpet and licking his paws, which I can only assume is an irritation from the chemical.

Idk what the chemical was but after giving the dog a bath the smell traveled inside and on myself as well so I took a shower. Also, I went outside to spray the slab right outside my back door and there appeared to be slight suds coming off the concrete and lawn chairs right outside.

The only thing I can think of is that maybe it was some sort of pesticide contamination but when I tried looking it up I couldn’t find any descriptors like the smell I experienced.  Also, I read that if someone is spraying close to you they are supposed to notify you which didn’t happen. I have the contaminated collar sealed in a ziplock bag and don’t know if I can take it to someone to identify the smell? I don’t know who or if I should call someone to report this.

178,"I’ve lived my entire life in a tropical climate and have never really had to worry about my nose lol. The few times I got to travel to the US during cold weather, I would always notice my nose on the inside would get really dry, to the point that the inside walls would start bleeding. I used to think it was me not adjusting to weather cause of the small time frame of a vacation. However, I recently moved and settled in a place that has cool weather for most of the year. Today, I noticed my nose is getting dry again, and it’s bothering me a lot. 

I am not sure if I need to give my nose some more time to adjust to the colder and dryer weather, or if there’s something I could buy (or a remedy I can try). I thought about a humidifier for my room, but I’ve never used that, so idk if that’s something that helps.

182,"I am a 26 year old man. I have 2 children and an amazing, supportive fiancé. I have struggled with drug addiction my entire life. In March of 2017 I got clean and stayed sober until around last October. I just recently got clean again after impatient rehab. I am now coming up on 90 days again.


Here's my problem. I caught my first felony at 18 for smoking weed with a minor. So immediately I felt like it was impossible to get a job. I graduated high-school but its tough to find a job with a record so I worked under the table doing construction for my grandfather for about 8 years. But that option is no longer available to me. I caught a second felony in 2017 before getting clean and when I relapsed the last time I totalled my truck. 


I want to find a better path and be able to provide a life for my kids and future wife but I have no idea what to do, where to look, or how to start. I have barely any money left and there are no jobs close enough to walk to and I would have trouble finding reliable transportation.

184,"I’m going to attempt to portray the argument as well as possible, but it’s probably still going to be biased, so please keep that in mind. Anyway.

Today I was talking to a friend about having trouble focusing and she said something like, “yeah my add is wild.” (She has add, I do not). Now, some people will probably take issue with my reaction to this, but here goes: I dislike it when people do that, at least in this sort of context, because it does two things: 1) by using it as an excuse for her actions, it makes me feel like I have none for mine, and so makes me feel bad about myself, and 2) shifts the conversation completely onto her. Now, I know my reaction to that sort of comment isn’t the best, but I’ve been friends with her for 4 years now, and I’ve never ever said anything about it, and I’ve tried to stop myself from feeling that way. But I have failed. So today I decided to ask her not to say it. She reacted by saying that I’m, “toxic,” and, “I don’t know why you let it bother you...” (even though I explained that I tried my best... for four years... and also that other personal reasons could be impacting my feelings [i might have autism]), and saying that, “it’s like when people ask you to stop talking about gay stuff because it makes them uncomfortable” (we are both in the LGBT community somehow or another). Now, some backstory. I was her only friend for two years when she was really depressed, even though it was hell for me too, I stayed because I care about her. So I told her that I felt it was unfair that I had sacrificed so much for her but she wasn’t willing to stop making comments like that if it made me uncomfortable. I also said that part of the reason I dislike it is because I’m only 17 and I’m not fully mature yet. She said, “I gotta be honest I feel like you’re making me suppress something about myself (like you do with sara), and you’re not gonna actually know the real me. But, I guess that’s just how it will be from now on, until you grow some more.” Ok. So, apparently asking her not to make a specific comment (I also clarified that I didn’t care about her talking about ADD in general,  but I did care about the specific context) is suppressing her? And sara is a friend of ours with RADICALLY different political beliefs. I’m a bit of a centrist, she’s far far far left wing community anarchist (the contradictions), and she looooves talk about politics. When my friend said that, she was referencing the fact that I ask sara not to talk about politics around me because they always start fights (she bashes people who don’t agree with her when she talks). The argument continued on, but the rest is pretty irrelevant. I say that some of it could be my fault but that I think she needs to do xxx, she says something about how I’m right and I do need to work on that, and then it keeps going around and around.

Originally the plan was to close down until everyone got tested &amp; got their results back but within a day that was changed to opening back up to full right away like nothing happened, including our tap room.

However, the problem was I live near the border between Canada and United States and he was from the States. So, there was no way we could meet up with everything going on.


During this time the talk of dating came up and we sorta had a misunderstanding and it made me really upset because he basically assumed ""us talking every day"" was me being clingy...and that ""what if I turn out to be like his siblings gf who was crazy"". First of all I don't know why he thought talking often was clingy? It wasn't like we talked every hour of the day and it wasn't just me who started the conversation so I never understood what happened there.

Another problem was that I have international minutes and unlimited CAN/US texts but the international minutes only included certain countries. I told him that and ever since then he never really messaged again and eventually stopped messaging. It's been around 3 weeks and I really miss talking to him. The last text he sent was saying how he missed talking to me and felt bad about the phone bill. This was because I thought I'd get charged and I told him that for now I can't call but luckily those were incoming calls so I didn't get charged. I couldn't get back to him that day because I was really busy with work and exams but I did get back to him after 2 days which I know was really really stupid of me but I was extremely exhausted that week to even check my phone. 

Now this is where I don't know what went wrong. He told me how he was lucky to have met me because of what he was going through and I helped him through it. He also kept telling me how he would be ready to wait since he felt the connection and so did I. But since then he just disappeared...

Now looking back at it I feel even more stupid. It lasted for a few weeks till I found my way to a subreddit called R/threekings where users would post their made up rituals and include fictional backstory to it however I was quite gullible and believed all of it and people kept telling me it’s all real and it has all happened in their experience. This research on “rituals” would soon last a month and a half. 


One day I decided to join a occult server to ask about a ritual I found online. They told me it’s all fake and BS and kicked me out. I soon got paranoid I’ll be cursed or hexed and I asked my situation on Quora and everyone told me That I’ll be safe and nothing will happen; but I didn’t listen, I kept asking more and more and started to research the psychological effects on witchcraft and magic itself. What kept me going was things like high upvoted answers on people experiencing feelings of demons and other things like that.


Soon enough I went on another server to talk about my situation and someone told me their story on Haures the demon which  weirdly she knew I was paranoid about “magic” and decided to talk about something related to the supernatural. You can probably guess I got paranoid about demunzzz and in which I did. 


If you look in my profile there will be some demon questions and I’ve had Mutiple reddit accounts, maybe 4-5 full of demon questions. Not to mention my Quora accounts which are in the high 7-9s. My mind wants information and easily forgets it and soon wants the same info I’ve already read in the past while keeping doing this I fall into more demons and asking more questions, kind of like a wormhole.


I’m currently having therapy but my therapist is at vacation or something like that. The session costs $80 and the therapy sucks (maybe because she’s a social worker?) I’ve racked up around $600 already in payments but luckily my fathers company has insurance and pays for the therapy. My therapist/social worker usually tells me the same exact things every single time for the past 6 sessions and not trying to get to the core of my problems. My mother has sent a referral to the hospital and is awaiting a reply for 3 weeks (even though my mom says 1 1/5) we’ve tried calling them back but no response. My next therapy session will start during my school hours so I doubt I’ll be able to attend it, in addition school starts soon so I’ll probably not be able to concentrate on my schoolwork which I never do. My parents are starting to say they’ll cancel my future therapy sessions for reasons like “it won’t work it hasn’t worked ever”, “therapy only works if you only help yourself” and my brother who says things like “you can’t be helped” I’m starting to get a few suicidal thoughts from this research and I can’t stop even when I give my electronics away which always fails. At the end of the day my parents say things like you never listen to us etc. Is there any advise I can get and should I have therapy?

200,"I work in retail in 8 hour shifts. I handle stocking of general merchandise and the heavier lifting that needs to be done in the store due to my physical fitness as well as register work.
Next week I will be on the register for 40+ hours and my manager requires that all employees must wear nitrile gloves for the duration of work, sanitizing the outside of the gloves between purchases. 
The issue is that I sweat. A lot.  My hands have had holes torn in the skin due to being in a humid/wet environment for prolonged periods of time and I don't think I can wear gloves for that long starting next week.

Please Reddit, I can't lose my job over not wearing gloves. Is there any way to either sweat less or make wearing gloves bearable?",20Aug2020,1

202,"A little background: I(23f) live with my parents while I pursue my education. I have one older sister(24f) who has moved out. My parents and I have two medium-large dogs living with us who are about nine and ten. While both are fairly large and can be intimidating, they are shy and mellow. They're the type of dogs that will just nap at your feet quietly.

My sister had two dogs with her ex. When they broke up my sister took the dogs. Now the thing about my sister is that while she is not malicious, she is incredibly irresponsible and frankly,  inconsiderate. So when she moved to a smaller apartment (her second move after the breakup) she basically dropped her dogs at my parents house ""just for now"", but we all know she likely won't take them back. This was about six months ago.

Now the issue: my sister's dogs are both around 1 and medium sized dogs. They are high energy and they never got any training as puppies. As a result, their play style is aggressive. They have a nasty habit of jumping on us and play biting our wrists. Or trying to nip at our heels. The big problem is that they will start ""playing"" with our older dogs and it will end in full blown fights. Usually the two new ones will gang up on one of the older dogs. They've done this with the nine year old and it has led to some nasty wounds. 

This has caused some major frustrations in our household. Everyone is upset with my sister as this is like the visual representation on how she pushes her responsibilities on others at their expense. However the more practical issue is we don't actually know what to do with these dogs. I'm afraid one day they'll push me or one of my parents over and really bite us in their excitement. I'm afraid they're going to mortally wound the older dogs. I'm really afraid that if one of the older dogs is mortally wounded, my father would feel extreme levels of guilt over it as he sees their safety and care as his responsibility (as we all should). My father has major medical issues and does not need that kind of stress.

Both are pitbull mixes, so rehoming would be near impossible. Even though my sister is moving to a place with a yard, we've found that she is such an irresponsible pet owner that sending them back isn't  happening. There is no obedience trainers in my area, so that's out.

These dogs are not viscous dogs, but they are exicitable to a dangerous point. Does anyone have any advice on what we can do with these dogs?",20Aug2020,1

205,"Hey Reddit! I'm at a crossroads in my life and honestly have no idea of what I should do. I am a recent college grad and I decided to do what so many people do, move far away from my small hometown to a big city.  So in August of last year, I officially made the move.  I was able to secure a solid job that I thought I was going to be at for the next few years, but then covid hit and unfortunately I was laid off in March.  Unable to find anything new since, all the downtime has been pretty hard and has me thinking I made a mistake in moving here and being away from all my family and friends.  With the lockdown, it took away everything I moved to a big city for (entertainment, nightlife, sporting events, etc). I've been contemplating moving back home to the parents to save money (extended UI ran out and weekly is only $170) until I can find something else closer to home but since there are very few white-collar jobs in that area I could take a further hit career-wise.  This is pretty vague and loads of people might be in a similar situation due to covid, but any advice would be appreciated.",20Aug2020,1

I absorb knowledge like a sponge, especially with direct exposure. I don't have a remarkable background to speak of, and am a part of the lower economic class. Practically everything I own is a hand me down afterall.

My parents are getting older and it's clearly beginning to take a tole on them, providing for 5 kids and all. They try to hide it, but the serinity of their facade is crystal clear: eye bags, excessive medication, slump posture, elevated irratability, etc.

I want to become self-sufficient, maybe even help relieve their burden. 

It's been drilled into to me since my pre-k years that college is the guaranteed path to success. Quite frankly though, I don't trust it in the slightest.

because of my mouth, and lack of privacy, there’s a lot of gossip about me and as mad as I am at the people who’ve spread it, I’m more mad at myself. 

the only explanation why i tell people more things than necessary is because I feel like it’s a way of being myself and transparent for the other person to understand or to relate to what I’m saying with a personal story from them, but like I said it ends up with them using it against me. 

i don’t really keep in contact with the people that do gossip about me but it does bother me what stories and narratives that’s projected on me.

218,"- Girl meets guy from bumble for the first time at his nice home. No date first, just straight to the house at about 8:30pm.

- Guy has a very good job in an area where many men do not have good jobs. Girl sees that this guy is doing well for himself.

- Girl sleeps with guy the night she meets him. (Guy also slept with girl as well, both parties consented). A condom was worn. Condom did not break. Girl left about 15 minutes later.

- Girl continued trying to contact guy to hang out after their initial meeting, but guy wasn’t very into it. He responded with short responses. 

- Guy did lead her on a bit, in that he didn’t directly tell her that he was not interested, and agreed to meet with her for about 20-30 minutes while on an errand....because he wanted to make sure there wasn’t something there. There wasn’t. He continued kinda ghosting her, kinda responding to her.

- Guy meets other girl shortly after who he was very interested in. He started spending all of his time with her and eventually a post on social media was made. Not a sappy “here’s my girlfriend” post. Just a post indicating that he was spending his time with another girl.

- Shortly after public post with new girl, previous girl messaged him saying she was pregnant. She swore she had not slept with anyone other than him and that it is his.

- Girl did go into a Wendy’s bathroom to take a pregnancy test for him to prove it. He handed her two. One “fell in toilet”, one came back a very bold line positive....very early in the pregnancy, according to the dates she was giving.

- Dates seemed all too perfect. She took a pregnancy test the day one would have shown up positive and contacted him. Her first pregnancy confirmation appointment was the very first day she could make it, according to the calendar. No clinic will schedule you before you are 6 weeks. She texted that she’s definitely pregnant and had documentation from the doctor to prove it, but wouldn’t send it via text. Only if they met up. 

- Guy is terrified of having a child with someone whose last name he didn’t even know. Terrified that the courts will rake him over the coals for child support. Feels as though life as he knows it is over. Realizes he’s made a terrible mistake by sleeping with her.

- New girl thinks about leaving, but instead decides to try to see things through knowing that the likelihood it’s actually his child from a one night stand with a condom is very low.

- Weeks of stress and arguing ensue for couple who should be in honeymoon phase. Both start to wonder if they’re good for one another. 

- Guy decides to schedule a prenatal paternity test, which is about $2k. Girl agreed to test. Appointment was made and confirmed with clinic and with the girl. Girl said she could be there.

- The day of the appointment, girl does not show. Guy texts to ask where she is and she blocks his number. He texts her on another app, and she read the messages and then blocked that one as well.

Some of the things I’ve noticed is that he always faces towards me, I feel like he makes an effort to sit next to me, he responds pretty quickly, he looks at me when he laughs, he’s pretty touchy with me with play fighting, we have quite a lot of inside jokes, he makes a bit of an effort to hang out with me and my friend, when I’m not at the place we sit at yet I notice he looks in my direction quite a lot until I come over, he initiates conversation a little bit but it’s mostly me, he tells me personal shit sometimes even though he’s quite a closed off person, we have a group chat which me, him and a friend call in pretty much everyday, we walk to class together, and we’re gonna match costumes for a Halloween party. He teases me a lot, obviously it’s a mutual thing. The things that are throwing me off a bit is how sometimes he’ll look at me when I’m talking but he’ll kind of ignore me unless I talk to him first? He’s kind of a dry texter, sometimes when I teases me I get scared he’s serious, sometimes he walks off without me, and sometimes he will barely put in any effort in an irl conversation.

So when i come home I offer to help or just randomly go do things around my house. The big part is she gives me problems about not helping not doing things correctly that she wants done a certain way, stuff like that, like even when i’m on the game ( keep in mind a online game aka not pause-able) i will stop playing mid game and go do what ever she wants me to do. At this point yea ik im on all the time, only because ill be able to get in like maybe 2 games of cod like less that 5 minutes each ,before i get complaints about her wanting to watch tv. Im really lovable I tell her how much I appreciate her. But at this point idk if i should just stop playing and loose myself/ take away what helps me stay ok (not saying she doesn’t have a help in making me happy). I work full time and am also a volunteer firefighter for a small town right out of the town we live in, so its not like im a lazy bum or anything that plays all the time. I dont drink ,smoke ,flirt ,cheat. She always gives me issues with the fact of im never mad or upset ( because i play)...  my biggest times i play is when she is in the shower ( which is too small for the two of us so if anyone replies take a shower together and make her feel closer that wont work) the other time is every once in a while when supper is being made ... i cook with her and for her all the time, and every night I do the dishes. I go to the basement with her when she does the laundry because she doesn’t care for it ( don’t blame her looks like a horror movie). I just feel like she doesn’t want me to be me anymore and just wants me to be some body pillow that watches tvs and movies all the time and i can never just play a game for the night for a few hours without her giving me a dirty look and going to bed. It has effected our sex life as well like she sometimes gets out of the shower while im trying to sneak in one lousy game of cod for the whole entire day in and she will go to bed, as if i cant change it to Netflix or something in half a second. My issue is that she will play games too but its fine for her to play as well we have two Xboxs and i offer her to play together and she totally has no interest in it . I try to comprise or at least meet halfway and nothing ever works. All she whats is to watch a movie every night.

OK NOW I KNOW I SHOULDNT HAVE YELLED AT HIM CAUSEITS NOT MY RELATIONSHIP BUT I DID. AND PART OF IT WAS FOR ME CAUSE HE DOES THE SAME THING ON FT WITH ME WHERE HE JUST SITS ON HIS PHONE.

so fast forward i yelled at him. he was like how do you even know that? so i told him. and then he just didn’t answer and said something like ‘its my life just shut up’ so i tried telling him like ‘dude girls get mad at simple stuff like this u cant just do that and except her not to be mad’ he didn’t answer but he read it. so i yelled at him again and then he just stopped responding. he would open it but not respond. 

i felt bad so i texted him ‘ik ur mad at me but ilyyy and im sorryyy’ just to try and be nice cause i did honestly feel bad. he opened it and didnt say anything so i just said ‘wow’ and he said ‘ya.’

this happened after i lost a lot of weight and i'm not used to this much attention or any attention at all 

there's people that will literally follow me wherever i go. for example a few times at the mall a group of kids or people followed me to every store i went and some were standing outside the store watching me. then this one kid followed me to the bathroom and stood there watching me when i was at the urinal, like wtf?

or if i go to the corner store like cvs or something the people that were in their cars would follow me into the store 

it feels like i'm a celebrity but it just blows my mind that i'm actually that attractive to attract this much attention. i don't dress too flashy either, just a plain colored shirt with cargo pants or shorts... i have a full sleeve of tattoos though and i'm pretty sure that's what draws a lot of attention, i rarely see people with tattoos here

i live in a small town and i'm thinking that could be why because people aren't used to seeing a good looking person? i'm going to be moving to florida and i hope i don't suffer the same fate

We talked about dating back in May this year, and we agreed not too, she didn’t quite feel the same, and has been pretty hurt by guys in the past, and said she honestly just wanted nothing more than to be single.

I accepted ages ago it was best for us to not date, and I really don’t want a relationship with anyone that doesn’t love me back, and we’re still great friends, so I’m fine with all that.

However today, I was hanging out with her and some of her other good mates, and I don’t think I was supposed to see it, but happened to notice her making out this one other dude, who she’s been mates with for a long time too. I’m now feeling like I’ve kind of been lied to and betrayed, and I’m pretty hurt that she wouldn’t tell me something like that.

I get people want to keep stuff like that private, but I’d consider her one of my best friends, and I’m pretty sure she would consider me something similar, we’ve talked about some super deep stuff in the past and what not, and I don’t know why she would keep it from me, especially as she knows how I feel about her, and and I would have liked if she had just told me.

233,"Well, this quarantine has been the absolute worst for me; before things went on lockdown I usually just escaped the house by going out on myself or with my friends, do whatever, find any kind of excuse, even if that means enrolling to Math classes I never wanted, just to get me out of the house. and avoid my asshole brother who's always had a huge ego and would threaten to destroy my stuff and treat me like crap as a way to assert dominance. And now that I can't do it, the past 5 months have been absolutely horrendous.

My mental state is probably at its lowest, and with no clear direction on when this pandemic is going to end (if it's going to end, at all), I can see it going lower. At this point in time I already want to strangle him until I earn his respect, or at least not have to worry about earning it.

Obviously, I haven't gotten low enough to actually do it; the want to do it is there, but that's wrong for obvious reasons. But if I don't address him, which is one of the problems I have this quarantine, then there are other ways. I suppose I could run away, but it isn't a viable option considering there's a pandemic and no one would take in a stranger into their house. I also suppose I could kill myself instead. But I have things to live for, and I'd very much prefer to have him killed than have myself killed.

People say ""find someone to talk to"", but who even? If I went to your DMs, I'm pretty sure no one would handle a stranger going into their DMs and handle all that trouble, exchanging their mental health for a stranger's.

So, what do I do?",20Aug2020,1

236,"So I've had this headache for a week or 2 now and I can't tell if it's serious or not, I've tried evaluating my situation using headache charts or online videos but I can't tell what is happening. 

For those who are willing to give advice, I have pain on my forehead leading to the back of my head, along with pain sometimes residing on the top and the right side of my head. When I first looked at it I thought it was just the normal tension headache as said on charts but I couldn't tell what the pains from my top and sides were about so I couldn't make a conclusion. It may not be related but I get nosebleeds too, but it happens when I touch my nose. (Example: I wash my face, scratch my nose) but it happens for a short period of time and it goes away. I've been prone to nosebleeds since I was young but it didn't happen this often. ( I get it almost every day).  The head pain does go away from time to time or when I take a shower or when I lay down for a rest. 

 If someone has advice or can help, please do. Or if I'm just being stupid and it is indeed, just tension headache. Also if anyone has advice to get rid of those headaches, that would be also greatly appreciated.

I work for a spirits brand that has a lot of photos that we use for marketing, advertising, websites, media releases etc etc. There are thousands of photos and they need to be accessed by up to ten different people. A lot of the photos show the same thing (eg the product on its own, the product with a drink etc) so we are looking for a way to get them better organised and searchable.

We currently have them all saved in the company Dropbox in the folders that have been sent to us by the photographers. Currently if we need to find an image to use it involves searching through multiple folders and viewing hundreds of photos, which is completely inefficient. 

Were looking for a way to organise them so that they are searchable by tags, and also potentially make notes on them eg - for what publications they were used for. 

We are happy to spend a little bit for an app or a monthly fee, but some that I have previously looked into (Canto, Brandfolder etc) were way above the budget were looking at, and also probably have too many features that we wouldn't ever end up using.

I have looked at Mylio [www.mylio.com](https://www.mylio.com) which looks like it could work, but I just thought I would put it out there in case anyone has a better suggestion or app that they could suggest?

246,"Salut Redditors!

As the title suggests, thanks to the current global plague I am currently separated from most of my stuff and would really appreciate your advice :)


Up until recently I was living and working overseas on a temporary work permit, but because Covid travel restrictions struck while I was on vacation in a third country I had to return home. Having to return home meant I also lost my job (but not my ability to re enter the host country eventually once things improve). 


I'm currently being put up by my family which is a godsend, thankfully. 


So my apartment which is still full of my stuff that I'm still paying rent for is shared with another roommate. 


To me, it seems my options are:
A) Wait, and hope that I can travel back to pack up my place myself in the near enough future, or

B) Enlist the help of some friends based near my place to pack up my stuff and get it shipped to my family address, and terminate my part of the lease


I feel stuck in limbo as I don't want to trouble my overseas friends with having to deal with my stuff to sort/sell/pack/ship it (I'm not a minimalist by any means) but I also can't commit to a new job and life here at ""home"" until the apartment is dealt with. As much as I could just abandon an apartment worth of stuff, that's not going to happen. 


My preference would be to wait a bit longer and fly back but this Corona situation seems to keep dragging on and preventing me from going back, which is hurting my savings.


What should I do? Are there other options y'all think I should consider? Thanks again in advance!",20Aug2020,1
247,"A little backstory:

I am 19 years old. This fall semester is my second semester at the college in my hometown (I started in January instead of August). I have no issues with college, except for this small thing called COVID-19. I was having a great time last semester when it hit the world and shut everything down, effectively cancelling my first semester of college. Now that I'm back for the fall, I have a feeling that classes are soon to go online (likely once the refund deadline has passed), and the spring semester is going to be cancelled, leaving me to sit in my apartment with my part-time job to pay rent.  


I am also running out of money. I barely have enough to pay for this semester, and will need to take loans out next semester. What ever happened to the days when you could have no loans and your house paid off in your 30s?

Anyways, for myself the way I see it is that I can...

A) Either suck it up and accept that you won't have a 'normal' college experience and take the tens of thousands of dollars in loans to get a degree, even if it takes 6+ years.  


B) Start working. I would absolutely love to be an EMT/firefighter, but I've also looked at construction related trades.  


C) Military, Navy perhaps. See what happens after the 4 years of service, get free college and possibly become an officer/use the degree to get a job.

Thanks to anyone who replies and gives advice. I know to take advice from strangers with a grain of salt and do what's best for me but I want to see the way others would handle my situation.",20Aug2020,1

251,"My birthday is around the holidays, and if I want to do anything I let people know well in advance. About two months out I confirmed the final numbers for the trip double checked the price of the air bnb with the group. I paid for the Airbnb and told people how much they owed me I received all the payments except for one person, my friend of seven years. She said that she would pay me back and at the time I thought nothing of it because she was my friend. 

I had let everybody know about the dates of the trip 4+ months in advance, and had let everybody know to book it off. So it was a big surprise to me when my friend of seven years messaged me the day of departure, that we were supposed to go on together that she was scheduled to work. So looking at the amount of time that she would have to get to work and get to the destination I double checked with her and asked her if she was coming at all, she confirmed. 

So the day of her arrival comes and I message her and ask her what time she’s going to get in, no response. The day of my birthday comes I ask her if she’s coming at all, no response. At this point I was concerned for her safety so I reached out to her and asked her if she was okay, no response. So I decided to just wait it out and figured she would reach out to me when things had cleared up. Then it occurred to me to check her social media, I checked her activity and she has been going on as if everything was normal. That’s when I knew that she wasn’t coming and she was fine. So now that I know she is okay now I’m starting to get irritated she owes me over $300+ and I am a student it took me a long time to save up this money and if she would’ve just told me she couldn’t make it I would’ve gotten a cheaper place or something.  

Anyways, she is not returning my messages and this is when I decided I needed to calm down a bit. I decided to let a couple weeks go by then I reached out to her again on all social media platforms and no response. I waited a couple more weeks before I decide this is it, and I blocked her. 

A couple months go by and I decide to reach out to her again just to collect the money, essentially the gist of the conversation is she thinks because she didn’t physically show up to the destination that she does not owe me the money for the trip she paid me the money I leant to her before she he trip and that’s when she stopped responding once again. What do I do? Should I even bother continuing to get this money or should I just drop it?

SIDENOTE: This was the first time I’ve ever travelled so I was really scared about going out by myself in a place I am not familiar. 

Essentially I ended up spending most of the trip in the air bnb because the other people who confirmed only could make it on my birthday and she was the only person who said they’d be able to be there the whole trip. We left the morning after my birthday party.

She also owes one of the other girls in the group money too because she paid for everyones tickets all at once for an event that we attended on my birthday, but she also thinks that she doesn’t owe the money cause she wasn’t there, we all confirmed before she bought the ticket.",20Aug2020,1

259,"Hey guys,

I graduated with my MBA in 2019. I concentrated in marketing and my BA was in Communications. Pretty standard degree, nothing special but I can speak and write relatively well at least. I took a job (foolishly) out of college with friends that ended in an international business trip gone wrong and me leaving the company after only three months. 

I then took a job working retail while I engaged in a longer job hunt that ended up with me working through holiday retail until I found a job doing something very similar to my first job (basically account management with no sales component, aka talent management). I was promised 70k at first but when COVID ramped up, the new offer letter was remote instead of California living, with a paycut down to 60k/yr with a few small benefits that I dont really take.

2 Months in, I find myself struggling to relate to company culture (very fake California vibes) and dont look forward to work any day of the week. My actual work itself is not engaging for me, I still do it to the best of my ability, but I never feel intellectually engaged, even when trying to apply myself. To be frank, I don't have any certifications or anything that bolsters my resume other than working for my school and a couple internships. During COVID, I've been able to put away every penny I make as I'm staying with my family until things clear up a bit more. I'd like to get out and back to my own place asap when social distancing measures are relaxed/people stop being crazy. I'm open to moving anywhere in the world for a job I would actually enjoy.  


**I guess my question is,** is it better given today's job climate to stay in a job that after 2 months in, I don't really see myself ever enjoying, just because I don't think there is a better option currently, or should I begin my search now while I have the financial security of my current job.

260,"I posted this over on the relationships forum, got nervous about posting it, and took it down. I'm still looking for some unbiased input so, I thought I'd try this sub.

I've been dating my current boyfriend (30M) since last April. We were set up by mutual friends. Our first date was the best date I'd ever been on. We went to dinner then spent the night driving around talking about anything and everything. He and I immediately clicked. We share a lot of similar experiences and interests. We also have the same sense of humor. Even our differences balance each other out. For example, he's very mechanically and scientifically inclined, while I'm more literary minded and more of  bookish. He's also incredibly smart, sweet, loyal, funny, and hard working. He's got a lovely house on three acres and we have a puppy together. He's everything I've ever wanted in a partner and, I am positive I will marry him one day.

Now, this past weekend, I ran into my ex (34M) at a party. He and I very briefly dated at the beginning of 2018. We were also set up by a mutual friend so, I knew the type of person that he was beforehand. Unlike my current boyfriend, my ex was, and still is, very different from me. The main difference revolves around religion. He's very, very religious while I consider myself to be agnostic. He's also very conservative while I'm much more liberal. In the back of my mind, I knew we wouldn't be a good match. 

Normally, I wouldn't have gone out with him due to those factors. However, I'd broken up with my long term, long distance college boyfriend a few months prior. I was in that sad, vulnerable, post breakup state where I wanted to be back in a relationship. When we went out, I was happy to be back with someone and I fell ""in love"" with him quickly. I totally ignored our differences and, instead of calling it off after one date, we let it go on for much longer than we should have. 

Oh his part, he had little to no dating experience, primarily due to his, what I call ""old school"" religious beliefs and his general awkwardness. From what I understood, a man telling a woman he's remaining celibate until marriage can be a turn off. So, I think he was simply excited to have a woman be interested in him, especially a younger woman. I was 25 and he was 32 at the time.  

Eventually, he was the one who came to his senses amd realized our differences made us incompatible. What really finished it for me was when he said, if we were to get married, I would basically stay home, take care of the house, and have babies. That is not the kind of life I want at all. Frankly, I was very insulted because, the way he said it made me sound like I'd be a baby machine. After that realization, we went our separate ways and everything was cool.

That was until I ran into the ex at a party this past weekend. It was kind of awkward and I mostly acted like he didn't exist. However, for some reason, I started thinking about our ""relationship"" and what went wrong. I also started thinking about the what ifs and what would've happened if we'd stayed together. This makes no sense to me. I have no desire to get back with him. Hell, I don't really have much respect for him anymore after the whole baby factory implication. Why though am I thinking about someone who is so obviously wrong for me?

265,"   This is a very sensitive subject so don’t read on if you are unable to deal with reading about sexual abuse. 
   My grandfather molested me when I was very young, around 2-4 years old. He did this to MANY other women in my family when they were young girls, including his own daughter and my mother. My great-grandmother didn’t report him because she “didn’t know what to do”. She was worried about struggling financially without him. I resent her for this. When my sister and I told my mom about the abuse, she scared us by being very overbearing and we wouldn’t speak about it after that so he was never charged for anything, not a single time. 
   My whole family sweeps this under the rug. Though he is dead now, it hurts me every day. I struggle with getting the abuse out of my head every day and my family will post pictures of him praising him all the time on social media. All of these people know of and either completely ignore or deny the abuse. They post these tributes to him knowing many of the girls he abused will see these photos. My cousin even messaged me about a song and said it reminded him of our great grandfather. I replied by saying I didn’t want to be reminded of him. 
   I’ve been told when bringing up the abuse to my family that I’m “bringing a dead man’s name down”. I don’t know if I’m being overly dramatic but I have so much anger and hurt in my heart and I honestly just have no idea what to do. My family disgusts me and I don’t want to see his face anymore.

In return, the sugar baby will receive large sums of cash, lavish gifts, etc. Sex is not always involved).

Also, disclaimer, I'm not personally against B's hustle. But, I confided in my mom and boyfriend, and they seem pretty concerned for my safety. Honestly, I have no idea what to expect out of the sugar daddy world, so here we go:

At first, B told me she would make several hundred dollars per date, and that she only goes out with guys less than 35 years old. Then, in about a week, suddenly she's telling me about a guy offering her $15,000 A MONTH for her time with an eventual promise to buy her some sort of Ferrari, but she has to sign a ""contract."" When B told him that she wants the relationship to stay platonic, the guy argued back, ""well if I'm paying you that much, I kinda expect some sex to be involved."" No word on if B signed this bogus ""contract,"" but right before I was about to go to bed, she told me to set an alarm at nearly 2am to call her ""pretending to be drunk"" so she would have an excuse to leave his house.

When I asked B where she was going and expressed concern for her safety, she accused me of ""momming her."" 

Fortunately, B came back in one piece. No word if she's still hanging out with 15k dude, but a few days ago, she showed me a stamp book another sugar daddy gave her. The stamp book was fascinating! It had stamps from the 1800s and from all over the world... then B pointed to a stamp that was supposedly worth $200,000, and showed me others worth thousands of dollars.

B told me that this new sugar daddy had three of these stamp books that he somehow obtained, but he didn't have the time to validate the stamps. He told B that if she could validate the stamps, he would sell the book and split the cost with her. Apparently, his coworker offered 20K for the book. He asked to take a picture of B's ID before he gave her the book as a reassurance she won't take off with it, and luckily, B was smart enough to refuse giving out her ID. She also uses a fake name.

I just thought this whole exchange was weird. Why would a stranger trust a random teenager he just met with an item potentially worth hundreds of thousands of dollars? Apparently he's just gonna sell it for 20K after all and give B 5K for it. Again, this all happened in less than a week.

When I told my boyfriend about everything, he told his dad. My boyfriend's dad essentially recommended that I distance myself from my roommate, even if it means breaking the lease on my apartment. My boyfriend and mom are worried about my safety because they're afraid B's risky lifestyle is going to find itself directly in our apartment.

And, this might be me being paranoid, but I thought I heard B pick up her phone today, and I thought I heard a male voice call her by her fake name. I heard B give the address to this person... (the walls in my apartment are super thin). Again, I can't confirm that this *was* a sugar daddy (could have been a Tinder guy), but I'm paranoid of that now.

So, people of Reddit, what do you think? How would you handle this? 

tldr: roommate meets up with sugar daddies, some sugar daddies seem sketchy as hell, mom and boyfriend are concerned for my safety",20Aug2020,1
267,"I think my wife is controlled by her sister. I think my wife's sister is getting money from her. I'm very ill and I think the sister (who has nowhere to live and her friends live right around the corner from me) wants to cause my death or divorce.  In the past I didn't mind my wife helping out anyone, but we always told each other. Her sister doesn't work and thinks she's TOO GOOD to be accepting welfare. I have checked all our accounts and nothings missing, basically everywhere I look, everything is fine, but I get the sense, somethings going on. About 18 months ago my wife had this thing about knowing where all our identification documents were, using an excuse in case of a fire. Then her Mother got ill and I wanted to go and visit her Mother, which I'd usually do, but this time I wasn't allowed. Now, what I have noticed everywhere we go we have weird people hanging around us and my wife seems to do shit that draws my attention away.

She made me go to a hardware store and buy something that I don't need for another 6 months and this was in that period where the government was asking everyone to stay home unless necessary. We went down the isle where the product was and immediately followed, actually from nowhere a guy  rushed up right behind us and he was grinning, nearly bumped into me as I'm becoming aware something smells in my life and as I entered the isle I immediately turned around. I was on one side of the isle and he just hung on the otherside looking at two stroke oil and to me pretending search his phone about it. just hanging around. I sat there for at least 10-15 minutes, I felt like this was a setup, then my wife was saying check out the barcode to make sure the product is the price we want. She knows I'm having trouble with my vision. She kept doing shit like this. Eventually I said this is the one, then I grabbed it, we left the isle and I decided to double back and look for the guy and he was gone.

We were at a store looking at a cupboard, right near where her sister's friends live and to me their were other places we could go and we know what cupboard we want. Like the previous case in the hardware store, this always happens on a Wednesday or Thursday night. So I was watching her. This saleslady showed us a cupboard but my wife held back for a second and lost sight. Then this woman came into the store and even though she was approached by a saleslady she didn't seem to want to be helped. She just walked up and down and around, but never came anywhere near us and absolutely not looking at any products. She was walking around doing nothing for 30 minutes Then I saw her head towards a cupboard where my wife was when I lost sight of her. My wife dragged me into another section of the store and then when I came back the woman was gone. It was then my wife decided to leave the store, before that I was asking to go, but she wouldn't.  I saw her out the front in her car texting someone.

When it first started, everytime we'd shop, she'd wait till we got to the check out and say I forgot something. This happened everytime we shopped. Then I questioned it. For example one time when they first introduced the limit on milk, all the warning notices were removed about how many. My wife was saying she needed to buy some for someone at work (she doesn't like this person) so we bought 8. We walked straight from the isle (isle 10) to the check out where the girl said we could only buy 2 long life milks. I grabbed 2 and said can you get someone to return them and she agreed. My wife however said ""How embarrassing"" grabbed the other 4 and walked to isle 3. I questioned her about this and she said I was imagining things. So from then on, she'd flip it up and tried to send me away from the check out. I was at one store when this happened, when this girl with a kid of the same nationality as my wife was hanging around like a bad smell. We were at the check out and she was hanging around there. She'd just come in the shop and basically headed straight towards the check out and was just hanging there pretending to look at milk. My wife said ""I need a plastic bag"", so I took off as quick as I could to get this bag and when I turned around, this woman and child were heading quickly away from my wife, my wife wasn't that close, but this time the check out chick gave me a really dirty look, then she stared at my wife back to me and a really hard stare at the woman and kid who were then heading away from my wife and then back to me. She was quiet and just looked at me with a strange look as I was paying her.

Then on Sundays something similar happens. Last week we washed the car and my wife was claiming to make sure the cars windows were up using the buttons on the drivers door as I was outside getting the equipment ready. It was too long and I think she rang someone once and hung up. Even though she denies doing this one ring hang up before, without any doubt I have caught this. When I started spraying the car down, she moved further and further away. Then she moved closer to the edge of the pump room and on the other side of this pump room is a road and then a fast food carpark and stood next to this pump room and said she was avoiding the spray, but I get the feeling not, normally she sits in the car.

It seems to me, we give her sister something on a Wednesday or Thursday and she gets it back on a Sunday. My life seems very regimented, try and flip it up where we are going and I can't.

Sorry if this was long but I'm very ill and if what I'm thinking is happening to me it's abuse and I've always put my wife first and I think that's what has made her sister jealous.

Thanks to anyone that can give advice.",20Aug2020,1
268,"So last month i got a job making $17hr as an apprentice. Their is plenty of room to “move up”. Problem is im working 10-16 hrs days most days not getting home till past 7 most days getting home between 9-11 pm. Work has completely consumed my life. I wake up look at my schedule get home look at my schedule for the next day and prep for it. I feel stressed 24/7. 

Today i got a call from my old employer offering my old job back but making $15hr. That job was much less stressful and I really enjoyed it never really felt like i worked . But thats pretty much top pay maybe get $16 after a year. But i was also thinking it would allow me more time to do some online classes and finish my associates and go for my bachelors maybe even masters. Can anyone give me advice im getting no help from those around me.",20Aug2020,1
269," 

(reposed here since it was too long for AITA)

I touched on this a little in a couple of my past posts but I have two invisible illnesses, Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and Crohns disease. You can google each of these for more information on what they are exactly, but basically MS is a neurological disease with no cure that affects the brain making it hard to walk or move for some and impossible for others. Some people with mild MS go their entire lives looking and feeling fine if they take their meds while some people are in wheelchairs in various levels of neurological distress. Crohns disease is a gastrointestinal disease that affects your digestive track that has no cure. I was only recently diagnosed earlier this year but basically anything having to do with digestion, from your throat all the way to your colon develop problems and there are loads of side effects such as painful cramping, ulcers, bloody stool, anemia, weight loss and trouble eating to name a few that i have personally been dealing with.

So after my Crohns diagnosis, my husband and i split up, i felt like i was a real burden on him and it all came to a head when he physically struck me and i had to go to the ER for stitches, but thats a whole other story. Anyway, Ive been struggling with feelings of being a burden and because i relied too much on my husband i drove him away and other dark thoughts like that. Ive been dealing with it best i can. But anyway, my family and i love to go to the renaissance festival every year and we always make a big deal about it with elaborate costumes and everything. Last year, I was having a hard time moving around and needed my husbands help a lot because of the undiagnosed crohns at the time. I didnt know it, but i was suffering and am still suffering from severe anemia from bleeding so much when i go to the bathroom. Even after a transfusion in January, my levels have been slowly dipping again and we are trying to get with my doctor to deal with it, but i dont want to miss going to the festival because I cant move around on my own or make everyone slow down for me because of my pain, so my mom bought me a pretty nice wheelchair from the second hand store Im actually really thankful for. For anyone wondering how a wheelchair would help me with anemia, its basically a way to move better without putting in so much effort, as severe anemia makes you very tired very quickly, walking to the end of a parking lot is equivalent to running a lap and you get winded very quickly. That and more than once my MS has misbehaved and I stumble from time to time. to others i look like im clumsy, but really i cant control spasms in my legs sometimes.

I should also mention that a while ago my mom also bought me a walker because i told her without my husband anymore i have noone to help me get up and rush to the bathroom in the middle of the night because even though im handling my MS pretty well right now i still seize up at night and its painful to try to move without putting time aside to stretch and get the legs to work first. But when you have Crohns and you have to go to the bathroom, you have to go to the bathroom like yesterday. Its all very painful, but the walker has helped me force my legs to do the movement so I can walk on my own to the bathroom in the middle of the night.

So heres where the problems start to ink in, I am technically NOT disabled. I do accept government help in the form of a indigent care card. Which is basically a card that replaces your insurance card for people who cant afford their own medical bills. This was something i needed since the MS diagnosis at 21, (im 27 now) as MS means you have to go in for very expensive MRIs all the time so they can scan your brain and spine and track the progress of the disease. To qualify for this help, I cannot make more than about $400 a month where i am, which, with my limitations, I cant really work anyway. With MS, you cannot be exposed to too much high heat, fatigue, or stress, and with Crohns, I basically always need to be near a bathroom so thats also part of it now. I run a small business from home selling my art and taking commissions, but this keeps me well under the limit. Its worked out great until now with my caseworker. But my doctor recently suggested i seriously consider going all out and going for full disability with all the benefits and the sweet parking space.

But in my family, its considered bad to take any extra help when we dont need it. We view it at taking it from someone who might sctually need it. I dont even go to the large bathroom stall and will wait for the smaller non handicap stall to open up. I already got a couple of eyebrows when i applied for the indigent care, but it was understood pretty quickly when i showed them the bill for the MRIs alone. This is also where problems with the wheelchair come in. I am not THAT bad off, I can still walk with some practice, and i still LOOK completely healthy. My mom doesnt care about all this and just wants to help me with the pain as much as possible so she got me the walker and the wheelchair.

The other day i was in the wheelchair trying to get used to it but also because my feet were swollen and I was having a hard time when my sister came over. Shes a nurses assistant studying to be a nurse one day. She reacted a little like my brothers did and were taken aback by the chair, when i tell them Im fine and i stand up and everything. i told her the chair was mostly in case we went to the Ren fest and I was anemic again, I wanted to be able to move around on my own without help. She is very sweet and she cares and even offered to push me if that were to happen, but i was very adamant on being more independent from now on. besides, with MS, i told her i would probably end up in a chair one day anyway so i might as well practice. She looked a little uncomfortable and told me that the people shes met who are bound to chairs really miss the days they werent and wished mostly that they took advantage of their legs when they had it, and maybe i shouldnt spend too much time in the chair if i could help it. She also asked how i would go to the bathroom. I told her i could still get up out of the chair and use a regular stall, it was no big deal.

She kinda got skeptical and said shes seen a lot of stuff in her field of work and people might freak out if i just stroll around in a chair but then suddenly rise and walk to the toilet. She and my family would know that i need the chair, but it wouldnt stop everyone else from being very judgmental. There are plenty of stories here on reddit of wild Karens and wheelchairs so I dont doubt her feelings. But it does have me thinking if i really belong in the chair or not. what if someone else in the family sees me and thinks im just trying to get attention? My sister said at the end of the day, if i think I need it, I have a right to use it. But it has got me wondering, do i need it? not technically, not legally either. I just use it because im too stubborn to depend on others. The thought that i might need it one day because of my MS is really bleak and maybe i shouldnt dote on it or say stuff like that in front of my family. It probably scared my siblings to see me in the chair and I dont know how they might fear one day they see me in it permanently. It probably really hurts them.

AITA for using a wheelchair before my time? Am i asking for trouble? I dont want to lessen the fun of the Ren fest by being tired or in pain or making others slow down for me. But do i NEED the chair? No. Does the chair help me? Yes. So whats the morally correct thing to do here?

I also preemptively want to state that neither my mom or my sister are the AHs because in each of their own ways i know they are just looking out for whatever obstacles may come my way and whatever i choose i know they are on my side. I honestly dont doubt my sister will throw hands if i get out of the chair to go to the bathroom and someone wants to have an opinion. But all of that can be prevented if i can find it in myself not to use the chair at all when we go out and avoid a future karen or entitled parent story.",20Aug2020,1
270,"EDIT: I'm halfway through writing this, and I want you to bear with me. My story feels all over the place, but everything I'm mentioning is relevant to the questions I will be asking. I'm trying to condense 23 years of shit. Please be patient with me. 😅😂

I should start off by saying that I relying on my family for help isn't an option. I was raised in a cult, and was sexually abused for many years by both grandparents, cousins, and my father. 
My mother is mentally ill, and tried to murder me when I was a teen.
Unlike some of my other cousins, I was allowed to attend public school. However, because of abuse at home, I was rarely able to actually go. I have major gaps in my education starting in 4th grade, and I wasn't able to complete my senior year. 

Because of this, I don't have a GED, and this messes up some job requirements. 

During my senior year, I moved in with a family member to escape some of the abuse at home (this was after the mother incident, and my fifth suicide attempt.)
I wasn't able to leave the house until I was 19. Once I hit 19, I was allowed to hang out with friends and local teens from our church as long as I was home by 10, which was awesome. 
I still had to follow some ground rules:
1. I was allowed to obtain my driving permit, but I had to find someone else to teach me.
2. I had to get a job.

I did end up getting my permit, and failed to meet the driving hours and deadlines twice, so I put it on hold.
During my first job, I ended up getting sexually harassed by my boss, who was also of our faith. 
I started to develop stress seizures over time, and eventually my boss pulled me aside and gave me a ""blessing"". I was told that I needed to read my scriptures every night before bed and the seizures would stop. When the blessing didn't work, he chewed me out for not having enough faith to be healed. 
During this time, he raised my part-time hours (4 hours a day) to 7 hours, and then to 11 a day without no breaks. (I've been informed this is illegal?)

After work, I would also have to come home, help my siblings with schoolwork, cook my relatives dinner, clean the house, and then spend the next few hours texting my codependent sexually-abusive ex before going to bed. My family loved him, was convinced I was going to marry him, but it was still always my fault for ""tempting"" him, ""he couldn't control himself"", and it was my fault that he had to have sexual urges in the first place. Of course, he didn't refute my family's claims, so I believed I was with this amazing guy, and I was the piece of worthless shit everyone told me I was.

It became too much, and I threatened to kill myself, ending up in the hospital. 
I quit my job a week later after an accident at work almost permanently maimed me.
For the next 3 months, I never left the house, until I was put into a calling at church.

This is how I met my husband. His family is also part of the cult, but they're not as bad as mine, in fact a few siblings of his ended up leaving. He and I got married at 20 for a couple of reasons. 

1. We started talking about leaving the faith together. We had a lot of questions about the truthfulness of what we were taught
2. We had started having sex (a major sin in our religion)
3. My family suspected we were sinning and it put huge tension on my relationship with them. It became obvious they were going to kick me out, and I had nowhere else to go. 
4. I had PTSD, major depression, and lots of anxiety. (Go figure) My husband, while he loved me, admitted that a large portion of his decision was pity. He was afraid I would kill myself if he didn't marry me. 

During the course of our marriage a couple things happened, not in order:

1. He taught me how to drive(ish) and helped me get my license.
2. I gained weight when we were dating, but we discovered that it wouldn't be easy to get off due to hormone issues. 
3. Due to my weight, he stopped being sexually attracted to me after the first 2 months of marriage. 
4. I started receiving therapy until we couldn't pay for it anymore.
5. My relatives gifted us with a car. The car was put in our name, even though it was for me. Our cult puts men as the first and final say in all important decisions, and they wanted my husband to have the final say on what is done with my car.. 
(My husband now wants to sell my car to help him out money towards a new one, which will leave me in a position where I'm even more dependent.)
6. My mother's health went wayyy downhill. I filed a protective order against her, and she's in a behavioral center in a neighboring state. She threatened to kill her caretaker, and I'm afraid she'll try to kill me again when she gets out. 
7. I've started having massive panic attacks and disassociative meltdowns that affect my day-to-day life. I'm afraid they'll impact my ability to handle a job
8. My husband and I decided to get a divorce. We then decided to give it a month. 

Our month passed, and my husband decided a couple things. He doesn't want to be without me. He likes that I cook and clean for him and that I support him in his work. He likes having sex with me even though he's not attracted to me. He says he loves me as a friend, but not as a romantic interest. 

Last week, he asked if he could start sleeping with other women to ""satisfy his craving"" for skinnier, more attractive women while he works on building our actual relationship (and while I work on losing weight.) 

Typing this out feels surreal. I know my life is fucked up. I know it's unhealthy. I know this marriage is unhealthy, even though I really, really love him. 
He married me to ""save me"". I married him because I loved him, and he was the moonlight in the darkness of my dysfunctional, crazy life. 

I'll be honest. I don't know if there's hope for me. This has been 23 years of damage. My therapist told me I should I write a book. I don't want to write a book. I want to have a normal life. I'm worried I'll always look everywhere and see how I'm different from everyone who was raised normally. I don't know if I can undo the way I am. I don't know if I'm ""fixable.""

But I do know I deserve better. I know I'm unattractive. But I still think that one day, in spite of it, I'll be strong enough to find myself years and miles from here, sitting on a porch in the sun, content with myself in a relationship where someone wants to kiss me, touch me, and just look at me and see me for me.

I have steps for myself to get there. I don't know how to do any of these, but here they are:
-Get therapy
-Get a job
-Fight to keep my car
-Become confident in my driving so I can drive to work
-Gain financial independence
-Get a tutor to help me learn what I missed for years 
-Get my GED one day
-Leave my husband
-Change my name and start clean, untraceable, where my mother, family, and husband can't find me. 
-Learn to become content with this part of my life and put it behind me.

I guess this is where the advice part comes in. I've looked at women's shelters. I'm not a Domestic Violence victim. My husband just... Doesn't love me. Hardly a crime. 

While I've experienced years of sexual abuse, I'm not experiencing any currently. Programs like SavingJane, etc, aren't for me. 

I tried an adult education program run by the state for helping adults gain independence, but it was geared towards mentally disabled adults, and they didn't know what to do with me. 

So... What do I do? Where the hell do I... Fit? Are there any programs or... Anything? That can give me emotional and mental support while I learn to be... Human again? 

I'm financially stranded with zero countable education, a shit ton of emotional trauma and complex mental issues that I can't pay to work through or get rid of, and an intense fear of working. I don't want to be hurt again. I don't want to have seizures or be harassed again. And I definitely don't want to disassociate at work! 😬 Sometimes being with my husband is the only thing that feels manageable and safe anymore. 

But I know that if I do the easy thing- give in and let him start sleeping with other women- I won't cut it. I'll be on my own soon anyway, because there will always be someone better than me. 

I know I can get through it. I just need direction and maybe some external support. I have no safety nets, no support systems, and no clue what I'm doing. It's hard not to be overwhelmed.",20Aug2020,1

At this point I have questioned if I am losing my mind because these experiences. I have even started to feel extremely uncomfortable in my house even though before this started I have always felt very safe. First off I hear noises around my home. Some noises is like someone is moving around, sometimes I hear coughing, sometimes I hear whispering, and sometimes I hear people saying my name or a family members name. The voice is unrecognizable. I've woken up in the middle of the night because I heard someone say loudly ""(my name)!"" From next to my bed and I would wake up and nothing would be there, that is usually the case. Last month I woke up to someone standing next to my bed. They immediately left the room and I assumed it was a family member. Turns out none of them were in my room that night. I've come home from work while everyone in my home is gone doing something and I would turn the corner and find someone move out of sight. I was extremely scared and grabbed a knife from the kitchen and I searched the entire house to find absolutely nothing. Things of my family has been disappearing in the house. From small little objects to architecture... We have always had an attic door in our house in one of our closets and I remember when I was a kid an discovered its existed I got scared and went to my mom about it and she thought it was amusing and told me everything was fine and that it was sealed shut and there was nothing to be afraid of. After I've started seeing appearances of people in my house and the voices I decided I needed to check the attic but when I went to look the door wasn't even there and my family has no recollection of there ever being a door. I've even had intense nightmares every single night since these weird things have started. A lot more weird things have happened in this house and it is way too much to get into so I left in the most notable experiences. I am genuinely scared and I do not feel comfortable here and I want to leave but I am not able to leave at the current moment.

I'm in my early 20s, and I work as a waitress, mostly to afford my shitty one-bedroom. All I do is wait tables and field requests from little old Italian grandmas to marry their grandsons. 

I have a bachelor's degree, but it's in a subject area without a lot of job openings (and honestly, I've kind of lost interest in it). I went to college on a scholarship, though, so I don't have any debt. 

My dad told me that I could move back in with him if I want to get a master's degree, which would make it pretty affordable. I could be a teacher, or a nurse, or maybe a social worker. 

The problem is, I don't know *what* I want to do. I feel like everyone else is so passionate and excited about their careers, and I'm just a directionless jellyfish. I get a little nihilistic about the whole thing, like no matter what I choose, it's all going to be kind of pointless after I'm dead. But I also don't want to spend the rest of my life surrounded by fake grapes and weirdly aggressive grandmas. 

Does anyone else feel like this? How did you decide what you wanted to do with your life? What do you think I should do?",20Aug2020,1
279,"I am going into my sophomore year of high school and i have been dealing with a lot of friend drama. Especially from one girl in particular (let’s call her tracy). I recently invited one friend to hangout that i have never hung out 1 on 1 with. Tracy asks me what i’m doing this weekend and i told her i was hanging out with someone. She started asking me all the details and then she kept trying to invite her self/ dropping hints to tell her to come. I politely told her maybe another time, which made her upset. I wasn’t trying to leave her on purpose even though she made it seem that way. I felt so guilty so i end up inviting her. Fast forward to today, she calls me and starts talking about how i should have invited her, how i never invite her to my neighbourhood walks and she is rehashing things from weeks ago. She lives on the other side of town and no where near my neighbourhood. Never the less i did realize how my two close friends and i may have been leaving her out, even if it was on accident.I guess what i am trying to say is am i in the wrong? should i always extend my invitation to her? am i being selfish and rude?",20Aug2020,1

281,"Hello everyone, 

I have this friend who is into kpop like me however I noticed that they have a lot of double standards and can be very hypocritical about certain things and I mentioned to them about it and they got really defensive about. For an example one of his favorite kpop singer and her band  has done black face multiple times and culturally appropriate black culture and I told him that yet all he did was brush it off and said she is a really good singer and I only like her as a solo artist; I also mentioned how another group that he listened culturally appropriate  different cultural for each comeback concept and then he got really defensive about it saying that its a neutral term and that we associate with a negative connotation or he'll just brush it off saying that they're very talented. However, if I were to tell him about a band he doesn't like that they did black he said we should stop supporting them, so how do I tell him politely that he has double standards and is bias against certain groups.",20Aug2020,1
282,"I [20M] overstepped my girlfriends [20F] boundaries. I feel terrible and I have this overwhelming guilt which has led me to some terrible and unhealthy thoughts. My girlfriend and I had a conversation where she told me porn is cheating and that im not allowed to watch porn. I happily obliged not realizing how truly hard it would be to stop considering we see each other twice a month. The first few days were easy but then i would get sudden urges to watch porn, and in order to combat this id masturbate to other things including fantasies in my head. One time, I masturbated to a fantasy of someone I saw a couple times at my old work. I am not friends with this person, not in contact with this person either. When I first did the deed I didn’t think anything of it because I know it meant nothing, I wasn’t attracted to this person, and it only happened because I was getting over my porn addiction/habit. Fast forward to a month later me and my gf have a conversation about the same topic where she tells me that guys who masturbate to anyone other than their SO are cheaters, disloyal, and disgusting. I then started spiralling remembering the fantasy from before among other things that I did in order to get over porn. The fantasy of other people only happened one time because I realized how wrong it is and currently where I am, now over watching porn, I would never dare masturbate to anyone other than my GF because what happened only happened as I was getting over porn and I was in a different mindset. This situation has really affected my mental health and I feel extremely guilty for my actions even though I know my heart was always in the right place and what happened, happened because I wanted to change for my gf but now it feels like its come to the point where it’s too far because I feel guilty for my own thoughts. If I were to tell my gf she would flip out and most likely want to be away from me if not break up. Is what I’m feeling justified or am I being too harsh?

tl;dr: Masturbated to fantasy of girl other than my gf after my gf said to stop watching porn. I feel extremely guilty",20Aug2020,1

284,"Last Friday, 2 days before classes started, I received an email saying that one of my classes was going all online and that the in class version was being dropped, in order to attend the new version I must add it to my class schedule. Unfortunately I have holds on my account preventing me from adding classes, and the last day to add classes is this friday. 

Before this I was at risk of being dropped from all my classes due to these financial holds but apparently they’re making exceptions for a lot of people who owe past dues because of Covid. I was granted such an exception and was told that so long that I made payments that I would be good to go. My tuition for this semester is completely covered and my room and board is being covered by my RA position, all I owe is expenses from last semester and even though my loans are enough to cover what I owe, they simply can’t go towards it. 

Now I get dropped from a class and I can’t do anything about it and no one can seemingly help me. This is a class I was enrolled in already before the holds on my account, but for some reason I can’t just be rolled over into the online version. I’ve called my advisor, the dean of my program, and left voicemails with the registrar and have barely heard anything back from anyone and I don’t know what to do. If I have less than 12 credit hours before Friday night I’m going to be let go from my RA position which means I won’t have housing which also means I’ll likely need to focus on finding a job and apartment and won’t be able to take classes.

288,"I really don’t know where else to go to get help with this as I don’t know many trusted adults and don’t wish to involve friends into this matter.
I am 17, going to be 18 on September 18th. I’m a senior in highschool, and so is my boyfriend who turns 18 a week after me on the 25th. 
In October it will be four years that I have been living with my legal guardian (48F) and I have grown quite a bit of animosity towards her. Originally I was only supposed to stay with her for a couple of months why my mother moved out of state to get my little brother out of foster care, but she never came back for me and I ended up stuck here. My legal guardian took it upon herself to take me into her family despite my not wanting to. She has made my life living under her rather difficult and honestly embarrassing to tell my friends.
She has strict rules that I try my best to respect but some are exhausting to follow, others plain annoying. It may sound like I am complaining, but you would too if you were nearly a legal adult and could not walk around the block without someone with you (literally).
If I were to list out everything she does that makes my life here miserable, it would take a very long time. So I’m going to skip all this.
I’ve known my boyfriend since 6th grade, we’ve been friends since 9th grade, and started dating in 11th. We are so close as friends that if we were to break up we would likely still be friends. I know him well enough to know that if I were to move in with him and we were to break up, he would not kick me out but give me time to find a place to go. 
He lives with his single mother and she is very for me moving in with them. They want me to move in on the 25th of September and even have people willing to help move my stuff. 
The complications here are that I don’t know if I should go through with the move. My legal guardian is an incredibly sensitive person, she would never forgive me and would be very angry for a long time. I know her daughter. My friend of many years, would also be incredibly mad. It would be hard to see her in the halls at school and if we had class together it would be even harder as she is also a sensitive individual. 
Not only this but why I do hold a lot of dislike for my legal guardian, at the end of the day I do not want to hurt her. She has taken care of me for these past four years, paying for my medical, any food I ask for, my dental, school clothes, games, my drawing tablet that I use all the time. I owe her so much that I cannot repay. It does not sit well with me, leaving after she has done all of this for me. 
I would have attempted to pay her back in the past if I had been able to get a job. In my area jobs are hard to get, and after applying to nearly every place I could think of, I landed an interview at one place. I was hired too, but my guardian made me harass the manager, because she wanted to call her. I couldn’t say no to my guardian because she gets very mad if I do, so I did as I was told. I ended up being ghosted by my manager, and after that my guardian would not let me attempt to get any more jobs.
She does not want me to grow up, and she is coddling me so much that it is hard to grow into being an adult as she will not let me do regular teenage things. 
I have also asked her for therapy, because I show strong signs of depression according to those around me, and why she said yes, she never got me any, and then dismissed it when I brought it up again, saying she could not afford it, and still would not let me get my own job.
So it looks like my only way out is my boyfriends house, yet I am still on the fence about it. He has depression himself, and sometimes his state of mind prevents him from thinking rationally. I am afraid he may not be mentally prepared for me to start living with him. He does not take medication or see a therapist, though he is about to consult his doctor on if he should. 
We will not have to pay his mom rent, but I do think that if I want to be added to their phone plan I will have to get a job, which is no problem for me. I am not worried about finances as we have a solid plan for that, confirmed by his mother who works at a bank.
I would still be in school at this time, and my guardian likes to say all the time that I legally cannot leave until I graduate, even if I am 18, however after many searches on the internet I cannot find anything that confirms this.
I am very on the fence about moving out, I have already moved 17 times my entire life, and each move seems harder than the last. I have grown used to the soft abuse here and have learned how to not trigger those I live with, but it is stressful at times. I would much prefer to leave, but at what cost?

292,"I currently live in an apartment with my girlfriend. One day I get text from my friend saying he got kicked out of his parents and that he needed a place to stay. I say yeah sure you can stay for a little while. When he finally got to my place, he was high as a kite on Xanax and maybe something else. I tried to give him a chance by telling him that if he is gonna stay, he’ll have to refrain from drug use and even having it in my apartment. I mentioned this multiple times, and it was my only rule. Fast forward to the next morning, I see a bottle xanax on my desk. As I was telling him, I could clearly tell he was high. He broke my only rule in one night. I even found a small broken piece and he had the audacity to down it right in front of me. I felt disrespected and disappointed. On top of that, he did not show any sign of appreciation. 

I tell him that I can’t have him staying any longer as I can’t risk having you here. He then pauses for a good couple of minutes. Starts to cry, and then says  “if you didn’t let me stay the night I probably would’ve killed myself.” I collect my thoughts and put my foot down in order to protect myself and I apologize and tell him i had no choice. 

My girlfriend and I are in school and work. We’re in a good place and I will probably be marrying her. First and foremost I have to protect her and my home. This may sound cold hearted, but even if something happens to my friend, I would still make the same decision if the situation presented itself again. Regardless, I still feel really bad.

I ended up moving and it sucked so much, we would talk still but It was hard. We went a few months where we didnt talk because I was hoping that would make me lose the feeling for her, it didnt.

I consider myself a good person and that’s the only thing I feel like I can be happy about.

A while ago I tried to sign up for the peace corps. I wanted to travel and help people. Do something totally unselfish, out of my element, and try to do something meaningful that might give me a new perspective on life. I was denied because basically I had no skills or anything I could provide to them is what I was told. 

Is there anything similar or anything that can humble me? Take me away from my life I have now and show me an entire different world, while still helping people? I thoroughly get satisfaction out of helping people and knowing I did something good for someone else.

306,"TL:DR at the bottom
Today was the first day in forever that I didn't smoke weed. Withdrawal symptoms have me in a bad headspace. Can't sleep. I'm proud of myself for putting a hold on my addiction, but I'm ashamed that I let it get so out of control.

 I'm 20, no savings. Working in a sandwich shop. Very little job experience and little references. I've spent the past 4 months living paycheck to paycheck, hoping and praying I'll get to eat, to smoke weed, to have gas in my car. Isolation and introversion have eroded my social skills. No friends, no girlfriend. These things won't just fall into my lap but as I said, social skills have atrophied. I'd like to go to college, but ideas seem unachievable, not worth the effort. 

I think I may have manic depression. Runs in both sides of my family. I'm attempting (for the 8th time) to get myself off weed, maybe see if the weed is causing the manic episodes. It was to the point where I didn't feel normal unless I was high. I'd also like a different job, need more money to support my hobbies. What hobbies, you say? Playing video games, gym, hiking. Still haven't been camping yet, but it'll get here.  My life up till this point has been filled with struggle, sacrifice and a worrysome lack of seratonin. (old stepdad was the equivalent of a tu. 1) the septic tank has holes through the sides due to hella dedicated tree roots. The field lines also got clapped due to the same problem. In this 2 bathroom trailer, only one toilet works. Living in this trailer, are 6 humans and 5 animals. This trailer is always filthy, there is always trash in the yard, and the septic tank, having holes in it, fills with water when it rains. What this means is the tank is drained into the nearby woods, blessing the neighborhood with the sweet smell of marinated booty beef.

Both of my parents are in fuck-fuck type situations. It really messes with my headspace and idk what to do anymore. 

Any advice on how to cheer up a little?

307,"(Posted this in r/Breakups too fyi!) Long story short, we (25F/22M) were a summer fling for about two months. We were doing everything a BF/GF would without the label (slept at each other’s places 4-5 times a week, dates, etc). He (22 M) was in my city for an internship and we “broke it off” a couple weeks ago when he moved back to where he lives 6 hours away. We met off a dating app and he told me right away he wasn’t looking for something serious because he was moving and just got out of a long term distance relationship that didn’t work out. I personally caught the feels and 100% would’ve dated him had he asked. The only red flag is he was still good friends with his recent ex (explained below). We said goodbye on good terms, I was crying and he said he was going to miss me, and he wished me luck and said to keep in touch. That was two weeks ago and since then he’s texted me several times and has often replied to my snap story.

I’m torn over this. I know we weren’t ever “officially” together so the lines were blurry, but I’m really having a hard time moving on. I don’t want to lose contact with him but I am also holding on to the glimmer of hope he’ll change his mind or in a couple years when he’s finished with school we can reconnect in the same city.

I guess I don’t understand his purpose of still reaching out? He is a really sweet guy and really cares about me... but it makes me sad it’s not enough to date me. 

Another thing is that I considered is he was in frequent contact with his ex (texts/snaps/calls) and just said they are friends and they never stopped contact after they broke up 7 months ago. He said they were friends for a couple years before they dated, they didn’t have a great sexual/romantic contraction, and they went back to being friends. So I’m thinking he either strings along his ex’s or he never lost feelings for her and is keeping me around too. 

Any thoughts? I just want to move on but also keep options for the future open. What do I do?

309,"Over the summer quarantine I (19F) had a lot of time to think on what I really want to do with my life and I finally figured out that I want to either produce, direct, or act in film or television. The high school I went to though gave absolutely zero information on this theater or even the arts as a whole because it was an incredibly small STEM school (~600 students when combining middle and high), with no clubs. After my first semester of college I decided to go with a degree in secondary education with a focus in history which has always been a more backup plan degree. I've already switched a few times, between studio arts and communications, to see what fits best. I have certain benifits that keep me from being undecided/undeclared and the film portion of the school won't accept me without a portfolio of some sort. I've thought about asking to switch to theater but I don't know anything about that either. Im just not sure what to do at this point because I know what I want just not how to go about getting there. I've also been having impulsive thoughts about just dropping out and moving away to try and find some way to do this so I'm not taking up someone else's spot who probably knows what they want to do already but I don't think that's a great way to go about it.

314,"I had a break up last year, so I was in depression and started fucking prostitutes, snorted drugs, etc.
One of my friend accompanied me through all these but he never touched a substance and stayed away.

Later when I asked him, why didn't he stop me before, he replied, ""I tried stopping but you won't listen"".
I remember after 2-3 times of my excuse, he used to peacefully accompany me. 
Isn't a friend supposed to stop you from doing all wrong things, either by words or by force.

Could he react in some other way to stop me ? Is yes, shall i keep such people in life ?",20Aug2020,1
315,"when i look at myself i don’t even know who it is. i used to have beautiful long black hair and during a manic episode (bi polar 1) i cut it above my shoulders, bleached to straw, and dyed it bright pink. all that replays in my head is when my ex told me “you have a ton of natural beauty” and i destroyed it. i look at old pictures of myself to me now and i’m completely disgusted. the pink is obnoxious on me, i look like a clown, it makes me cry. i’m so lost in general in life rn and i want to at least look like myself again. i’ve spent so much money on hair vitamins and treatments and nothing is working. i still look psycho and disgusting. i imagine this girl sitting in a social setting and i cannot describe the feeling of disgust i get.

317,"So I recently moved into my dorm for college and my roommate is already driving me insane. She follows me everywhere and constantly talks. I’m quiet and I like being alone. She also likes to talk for me and talk over me. 

She acts like I’m a child that can’t take care of myself. She asks too many questions. Like when I go to the restroom she asks, “Where are you going?” Like it’s not really her business to know where I’m going at all times. I can’t seem to be alone away from her until classes.

She’s also that one bitch who always tries to be quirky and fun, but she’s just annoying. She also snores like no other. It legitimately sounds like a fucking motorcycle starting up next to me.

Eventually, I reported the person to my RA and got them to back off.

323,"I'm basically experiencing transference, but with my professors, instead of my therapist.

I try not to be obvious about it, and I am resolved to be strictly professional around my professors, but I keep idealizing my professors, seeing them as potential parental figures, and yearning for a more intimate connection even though I know it's not possible or ethical. I want to be around them pretty much any chance I can get. I hang out in the department a lot, go to departmental events, spend a lot of time trying to excel and impress them with my work, and even got a job as a student assistant to the department admin, mostly just to feel closer to my professors and the department in general. This is probably starting to sound really creepy. I'm sorry.

I know this isn't that unique, and not an excuse, but I was abused by my parents and never really had any positive role models or adults that I trusted, or that really supported or encouraged me.

I know it is totally inappropriate and unfair to put this kind of pressure of my professors, or anyone, really. It is not their job at all to be my parent or care about me as anything more than a student. Yet my affection for them is very persistent and it is sometimes very hard for me deal with the asymmetry of it. If I'm being honest, I want them to love and be proud of me which is obviously asking way too much.

324,"I have a pretty big crush on this guy. We go to the same school so I see him everyday. Some of the things I’ve noticed is that he always faces towards me, I feel like he makes an effort to sit next to me, he responds pretty quickly, he looks at me when he laughs, he’s pretty touchy with me with play fighting, we have quite a lot of inside jokes, he makes a bit of an effort to hang out with me and my friend, when I’m not at the place we sit at yet I notice he looks in my direction quite a lot until I come over, he initiates conversation a little bit but it’s mostly me, he tells me personal shit sometimes even though he’s quite a closed off person, we have a group chat which me, him and a friend call in pretty much everyday, we walk to class together, and we’re gonna match costumes for a Halloween party. He teases me a lot, obviously it’s a mutual thing. The things that are throwing me off a bit is how sometimes he’ll look at me when I’m talking but he’ll kind of ignore me unless I talk to him first? He’s kind of a dry texter, sometimes when I teases me I get scared he’s serious, sometimes he walks off without me, and sometimes he will barely put in any effort in an irl conversation. Sometimes I think he does feel the same way, but then he’ll act standoffish for an entire day and it puts me off and makes me wonder if I was wrong.

326,"So on Sunday around 12:40 in the morning, my cousin and his girlfriend were driving an Uber eats delivery. Suddenly, a car hit them killing them almost instantly (all I know is that they were pronounced dead at the scene so I don’t know how quick and hopefully painless it was for them), they other vehicle driver and passenger had critical injuries while their 5 year old had minor injuries. According to the witness, he saw the other driver going unusually fast before crossing an intersection hitting my cousin. Apparently the cops took a blood sample to test to see if he was under the influence of anything.

Ever since I found out about the accident, I haven’t been right. I can’t think straight, I can’t sleep, I have to force myself to eat otherwise I don’t and before, typical depression stuff. If I wasn’t sad about my cousin I wanted to greatly harm (but not kill) whoever hit him. My cousin was my best friend and honestly the reason why I’m the person I am today. He showed me everything I’m interested in and typically watch or play or do to this day.

His funeral was on Tuesday and it was open casket for family and really close friends, but closed casket after the first hour when everyone else showed up. I was lucky enough to see him and say my goodbyes, so I’m at peace in my mind and I’m not mad at the driver who hit him anymore, but I’m still deeply hurt because he is not here with us anymore. I know I mainly need time to heal (cause the saying time heals all wounds) but I don’t know how long it will take. 
I don’t want to rush the healing process or anything cause that will just lead to more pain I’m sure, but I don’t want to just sit around and hurt all day either. What can I do that will help me right now.
As I said before I am not really thinking straight right now so I’m sorry if some of this stuff doesn’t make any since, I just don’t know what to do.
I’m thinking about sharing stories in the comments about the things we would do together (keep in mind we barely got a chance to see each other cause we live in different states so we only hung out over summers and breaks in school when we could visit family and he was only 20 DAYS older than me).",20Aug2020,1

329,"The title says much of it. I have always seen myself as an introvert, and I have never really enjoyed being around others. I can enjoy playing online games with friends, but only for a very short time before I start to feel like crap. It is very difficult, because my family wants to spend a lot of time with me, (I am in my teen years) but I really don’t enjoy spending time with them. It’s not them that I don’t want to spend time with, it’s people. I basically spend all day in my bedroom, and I am very happy in my current situation. 

In the past, I used to spend lots more time with my family and I never really had any alone time. I also have insane sleep issues, like insomnia, anxiety before sleep, and I had sleep paralysis when I was young. I would spend 2-3 hours laying there trying desperately to fall asleep. I attributed my unhappiness to my sleep issues, but I now realize that spending time with others had made me unhappy. 

I want to make it clear that I have very good social skills, and that I can make connections with people, and that I can empathize with them. I just despise being around them. When I was born, my family was convinced that I was autistic, as I was very antisocial. What changed their mind was the empathy and compassion I showed to my grandmother with a very bad knee. I was mindful of her knee pain and I tried to make sure that she was comfortable and that she wasn’t in pain. I love my family, but I hate spending time with them. I know that this is very contradictory, but I can’t think of another way to phrase what I am saying.

This really makes me feel bad, and I want to feel like a normal kid. Thank you for thanking the time to read this post, and I hope you can give me some helpful advice.",20Aug2020,1
330,"I am a 2nd year full time uni student and I am seeking advice. Three of the units I'm doing are alright and I enjoy them but this one particular unit I am doing is so difficult that it is stressing me out so much, no other unit has ever given me this much stress before. Many of the other students who are in the current cohort as me have also expressed their anxiety, anger, resentment, stress and worries (of failing) from doing this unit. 

I cannot switch units at this point because we are only allowed to switch units in the first two weeks and this is the third week. The reason why I stayed in this unit was because I actually enjoyed learning the first two weeks of content and I thought the unit was good so I decided to stay. However, the Week 3's content had me confused and even when I was searching up on Google for more information, the lecture content would not be consistent with what I was finding on Google, so it led to more confusion. I even asked the tutors questions and if I'm even lucky to get a response, they always give me vague answers (that don't exactly answer my questions) or tell me to 'ask other students'. I feel like I have been tricked into doing this unit just because they make the first two weeks sound like it's going to be an easy pass, and the only reason why I am doing this unit in the first place is because it's compulsory. 

I am also thinking about dropping out of this unit and just doing the other 3 units this semester. However, if I drop out of this unit then I will have to spend an extra semester and graduate a semester later, and I do not think it will look good on my resume (and may lower my chances of finding a job) if I spent an extra semester trying to complete my degree. However, I am worried that if I don't drop out, I might fail this unit (and maybe other units) because it's very stressful and if I fail any units, it could jeopardise my chances of going on the exchange program next year. (I have already been conditionally allocated to my host university but if I do not fulfil their conditions (i.e. getting 70% on average) then they can give up my place to someone else). 

So, I am looking for advice to see whether it is worth dropping the unit or if I should stay? Or, what else I should do?

TL;DR I am doing a compulsory unit that is causing me so much stress that I am contemplating about dropping out. If I drop out, I worry that this may not look good on my resume as spending more time to complete a uni degree would indicate to future employers that I am not performing well academically. If I don't drop out, I worry that I may fail this unit, which could jeopardise my future chance of going on exchange next year.",20Aug2020,1

I'm a male college student (as of a week ago), and have been in a relationship with a male childhood friend since middle school. At the time, everything felt right. Near the end of middle school, a custody dispute made our relationship ""long-distance"" (considering the age bracket and parents' views, that is) and we met very few times during high school. This is when I started doubting if I made the right choice, but passed it off due to the extraneous circumstances. 

Now, I'm living in the same college dorm as my boyfriend (as well as my best friend), and the regular physical contact has confirmed my suspicions that what was once between us is no longer there. I don't know how to break it to him, he's absolutely head over heels for me but I can't imagine myself following through with this relationship much longer.

335,"
I run my business out of half a family members garage. I have needed more space, but now I kind of really need it. The only way to get that, is to get a full garage or shop space. 

I live in Los Angeles so a shop space will run me $850-1250 for a “cheap” one- not including utilities in most cases. 

My rent for a 1br apartment is $1395 with about $150 in utilities a month. 

I decided to see if I could put that cash together and rent a 2-3 bedroom house locally. Local to me runs about $2500-3000 and an hour away is about $2000-2500. 

I’ve been considering an out of state move for a long time. Money has always been the number one thing holding me back- but that’s not a factor now. My family lives here, so I feel scared to move away where I don’t know anything. 

I have some friends in other states that I would be interested in, but I’m kinda an introvert so I don’t think I’d even see any of these people a whole ton. Meeting new people seems like it’s hardcore out because, well, you know- COVID.

336,"I'm not sure if this is normal or not. I don't really know anyone else who's done this (or at least told me they've had this happen) and it's just on my mind because it happened earlier.

Anyways, the title kind of sums it up. If I'm speaking and I catch a glimpse of a word (enough to where I know what it is) or I'm reading something while speaking, I'll say the word my eyes are currently on involuntarily in my sentence. 

Ex: Let's say I was talking about cats, and then I read 'The Greatest Hits' on the radio. ""He has the softest fur, I really love *hits*."" Or if I were talking about cake's and I saw the word 'radio.' “Wow, these cakes are really amazing. I love how they radio.” 

It's not really the biggest deal to me because it doesn't happen 24/7, but I feel really confused and a little disoriented whenever it happens. When it happens around people I feel really frustrated and embarrassed because I already have lots of issues speaking, so the only concern I'd have with this is how it's effecting me being social.

Also, just to add, I have always had a hard time reading aloud. I'll always mix words up and switch their places and even add words that aren't even in the sentence. When I was younger it was really bad, but recently I kind of stopped caring so it hasn't bothered me too much. So it's kind of extra confusing to me that when I intentionally try to read things aloud I'll always jump to the word ahead or say a word that's not there but when I look at a word I'll involuntarily say it without thinking.",20Aug2020,1
337,"I don’t really know how to start this or even if this is the right subreddit for this but here it is.

 When I was younger I was a bad kid. I had this terrible reputation of playing girls and I deserved it. I was the epicenter of controversy when it came who I was seeing at the time. I ruined relationships, I hurt peoples feelings and I did not care as long as I “reached my goal”. Every day I look back on who I used to be and regret every single day of it. Back then however whenever I said something I got a response. Whether it was good or bad or something in between people acknowledged me and what I had to say. Since then I changed myself. I stopped sleeping around, stopped drinking, and told myself that i never want to be who I used to be. The issue that I’m facing now is no body acknowledges me or the things I say. When I was a bad guy people laughed and joked with me and thought I was cool and fun to be around but now I just feel like a husk. The people I used to think were my best friends have forgotten me and the people at my university don’t think anything of me. I’ve become no one, with no reputation, and nothing extraordinary I can bring to the table. I am boring and nothing I say anymore brings any excitement. I want to tell people how sad I am all the time but no one listens anymore. I try talking and talking but people just forget by the next day. I feel so alone all the time. People aren’t reaching out to me, my “friends” don’t respond to me, and the only time I ever get brought up is if someone needs me to do something. I don’t get invited places, my friends leave me out of plans, and I just feel all alone all the time.

338,"I’m (19f). I’m not a mom or a legal guardian. But my grandma (63) is. She raised me, and is currently raising a few of my younger siblings, and a few of my cousins. (Our biological parents aren’t present in any of our lives due to addictions, in and out of jail, etc.) 

So in all, there’s (f63) (f19) (m14) (m13) (f13) and (f10) in my family/house.

(F10) is the problem. So so many behavioural issues. my grandma &amp; the rest of us, honestly are at the last straw with her &amp; we just want her out of our care and we do not want to deal with her anymore. We don’t want anymore trouble. (F10) wasn’t raised by my grandma, (F10) was born into foster care. We didn’t get her until she was like 5/6 years old. She’s now 10, hence the (F10).

In my own opinion, (F10) has got to be the most corrupt and evil, disgusting little “child” I’ve ever met. (F10) honestly reminds me of the movie “orphan.” I know it’s not her fault the way she is, someone in foster care must’ve taught her the things she knows, or has done something to her.

But today, was the last straw for us, especially my grandma. (F10) stole (F13s) phone and (F13) didn’t know about it, we have no idea when it happened I’m assuming it happened late at night when (F13) was sleeping. But just today (?) , when (F13) when onto her phone and checked through her apps like Instagram, roblox, etc. When (F13) opened up snapchat she seen she had ‘posted’ a story up (which she didn’t) and she clicked on it, and seen it was (F10) using her phone &amp; she posted that she missed her “ex boyfriend” and she even wrote the boys name. (These are kids, like in grade 4 or 5.) 

Then as (F13) is looking through her Snapchat app she goes down to the pictures, and she found Naked photos that (F10) was taking of herself. Everybody flipped out &amp; (F13) deleted the photos, and the snapchat story. But we’re not sure if those photos were sent out to anybody. 

This isn’t the first time something disturbing and shocking like this has happened coming from (F10). We’ve had other incidents where she was suspended from school because her and the boy she liked were playing a ‘r*pe game* and pretended to sodomize her with a plastic bottle. 

There was so many times we had other “smaller” problems with her. Like:

She had also told teachers / principle at the school as if we had no food in our home, which was a complete lie. My mom has taken the $600 receipt down to the school &amp; offered to show them our fridge &amp; pantry. We have more than enough to go around. Lots of kids in the house.

She had pulled a kitchen knife out of me 3 separate times, and each time it was because she was mad over something I had said.

She cannot be trusted around babies, toddlers or small children. She has been caught pinching, bending babies fingers/hands back, and she physically hit a baby. She is really mean to smaller kids, &amp; likes to bully them or make them cry. I’ve seen this happen &amp; each I’ve yelled at her and sent her to go somewhere alone. (Away from the kids.)

She cannot be on any forms of technology or social media’s whatsoever. Not even video games. Not even be able to watch any type of ‘real’ Tv shows or movies. Strictly cartoons. 

She isn’t allowed technology or social media due to her posting videos of her in a ‘crop top’ &amp; booty shorts (she had made herself. By cutting her clothes.) 
And pretending to be her younger sister (making fake accounts using her younger sisters name &amp; pictures) (our younger sister is 8, she was adopted at birth by our uncle and his wife. She does not live with us)

(F10) had disappeared with (F8) from our yard, and I went outside looking for them and couldn’t find them, Until I seen (F8’s) little hot pink jacket all the way across our road, across the field near the underground fires. (F10) had taken (F8) all the way across the road and field toward the underground fires (smoke coming out from the ground) when we specifically told them NOT to leave the yard. (F10) knew what the underground fires were, we explained them to her beforehand.

(F10) cannot be trusted around the opposite sex. She tries to be too ‘friendly’ or close with boys. And seems to have crushes on grown men. She has once said as if she loved her principle. (F10) thought her principle was I love with her, because she was sent to his office to do her work (would disrupt the class and act out, or run freely in the hallways.)
Her principle was horrified/mortified when my grandma spoke to him about what (F10) was saying. 

(F10) loves to eevesdrop. She will be in the bedroom ‘colouring’, but in reality she listens to your conversations. She will also “hang around” or “longer around” adults who have conversations. Then she goes around twisting stories and words up. 

You basically cant show (F10) Affection or any type of love whatsoever. She manipulates you and lies to you. If she doesn’t get what she wants from you, she’ll go to the next person, then the next, then the next, or play victim and tell people as if she’s not being fed, or she doesn’t have this, doesn’t have that, she’ll try make you feel sorry for her. 

(F10) has made one of my uncles very uncomfortable. When he would come visit / sleep over she would basically follow him, stare at him  and watch him. To which he told his mom (my grandma) and (F10) was told not to go near him.

(F10) had once made up a lie and told our older cousin (f26) that granny was letting her move to her house as long as it was okay with (F26). (F26) let her, because there was 17 of us in a small 4 bedroom house. When (F10) got there, she unpacked her bags and (F26) noticed (F10) had stolen (F13’s) Bras. (F10) only moves to (F26) because (F26) had a boyfriend living with her. 

(F10) would cut her clothes to make them look slutty/skimpy. One of her shirts has ‘slits/holes across the chest (you know how some girls have those holes in their shirts to show their boobs). She’s made herself ‘booty shorts’ that showed her butt cheeks. She has also cut herself a damn thong out of her underwear. 
My grandma threw away those clothes away and now she’s only to wear baggy sweats, baggy shirts, etc. 

There’s so so many more things (F10) has done. But those are mostly the main worst things I know of and can remember. We don’t have the money to pay for therapy, or any type of professional help. &amp; were not exactly blessed to have those things in my community (I live on reservation ). We’ve tried contacting our biological mother, to find (F10s) biological father. But she either doesn’t know or won’t tell us. 

We’re really desperate and nothings been working. Not the time outs, not the yelling, not the “no tv”. My grandma has gone the long way and has taken her to church to get prayed for, she’s made her attend many church services before.

We just don’t want to be burdened with these problems anymore. She’s caused far too much trouble for us already and this is honesty the last straw. 
We feel like we’ve run out of any other options, and ACFS/CFS won’t take her back because she’s already in a home with immediate family. 

My grandma doesn’t know what to do and she’s stressed to the max, we don’t know where to put (F10) or what to even do about her.

339,"im gunna try to keep this as short as possible so bear with me. i met my girlfriend a little over a year ago. we met at the dog park and instantly connected spending the next 6 hours at the dog park together talking like it was nothing. it was great. but fast forward a year later and our relationship is being destroyed by trust issues. ill start from the very beginning

i had this friend already who happened to be a girl but was nothing more than a friend who ill just refer to as friend and me and friend planned to go to the lake one day to bring our dogs to the dog park. this is a few days after meeting GF so were were talking but not like set any boundaries or hung out much at all at this point i mean its been a few fucking days lol. GF finds out i went to the lake with another girl and basically never wants to talk to me again. i eventually talk her down and actually lied to her and told her friend already had a boyfriend anyways so she had nothing to worry about. confessed said lie and GF wanted to never talk to me again, again. eventually obviously worked through that but relationship off to a bad start and i suppose that was the first thing that started her trust issues towards me which i understand i lied but also thought it was pretty crazy of her to be mad at me for going to the lake with someone else after only knowing her not even a week

throughout our relationship, GF has accused me left and right of looking at and checking out other girls. she's broken up with me on the spot countless times of false accusations. however, there has been 2 times where i actually was doing so and she caught me red handed. both times basically broke up with me but obviously worked it out. this was a very long time ago and have made sure to make sure she knows im not doing that but i still get accused left and right and treated poorly about accusations that aren't even true

there was a youtube video i watched a really long time ago toward the very beginning of our relationship of bradley martyn (fitness youtube) where this couple was in his video doing a workout and i had mentioned something about it to her and she (surprisingly to me because i didn't see anything wrong with me watching this) had a huge problem with me watching that since there was another girl in it and she took it upon herself to go through my youtube history after that finding another video of his where the title was ""how to pick up girls at the gym"" which no, i didn't watch that to learn how to pick up girls at the gym i had her and was very happy with her and would never cheat on her or want to cheat, i just have seen his videos like that in the past and enjoyed them so i watched that one too. she was beyond not okay with this and i forget what actually happened but that also led to a downward spiral of trust issues making her want my passwords and stuff

there was another video on the nelk boys personal website where it was a prank video where a naked girl answers the door to a pizza delivery guy and they get the reaction. it sounds dumb thinking back to it but she was fully censored and i didn't just go to their website to find that video. i watched a bunch of their videos and that happened to be in the line up. she somehow stumbled across this in my history while i was sleeping and i basically woke up to her confronting me about the video and how i cheated on her by watching that and she breaks up with me walking out of my house saying to my dad ""your son likes to watch other naked women"". that one lost trust obviously

so we've obviously had a few break ups (a lot and its bad) and sometimes during those break ups id get on dating apps and this alone caused alot of trust issues cause she says stuff like ""how do i know youre not on dating apps since you always get on them when we break up"" or ""every time we break up you go look at half naked girls"" etc.. but the main thing is that during one of our break ups i was very skeptical about getting back with her because if you knew all the shit i dealt with and all the red flags you'd be skeptical too. so we started talking again and during the time we started talking again i was still talking to girls on the dating apps. it was like that for maybe a day or so and then when i thought it was clear me and GF were actually getting back together i stopped the dating apps. well once GF basically went through ALL of my shit cause she knew my passwords, she found out this info and claims i cheated on her and broke up with me again (she found out months later or whatever) and thats a huge factor in the trust issues

she has trust issues because ive watched porn before during breakups. she doesnt let me have any social media besides facebook. she doesnt trust me to go anywhere in public without her because she thinks im just gunna check out other girls. she literally says i go places just to check them out. one time i went to the mall specifically to buy her a gift and when she found out i was at the mall she flipped out and she knew i was there to get her something because i told her and she still flipped out and was ready to like ignore me and not let me come see her and all that. she has slapped me before for looking at a scene on tv where this girl was on a boat in a sun dress. anything with girls in it she doesnt trust me and i just cant figure out whether i deserve this or not.

the biggest example of how she handles these trust issues was a recent event where i went to help my dad and his female work partner move some furniture. i told GF i was going to help and she instantly had a problem with it and said i either couldn't go or had to bring her. i later told her i wouldnt be bringing her along and that she had nothing to worry about. she didn't fight me on it miraculously but once i was there she was asking lots of questions and stressing me the fuck out. she asked me to send a picture of everyones feet so she could see if i was looking at her and to send a video to make sure i couldnt see her. i expressed my problems to her trying to get me to do all this and then she literally starts spamming me with video calls so she can see and just being crazy. she's telling me how its my fault this is happening since ive put these trust issues on her and how since i did that i need to build it back like this. it ended in me hanging up on her and then her calling back while i was in the car with my brother and friend headed from the uhaul place to the place where we were getting the furniture and her saying like fuck you and so i said it back and then she broke up with me ignored me for basically 3 days and treated me like shit afterwards putting everything on me like i caused this cause of the trust issues

theres a hell of a lot more craziness but i don't want to keep going. do i deserve these trust issues and the way she handles it or is this overboard? i know some of the things i probably shouldnt have done or could've done a lot better, but i really feel im being mistreated.

tldr: girlfriend doesnt trust me and i feel its not justified fully",20Aug2020,1
340,"I’ve never known how to react to an emotional situation. If someone is talking about something like a break up or bad situation where they usually end up crying, i blank. I usually try to give advice or say that I’ll be there if they need to vent, but i don’t know what else to do, and i don’t show emotions on my face; although i am indeed feeling intense emotions and really do care. I usually try to talk to the person after the fact and they usually seem to talk to me differently, like they think i don’t care, and it seems like they want to brush me off.


The blank expression thing also extends to day to day life. I feel like it makes people uncomfortable, and I’m super self conscious about it. The best i can do is smile when I’m happy and look down when I’m sad(without having a sad expression), which makes for a horrible impression on them.

I just want to connect with people and be there for them without seeming absent minded or careless. Is there something i can do to fix this? It’s really starting to take a toll on my mental health and i really need advice.",20Aug2020,1
341,"-I Was 15-16 at the time (currently 17) and i met this girl on discord, you see i have always been a loner therefore i caught feelings pretty quick, we started off as friends but we ended up saying we liked each other, i got it a bit too far i guess by making it a relationship. We stayed like that for a year playing games for a year and you know making plans on when we meet. But she ended up falling into depression cos school, then met this other guy who was from the country next to him and just left me for him, but now i feel as if i can just be friends with her and forget about my past, i feel as if the only way to move on for real is to be comfortable even with someone who once hurt me, and not just dislike them because we both messed up but she did a bit more. I understand talking to your ex is never a good thing but what i have understood is that being friends would've probably been better, she was also 1 year older than me and todays society pushes females to think a younger guy is immature, therefore i do not think there was much choice about it. What im thinking is trying to hit her back to maybe play something, i know i will feel something nostalgic and also will feel some kind of pain or anger towards her but obviously won't show it, and i KNOW for a fact it will go away within minimum 1 week to maximum 1 month. I also guarantee myself i would immedieatly stop talking to her if i could not control my emotions. I just really want to get over with this person, even have her as a friend and also just manage to train my emotions. Note that im NOT using her, i am only saying train because i have learnt to be calm with everything but except when it comes to past lovers and i feel as if the only reason that it is so its because i never comforted that feeling like i have with other ones, i never got the chance. I Would also like to add that she TRIED to be a friend with me after 6 months of not talking but after i realised she had commited intercourse with that guy that i had a bad feeling about i could not help myself but feel VERY angry and dissrespected that i was thrown away for someone like that and that is when she realised...but now i don't care it was my fault for expecting much, just being friends and playing would be a good time killer and also would be fun cos we related a lot but as i said i was just a loner who wanted to try love but tried it on internet.

-The only reason that i really want to talk is because it feels wrong for me to have cut her off even though she was with him AFTER breaking up with me, like after we talked again she was very cooperative and was talkative and asking to play and shit NOTHING relationship, but i just turnt it awkward, i kept asking her personal questions i kept being a kid and immature and saying ""idk i feel weird about you again"" and after asking if she was a virgin and her saying no gave me like a sudden emotional attack because you know you expect the opposite. And i just cut her off completely that makes me look completely like a kid who can't deal with not having what he wants. Therefore i think it really could help me develop better experience so i don't act childish especially that im growing up. I will be honest with you, i barely think she was my ex anymore, i feel as if we had a crush, but hers ended quicker but not before i made it into a relationship (more of like a want to feel loved relationship).",20Aug2020,1

347,"We are both 18 and we got assigned roommates and I had only FaceTimed (once) and texted her a few times prior to moving in. My roommate and me come from different economic and family backgrounds. My mom is very active in my life and we are upper middle class (have the money for everything we need; save for what we want) She also taught me/ life has taught me how to be strong, independent, caring, intelligent, basically an adult. I am extremely greatful for the life that I have with the support system and financial stability. 
My roommates life was nothing like mine, she grew up dirt poor, parents who never went to college and work minimum wage jobs, they essentially kicked her out when she turned 18 but they “allowed” her to stay until college started. Which was about a week ago. To put this bluntly, my roomate is not mentally, physically, socially, or academically ready for college. 
She has social anxiety and won’t go anywhere unless I go with her (like to the extremes), won’t shower/brush her teeth unless I remind her multiple times (it’s Wednesday night and she hasn’t showered since Sunday and she hasn’t showered again) , she doesn’t want to participate in any social events, and I am assuming ( I do not know for sure) that she has an eating disorder. She hasn’t eaten more than a few hundred calories per day. Also she won’t even go to the cafeteria to get food unless I go with her and due to my schedule our lunches and dinners don’t match up most days. So she just doesn’t eat. Additionally- I encouraged her to look at her financial aid and see what she owes to make sure it’s been paid off. She had no clue what I was talking about. I had to help her log in and it turns out she owes 3k by September and another 2k by October. And then again in Jan and February. She had no idea she had to pay this or even agreed to this. She’s speaking with the financial aid office tomorrow to see if there is anything they can do and also see if her grandparents will go sign a loan. Ultimately, I am feeling more like a mom than a roommate and I hate her for it. This isn’t the college experience i wanted or deserve and i don’t know what to do. Even if she does find a way to pay it, everything else is still there. Please

349,"For background the whole story about my manager(owner of the restaurant but also plays manager) is in my post history. To sum it up, my manager is not a very nice/good person and takes out her frustrations on me and often treats me like i’m dumb. Therefore making me feel anxiety about going to work everyday. 

I’m just 17 and i’ve recently got into the hobby of flipping clothes and want to put my time into that. I’ve been meaning to quit this week but everyday i chicken out and end up going. (The rude manager was off this week but will be there tomorrow) My plan was to either go to work and wait for her to say something rude to me (which she will eventually in the time i’m there) and then tell her that i don’t like how she talks to me and then leave mid shift. (immature yes i know xD) OR just text her the morning before my shift and tell her i won’t be coming in anymore. If i don’t come in tomorrow the owner will be forced to cover my job or have someone else cover it.

Should i just text her before and tell her i won’t be coming in? I don’t really wanna go in tomorrow and talk to her because sometimes when it’s time for me to leave (time that’s on the schedule) they ask me to stay longer and i always have stuff to do after work and they guilt me into staying and if she tries to guilt me into not quitting it might work because i’m too nice 😬",20Aug2020,1
350,"About a week ago my dad impulsively bought a husky puppy while my mom, sister, and I were visiting family. She’s really hyper (as expected because she’s a puppy and a husky), however, my family can’t seem to handle her energy levels. My sister (14) is getting beyond stressed and wants to send her back or sell her. I don’t want to give up on her just yet, I want to give this puppy a chance and raise her right because I feel it’s too soon to just simply give up on her.

Here’s our “problems”
- biting and scratching (she tends to do this even if we aren’t in her personal space, but mostly happens when we try to put her in a kennel, take things away from her that she can’t have or will make her sick. She got my sister good the other day while my sister was simply sitting on the couch) 
- refusing to pee or poop outside, but only using her pee pads 
- chewing (of course since she’s a puppy) 
- I struggle with negative reinforcement like stern voice, putting her in a kennel, etc

Here’s what I do know about raising a puppy 
- positive reinforcement is a must, and we have been doing this with treats and affection/attention 
- we need to kennel train her (my sister and I have a trouble with leaving her in a kennel because she cries and we don’t have the heart to just simply let herself cry until she adjusts to it)
- she needs lots of exercise (we try to bring her outside lots for walks, however, most times she just sits and eats grass. We also play with her in the house with toys) 
- we can’t punish her for her hyper ness because it’s in her nature and I feel it would be wrong to do so and would cause her to not trust us 

If anyone has any advice, it would be greatly appreciated. I really don’t want to give up on this dog as my dad is already in love with her and I want her to have a good life. Thank you in advance.",20Aug2020,1
351,"Hello, so i live in the new jersey area at a restaurant i’m gonna apologize for my grammar now it’s gonna be bad.

355,"Has anyone else gone to Colorado technical university on campus or online? I’m almost 60% done with my bachelors and I’m feeling so discouraged. 

My student loans with the government are running out CTU told me so they told me to get another loan in the next few months and pay out of pocket on a balance I have in my student acct or they will have to withdraw me. I am a first generation student with no living parents so you would think my EFC is low but it’s not. I’ve had to retake a few classes so that has eaten up aid I could have used but it’s only been a few classes. 
I’ve seen some shady stuff about this “university” charging you for even logging into campus and they fees they charge are crazy high. I think it’s sketchy how all the sudden they have used up all my government aid and grants. 
I have core credits math and such completed at another legitimate university I can transfer once I pay them off. But I think they won’t matter because I have taken these same classes at CTU. So this isn’t the only college I’ve used my aid at. 

The problem is I wasn’t aware and didn’t do my research that CTU is in trouble with the state board of education for false advertising about jobs and screwing over veterans so I can’t get a loan from another source. CTU isn’t in the options list no matter what loan service I try. They might be accredited and this and that but the college itself is on pins and needles with the department of education. 

I read they have to remain open long enough for the current students to graduate and then they will be shut down unless they do a settlement. I’ve seen the settlement in the works and I don’t think I’d qualify to sue them because I don’t remember them explicitly telling me I was promised a job and I’m not a vet. Im just an un educated young person who picked the worst school possible for a IT computer degree. And soon just like those other sketchy universities you used to see on commercials making false promises and luring people in. Will I even be able to go back to it and complete my degree after I scrounge you money. I honestly want a refund!!!

I’m trying to get my credit score up now so I can get a personal loan and I’m so disappointed my school has let me down. I’ve had a long journey trying to complete college I’m now in my late 20s -between loosing family members and being homeless twice it’s been tough. I always have tried to withdraw in a timely manner or take it down to one class a month when it hits the fan so I conserve my aid and stuff. 
It’s just so sketchy how all my aid is used up and between the stuff I have read online and my own experience this school has treated us like a piggy bank. It’s been an expensive waste of my time and I can’t transfer because I owe them 4000$ on my student account too. 

I’m thinking about once again taking break or just stopping all together. I’m due with my first baby in less than a month and a half. I don’t think I have anything done enough to get my associates with what I have completed so far credit wise and if I did have the credits done -I can’t use it or graduate due to the student account balance.

357,"So some backstory: 
My boyfriend(20) and I(18) have been together 4 years now. I’m from the states he’s from the uk. (How we met and got together is a whole other story) Let’s call him Josh and his sister Lucy(22).

A little over a year ago we all went on a trip to Greece. Josh, Lucy, Lucy’s bf, Josh’s friend and I. It was a very popular night life destination in Greece so very wild. I kind of new this but wasn’t aware of the extent. I had only ever been out of the usa twice and both were to the uk. This was all very new to me and I was very overwhelmed at the start. I also have pretty bad anxiety and get anxiety attacks often. Not even 10 minutes after arriving at our hotel, I had one. It’s hard to explain why I think I was just overwhelmed and in shock I guess of the change. Right away everyone wanted to get pre drinking everything. After I calmed down from my anxiety attack I was cool with this. We were just in the hotel room playing uno and drinking. When night time came, we went out to a club. I had a pretty bad experience just feeling so out of place, so uncomfortable, and anxious. At one point a man grabbed my ass and this rattled me because i’ve had past trauma with sexual assault. (He got kicked out in the end.) I tried really hard to fit in so I got really drunk and we “had a good night”. I never actually felt happy I was just going along with it. The next two nights were pretty much the exact same except the 3rd night I had a severe anxiety attack and Josh and I left early. This is where the sister part comes in.

The next day Lucy and Josh’s friend were alittle annoyed that we left early but we’re planning what we were gonna do that night. Josh knew how much I didn’t want to go out again so he voiced that and that’s when Lucy went into full bitch mode. She said that I need to stop being so scared and “suck it up” and this trip is meant to be like this so I should have known. She was spewing shit like Josh needs to stop worrying about me because he doesn’t leave my side and that I’m leaving his friend out. She said this trip was meant to be without me anyway. She said I’m spoiling this holiday for everyone basically. So much more than that was said but I can’t put everything. I was just speechless honestly I didn’t know what to say. Here is something she needed to understand: I was 17. How old was she? Oh a full ass 21 year old having a go at a 17 yr old girl for being uncomfortable going out clubbing every single night. Another thing she needed to understand was I am from the U.S. I’m not even of legal age to drink there so I had never been out drinking once. She’s been drinking for about 6 years. Josh and I went back to our hotel room and what do you know? I had another attack and was crying most the night wishing I could be back home. She made me feel so horrible like I was such a burden and noone wants me there. OH the best part?? The next night Lucy got a sore throat and she didn’t wanna go out because she felt like shit. Oh! So you can’t go out anymore? Huh? Well that’s funny because what happened to sucking it up ? Oh but now it’s you suffering so you know how it feels. Mkay. Oh and one of the last nights we were there, Lucy and her bf bailed on us because they were sick of going out with Josh’s friend who was with us. Hmmm. (There was a whole other bad experience with Josh’s friend.) Lucy never apologized to me for this. She’s never even acknowledged it. Also to note, this trip was the second time I had ever met this girl. So great first impressions right?

To this day I haven’t let go of this grudge. I have tried. I really want to because it gets in the way of Josh and I’s relationship because we see her all the time and sometimes I can’t hold back my remarks. It would be easier if she wasn’t such a shallow, ignorant, attention seeking, slutty, dumb blonde bitch. God I can’t stand her sometimes. She fully embodies the persona of a dumb blonde mean girl. She is 22 now and she is still so stupid. An example, she didn’t know what “immune” meant before this virus thing. Yesterday she didn’t know what it meant to “exert” yourself. Simple shit like that, there is so much more. I honestly can’t make this up. 

So yeah she gets on my nerves every single time I’m with her and I don’t know how to stop it. Any advice or similar situations you wanna share would be nice.
Thanks for reading all of that.",20Aug2020,1
358,"I was at a party with one of my guy friends (who I might have sexual tension with??idrk) and he asked me and only me if he should hook up with this girl. He’s never done this, usually I would assume he would ask his guys friends who were there. I told him I didn’t know and he kept asking me until he said that it was up to me so I had to tell him an answer. When I asked why it was up to me he didn’t say anything.

359,"So I recently started seeing this guy and he’s great. He’s so sweet, funny, and we get along so much. But today I noticed right above his lip he had acne? I am familiar with cold sores and what the virus is but I have never gotten one. 
My health is very important to me and I’ve had an ex before who didn’t tell me he got cold sores until I noticed one day he had a giant one on his lip. He tried to say it wasn’t a big deal and 99% of the population gets them but I broke up with him right then and there because he should’ve been more responsible and not try to downplay and knowingly risk infecting me. 
Anyway I can’t tell if the new guy I’m seeing has a cold sore. It doesn’t look bad and it’s not on his lip. I know people can get them around the mouth. So I asked him as soon as I noticed. He told me this was the first time hearing of it and prior he didn’t know what cold sores were. He was apologized and he told me if we don’t have to kiss until he gets it looked at. 
I’m not a doctor but it just looked like two small pimples and he said he’s never gotten anything on his lip directly. What do you guys think? I hope I wasn’t exaggerating or being phobic but I am scared. He’s such a great guy but I don’t see it working out if they are actually cold sores.",20Aug2020,1
360,"Context: I have been living in a very abusive family all my life. My dad was physically abusive, he beat my siblings a lot, and has even shot at them before. He also constantly threatens us with violence, even my 8 year old niece (I call her my sister sometimes). My mother is extremely manipulative and constantly gaslights me. She also manipulated me (as a minor) to hide the fact that I was sexually harassed and assaulted multiple times by different people. When I confronted her about it this year, she insisted it was my own choice to not say anything about it. My older siblings are also extremely toxic and antagonistic.

I've recently opened emergency commissions ( [https://perciscommissions.carrd.co/](https://perciscommissions.carrd.co/) ) to save enough money to get out. Due to the pandemic, I haven't left the house AT ALL, not even for a grocery run since my parents have made sure that I don't get a pass at all. If I were to get a pass, I'd need to get one from the local barangay, and get an authorization letter. Which is difficult since my mom works there, and my dad is close to almost everybody there.

My goal is PHP150k, and I've only saved up 40k so far. I'd need a large portion of that for the downpayment of the apartment, and the rest is to sustain myself for awhile while I don't have work.

I told my mom of my intentions to move and she has gotten severely manipulative and antagonistic. I fear that she might get my dad on her side (he doesn't know yet) and they might start taking my things, and trap me here.

Should I use a little over half my savings and just get the apartment now to ensure my safety, then keep earning money from commissions, from there? Or should I brave storm for another month here (if it's possible)?",20Aug2020,1

365,"I often go out with a friend group of about 7 to 5 people and it’s great. However, I lose myself in the moment so to say. It’s a nice get away when if there is something weighing on my mind as I feel like I completely have a different mindset when I’m with others. I just ignore or forget what’s on my mind. It’s good that I forget my woes but I also forget how to be conscious of what I’m saying or doing. When I go into this “being with company” mode i have two different “moods”, I either get really annoying or what I can only describe as a “resting depressed face” where I look like I’m not having a good time and mental goes downhill a little. Neither of those are very fun moods for others. As I feel I cause many headaches.

The best way to describe it, is as if I’m drunk. I don’t really know what I should say so I just say things anyways (not rude or insulting things, just weird things), but when I leave I feel like complete trash for being that way and I often question why I’m like this. My friends don’t really say anything about me being annoying but I’m sure it’s because they wouldn’t say it to my face., but they still invite me to places which I hope means they don’t completely hate me. I feel as if it would have been a better experience had I not been around. Anyways, I make really annoying comments or jokes that aren’t funny and I activity think about how to be funny or how to be entertaining when all it probably comes off as is annoying. I don’t want to sound edgy or anything but I often wonder if there is something wrong with me. I’m horrible at 1 on 1 conversations with others as I feel the need to fill in every single period of silence with something even though I would be better of saying nothing. I wouldnt say I’m an awkward person and I don’t think others think I’m awkward, yet when I speak to someone I always feel awkward. 

After we hang out I feel like trash and do some self reflection, I tell myself that I’m annoying and should stop being like that. Despite me telling myself that what I’m doing is annoying and I shouldn’t force myself to be funny or entertaining, I forget this when I enter my “being with company” mode and the cycle starts all over again.

I don’t believe I’m depressed or have anxiety issues as I believe this is an issue most face. So the TLDR of this is, how do I be normal. How can I take control of myself and tell myself that I shan’t be like this so I don’t feel like trash after I hang out with friends. I don’t wish to completely remove myself from them but I also don’t want them to notice that I’ve completely change my personality. I just want to be more normal I guess.

I’m sorry if I’m wasn’t clear enough or that there is an obvious solution. I’ll try to clear questions to the best of my ability even if I’m not the best at explaining how I feel. Thank you for your time and thank you for any help you can provide.",20Aug2020,1
366,"Hey guys,

I come from a bad country and my goal is to move to a first world, safe country before I am 30. I am now 20. The best way to do this is by getting a good degree, in said country because most allow you to seek for jobs after your graduation.

I applied for an exchange as well as to a University in Austria, I already got accepted in Austria and everything is in place to go. For the exchange, there is also a high probability. Therefore I have a choice.

Finish my degree in my home country (I'm first year, 2nd semester) or start over in Austria (I will start then this October, but I will also get a lot of ECTS off - about a semester so no time wasted really + if I want to go over for masters I also don't have to wait around for a year). 

The reasons for doing the exchange, above the degree is:   
\- I get to see if I like the country before committing everything to it, if it doesn't work out I can go back relatively quickly having lost no time in my degree program

Negatives about exchange: Only real negative is that I'm forced to do the Masters after my bachelor. Isn't the end of the world to me though, I love studying. 

The reasons for doing the degree abroad:   
\-Instant bologna degree, should be easier to get into a masters throughout Europe  
\-Can directly start working in the country after my bachelor.   
\-I might get more used to the culture with a 3 year bachelor than a 1 year exchange surrounded by exchange students most likely. 

Negatives about taking the degree abroad : Big risk, I might not cope with the language. I might be very alone and hate the culture, Austria especially is not as warm and friendly as my home country. 

The degree is in Computer Science. 

Thanks in advance! 

Tl;dr : Come from a poor country, want to emigrate to a developed country. Should I do exchange to European uni and then migrate for master or should I do my bachelor there",20Aug2020,1

371,"7 years ago I really liked this boy I met at a mutual friend's beach party and we had such a connection. It was on another level that even years later, no other connections have ever even come close. 7 years later, I still think about the romantic getaways, the chemistry we had that was physical, mental, and even emotional. I won't go too much into detail on that but trust when I say that this person was one of a kind and had an impact on my life. Fast forwarding after maybe 4 months of spending time together, I moved to college and the connection had severed. He had ghosted me and later I had learned that he had a girlfriend right after. Which made me think it wasn't as genuine as I thought. There never was any closure come to think of it. I just accepted ghosting as a form of closure that he didn't respect me enough to give me even that much. After trying to reconnect after college, I found that he had blocked and even unadded me on everything. (Which could've been bevause he had a girlfriend) 

NOW in 2020, he's single, and I get a friend request from him so of course I gave in despite my better judgement. We've been ""friends"" since June. But none of us have messaged eachother. Or done anything. I want to know if I should trust my logic on this one because he had his chance and he didn't get it right the first time by lying to me, disrespecting me, hurting me, and I shouldn't be the one to let him in and message first. Even though we were never together as a couple. OR go with the benefit of a doubt and let go of what happened 7 YEARS ago. I did a lot of growing up in 7 years and hopefully he has, too.

373,"Hey so I (f15) have this friend who I have a weird history with. We've been... aquatints for a few years but about a year ago He groped a couple of girls and got jumped for it. I stopped talking to him until I finally gave him a second chance because he got clean and swore he was different.

So that's a bit of background for why I act a bit more sensitive to some of his jokes. As for what's happening right now, we just hung out for the first time since covid started and  he acted really strange. We were alone in his house and so that was a bit sus to begin with, but also every second sentence he said was some sort of sexual joke like 'quick before my mom comes back you gotta blow me' and stuff and to begin I laughed it off, but as it got to the point where he didn't say anything else I said it was starting to bother me and stuff. He swears they're just jokes and he said that 'he can't help himself'. Later on he did more stuff like tried to snuggle because he was 'sad' and so I ended up leaving.

Usually, I'd stop talking to anyone who did stuff like this, but He doesn't have any other friends really and he attributes me as the reason he didn't end his life. Basically, I'm worried that if I leave, I will have driven him to suicide or back on drugs because I can't take a joke. Maybe I'm over reacting and I should just tolerate the jokes, but its really bothering me not knowing what to do.

She is on a waiting list for counseling to help her through this.

I'm here because I want to know if it is a good idea to buy this used 2013 Hyundai Sonata Limited despite the big recall.

I've been looking for a new car for 3 weeks since my 2007 Civic took some water in and was totaled. I'm thinking about settling on the car mentioned below. According to [Autotrader.com](https://autotrader.com/) there are only 22 models like this in the country with under 75,000 miles, this is the 3rd best priced, there's no better deal within 650 miles, and it's only $300 cheaper. This was listed at $9.9k and the dealer has agreed to drop it down to $9,000 to get me out the door under $11,000. My loan only covers up to $11,000 and that must cover taxes, tags, title and all.

2.4L 2013 Hyundai Sonata Limited w/ premium package-close to excellent condition - exception being a very minor dent on the back right side. //alloy wheels // panoramic moon/sun roof // blu-tooth // leather interior // front and rear heated seats // back up camera // 6 speakers w/sub // touch screen // navigation // XM // dual climate control // rear a/c //  
66k miles. 1 Owner and the service record on car fax shows vehicle was maintained at manufacturer suggested intervals. All recall maintenance performed, including the rattle sensor being installed.

\#6 used midsized sedan for under $10k per cars.usnews

Carfax shows that just a couple hundred miles ago the engine was replaced at the dealer because of the metal shavings / cam shaft recall. At that time the original owner sold. The engine was replaced and is refurbished / like new.

I have contacted plaintiff relations in regards to the pending class-action suit and they confirmed that the VIN associated with this car has a life-time power train warranty attached to it. This can be repaired under warranty indefinitely as long as the vehicle continues to be serviced regularly. I'm thinking this might be the only way I can get a vehicle with a manufacturer warranty in my price range.

So please, I'm not the most experienced at buying used cars from dealers. Is this a good idea because of the life time warranty or would I be making a mistake? Even if my engine blew out after 100 miles I could have it replaced at no cost with the warranty, in fact I could have the engine replaced anytime needed... for a lifetime! Also the 13 Sonata is supposed to be extremely inexpensive to maintain!",20Aug2020,1
383,"Hello,

A little backstory:
My mom and me stopped talking after she threw me out of the house at 12. She was very abusive (verbally), however, I was unaware until I left. I really thought my life was normal, that the treatment was normal. 

I’m older now and in my early 20s. I recently reconciled with her and am now taking a role of helping her out with cleaning. She has chronic COPD and still smokes. I don’t really think she’s going to make it much longer. 

I hate to admit it but when I saw her for the first time it scared me. Her teeth are gone and she requires air at all times. She cannot breathe and it’s scary hearing her gasp from simple tasks. 

I’m overwhelmed. This is the first time I’ve seen her in three years and now that I’m here, she’s dying. 

I feel guilty, like I truly ruined my mother. I was all she had and I cut contact off in order to protect myself. She has always had mental illness issues and been poor. I just feel like over time I’ve killed her and her life has been so sad. It sounds like a self centered view, but my mother truly had no one consistent but me. 

She still scares me. It scares me to be alone with her now. I can’t explain it, and I don’t think anyone thinks I’m being reasonable when I say I’m scared. I saw her yesterday and she raised her voice at a spam caller. I went into panic mode slightly because that behavior scares me when it comes from her.

This is something that I can feel changing me. I don’t have a choice but I also don’t know if I’m being dramatic. I don’t know how to handle this or really what to think. I don’t want to bother my friends with this so I’ve kept it to myself. I just need another perspective.",20Aug2020,1

388,I’ll try to make this short. I’m 19 and I’m a buss boy at a restaurant. I’ve worked there since May. I probably average about $9 an hour. Not trying to sound spoiled but I don’t need the money because my dad pays for my tuition and and gives me an allowance. I would like to be able to work as a server next summer and throughout the rest of college but I’m not sure if I’d be able to pull a server job with 4 months of experience working as a buss boy. I get along with the people I work with but I’m not really close with any of them and I only see them outside of work maybe every 2 weeks or so. They want we to work at least 3 days a week during the semester and my class schedule makes it to where I wouldn’t be able to work on any of the days I have school so I would be doing school or work 6 days a week. I like to visit my mom and grandparents who live a couple hours away and I want to be more involved in clubs going on on campus this semester so working would make both those things more difficult. But I’m worried if I quit this job I either won’t be able to find something as good or I’ll end up being bored and having too much free time. Should I keep working or should I quit?,20Aug2020,1
390,"Earlier this week, my mum recently found my weed stash which I was hiding somewhere in my room. I didn't exactly get in trouble, but the dynamics have been different with me and her recently. 

I got in trouble halfway through last year by the cops, my school and my parents because someone caught me with weed on myself (long story).

This is the second time I've been in trouble with drugs before. 

Story:

She picked me up from school, but she seemed weirdly quiet today. When we arrived home, she told my brother to go to the living room and she quietly confronted me about the weed. 

She asked me if I still do it, to which I replied that I was keeping it for a friend. She gave me a long look, and just replied with ok. She took it away, and I don't think she really gave me a punishment. 

She told me that she won't tell my dad, considering that I'm being fully honest with her. She said she chose to believe me, but I don't think she does.

It's been a few days since the incident and she's the only one who knows. She's been acting more cold towards me and we haven't really had a conversation since then. 

Weed is something that I do like every month or two with mates, so I was pretty bummed out when she took my stash. I still don't know react or proceed honestly. Things have been weird with her since then.",20Aug2020,1
391,"I have almost always been quite an anxious person, and corona has made it much worse. During lockdown I switched jobs, but starting a 8.45-5.15 job after being furloughed for 5 months is proving really tough. My last few jobs before covid knocked my confidence hugely anyway and now with my new job my mental health is just getting the better of me and I've taken a couple of sick days.

I've overheard my colleague say he had to come in because he wasn't sure if I was gonna be in. I can understand why he said that and why they wouldn't trust me to be in - I have had 2 sick days in the span of 3.5 weeks - I just don't know how to bounce back from this. I used to be anxious but much more resilient.  I feel covid has affected my mental health proper hard, I'm doing therapy once a week but I'm scared that I won't be able to cope with not being trusted, my rock bottom confidence and my anxious thoughts.

392,"I'm 17 (M) and I was suppose to enroll into a university called University of San Carlos for senior high in Cebu, Philippines and to pick ABM as a strand.

But due to the pandemic, it all has to be done via online classes. Now, it's the 20th (on my timezone) and the final day for enrollment is in the 22nd. No problem with that.

397,"TW: sexual harassment, emotional abuse

Hi everyone, I’m posting here because I have no one to share this with and over time this has really taken a toll on my mental health. Any advice or comforting words would be extremely appreciated. 

I am a 21 year old female who used to live in a blessed nuclear family (I’m an only child with immigrant parents). My mom and dad came to North America at a young age and started their entrepreneurial careers, and recently found success in the restaurant business. We were always financially stable (middle class) and seen as a “normal” family. 

However, my mom suddenly passed away recently due to a health issue and his true colours finally came out. I had a friend (22F) that was staying temporarily at our house at the time, who was actually my fiancée and my mom adored her. So when she passed away, despite our own hurting, we tried to comfort him as much as possible because we know they’ve been inseparable for the past 20+ years. 

On the night my mom was bedridden in the hospital, the day before we had to decide if we were going to keep her alive in a medical induced coma for the rest of her life or let her go peacefully, he said he was so lonely, and asked me and my friend to sleep in their bedroom with him that night.

I didn’t think anything of it, because before that night, I always thought of him as such a decent and gentle man, a great father, and a smart businessman. Also, it wasn’t uncommon for daughters to sleep with their dads in our culture even if we are a little older, and also I never thought anything of it when we both agreed to his request because who is sick enough to do anything inappropriate? My fiancée and I were jus too innocent and I will forever feel guilty for what happened next..

We slept on either side of him per his request, and I never thought anything of it.. until the next morning, my fiancée told me while sobbing about what he did to her. While we were sleeping, he slowly caressed her and touched her stomach, and moved his way up to her breast and nipples, running his fingers over them, and then tried to put his hands inside her pants. He also kissed her a lot, on her neck, her cheek, her forehead, and very close to her lips too. She was a light sleeper, so she felt everything but was too frozen to do anything in the moment, and went into shock. But she did try to warn him of sorts, several times, that she was awake, by moving around and pushing him away, but when she did that he clutched her in his arms even tighter, and kept a firm grip over her with his arms under her neck and his thigh hooked over her body. He looked at her a lot to make sure she was asleep too, which is disgusting. 
When he put his hands inside her pants, she immediately pretended to wake up and went to the washroom. After that, she came back and slept between me and him (unfortunately I was asleep so there was no space for her on my side) and she hugged me very tightly to get away from his grip. The next morning, my fiancée was sobbing when she told me that she doesn’t think my dad thinks of her like his daughter’s friend (we weren’t out to him). To this day, I feel so ashamed and so guilty every time I see my fiancée although she insisted it’s not my fault, but I feel like I should have been more cautious and had I not been so gullible and trusting I could have prevented this traumatic experience that happened to her. 
My wonderful fiancée, she’s such a kind soul, and had decided not to tell anyone because she knows that him and I are working on our business together and doesn’t want to see me fail because of his actions. I am so grateful to her for sticking by me despite everything that has happened but I can’t get rid of this pain and this guilt whenever I see her silently cry, trying to hide it from me, or when I see her hurting, alone. 

There’s a lot more to the story after that, but eventually I told him the truth (with my fiancées permission) about why we had been avoiding him, and why I never talked to him and why I was always angry around him. I told him she was awake when he sexually harassed her, and his response was so fucking pathetic I wanted to vomit on the spot. 

He stated: “well I didn’t rape her, it was nothing. She can try to sue me if that’s what she wants but there’s no evidence, tell anyone this story and there’s no one who would think I did anything wrong. I never put my dick in her, so I don’t understand why she’s so upset and why you’re so angry.”

I’m so upset because not only was what he did so wrong, but he did it on the night my mom was on her DEATH BED. Additionally, that was my fiancée he touched.. but I couldn’t do anything to protect her, from my own fucking father. 

To this day, my relationship with him has been broken, and even when he found out about us being together, he seems jealous that I talk and FaceTime her almost every night LDR) but he has never, ever been remorseful of his actions. He talks over it casually, and it’s as if he genuinely doesn’t think he did anything wrong, which is scary.

Fast forward to now (this happened a year ago), I have been so stressed on the daily, dealing with him. He is so verbally abusive, aggressive, and never fails to gaslight me at every opportunity. His words are like poison, he kills you from the inside. 

He threatened to out me and my fiancée (we’re a very conservative family) to the rest of the family to make me feel ashamed. He has commented on my boobs saying that they’re so saggy it’s as if I did something or got fucked by lots of men (they’re very big for my frame, I’m extremely embarrassed about it so I always wear baggy clothes to cover it up, he knows this and still took aim at my biggest insecurity).

He makes you doubt yourself and makes you winder if you were wrong all along. We still live together and do business together (I’m the brains and he’s the brawn) because honestly, I’m scared to leave behind everything that’s here for me. I have another year left to finish university, the business is doing well, we’re financially stable, it’s so difficult for me to just up and leave everything behind. I want to be able to provide for my future family, and this business is already doing quite well it’s such a shame if I lose it all because of him. But what makes me even more mad at myself, is I can’t run the business alone, at least not quite yet, no matter what he’s an experienced businessman who has 20+ years of experience under his belt where as I’m just a 21 year old girl starting her career. But his verbal abuse, his passive aggressiveness, and daily threats have been taking such a toll on me I think it’s only a matter of time before my patience runs out and I explode on him and do something stupid. 

Mind you, I have never forgotten what he did to my fiancée and to my mom on that horrible night, but I always glossed over his abuse toward me because I’m just trying to be patient for another year to finish school and become financially independent from him and the business. I have no one to talk to about this, and it eats at me every night and I don’t know how longer I can take this emotional trauma. To add to all this, he admitted one night after my mom died after I questioned him (because he was a known womanizer in his younger days) if he had ever cheated on my mom. 

Turns out, not only does he have a SON (what the fuck!!) a couple years older than me which he abandoned, but he also cheated on my mom when she was pregnant with me with her BEST FRIEND!! She never knew about it even until the day she passed. His actions, ignorance, mentality, and arrogance has not caught up to him yet, but I’m so angry for my mom, for my fiancée, and for myself. I have no one to turn to, and have no one to console. I feel so isolated, and am wondering what is a viable option at this point. 

Thank you for reading and noticing my post. Writing this out even if no one reads it has helped me figure out my own feelings a lot. I hope whoever you are, you are having a great day and don’t ever take your family for granted, ever.",20Aug2020,1

The only social interaction I would have was with my parents, grandparents, my sister and the kids who were at my school. The school experience wasnt the greatest either.

404," Im a guy. So feel free to not pitty me because we are supposed to just fucking tough it out. I am the biggest loser youll ever fucking meet. Ill start from the begining.I lost track of how fucking long ago this was... 3 years maybe? I dont know. I was at a calm party. No drugs or anything. I was talking about anime to my friends and their friends. I ended up bringing up a anime I adore. ""Goldentime"" I respect you if you know it. I pretty much said ""If you know Golden Time ill marry you"" And that was the biggest fucking mistake of my life. I wont give her real name, so lets call her Spirit. A friend of a friend answered with ""I know it"" And we started talking. I figured out her name was spirit and we clicked. One two skip a few. She has a boyfriend. Totaly dick who could be in the room with all the past presidents and would still think hes the smartest, hottest, best... Yatta yatta ect. Point is hes a total dick. Well she and him have been together for I think like 3 months. I wont go into detail about the next part because it was boring. We pretty much just got closer. After about 3 weeks I made a joke or something about me kissing her and she said some shit like ""ok"" and yeah. I made a HUGE mistake. That guy was a total dick but he didnt deserve this. I kissed her, she kissed back.... Things got carried away. We kept it a secret for about a week before I told her to break up with him. She was totally ok with it. Now let me pause and say this. I had never been in a serious relationship before this. I regret what I did very much. I was too fucking selfish to see what I was doing. I dont care how bad you want someone dont ever make someone a cheater. Back to the story, we just fucking... WOW we were so perfect. We would leave each other like 500 messages at night while the other person slept. It was just too cute. We dated for about a year and some change. It was just pure perfect. The best relationship anyone could ask for. Then i got fucked over. She cheated on me. And let me just say this. I NOW see that if your relationship starts with cheating YOURE GONNA GET CHEATED ON. I didnt see it coming at all. I got... Phew... SO fucking broken at that point... I uh... I ended up ... I fucking begged. BEGGED for at least 2 weeks for her to come back... I cried myself to sleep every night. She kept picking him over me for 2 FUCKING WEEKS. Now theres 9.7K memebers in this and all of you would agree that was the most stupid move. She took me back after that. And I wasnt happy... I was fucking PISSED. I did stupid shit made her feel guilty made her cry (Never put my hands on her it was all verbal) (Also I wasnt saying things like ""YOURE A UGLY WHORE"" it was just like ""HOW COULD YOU AFTER EVERYTHING WE HAVE BEEN THROUGH"") She told me she was forced into the other relationship and I still dont know HOW she wasnt raped for put at gunpoint. It was probly a secret she had or something along those lines. But it doesnt matter. Id say 6 months into our NEW relationship. It was at that point not good. We didnt talk much but in a weird way I loved her to death and I just couldnt let go. Well she cheated again. This time she didnt tell me for god knows how long. But get this shit. ITS WITH THE FUCKING EX. But you guys can just call that Karma I guess. Well I begged AGAIN like a fucking idiot and she said yes then about a week later I found out she never broke up with him. The next part was the worst because it was then she stopped loving me. She fully spat on me. She ended up bringing a friend to tell me to fuck off. And I wanted to but I cried myself to sleep at night. I cut my legs, I could barely walk without getting tired (At this point i was like 130 pounds and kinda not muscular but not at all fat) It was just... The worst. Well skip a few months and here I am. Idk anymore I tried dating others and I couldnt. I dont love them. I cant love them. My heart belongs to spirit and I cant for the fucking life of me take it back. I dont want to be with her anymore. But I cant love anyone else. I try so hard I read articles buy books all just for a way to fucking get out of this constant loop of heartbreak but I just fucking CANT. I hate this feeling. I take anti depressants but they dont help all that much. Im so fucking tired of not being able to sleep without crying. I hate feeling weak (Im now about 160 pounds, I started working out when i could.) Im so lost. I hate this feeling but I just CANT get over it. I know this will make many think im a loser or pathetic or a ass for making that guy get cheated on but honestly im just a human who makes dumb mistakes and cant find happiness. I need advise. I dont know what to do anymore. I want nothing to do with her yet I wanna spend every second with her if that makes any sense. Thanks for reading.",20Aug2020,1

Hi! This is my first ever post. Just wanted to ask for your advice.

I just feel so frustrated because my sister (15 y/o) gets away with everything. She is exempted from doing chores, when she wants something she immediately gets it and when I would ask my parents why they let her, they just say “just let her be, your sister is has a different way of thinking, we should be very understanding”. 

Whenever she gets reprimanded, she would often talk back and try to prove that she did nothing wrong. She is very good at twisting stories, to make it look like we’re at fault. 

My other siblings and I feel very hurt because we cannot air out our frustrations. My parents are scared to hurt her feelings so most of the time we just keep quiet. They just tell us to be more patient and understanding but it gets really tiring. 

Am I a bad person for crying and feeling sad because she ate all my snacks ? I know it sounds selfish :( I cant even ask her why she didn’t leave some for me because it will just create more drama. I just got reprimanded because they said that Im making a big deal out of this, they said that i should’ve just kept quiet. I just don’t know what to do anymore… :(",20Aug2020,1

409,"When I was 13-15 I had anorexia. Was diagnosed, bmi underweight, I didn't have my period for about a year.

After that I still was very insecure about my weight, slowly gained some and my bmi was then in the healthy range but on the lower end for a long while. I developed stomach inflammation too which was pretty bad because I wasn't eating properly.

Since I finished my final school exams, started birth control, and after that moved in with my boyfriend I've been much happier. And my weight has been increasing since then (a bit over a year ago). So about year and a half ago I used to weigh around 54-55kg and I am 164kg,now I weigh 65kg and a few months ago it was 63kg. My stomach was full when I weighed myself so it's a bit less than 65kg. On the BMI scale that is on the edge of being overweight.

My boyfriend's reaction was that I should stop buying junk food and eat less junk food. He is pretty realistic and he always tells me the truth.

I know I have been eating a lot of junk food lately because I am extremely stressed... I'm in and out of jobs, waiting for a visa, away from family for nearly a year and idk when I will see them because of covid 19...

The thing is that I don't think that I can change my diet at the moment that much because it would be too much for me to take on at the moment. I started going to the gym last week and that makes me feel so so good and I really want to keep that habit going. So if I also started seriously dieting, it would be extremely hard to start both things at the same time. But I am obviously upset about my weight, I started crying when I saw the number on the scales and I am still extremely upset.

I will also mention that prior to seeing that number I was very happy in terms of my body and food I eat. I wasn't that happy before I stared going to the gym, and sometimes I feel quite self consciouss but overall I have a much better relationship with my body than I had a few years ago (or so I believe).

So yes I don't know what to do... I feel very horrible.

412,"So, let's start from the beginning.. i use to work in an IT department doing basic IT stuff and looking after a website, I also did some graphic design for the marketing department, I enjoyed the graphic design side of things as I studied graphic design at college and new what I was doing. I decided I wanted to changed jobs as I wasn't enjoying the IT side of things, it just didn't interest me anymore. My partners dad runs his own small business, and got wind that I wanted to change jobs (i did some work on the side for him) and offered me a job opertunity doing graphic design work and also software development, I found this interesting and after some carful consideration (obviously because I will be working for my partners dad and working with my partner!) I decided to take the role. 

I started a month later, I new I would have to do a mixture of role as its a small business so I helped out with the IT, thats fine as long as it doesn't outweigh my new role, it did. And now I find myself doing 80% IT stuff 10% of software and graphic design and then 10% of other random stuff. 

I have voiced this in my appraisals but nothing has changed, its at the point now where if someone asks what my job role is to someone in the office the responce is IT, I dont even know my actual job role!. I had to fill out a job description form basiclly what are my duties and responsibilities at work and the majority of it was IT related.

I am in a difficult position as I'm working for my partners dad and I feel like I'm not learning or doing my actual role, the software side of things is very technical and needs guidance from the boss but It seems like I do a bit every now and then meaning I'm not learning alot. lets put it this way I have been working at my current job for over 3 years and i still don't understand the basics.

So, yea is it just me or am I being pushed down a path i dont want to go down? I left my old job because I didn't want to do IT anymore and now I'm doing IT in my current job and not my actual job role. I have handed my notice in once but my partners dad told me that it will change so I decided to stay on, that was 2 years ago. Any advice would be great!",20Aug2020,1

To be honest, I just want to throw myself off a bridge or in front of a car perhaps. It's not like my life particularly matters to society. I've got no friends, barely any family. It's not like I even matter to you, reading this. Why suffer through the hard ships and troubles of life, if at the end of the day it's pointless and the world will still be unjust and cruel. I have no value as an individual. If anything, I take from society more than I give back. I don't even know why I'm so upset, it's pathetic; there are so many undeserving people who suffer through so much worse, yet here I am taking up your time. You reading this could be helping those deserving people instead of listen to me, whining. It's not unexpected, given brainless BoJo's response to the virus. It's not like the 60,000 people who are dead deserved it. I just don't know what to do anymore. I felt this was the only opportunity to actually make something of my worthless life, yet I have failed to even do that. Any responses would be appreciated and thanks beforehand. See you on the other side, I suppose.",20Aug2020,1

I thought it was because of perhaps i had gender issues, i think i am cisgender. The reason i dont think its because of gender, is because i cringe i hear anytime someone says dude (it has gotten less over time) even not to me.

My hairline won't be so bad I hate it entirely for a few years but this is all preparation in case the finasteride/drug route doesnt work.

421,"Hello! I don't really know if this belongs here, but my problem is as the title suggests. I'll preface this by saying that what I did was wrong and stupid. 

Basically, I'm working my first summer job at a small organization. Part of my job is to create educational videos. For one of these videos, I did the old ""take a passage and change a few words"" thing, not once, but multiple times from different articles in a frankenstein-esque script. I did this for no good reasons; I was stressed, I was tired, and it seemed like a good idea. Obviously, it wasn't. During our morning meeting, my boss mentioned that the editor of our magazine should do a specific lesson on plagiarism for our contributors, because ""someone"" on our team had done so for a video and it wasn't okay. She did not refer to me by name, but although several others also do videos, I am almost certain it is me. She didn't call me out today at all, or send any emails about it, but after consulting someone, I schedule sent her an apology email for tomorrow morning. 

Will this tarnish my record of anything forever? I'm starting university in the fall and am terrified that the consequences of this awful blunder will affect me somehow. Does anyone have any advice for this type of situation? Please advise if so.",20Aug2020,1
422,"Hey I was wondering what everyone thinks of this. Or if I'm imagining things. I follow this girl on insta - she is semi famous (insta model with over a million followers). What she's also famous for is stealing other peoples pictures and using them as her own (there was a big scandal involving her last year). 

I still follow her as I like the kind of nature aesthetic she has, even if she is a dick. 

I have a small following, like only 300 people. Pretty standard. 

Anyway, for the past few months I've started noticing strange parallels between our posts. I took a pic with a bike - she posted a pic with a bike like 2 days later, when I post a pic of some of my sketchbook work, a day later she will post almost the exact same thing. I have a really specific way of laying out my stories (I'm a graphic designer so that stuff matters to me) And she has started using the exact same layout. I posted a pic with some black tourmaline a few days ago, then last night she uploaded a pic with black tourmaline. (There are more examples but will save that for now)

She doesn't follow me and I never see that she has viewed my stories - so I don't know if I'm going crazy. But there have been so many strange parallels that have happened that I'm wondering if she's copying me? And if so - is there anything I can do? I don't really want to private my page as I get more interaction with it public. I think because she's known for doing this it's making me even more suspicious

Anyway, if I'm tripping let me know

429,"I accidentally deleted the draft like 3 times so I'm going to make this quick. I'm sorry if I'm vague, I can provide more details in the comments if necessary. Recently my mom (34) and I (14) got in a fight over her trying to take away my stuff and giving it to my cousin. I'm still mad at her about it but I feel like of stupid for reacting the way I did despite knowing I have problems. 

Ever since I was little I've had depression, anger issues, anxiety and possibly more I don't even know about. She would always antagonize and belittle me for this. Whenever I would have a meltdown, she would accuse me of being ungrateful for everything and would subtly insult me whenever I tried to talk to her about my problems, either it be calling me fat or whatever. She called me useless and worth for nothing a couple of times when I was younger too. She's always done this and only now am I finally at my breaking point.

Please keep in mind I've appreciated everything she's ever done to me. I loved her so much I was willing to look past all the things she would say to me. I looked up to her and whenever she did something for me I'd thank her at least three times just to get my point across.

Ever since quarantine started I've been feeling more down in the dumps because everything is spiraling out of control. I don't even know how to feel anymore a majority of the time. I'm sure some of you know how that feels. I don't know why but I like to be assured that I have everything under my control and whatnot. Like I can keep my life in check and feel confident that nobody can change that. Unfortunately, it isn't mine that anymore. It's gotten to a point where the only way I feel like I have control over my own life is destruction. Not just to myself but everything ive ever owned. I hate this feeling but it's really all i feel like i have left. 

Last week she tried to take away my stuff (a console and a bunch of other stuff i bought with my own money) and give it to my cousin who she knows I don't get along with. She never asked me beforehand and just told me she was going to get rid of it because she assumed I never used any of it. I thought this was a little unfair and I was pretty annoyed she'd be getting rid of a gift i had received after the same cousin destroyed my old console. She never acknowledged it anymore than that until I started getting angry. I asked her why I would have to be giving my stuff to a cousin when I never gave permission for her to do this and she said it was never technically mine in the first place. I recounted the whole reason we even had it in the first place and she said ""Oh. I thought he just gave it to us because be didn't use it. I'm still going to give it to him though because I'm keeping my word."" And I just went nuts at that point. I was so upset that my belongings, the one thing left that I felt I had control over and found comfort in was being taken away from me by the same woman who constantly insulted and degraded me for years. I didn't even want to look at her the next day, Tuesday. Tuesday was strange. I went downstairs to go get my laundry since I had finally finished cleaning all my clothes and she was telling me something I obviously didn't want to hear at the moment. I don't remember what about. She seemed to notice I was a little stiffer than usual and asked what my problem was. Now, normally I don't ever tell her these things because of her reactions but I flat out told her I was unhappy she was giving away my stuff without my permission. She groaned and started going on about how she was sorry but that i shouldn't be upset over it because she ""didn't know"" in a very passive aggressive tone. I just said ""Okay."" and went upstairs with my laundry. I'll admit, it was a little rude of me but I really didn't feel like arguing with her. She followed me up my room and started doing what she always did. She told me I was overreacting and that it wasn't fair to her I was upset because ""i do everything for you and you're never grateful for anything i try to do"". then she tried using my own friends against me. I broke down at that point. She kept asking me ""What do you honestly want me to do at this point? Because it seems like you're never happy with anything. What am I supposed to do with you?"" to which I sheepishly replied ""Nothing. I'm sorry."" while on the verge of tears. 

It took her about 20 minutes for her to tell me to come downstairs and get the box of stuff she was getting rid of, so I did very reluctantly thinking I was just being baited and she would continue ranting. I stood at the stairway for a few seconds and she said ""Well? Come get it. It's over here."" So I went. I thought it was finally over. I had my stuff back and I wouldn't have to worry about her taking any of it away from me again. No. As I was walking back up the stairs she said ""You shouldn't be mad at me. I've never done anything wrong to you. Ever."" 

I told my friends what happened and they said it wasn't right of her to do that after I told them everything. My girlfriend agrees. Everyone I've talked to about this said the same but I'm still having my doubts. 

Did I overreact a little? I'm really not sure what to do anymore. I'm so tired of being antagonized by my mom but I'm starting to feel like this really is all my fault. We've had so many other incidents similar to this one and she always has the same reaction.",20Aug2020,1

I've fixed many of my bad habits of sorts,  
however I feel as if my mental state has gotten worse.  
Every now and again I feel as if I'm talking in my sleep,  
I forget the points in my conversation, and either drop it or sort of reflect over my statements until I'm able to get my point across clearly.  
I have many idiosyncrasies, and sometimes they irk me to the point of having thoughts of verbally hurting my family when they do the things that I don't like. On the occasion, I get thoughts of slapping their hands or spitting on their feet,  
and that absolutely disturbs me to think about even that.  
I don't wish for anything to progress any further.  
When I wake up, especially when I'm awoken, I mumble expletives, and I feel anger towards them.  
When I use loud machinery, I can hear my family members shouting at me, calling me names, only to realize when I turn it off, nobody was calling me.  
More recently, I've been remembering little details.

What if I didn't turn the stove off, and everything catches fire?  
What if this rag is too close to the edge of the counter, and my grandma slips on it?  
What if I didn't close Papa's car door all the way, and it drains his battery on the way to work, and he gets horribly mutilated?  
What if somebody killed themselves over an out of context thing I've said?  
It's always horrible thoughts like that that are leeching in my brain.

437,"Hey 😊 I’ve posted similarly on other subreddits for help but nothings working.
Essentially, I’m really unhappy, depressed as my doctor calls is. I’m in the waiting list for NHS mental health services which I’m proud I eventually sought out. The problem lies with why I’m currently unhappy.

My house.

I’m a student going into her 2nd year at university, the course isn’t great rn but hopefully will improve, none of that ever made me totally unhappy but who I live with did. For the first three months, when we decided we’d move in together for another year, we were a perfect group, so much so that we essentially isolated ourselves from making more friends. Soon after, it fell apart and I learnt the majority of the 7 others were horrible people. This took a massive toll on my mental state which did occasionally turn suicidal. I say did, it still often does mainly at the thought of being back with those people.

I’m living in my second year house with one of them now. He was my closest friend last year who I’ve now learnt was manipulating me the entire time. He was horrible to everyone, but as it was to everyone he made me feel lucky as he “was the least mean to me” despite the fact what he said to me was still enough, as my sister informed me, to get him in trouble with a police hate crime unit. As it’s just me and him currently, it’s far worse as it’s all directed at me. I think I should leave the house but am so reluctant to change it’s making me panic. I don’t want to upset anyone but I think I should for once do something to stop me being upset.

If it’s necessary I can give details as to my relationship with each flatmate, specifically the one I’m with atm. I have a week before another two horrible flatmates move in and ideally should start leaving before then if I actually go.

447,"Hello Reddit, here's my situation:  
One of my closest friends who I met about 2 years ago was born with profound hearing loss, meaning that he has only heard of thunder, fireworks, and other high-volume sounds in his life. He has never heard Mozart's sonatas or The Beatle's singles, or the grooves of Michael Jackson.  
This contrasts greatly with myself, a passionate musician who can decently play both guitar and a bit of the keyboard. My tastes range from Enya to King Crimson to Snarky Puppy to my favorite band, Tool. I dabble in most genres and can get along with mostly anything.  
About a few weeks ago, my friend got the amazing news that he'll be getting hearing aids soon. An otherwise deaf man will be able to hear! He will not be able to understand human speech at first nor speak it, as he'll need to learn how to interpret English speaking more directly. A convenient work-around this is ""lyric"" videos that we all remember so fondly of the earlier days of Youtube - turns out those things can be more useful than we thought after all.  
I wish to be able to express my love to music and to introduce him to something we take for granted in the easiest way possible (for him). What should I send him first to start off listening to... music in general? I don't think it would be smart to immediately start him with the music *I personally* like, but instead musicians we all cherish and enjoy without even thinking about it.

I hate my mom, I’m serious about that. Idk if we need to go family therapy or what because she can’t seem to stop stepping over my boundaries. 
There’s things she brings up that she knows I don’t like. Like she kept bringing up my ex when I asked her to stop but she kept talking about him when I was hurting. She wouldn’t stop. And she would ask me about getting a permit but I said when I’m ready. Literally the next day she brought it up again. And I said I’m not ready. She kept bringing it up. Does she not understand what I’m saying? 

Its very annoying it is when she keeps bringing up shit I want her to stop about?. It’s rude that she ignores my request. That’s a all I ask but she can’t see shut her mouth. I only ask one thing. That’s it but she can’t seems to stop. And it makes me feel she doenst respect me, she says she does but she isn’t showing it. 
She talks about stuff I tell her to stop about but she can’t talk to me about the stuff that I’m passionate about. I dotn know what o do. I’m moving out as fast as I can. I can’t live with her anymore. I will stop contact at with her as well.",20Aug2020,1
450,"Someone I told I didn't want to speak to anymore keeps putting money in my bank account - I've asked them not to and in the past they've called me ungrateful and said they wouldn't do it again - which was a relief. But it was a lie. 

They also keep texting me and trying to call me - I've been text about 50 - 70 times this year. I replied once to say thanks for the money because I felt bad. I told them to leave me alone three years ago. I've had to move city/house and job so they don't know where I am, I'm safe.

I've blocked their number (I can't change mine - it's mine and I've had it a long time, it has sentimental value for me). I have an option on my phone so I can see blocked messages but they're thankfully kept separate from my actual texts - I check it occassionally, I think probably because they used to know where I live and it gave me a clues as to whether they were going to turn up and try see me - it's like a panic thing. 

They're starting to say I'm rude for not thanking them for the money - I feel like I'm a good person but this makes me feel bad. Should I thank them? I don't want anything to do with them but they don't listen. The police were involved - all they could do was proceed to arrest because they had already warned them - I don't want them arrested, I just want to be left alone.

453,"My friends' neighbour's house caught on fire.  They live in a complex (6 units per building) and all of the houses were on fire apart from theirs (which was on the end).  However, there is a ton of smoke in their house.  The fire is put out, but the smoke is still there.  My friends are all safe (out of the house) and the firefighters are currently looking for their two cats.  :(

They're expecting some water damage.  Not sure how much currently, but there were some open windows while the flames were being put out.  They have no idea how much smoke damage there will be.  I'm not there, so I'm not 100% about most of the details.

I'm just very concerned about what's going to happen to them and all their stuff, and especially the cats.  Can anyone tell me what the steps are in dealing with something like that?  How can they determine what needs to be replaced, thrown out, cleaned, inspected, etc?  I tried looking for this information in search engines, but it all seems so overwhelming, and I can't tell if the advice they're giving on the sites is for situations where the fire/smoke is closer or worse.

I should mention that they rent the place, and they don't have renters' insurance.  We're in Canada, none of them have a lot of disposable income, and one of the tenants has disability status.

456,"Dear all, (sorry for the long rant)

In July my (F, 28) neighbor from across the hall (F in her 50-60's) on the top floor of the apartment building started playing loud music in the evenings a few times a week. She didn't open when we knocked to ask her to turn it down a bit (I was studying for my exams). One Saturday she starts playing loud music again and talking to herself in a loud and weird voice. We (me and my BF, 31, M) had lived there since February and the guy who rented us the apartment had warned us she was a bit weird and liked to slam her front door in the evening. Wanting to avoid conflict we'd gotten used to her slamming her door around midnight.

My BF works at home due to corona and I work at the hospital. I work long hours, 24h shifts and nights in a stressful environment, so I need my rest and mostly quiet. (I sometimes have to sleep during the day).

Being a basic doctor I heard that my neighbor's loud rambling wasn't just a drunk banter, but that she was having a psychosis/delusion. I contacted the police for a welfare check, but they told me she was know for having psychological problems and to mail the neighborhood inspector. So I did, and we left on a holiday for 10 days. Of course the police hadn't done anything while we were away and upon calling them, the female cop said she'd pay the woman a visit.

She did -the neighbor denied all charges, said she was being spied on and was said to be very emotional- and after that things took a turn for the worse. I'd expected her to feel confirmed in her delusions and to cause more trouble, but it got way worse then I could have dreamed. First, she left a post-it on my door that 'my behavior was the result of my own psychiatric disease'. The door slamming and loud music continued. So I took this note and my testimony to the police to submit an official police report. The guy who rented us the apartment and lived below us had done the same.

My boyfriend was traveling at the time and I began feeling unsafe alone in the apartment: I didn't want to make a sound (so she wouldn't know I was home), I didn't dare to go in the hallway or use the balcony anymore (mine was next to hers). Days that should have been a relaxed working on a paper turned into hours and hours of calling social services. Nobody seemed to care. Nobody else visited me or the neighbor. I asked the police repeatedly to send by her son or family doctor (they reported she had those) or even a psychologist. Nothing.

Police declined to come by again when she was having a delusion next Saturday, because first 'everyone in the building had to file a police report'. This woman needed help, as a medic, I know schizophrenia/paranoia only gets worse, certainly when it's triggered by complaints. (I didn't want to even file a police report at first, but they left me no choice). She didn't even get a fine for the noise. They just saw her as this sad, harmless old woman, while she was in reality really manipulative, unpredictable and needed psychiatric help urgently. I wasn't gonna wait til she showed up with a knife at my door. I began feeling I was the one with the delusion as no one took action or took me seriously (my only friend was the guy who rented us the apartment). The one who owns her apartment and the people who manage the building did nothing as well.

After a few days I left my apartment during the day (she could hear my door unlock, so I couldn't leave quietly). She started slamming the door and talking loudly on the phone in a normal voice. 'I'm not talking to myself, I'm on the phone!' 'I'm gonna get them.' ... This was new behavior, in a normal voice and during the day, and this was the first time I'd heard her issue threats. I called the police, they cited that they were bound by the law and there was nothing the could do (seriously, is talking to the woman illegal?). So I left for a friend and next to a hotel before spending a few days at my parents. I made no progress on my study task due to time lost and stress and spent extra money on food and the hotel. I spent all my other time finding a new apartment early (we would normally only move out one or two months later). Luckily I found one: ground floor, hall and quiet older neighbor to the left, garage to the right, quiet street without cars, garden in the back. Only catch was the family upstairs and their young son who has severe Down syndrome, but whenever I visited the apartment I heard nothing, so I presumed noise would be minimal and didn't mind if the kid was crying once a day or something like that.

When my boyfriend was back from his holiday the week after that I explained the situation to him and that I wanted to move asap. He'd agreed on the apartment while he was away (I'd done the same thing with the apartment we then lived in). I felt safer with my boyfriend, but the night we were getting ready to move (with minimum noise) the psycho neighbor started talking loudly with her door open in a normal voice: she made dead threats. She even mentioned details from my police report (how did she know those?). We called the emergency number: responder was rude. Police arrived after 20 minutes, while the neighbor had already left. Luckily she got back when they were still there and after I explained the situation. They talked to her, warned her and said we should call back if she continued. It seemed like they were glad she had a few drinks and said that the situation wasn't serious enough to arrest her. (Ok, so you can just make dead threats to anyone?)

Ten minutes later she started again: 'Sickos!' 'I ain't leaving, you're leaving!' 'Doctor'. She had the creepiest voice, it was like living a horror movie outside my door. We called the police again and our downstairs neighbor lead them upstairs. Finally they heard her slam the door and shout. When she saw the two cops she flipped her tone and behavior completely: 'Oh I've had a little too much to drink.' Cops finally escorted her out after almost having to break down her door. Then her son arrived and claimed we were the problem. Police took our testimony again and took her away. Next morning she was back (so no sectioning) and had to go talk to a psychologist (who apparently didn't even know what was going on). Sigh.

I last minute hired a company to move that day (bye 500 euros) and moved into the new place. Day one off the new apartment: upstairs neighbors play loud music in the morning, but when I ask them to turns it down. The rest of the day there are kids screaming and stomping all over the ceiling and in the hallway. Our front door is basically paper pulp (and has the weakest lock ever) and the hall resonates the sound. My boyfriend and myself are at the end of our wits. A few days later the family is stomping and screaming again, moving furniture across the floor... I go ask if they could keep it down a bit, because we hear every noise. The mother immediately says she has the kid with Down Syndrome and that he doesn't listen to her. I know they can't control him and must be under a lot of stress, but I'm talking about their (the parents and two other kids) stomping, screaming and dragging stuff across the floor.

Some days are okay, others are more noisy, but every day there is some annoying noise. It's like it's grinding me down.

I contacted the owner who rents us the apartment and he's totally defensive. He doesn't want to install a secure and noise isolating door and is very skeptic of me 'making a mess' when I suggested to invest in some noise reduction measures myself. My BF at the same time is unhappy with the whole newly renovated apartment (""the cooker hood was installed to low"", ""I don't like this kind of hob electric"", ""the washing machine won't fit in this opening"", ""the quality of the renovation is sub par""...). He's right but I can't help it. This causes fights and more stress, because he doesn't offer any solutions or has arranged anything for the search of or move to the new apartment. Besides that he says the owner has to pay for the noise isolation/security improvements and not us. Sigh, I'm in a situation where no one wants to work with me. My BF's only suggestion is to rent a very expensive apartment, which I can't afford. He says he's 31 and wants to buy a house like his friends (I tell him to do that, I don't have money nor plans to ever buy as he as he knows).

So:

\- We can't move again (it would be breach of the 3 year contract and thus cost us a lot of money).

\- Owner/neighbor show no motivation to look for solutions or work with me. I don't want to be an asshole to people already dealing with a mentally handicapped child and I know they lived there first, so I don't want to keep complaining. If it continues I'll try to get the owner to talk to them. I think the rich owner could solve the issue easily by investing a little, but refuses.

Conclusion: I'm tired of the whole situation, exhausted, ready for my BF to get his own place. That would of course put me on the search for a roommate (I can't afford the apartment on my own) and would anger the owner even more.

QUESTIONS:

\- Does anyone have experience of my legal options here (in case of upstairs noise -mainly footsteps and screaming- and loud hallways) toward the owner?

\- Does anyone have experience with noise isolation for a front door/hallway/ceiling (vibration from footsteps)? DIY or cheap solutions would be preferred.

\- I've noted I've become hypersensitive to normal sounds as well as noise, especially inside the house (like my BF shutting a closet, talking loudly,...) and that I get frustrated and angry about these and other issues more easily. Does anyone know psychological tricks/treatments to fight this hypersensitivity?

TL;DR: moved from an apartment with a psycho neighbor to one where the upstairs neighbors cause noise. Tired of it all.",20Aug2020,1
458,"Hi everyone, I honestly wasn’t sure if I should make this post or not, however at this point I feel like it wouldn’t hurt to ask for advice. Basically, I am in college now majoring in English minoring in Graphic Design. I never new going in what I wanted to study or what I wanted careers wise. So I took a bunch of random classes, I did programming one semester, and I took pre reqs for nursing another semester. ( I chose not to pursue nursing because it is highly highly stressful, it would overwhelm me, I’m also just very introverted and anxious in general) 
Now I’m on track to graduate with an English degree and that’s not going to change. While I am well aware that this degree does not guarantee me a job after graduation, I still feel as though I will benefit from it in other ways such as improving my English speaking and writing abilities.  
That’s kind of my situation. I have no idea what I’m doing after graduation, I am thinking I will possibly need to get a masters in something completely different or apply to some other type of program possibly in the medical field. I just really don’t know what to do or which route to take. I want job security and enough to provide for myself because I don’t have support from my family. This is stressing me out a lot.

463,"Hi all,

The COVID regulations are hitting down hard on all of us and I guess some are taking it harder than others. A friend of mine who has often in the past struggled with mental health issues and alcohol abuse confided in me a few weeks back that since the beginning of the lockdown his mental health has taken a turn for the worse. A friend of his died of something unrelated to covid in february, and since our country is in lockdown since March he had to deal with it without the usual support around him. We often play video games with our friend group through discord and now that the regulations are slightly lessened here in the EU we do meet up with our friend group sometimes during weekends, but I guess it's not the same. Especially for him, living by himself in a small apartment, he took to heavy drinking again and fell into a major depression. He told me he also is auto-mutilating and has suicidal thoughts.

Before he told us, his job already noticed that something was wrong and sent a doctor to visit. He's in therapy now, has regular doctor visits and is on some medication, but he still seems to be doing pretty bad. Yesterday me and my partner tried to talk him through a panic attack where he was also chatting with a suicide prevention agency, I offered that we could come over if he wanted to. We live a little over an hour away, but if he would feel better to have someone around to go for a walk with or just play some video games, we'd gladly do so. He mentions a lot that he feels embarrassed about the situation which makes it difficult for him to talk about it and that he doesn't want to shock us. I try and repeat that there's no way we're judging him, that I am not easily shocked, but I feel a bit helpless on how to help him further. Moments like this I am obviously very worried, but I don't want to put too much pressure on him or force onto him things he might not need (like showing up uninvited). I've tried asking him a few times what we can do to help him, but I don't think he knows either. I ask him regularly how he's feeling that day just to check in on him, but I don't know if that's too much/not enough. Basically, I really want to support him but I am not sure what to do. 

I see a lot of ""just be there for him and listen to him"" -which is great advice! But I am hoping if people know anything more specific, that would be a huge help. I know we are one of the very few people he's opened up to about this, so it kind of puts on the extra pressure that we need to act right until he's comfortable enough to tell the rest of our friend group or his family about it.",20Aug2020,1
464,"So I’ve recently found out I have a hernia due to bathroom issues caused by my ibs and I think I really need to change my diet to try to minimize the issues I’m having because my linzess isn’t really working as well. For now, my doctor has me taking lactulose on top of my linzess to try to make it easier for me to go, but I also really don’t like having to take so much medication to be able to use the bathroom.

I’m an incredibly picky eater due to bad habits going back to my childhood and I feel like I’m actually struggling trying to figure out how to eat healthier due to being out of my comfort zone. I practically eat almost no vegetables or fruits daily. My diet really needs to be higher in fiber and calories, because I’m also underweight and need to gain some pounds. I feel like my breakfast is fine, but what I usually have for lunch and dinner *needs* to be changed.

I’ve tried googling foods and meal plans but it feels like a-lot of the foods I’m coming across are incredibly high in carbs or just lacking in calories, due to a lot of sites aiming for weight loss diets rather than weight gain, or just individual food choices that I have no idea how to actually incorporate into a meal (maybe just me overthinking it?) and it’s all just overwhelming.

475,"Me (19F) and my bf (18M) have been together for one year and its been really amazing, ofc with the normal ups and downs but we both truly love each other and being with him makes me so happy. We were friends for one year before we started dating and he's supported me through everything and is always there for me, but lately for the past month after every time we are together I walk home balling my eyes out. 

In the relationship I've just started to feel so lonely and emotionally exhausted. Throughout I've always tried to make sure that I make a real effort in the relationship and show him how much I appreciate him and love him, doing anything I can to make him happy but now sometimes it just feels like I'm not worth the effort that something as simple as writing a birthday/anniversary card or helping me or getting something when i say I'll pay him back is too much effort for him and is a hassle. He has jockingly said before that he puts the least amount of effort into things but idk. We both have become comfortable in our relationship which could be a reason why the effort hasn't been reciprocal but in this case how can I bring this up to him? 

Sometimes he realises it and he apologises for not putting in the effort and I always say ""its okay love"" but in reality i feel down by it and start asking myself how many times will he apologise until he actually starts putting in some effort in our relationship. I just feel that I pour everything into our relationship and into all of his interests and i dont feel like he's reciprocating it back. Its just starting to feel very one sided at the moment and im so exhausted. 

I also realised that another reason that I've been so down is that fact that we both are starting our last year at school before going to university and im nervous about it because most likey our relationship will become long distance which i am more than okay with but we haven't actually talked about it, is it too early to bring it up now, how should I talk to him about it? 

I am very aware that we are both young but I do want this relationship to work and we both do truly love eachother and respect eachother but I really want to talk to him and tell him about how I've been feeling but I dont know how to. I dont want it to come off like I'm attacking him in any way or make him angry or hurt, i just need some help and advice in putting how I feel into words so that i can communicate everything clearly to him without hurting him or making him feel that he is not enough because that is not the case at all.",20Aug2020,1

480,"Despite how important this is to me and how much I've thought about it, I have had issues lately trying to communicate important things view a keyboard.  I used to quite elogant on the 'ol Corsair, back in the day. But now I just ramble and unsure why. So please forgive whats coming. I'll TL;DR at the end, of course. I'm copying this from a running draft I have saved that I was going to send a black person, influencer, who is the type to give it to me straight but I couldn't send it.  


 So I just backspaced the equivalent of, well, a bunch of words, lol. I tend to lose focus and ramble when I am trying to write something serious.

I go into way too much detail to make sure something is sure to be understood and or not taken the wrong way. So, since I am already doing it again I will just keep on trucking and we'll see how it turns out.  


Me: Inching towards 40. White guy. Born/raised in a very small town in New Mexico. It was mostly hispanic or native american. I was the minority around here. I got called all the usual names. Anything to do with white and being fat. Even some teachers thought it was funny. I had also experienced some abuse by a neighbor, went on for about 3 years. But not related to the story, just to give a bit more insight into why I reacted to being bullied...

So skip ahead to 7th grade, the BS got cranked up. You know...let me ACTUALLY try to summerize...Got fed up and fought back and enjoyed it. I fought...a lot. A whole lot. Got a reputation around town and that led to more fights and getting my ass beat down pretty bad from time to time. As I grew up the white boy stuff kind of just vanished as we all grew up.

So, all that about my childhood wasn't to say ""SEE BLACK PEOPLE, I KNOW WHAT ITS LIKE!!!!"" I don't, honestly. I was never followed around stores, people didn't switch sidewalks when I was coming towards them, nothing. I only say it to show that I understand what it is like to not want to be your own race because of other people. Ok so...

I've never had issues with people and their race. If you were an ass, your brown/black/white skin was along for the ride, so to speak. That being said, I did find myself sometimes buying into stereotyping races based on media/tv etc. But someone's skin color has never meant much of anything. So, on to what makes me even ask the questions....

So the first one, about making someone uncomfortable and possibly ""hiding"" my racism is because of how I act around some black people. Remember how small this town is, under 11k. Not very diverse. Hispanics, Native American, White, Asian and African American are a blip on the radar.

So it's actually kind of rare to see people of color around town.

Years ago when I worked at Walmart, I'd watch how other people reacted when a black person would be in my department, electronics. Like the person was on exhibit. Would really piss me off. Especially when you could see the hurt in some of the peoples eyes as they felt all those eyes on them. So one day one of the regulars came in, a black guy about my age AND a fellow nerd. I didn't even know his name but we clicked right away that first day when he bought a USB hub, lol. So anyway, after the usual ""hey, sup"", I went back to what I was doing. I glanced over at him and he suddenly looked kinda scared. Well, I thought nervous at first but then saw the fear. He kept glancing to his left but I didn't see anyone. I inched around to see down the isle and instantly knew that this was going to end bad. You know the stereotype people lump on cops about being bullied and becoming cops to have power? What about the ones that couldn't become a cop? Or a corrections officer or even a damned security guard? They become Asset Protection of course! This wasn't just your usual Walmart narc.

This guy was one of the few guys around town I had been a bit nervous about fighting. (We fought 2 years prior to this, ugh I suck). He's 6'1, 220, ripped and worst of all...mean. I'm not sure what gave him all of this hatred and anger but if you got on his radar...

So yeah, I saw Mr. Walmart rent a cop just staring at him. Black Bob was my height, 5'10 and maybe 160. He didn't come off as the fighting type at all. So I felt his fear having this crazy looking dude stare you down. What I didn't realize at the moment was, Bob had no idea this was Walmarts AP guy. I found out later he thought it was some crazy white dude mad at the N word. (His words) Anyway, I walk over to Bob and tell him not stress roid rage over there, he thinks you're probably stealing, cause you know, you're black. He looked confused then realized who the guy was and was so happy. He said it's a huge relief to just have AP following him around vs thinking he was going to get killed going to his car. Ouch x2. Ouch that he was used to this and that getting killed because he was black...sigh. We joked about black people/white people for a bit and he asked if I wanted to come hang out while he rebuilt his kids PC. So during all of our interactions that day, a coworker was listening to everything. She told me that night that it's so cringe that I'm so overly nice to the black guy especially cause im such a racist...wait, what? Said it was so obvious. She even involved another employee I guess and they agreed?

So I DO do things a bit differently around certain black people, I admit that. Only around here though. I'll do what I can when I am around someone of color to convey that I'm not a threat, nor am I going to stare at them. I don't go overboard with it or anything. I don't even speak to the majority of them outside of niceties. I also only do it with people whom seem a bit on edge, nervous, concerned, etc.

I can imagine how they feel so whatever I can do to ease that for them, I'll do it. Would I make you uncomfortable? I don't think I've ever laid it on so thick that people were put off by it but I have no way of really knowing. Bob said nah, he was happy that I was in his corner and wished he had his ""crazy white fighting ni\*\*\*\*"" with him growing up, lol.   


I hope I've said enough (ha..ha) to help give you enough of an idea of who I am to give me your honest opinion on this.  


So TL;DR

I make sure to do what I can around black people so that they don't feel threatened around me, or that they have to have their guard up. I won't lay it on too thick. I don't run up to them telling me how I just love Will Smith and had a black best friend. But I'm also nicer to them than I would be most other people. This doesn't do the above justice.",20Aug2020,1

482,"I’m fostering a cat that has been homeless for a long time, the person who found him shaved him since his fur was semi long and very matted. I tried to bathe him but he got so panicked that I had to abort mission before even soaping him. 
I am now concerned if its even good idea to bathe or mess with his fur/skin at all. 

He is very dirty and smelly, has scabs all over and probably has cat scabies (doesn’t infect humans luckily). The vet that sponsors the shelter i’m fostering him for is fully booked until next week. 

What should I do? Is it a bad idea to try and bathe him again before a vet visit with someones help holding him? 

I feel bad just leaving him be this dirty until next week and it’s honestly kind of gross but If bathing him might hurt his skin, I wont do it. 

Of course I would rinse him thoroughly to make sure no soap was left irritating his skin but maybe putting soap on him at all would be bad? I tried google but all answers I could find was “take them to the vet” or “use this shampoo”, no one talked about if it was a good idea to bathe them at all, or what to do when the vet is unavailable and a visit isn’t urgent enough to warrant an emergency visit.

483,"I've suspected her of drinking and driving in the past. I witnessed her pour a beer out her window while she was driving down our neighborhood one time. Today was bad. Like really bad. She feel getting out of the car &amp; dropper all her belongings. She proceeded to faceplant 4-5 more times and lay on the ground crying. I offered to help her multiple times but she refused. I tried to console her but she just said 'everything was wrong' and didn't want help getting inside. Finally a runner came by and she went down hard again and we said 'that's enough' and got her to her door. When I say she couldn't walk, I don't mean she was wobbly, I mean she literally couldn't take a single step.

What do I do next?

Part of me thinks I should stay out of it because it's not my business. I don't want to create an uneasy relationship with a neighbor.

More of me says I need to take action. I should stand up for what right. Standing by and idly is cowardly. It's only a matter of time until she kills someone. Should I call the police now? Can they even do anything now that she is home &amp; they didn't see her actually driving hammered? Should I approach her and tell her to cut the shit or next time I'm involving the law? With Ubers/Lift so readily available, there is no excuse to drive drunk.

A little more back story - I had a friend who was killed by a drunk driver. She was a super nice girl. It was our senior year, she was headed home from a baseball game, and got t-boned and died. She had a full ride to a prestigious school in the Mittin State that has a big M as a logo. I want to tell my neighbor that story and tell her if I ever see her drinking and driving again I'm going to loose it.

485,"In a few days my mom will begin fostering two of my younger cousins (both girls, 5&amp;1). She lives in a very small house, only two bedrooms, and she has four kids of her own. Three of us don’t live at home, so it’s only my 13 year old sister in our shared bedroom, but I moved out to make room for the babies. We’re already family, so they’re both very familiar and somewhat comfortable with us, but how could I make their long duration of a stay easier?

For some context, their parents suffer from addiction which has led to a five year battle with children services to get the girls temporarily in our care while the parents go through rehab. They’ve been in and out of prison and continue to put the girls in harm’s way. Not to mention, they’re pregnant with a boy that’s due in January sometime. All three babies will have been born addicted to what the mother was using. My cousin (their father) has chosen my mother (his aunt) as the girls caregiver while both he and his girlfriend get clean. Us having the girls in our care can last anywhere from a month to a year, to more. We’re mostly prepared, but we also have no clue how the girls are going to handle this.


They both experience separation anxiety, the baby especially. The one year old (we’ll call her Chubs) can hardly be away from her parents or her great grandmother (the one who primarily cared for them) without crying for an overwhelming amount of time. And usually that’s just when Chubs is visiting, not living with us. Any advice on how to get a baby more accustomed to living in a home with a family they don’t recognize as safe? (We’re safe, but from Chubs’s understanding, we’re strangers)

The five year old (we’ll call her Birdie) was previously in our care for a few weeks when she was about 3. So this isn’t Birdie’s first rodeo. At this point, she sees it as a long sleepover. Birdie had developed early on trauma from her living situations. Birdie had a stutter and was very socially inept, but we have worked past that and she’s so much better. Our worry is, as soon as they’re placed back with their parents, Birdie will relapse. She has done it each time she’s gone home after their release. I want to make Birdie and Chubs living with us to feel as comfortable as possible. I want them to feel loved and safe.

Any tips on how to make this ride the best for them? I understand a good handful about this situation, as my older brother is adopted. But I know there’s more I can learn and do for them.

This summer it has been a bit different. Sometimes he brings what i assume based on our friendship good reasons for not being able to hange out( like going to his grandparents for tge weekend or being on vacation etc). But the times when he doesnt give any reason and just sais he cant have multiplyed.

The only thing that has changed is that he is working on a game that me and some other coleagues of him work on. He works a lot on it as he can be very persistent with things he really wants to do.


Also at the start if tge summer in a fit of rage he told me i am boribg and he thinks that for over a year which kinda took me by surprise as he didnt ever voice any concerns about out friendship before. He later apologises and blames the stress from his quote en quote ""employees"" not listening to him.


Here is the problem: if i dont hang out with him i dont have what else to do. I know its bad to have your personal time revolve around another person but other friends from my current school class live like 4-5 km away whereas my bestfriend lives 5 minutes of walking away.

I have other hobbies like exercise and going biking but the dont take nearly as much of my day/are that fun as haning out with him.

505,"Long read, sorry in advance. TL;DR at bottom. 

I (28M) currently live with my roommate (37M) and have for almost two years now. We met as coworkers and are great friends. 

However, he has a drinking problem and is extremely lackadaisical. Dirty dishes will remain in the sink for days, even though the dishwasher is empty. The kitchen will remain dirty days after he cooks food. Trash can will be overflowing, even though the dumpster is right in front of apartment. 

I like to maintain a clean living environment and I'll usually end up doing these tasks, unless I mention my frustrations, which are usually questioned. 

We have both been furloughed, due to the pandemic, however, I recently started working at my job again. He has not heard back from his job, but believes he may be let go sometime in the future. 

I managed to save most of the funds I received through unemployment, while I cannot say the same for him. With me working again, I won't require to spend my saved money for living expenses. Which brings me to my main question. 

Our lease is up at the end of the year and I essentially have two options. One, to get my own place and spend around an extra $400-$500 to live in a one bedroom apartment, which would be smaller than our current two bedroom. Or the second option would be to move into a house, with his girlfriend as a second roommate. The second option would lower my living expenses by about $200. These are rough estimates, considering that the internet and power bills would all have the same costs in both scenarios. 

My concerns on living alone would be the added costs and lack of social interaction, outside of work. My concerns with the second option would be that they would inadvertently control the house, as I would be single, living with a couple. I am also concerned that she (26F) has never been out of her parent's house and also does not maintain organization very well when she is over here. 

They both already lock themselves away in his room when she comes over. I'm almost always in the living room, playing video games or watching TV. I understand couples do that frequently, but we could all watch a movie, or something similar. 

TL;DR: With all of that being said, even though the choice is ultimately mine, would you prefer to live alone and spend more money, or would you cut costs by living with roommates who are messy, isolated from you, and ultimately, irresponsible?

507,"One night in my late teens I smoked some weed as I'd done most nights, a very, very small amount so I could fall asleep. This was in between 2010-2011. It was the last time I ever took a toke of it. That night I lay in bed and could hear a woman talking to me, like she was talking directly into my ear but I couldn't make out the words. I was so freaked out. All I wanted to do was get into bed with my folks and hide in their bed but I was too afraid that they'd find out I was high and the situation would snowball so I hid under my duvet and put on my headphones. Through the high volume of the music I could still hear her. A year later I lay in bed and watched a silhouette of a man walk alongside my bedroom wall and out of the crack of the door. I was not afraid or startled. It appeared very normal to me. Fast forward 2 years and I'm house-sitting for my mother in law, alone. I'm napping during the day and the dogs start barking. I jerk awake. In a full panic, sure that a home invasion is in progress but I cant move. I hear a woman talking in the room but again I cant make out the words. It takes about two minutes before I'm able to move my limbs and get up. A few months later over the course of a weekend stay at my mother in law I hear a woman calling my name periodically when I am alone. She sounds like she's in the same room with me. After the second time my fear and frustration wins out and i scream at her to leave me alone. After the 5th instance of me telling her that I dont know what she wants and I'm not interested.

She asked to meetup and i was hesistant and said i need time to think because although she has been flirty and kind, she has also been pretty rude and sarcastic at times and even blocked/unblocked me because i told our mutual friend shes being mean. Shes like this i assume because shes hurt

I said i dont want to meetup just yet, maybe in due time because of my family circumstances. She was upset and rude and even called me manipulative. she asked for four questions for closure. I sent the answers and said dont contact me because shes being mean. and she said shed always b here for me and she loves me. I saw her on the hinge app, am I making a mistake by not talking and meeting up? I miss seeing/ talking to her. I dont know how to proceed. I feel a lot of the trust is broken thats my main reservation. she acted mean two years ago. I dont know what to do, any advice would be great. I still have feelings for her.

Tldr: ex from 2years ago wants to meetup, im hesitant due to trust but still have feelings and saw her on the hinge dating app, she looks beautiful",20Aug2020,1

Well my boss hired someone to replace me and told me out of nowhere I was fired and had to days to leave. When I asked him why he said different reasons that he didn't want to talk about. I told him it's impossible for me to find a place and move in to days. I don't even have a car right now and asked for 2 weeks and he said he'd let me know today. Idk what to do or where to go. I have no money saved and this came out of nowhere. I've seriously donev to much for this place. I'm here literally 24/7. The last day I had off was when my 1yp needed emergency surgery and we were in the hospital. He yelled at me when I was trying to tell him I had to take the can't to the hospital. I've missed holidays with family because I can't leave, I've missed field trips, I've missed my oldest son's sports, plus other shit. My mental health, especially anxiety, has really gotten bad here. Because I'm constantly on the clock I can never fully relax because I'm constantly ready to have to drop everything in a second to do whatever. Plus the owner nit picks everything everyday and he scolds me like a child and everything even things that I can't do anything about. I have no idea what to do. I've been looking for help but living in a small town there's seriously no resources. Even if I find a place there's no way I'll have the  money to move.

516,"Alright so, I started a job last week it's pretty much packing eBay and Amazon items for shipping, its honestly not too difficult, only on Mondays because we are closed on weekends and all the online orders pile up. So I have 2 bosses technically, even though one of them is rarely working. They are a married couple, probs in their 40s/50s idk, and I really don't like the wife. So I should just throw this out there just to give you an idea of how this situation is even more aids for me, her English sucks dick. Her accent is really heavy, I can understand her when she asks me to do something but like, she is really shit at explaining things. I hate when people explain something vaguely which means that you have to use your own judgement on how you should execute said task, but you execute it in a way that you assumed was ok however it didn't meet the person's standards/expectations and then they get mad at you for it. Yep, she is that kind of person. So how in fucks name do I deal with this shit? I can't just say ""yeah no sorry, this isn't working, I'd rather learn from your husband"" I mean, he has an accent too but I can understand him better somehow, pretty sure he has better English but yeah. Like, if I make a mistake, she basically complains about it in a fucking bitchy way but she is shit at explaining things so it's not even my fault because her explaining it vaguely is forcing me to use my judgement and if I ask her to explain it again or in more detail, that also seems to annoy her. What would you guys do in this situation? And how would you deal with it? It doesn't help that I have anxiety too and that I'm fucking shit at dealing with these kinds of things cause it just makes me hate the job and makes me dread coming into work especially on fucking Mondays cause its busy which means she gets even more annoying about shit and doesn't want to be bothered and isn't in the mood for my mistakes. Is this a good reason to leave the job? I mean I'm not desperate for the money as I am receiving government payments because I'm studying full time (online course ofc).

So I’ve become friends with a really nice girl I met on Instagram. We’ve hung once in person and plan to hang out more in the future. I just happened to see that she changed her profile picture on her Instagram last night, and I think it’s a really nice picture of her. So would be weird if I were to tell her that? 

I did and honestly still do like her but we’re just friends, and I’m totally okay with that. She’s been a wonderful friend since I’ve known her. I don’t want her to think I have any ulterior motives by saying that, given that I have liked her. I just mean it in a friendly way, not being romantic or flirty at all. 

She’s really busy getting ready for university to start up again so I just figured maybe that’ll make her smile if she’s stressed over that at all

524," So a few years ago i have smoked a lot of cannabis, it started out as fun with friends, and ended up becoming dependend on it. i smoked everyday and after some time i went to the doctor's office, because i felt depressed, unmotivated, and was like wat am i doing here on this earth(never told her this). she told me to quit weed first and then well look into depression.

before this happen i had a bumpy childhood, my father was addicted, my brother had a fight marriage when i was 10 he was a teenage dad, with her parents disapproving of it and moved out, that same year my parents devorced. and i was left to take care of myselve since my mother had to work. i became obese because i coped with food. then i got a suicidal/self harming girlfriend, my fathers addiction got worse and my mom got cancer(but she survived), also i lost all the weight again about 30kilos. I did have friends in these times, but they never understood me or i could not talk to them because they had ""normal lives"" by the time i was 16/17 i felt really down but had to do exams. i made it trough but people where worried about me but i was like im fine. after graduating i fell in lets say a pit, it was all done finally. and all things i couldn't get over before now came to me again. i started hanging out with new friends, got into weed like i said before. then i was forced to move away from my hometown wich wrecked me. and in the end got addicted and went to the docter and ended up quitting and having therapie.

now im done with all this but still i have a lot of mood swings i go from feeling great and unstoppble to feeling anxious and depressed, it all fluctuates from time to time. and i remember having these fluctuations sinds i was a kid and also telling this to my parents,friends,brother, and proffessional help. now i wonder if i might be bipolar. i went from wanting to join the military and sport 5 times a week and feeling great. to no wanting to do much, (still doing some sports because i know its good for me) and feeling shit and having negative toughts.

i dont want to self diagnose, but i also think if i would have been bipolar people would have noticed it by now, ive been contect witch school counselors, social workers and psychologist and i have told them that i feel like there is no 'inbetween' for me. i have always kinda felt off and different. anybody has some tips on what i can or should do?

I have a coworker that has been taking her lunch at a different time and has been taking a 50min lunch. This is very frustrating for me as I'm left alone to work on my floor. Ive brought this up to my manager and she said she would talk to my coworker. But today all she did was send out an email to our team with the policy of our breaks and attendance from the employee hand book with no context.

Me and my ex had been broken up with for over a year but I felt the need to reach out to her given the situation she’s in. I promised to be there for her and be a friend when she needed me Becuase I want to support her during this hard time so we would hangout as just friends in an attempt to cheer her up. Days after the call however I find out that the whole family has COVID so I was exposed to it. I got tested and came back positive as did my ex girlfriend thankfully me and her both recovered fine. A few weeks later after being COVID free I start seeing a girl F(18) from my work and it starts to get more serious like I might start dating her soon. This girl is aware of my ex’s situation and has no issues with me being there for her. But When my ex learns that I’m gonna start dating again she gets angry and spent 2 hours yelling at me that I’m not helping her enough and that I’m a moron who doesn’t think things through. I know her head is in a bad place right now and she probably didn’t mean half of what she said to me but should I feel bad for moving on and living my life?

I had enrolled in an online English course. It's just 2 hours a week in the evenings. But I think about it all day because I should interact with people. I had joined in a few discord server for chatting, I'm scared to talk there either. My parents are so dramatic about this. I can't ask them to take to me to a counselor. They think it's not that big of a deal to take it to a counselor. Every situation seems hard. Even talking to my cousin(who is not even elder than me) feels a huge step. Because of this, I can't concentrate on anything. I get distracted and get anxious of being anxious. I sleep all the time to avoid it. Already skipped 2 classes just because of this.

The latest argument is about who’s going to manage my disabled cousin’s finances when his guardians pass away (they’re trying to pawn it off to my sibling who’s only like 20).

I feel like my mom holds him to a higher standard because her dad used to be a really hard worker and do everything her mom asked, and she’s holding my dad to the standard of her dad. Anyway, when it’s not that, one of them makes a remark that is either a) genuinely snippy or b) harmless that one takes the wrong way because they misinterpret the tone or whatever. And when it’s not that, it’s either my dad yelling at my disabled aunt for minding her own business most of the time and my mom yelling at my dad because my aunt is her sister.

One I told my mom that I don’t like how often they fight and she said that they don’t fight THAT often, but almost every other day they get into a shouting match.

530,"I really enjoy iced coffee, but I'm awful at making it. I can make a decent cup of hot coffee, but that's not really what I'm looking to drink all the time.

532,"So within the past 2-3 days, I've taken 12 450mg cascara sagrada pills. I was sort of aware of the fact that they're natural laxatives, which I think is important in this situation. I'm 17, but quite overweight, just for reference.

My mother is aware that I've taken 8 pills, not 12 (I took 8 in one day, and 4 in the other). She's quite obese herself. As most things happen, if there's an obese parent, there's most likely an obese child. I've been losing weight slowly, I've been trying to do it in a sustainable way, and as a result, I've lost over 25 pounds. It's hard, but I try. I try really hard.

She has always encouraged fad diets, ""detoxing"", fasting for days at a time, and what she calls ""natural remedies"" for weight loss. She constantly nitpicks at how my diet is terrible, and how I won't lose weight if I keep doing A, B, or C. How I'm lazy, and I'll never get anywhere with my weight loss. She doesn't have a healthy view with food, none of our family does except for my brother.

I'm saying this to maximize on the probability that I have an eating disorder, because of her.

About the start of this year, if I felt constipated, or fat, or just hopeless, I'd overdose on one of the many dietary supplements in our house. Probiotics, fish oil, something like that. My mom would never be any help, all she would say is ""Your diet is YOUR FAULT, if you had just looked at the diets I did you wouldn't have these problems. You're going to mess yourself up."" So then I'd tell her when I was taking pills, and how many. I'd ask her how many. But  the moment I did that, she'd get upset! ""You already know how much to take, stop bothering me."" She's never consistent in her help.

So after months and months of taking laxatives, of taking way too many supplements in secret, this happened and I got scared. I got up at 3 this morning because I had intense stomach pain and diarrhea, and I called the poison center. 

They said to have stuff like gatorade, just hydrate, and rest. I've been shaking and feeling weak since. My mom got up this morning to tell me basically what she always does. ""Stop eating that, this is all your fault, I don't even know WHY you do this."" And she said I shouldn't have called the poison center without telling her first? How does that compute??

I honestly want to tell her that I think I have an eating disorder. I'm already in bad shape, it wouldn't be surprising. But I've tried this before. And she just ignores me. She hates having to face the fact that she TAUGHT ME this relationship I have with food. She'd get more angry with me. I'm already in pain, I'm already sad. I don't need her anger.

On a good note, I have a therapist I've been going to. The last session, I expressed to her that I think I might have an eating disorder. At the next session, we're gonna address it. I could just wait for about a week to discuss it, but I don't know.  


**In short (Or TLDR)**, my obese mother who taught me how to have an unhealthy relationship with food is now mad at me for having an unhealthy relationship with food. I've overdosed on a dietary supplement, and now I want to tell her about my possible disorder, but she always gets upset.

*Should I tell my mom about my thoughts, or should I just wait for my therapist appointment? Any medical advice? I'm scared.*",20Aug2020,1

I told her if she doesn’t want to talk she can tell me yet no answer. What honestly bothers me more than anything is the fact she can’t let me have closure.

We lived with my parents for a little over a year because we lost our house. We both acquired new jobs and made a great deal of financial success between us both.

537,"Hello,

My sister (20) was diagnosed with epilepsy and a trauma when she was 18. We don't know exactly why she has epilepsy (no family history and no head injuries) the doctors say it's maybe due to her trauma (she has a dissociative disorder because of the trauma).

Well if she is forgetting to take her meds she normally gets an epileptical seizure. My family always reacts wrong.

Like they are hugging her or trying to put her in the recovery position (I hope that's the right word).

Today she had a seizure and I literally screamed at my stepmother (who is a geriatric nurse and should know these things) because she wanted to put her in the recovery position!

I mean it's dangerous to be near someone who has a seizure. They can hurt you! I told them (my dad wad also there) to put everything around her away and wait. Then I added if it's longer than 5 minutes or more than one seizure a day to call the ambulance.

My stepmother said: ""But she can't breath!""

I said: ""if you try to move her she can hurt you and won't still be able to breath.""

My father later asked me how I can be so relaxed and not panic.

I mean it's not the first seizure she had and also I learnt first aid when I was 14. (I am 18 now).

So, if I go out and get a job in that field, I'll probably lose it as soon as I tell them that I have to take almost two months off work. Of course, I could always find another job in that field after I've had the surgery and recovered.

I \*really\* don't like lying to employers (or anyone else), but as I see it my current employer doesn't have my best interests at heart (I'm basically being outsourced), and they're leaving me almost no choice but to take advantage of another employer and possibly put them in a bad situation.",20Aug2020,1
541,"I have a friend who I’ve known and worked with for the last 5 years, we’re close, go on trips together, etc. She’s someone who is very out spoken and a IDGAF personality when it comes to talking to others, and it used to have a filter. We both work a very front line job, and of course the stress has gotten to everyone, but I’ve noticed at work and in her personal life, she’s been more moody, condescending, negative, and sometimes blatantly mean.  

A few days ago, she got very passive aggressive, because a friend and I saw the opportunity for a small trip together. We came up with dates we both had off, and asked if she could go on those same dates. She said she couldn’t. So she sent a lot of passive aggressive and angry texts about the trip. My other friend and I went silent, because this passive aggressive texting happens every few weeks, and we’re a little exhausted by it. She texted a few days later after some silence, and asked if we were mad at her. I told her that I felt like she was angry with us, which she denied. I clearly explained to her, that I felt like I was upsetting and frustrating her a lot lately. I wanted to know if there was anything I could do to resolve it. She said I was bombarding her with this news, and that she had no problems with me, and she thought our friendship was fine. 

I brought up an example, where her and our friends all went to lunch together. She was fine right before we left, but I decided to ride with our other friends, and she decided to ride in her car alone. I, nor our friends, genuinely thought anything of it, since it was a five minute ride down the road. She spent the first 30 minutes of the lunch giving us all the silent treatment. Meaning I and our friends all had to sit there, while she openly pouted. 

I explained to her that those actions had me thinking that for two weeks, she was mad at me. She said that moment wasn’t about me, it was about how no one thought to offer to ride with her. So I tell her that is a little about everyone, and she could just ask next time or send me a text after, if she was upset or hurt about it. She still insisted the issue was not about me. I then explained to her, regardless of whether it was about any of us or not, it wasn’t fair to treat everyone at the table like that. I told her, that I thought she was mad at me for weeks now, and she threw back that if I was afraid to talk to her, that maybe we shouldn’t be friends.  I tried telling her, that I have tried talking to her about if she’s upset with me or not, and she usually just says ‘never mind, I’m fine,” which obviously doesn’t resolve anything either.

I stopped responding to the conversation after a few more texts, because I felt like we were going in circles, and I was afraid she wasn’t really hearing what I was saying. There are multiple more stories like this, and a lot of our mutual friends come to me often, telling me, that they think she’s mad at them. A day later, she usually spins it back on them, and asks them if they’re mad at her, which I think is really manipulative. 

So...How do I go forward? I work with her, I have a lot of mutual friends with her, and she honestly was a decent friend.",20Aug2020,1
542,"I'm neither an incel or male feminist or any kind of B.S label but I've had my experiences with women they use people etc. And like to hurt their feelings for their own entertainment as the advice I always get is the same which I'll respond to

1.WOMEN DONT OWE YOU ANYTHING-that is very hypocrite also I don't care if men owe people stuff or women it's not a valid arguement women can't stand rejection or being told no they hate it which is also why they friend zone people because they are putting their ego on the line if they don't I've done it as an experiment and ŵhen you reject a women they go mad and if you tried to friendzone them they would kill you so why do it to others? I think when your saying ""women don't owe you anything"" people need to practice what they preach

2.men do it aswell-wtf kind of arguement is that just because men do stuff it don't make it ok for women to also if a women was saying stuff about men or a gay men was staying stuff about men no one would bat an eyelid and no one would say anything like ""well women do it to""

550,"Hey, hope you're drinking plenty of water.

 I'm 17 and about to start college. I have gotten into a college in a different city. I really like the college because it is very disciplined and supportive, they have good support groups and mental health services there as well. I'd love to shift there and it is within our financial means. I've already socialised a bit and gotten into groups etc. (classes are still online).

The thing is, my parents and their doctor friend feel that I should to to a college in my home city. I struggle with anxiety and situational depression and I'm pretty much a shut-in. The friend thinks that I shouldn't go far from home because I probably will have difficulty in adapting. 

My parents and I don't have a good relationship. There's a lot of verbal fighting and we just aren't a good fit. They didn't listen to my mental health problems giving typical advice such as ""don't think about it, snap out of it"" and would mock me and ask me if I wanted to go to a 'mental doctor'. They woke up when I just couldn't get out of bed and them shouting at me for hours still couldn't get me out. 

Since then, shit's gotten worse. I started going to a psychiatrist and was put on anti-depressants. They were didn't suit me and I was having a tough time adjusting. We got into constant fights every single day about the meds, about how I was weak for relying on meds, they're bad, my doctor's just trying to make money off of me as a patient. This would happen multiple times in the day, if I seemed just a bit down or took longer to wake up in the morning. 

They now hover over me, I can't even be in the bathroom without them knocking at the door for 15 minutes (I have no history of self-harm/ have any active plans) and whatever privacy I had is gone. I had brain fog and was generally clumsy due to the meds so I do make mistakes a lot, but I can usually figure it out in the end. Due to his, they don't let me speak for myself. Besides this, we literally don't talk at all. We don't do anything together as a family. Meals together become a huge ordeal and by the end my mom's shouting and my dad's storming away without eating.

I got fed up and got off my meds and I'm not as bad as I was on the meds. I've had a very frank conversation with them and told them about how I'd like to shift and not stay in the same city anymore. They were surprisingly okay with it but now that the friend has put in his two bits, they're freaking out. 

I just really need space man. I just want a clean fucking slate and start over. Impossible, I know. But this is my best chance. I am incredibly grateful that I am financially stable enough to actually even consider this. 

I just want to know your opinion, if you've read the whole message. Also, I'm not from the US/ Canada, I'm from an Asian country. The college culture is different, living with your parents isn't looked down upon and there's a HUGE stigma about antidepressants.

551,"I wake up everyday and at random times of the night in absolute pain. My heart feels so heavy but empty. I dont even think about anything, it's just there as soon as I wake up.

I think it may be because I have no real motivation and reason for existing. Everything seems pointless and no goal that I set for myself seems worth it. I've tried living for my dreams, but now it seems mundane. However, this may be because I envision that once I accomplish my goal, I will live in routine by myself. I have no vision to share my life with someone because it is impossible(to me). 

Another reason I wake up feeling this way could be because nothing makes me happy anymore. It's actually the opposite, everything that I see, hear, eat and do makes me feel pain. I stopped listening to music because it has become unbearable and toxic. Looking at something simple like the ground brings me pain. Eating and drinking makes me feel pain. 

Will I ever find joy in life again? Every day it gets worse, so I have no hope. What can therapists do? Tell me to keep going and that everything will be fine? I already do that.

552,"I have a group project at uni where I've been forced into a group of international students who speak minimal English (at an English speaking university). All of the group members are lovely people, and all work very hard except for one guy. 

He is genuinely a nice person and he is efficient at communicating, he always responds and requests clarification whenever hes confused. The only problem is he is ALWAYS confused. I must have explained the topic to him at least 5 times. Yet he has produced some research that is completely irrelevant to the topic. On top of this, it is straight up copied and pasted from his sources without any effort of rephrasing. 

I finally told him I would do the research myself, and prepare his script. All he had to do was record himself reading it for the presentation so I could compile it into a video (online schooling amirite?) , but even this is subpar. 

My dilemma is this: I don't know anything about his personal life or anything hes going through outside of school. English is not his first language so obviously he will have difficulty understanding. I've justified this saying that it's a third year course, so he should be putting in more effort than he is, and the other group members also put in a lot of effort to understand a language they dont natively speak. I don't believe he deserves to ride off our backs and get a grade he didnt work for, so I want to report him. At the same time, COVID has brought so many uncertainties and I feel like I should just let it be. He could be really relying on us to make it just a bit easier for him, and after all theres nothing else to lose from just letting him ride off of us?

553,"My GF and I don’t live together. My GF just moved to NC from GA. Her male friend let’s call him Paul decided he was going to come up and visit her at her new place. She told me and told him he wasn’t allowed to visit or stay over at her place (she bought a four bedroom house) unless he met me first. 

So we all went to dinner the night he arrived (Tuesday) and he seemed pretty nice. A little weird but she told me ahead of time that he is not a “normal” dude and is bi and poly. But she has known this guy since middle school and considers him a friend. 

We go back to her place. She asks me to stay over. Keep in mind the master bedroom is on the opposite side of the house with the exception of one bedroom she has turned into her office. 

We start to have sex and we try to do it as discreet as possible but we are both pretty sure we heard him walk up to the bedroom door but at the time it wasn’t a big deal. 

Flash forward to yesterday. I am at work. My GF and her friend are exploring Charlotte. I meet them for dinner again after work but I had to take care of my dog and be at work super early so I went back to my place. 

Everything was fine until it wasn’t. She FT me while in the shower and she said one sec. She put her towel on and went out to her room and Paul was sitting on her floor playing with her dog. She asked him nicely to leave so she could finish showering. We both think it’s weird but he tried to play it off as “whoops I didn’t know”. 


She texts me at 1am asking if I am awake but I didn’t see that text until this morning. I respond and she calls me to tell me that she kicked Paul out last night. They watched Parks and Rec for a few hours after our FT chat and then she went to bed. He apparently snuck into her room naked and tried to crawl into bed with her. So she kicked him out. 

He on the other hand is blowing up my phone telling me that he slept with her. To check the condoms because there was five left and now there are only three left. To not believe her because she invited him up and then to “relax me” have us meet first because she didn’t want me to suspect anything but that they regularly had sex when she lived in GA and that she lied to me about her body count (like I care about that).

Anyway. I believe my GFs side. Because this just seems like a psycho move. However I don’t know how to bring up what he is saying to her without it sounding accusatory.

What do you think? Any advice?


TLDR- GF guy friend shows up for a few day’s. I meet him. We believe he spied on us having sex. She took a shower and he was in her room and “didn’t know” she was showering. He apparently snuck into her bed the night I wasn’t there and tried to have sex. She kicked him out. He is blowing up my phone saying she is lying, they had sex twice and to check the condoms. That she sleeps around. Etc.

557,"I don't even know where to start but I know what's happened has impacted my life massively. I'm 20 now but on the night of my 16th birthday my younger brother who was then 13 came into my bedroom while I was sleeping. I was wearing one of them hella baggy onesies with the loose buttons and wasn't wearing anything but my underwear underneath. He undid the buttons and started feeling and touching me. Mostly my boobs. I don't remember exactly when he did but as soon as I woke up I sat jolt up right, grabbed him and took him to my parents room. I banged on their door to wake them up and I then told them what he did. My dad came out and shouted at him and they ended up taking his xbox off of him for a few days but other than that it was all swept under the rug. I tried bringing it up again a few months later when we were on holiday. He was getting too touchy feely with my younger sisters and it made me uncomfortable and angry. I told him to stop and started shouting at my parents that he's a creep and a perv etc and something needs to be done. I just got accused by them of wanting to tear the family apart. And since then Ive never brought it up to anyone and I try to forget about it.
It has affected me so much in so many ways but I try to bottle it up, and carry on with my life. The reason I bring it up now and ask for advice is because my mum is looking into fostering. This gives me so many anxieties because I feel like, with my brother in the house, it is not a safe environment to bring vulnerable children into. My brother is 17, 18 in January. To my knowledge he hasn't touched my sisters inappropriately like he did me but he does hurt them. To the point that they are bruised and have finger marks on them. My parents don't seem to have control of him or know what to do with him. Whenever something happens like that they have a little moan at him through his bedroom door until he tells then to shut up or go away. Nothing else is done.
He is diagnosed with autism and adhd but that is no excuse for this sort of behaviour but that's the excuse my parents give him. Is there anything I can do to anonymously stop the process of fostering?

We also help people apply for benefits, like SSI, SSDI, housing, SNAP, etc.  We have a cool program that allows people with no work history, or other barriers to work (like a criminal background) an opportunity to start working and build a resume. We also have a program where we are able to give people employment opportunities through various federal contracts we have where we provide janitorial services.

I used to absolutely love where I work.  Then COVID hit.  We shut down for about a month when my state was in lock down.

Before we were an average middle class family who had food coming in, were able to send a kid to a good school, and could also pay for their many extracurriculars. Unfortunately, my mother works in the travel industry and the company she worked for has just shut down, meaning no income from her to our family.

564,"Hello,

I’m in a bit of a difficult situation and I’m not sure how to proceed. I work at a resort in Canada where staff live on-site in close quarters and customers come stay with us. Staff interact with customers on multiple, close-contact occasions including checking them in/out, serving meals, cleaning rooms, conducting activities, etc. Masks are worn by (most) staff during all of these interactions, but rarely by customers. We had a customer stay with us last week who informed us that he tested positive for COVID, and I only know this because I’m in a senior position.

The reason I called this a “high risk” exposure is because the staff potentially spent long periods of time with the customer who has now tested positive. The General Manager assured me he would be informing staff and customers of the exposure so they could monitor for symptoms and isolate if needed, but so far this hasn’t been done. I’m really uncomfortable, and frankly really angry, because cases are on the rise in my city again and this seems unethical and irresponsible to me.

567," My brother is having his wedding next month and has invited around 15-20 people out for an extended weekend and ceremony. I really like both him and his fiance and of course, I want to be there for him during his wedding but I feel that it is not safe for me or especially my parents to attend something that would require a plane ride and no masks or social distancing for 5 days with people from all over the country. Additionally, my sister is going to be attending a 90 person wedding in a different state a few days before everyone would arrive. This makes me even more nervous because she or her boyfriend could get COVID and not be symptomatic until they have been interacting with everyone all weekend.

I called him to voice these issues directly and he was receptive and even asked if there was anything they could do to put me at ease which I really appreciated. The trouble is that there is almost nothing that I could see being done that would make me feel safe about going. They have already said that they won't ask people to wear masks or social distance. They did float the idea of having everyone get tested for COVID before coming but I'm not really sure how feasible that is. My brother's fiance also told my sister not to mention to anyone that she was attending another wedding because she didn't want to deal with anyone else being alarmed about getting sick. She also told her sister &amp; brother-in-law (who just got done with chemo) that they wouldn't ask anyone to wear masks. I'm terrified for my parents and for the older people that would be attending the event.

After I got off the phone with him and we agreed that we would talk about it in a few days I felt good about our conversation. This morning I woke up to a text from him that just had the link to a CNN article about the safety of flying and then he text me a little bit later saying that he would need an answer by this weekend. I get why he would be upset and to be honest, I am upset as well. I feel as if everyone involved is being cavalier about the safety of their loved ones and overly dismissive of health concerns. I feel like I have to make an impossible choice to be there for my only brother during his wedding or risk getting or spreading an illness that could kill me or my family members or cost them thousands in medical debt. I really love my family and don't want to ruin my relationship with my brother but I don't see how this can be done safely.",20Aug2020,1

571,"So I finally asked my crush if he wanted to date me. Cuz long ago we had something special or so I thought. I felt a connection between us. I really did. Like I knew us talking and being friends or more would be something that was no mistake of happening. 
So we hit it off great in the beginning, I had a crush on him and he did on me as well. He didn’t tell me but he wasn’t very good at hiding his crush on me. We flirted with eachother, called each other baby and said were thankful that we are in each other’s lives and we will be there for each other always. He was sweet, caring and the most nicest person. This made me think we stepped into the dating zone. But nobody asked eahcother out. Until he asked his parents if he could date me. They said no. And for us to wait in the future. So we waited, we kept flirting anyways. Then he lost interest while I became in love by the second. 
I kept perusing him. I knew he still had a little bit of feels for me but it enough for him to do anything back.

Then he completely lost interest. And 7 months later I’m still into him. He asked me about my ex boyfriend to which I asked about his ex gf, he said wasn’t serious between his ex. I decided to ask him did we ever dated. And he said we never dated. He said we just had something going on. Idk what that means. 

The entire time I thought we were dating. But the whole time it was just friends flirting with each other. We did all the things people do when dating, so I thought this was a misunderstanding cuz we had something.


 I felt used. I told him I felt used and he said he didn’t use me cuz he liked me. But then he added “I thought I liked you” he kept telling me he liked me before over and over again, then he says he thinks?? And then I asked him if he wanted to date me. He said “No not really” I felt stabbed in the back, and have my heart ripped out. He literally asked his parents if he could date me and he said he didn’t want to?? What the bloody hell was going on!?? I’m so confused. Was I used?

572,"Sorry for the long story.
So since December of last year, I have been in a relationship with an amazing guy, he has been someone I can really trust and he is so much different to any guy I have ever dated, ever.
During quarantine He lived with me and our relationship has grown so much stronger.
On the 4th of July my boyfriends family were having a get together with more than just their family, My boyfriend asked his family if he could bring me along so we could meet, They agreed.
When the day came around we arrived early as my boyfriend promised his dad he would help with the set up. He introduced me to his family and his dad brother and sister were very friendly to me, But his mom was very very rude from the get go she made it obvious that she didn't like me and would occasionally whisper in my boyfriends sister's ear about me, and how my boyfriend could do better.
His mother made it clear what her son was not going to date a ""stuck up model"".
Now when I first heard this I was confused, In all honesty I am a model but it's only for a small company that were very closed off in a way.
I did ask my boyfriends sister at one point what she meant and she told me that my boyfriend's last relationship was with someone from the same company as me, There are three different locations for the company so It's a good chance this ex was from a different location to me.
Apparently this ex, after she had meet the family was incredibly rude and was trying her best to get my boyfriends family to constantly fight, According to my boyfriends sister to she came off very entitled, and always tried to make it a point that my boyfriend was her only ""choice"" for a boyfriend, she always bragged to my boyfriends sister that she always had a line of guys ready for her, and they constantly were texting her.
In the end they broke up because she was cheating on him.
I think this has very much has made an impact on the way my boyfriends mom see's me now and thinks I'll be the same way, I've tried getting along with her since 4th of July but she doesn't seem to want a relationship with me at all.
Any time my boyfriends family have some event my boyfriends siblings can invite their SO's but boyfriends mother makes it well known that I can't go.
I've tried voicing my thoughts to my boyfriend but all he says is give it time.
But how am I supposed to give her time if I can't prove I'm not like his ex?",20Aug2020,1

I just think a guy that age might be more  attentive and romantic unlike my ex who ignored half of my messages and never bothered to flirt with me or entertain any romantic fanatsies I had (like I would tell I would like to take a romantic trip with him to Paris one day or have sex on the beach with him but he would ignore those messages). I also figured an older guy would be more willing to commit unlike most of the guys in my age group. They’ll also probably be more mature, classier, and will probably have more show me in the bedroom (I just lost my virginity a couple of months ago and my ex and i didn’t try a wide variety of things. So, I want to be able to do explore more with my sexuality as much as possible). 

1. If a guy that age is single, he will probably have a baby mama.

578,"So I’m a senior (17f) in high school. My entire life I’ve done theatre, being in about 1-2 productions a year. While I’m not the best actress I’ve definitely seen success both in those productions, and on my schools speech team in dramatic interp, getting several first place awards. However, when I auditioned for the school play my freshman year I got a callback but only for a part that did not fit me whatsoever, when I had been in that specific play MULTIPLE times and there were several other roles that fit me much better. However I was not cast, and the role went to another soft spoken, inexperienced freshman. Scheduling conflicts interfered with my junior and sophomore auditions, but this year they changed the date of the play so I could. I practiced my monologue for like two weeks, gave a pretty good performance. I checked the callback list 20 minutes after it was posted, and alas, it was all people from previous productions, and the one person who wasn’t was a relative of someone who had been involved in previous years. Also the fact that it was posted 20 minutes after auditions really irritated me, because it seems like the directors did not give it any thought what so ever and just went with their favorites, it was almost pre typed. While it’s common for directors to play favorites, I feel this is unacceptable. Now I know it’s art, and therefore subjective, but I feel as this is ridiculous. Not only for myself but there were other good actors in my group who weren’t call back. I’m tired of missing out on what could have been really fun productions because of how nepotistic, selective, and elite our theatre department is. So reddit, how should I best call out my school on this? All I can think of so far is an open anonymous letter but I don’t know if this will do any good. Any suggestions are welcome!",20Aug2020,1

581,"I feel totally disrespected but also a bit outnumbered.

Some important info:

We live in a three story house where each story is a flat. 
I share a flat with my parter (leaseholder) and two other roommates. 
Our upstairs neighbors have been having HUGE parties in the backyard...without bothering to tell us first or anything. Like 50-100 people playing beer pong and passing joints. Obviously no masks or distancing. A gun “accidentally” went off at their last party and then they agreed to stop having them. 

One of my roommates had been attending these parties and also bringing friends of his over and letting people use our bathroom. 

We got in a huge fight about it last week. We didn’t walk away on great terms but he did agree to stop bringing people in and stop letting people use the bathroom. 

Fast forward to this morning when my other roommate texts me asking how I feel about this party bc she knew I hadn’t been included in the thread. (My partner tends to ignore group texts to idk if he read it or not he’s in bed sleeping and I don’t want to bother him which brings me to another point...) 

My parter is sick. He has had abdominal pain to the point where he woke me up last night saying he might need a ride to the ER even though he has a CT scan scheduled for today. But I think he needs easy access to the bathroom right now.

Also my other roommate who just texted me telling me all this is supposed to be quarantined right now so she can go visit her sister who is about to give birth. But she apparently just responded to his text about the party with “perfect”. 

I’m looking for a new place to live with my partner and my nice roommate but in the meantime this living situation feels awkward af right now and I feel like I’m being driven out of my home that I’ve lived in for years.",20Aug2020,1

This has resulted in me having no experience what so ever in dating and creating relationships with girls in my previous years, and unfortunately paired with autism aspergers I am so far behind in social interactions that im lost as to how to confront woman....

&amp;#x200B;

Over the past months I have had a bunch of woman that have been giving me regular looks that indicate interest in me, (when you know , you know) but I have NO idea how to approach them!

I just cant bear the anxiety of having others judging conversation, im really relaxed and on-going towards the older woman with powerful positions, in fact im great friends with my female boss that I have no problem coming up towards, this is in part because she made it easy for me to do so, always the first one to iniatiate at the start... 

But the story is different towards woman in my age group, they seem to be ''intimated'' by me, I guess my social status paired with good looks (Humble brag) they never really approach or engage in convo EVER if im not the one doint it first...

This results in them having small crushes on me, and not suprisingly they get upset after a few days if I dont make a move..

Many companies through out the US either pay for the full 12 weeks (and beyond) or allow their employees to use vacation AND sick leave. We are a large company (3k employees) and from what I can tell, using sick leave will not cause and undo burden to the organization.

I am a 22 year old male,my sister [32] always had a problem with my smoking habbit and my teenage years were full of argunents and fights over it with my family in general and my sister specifically (often calling me names and sprouting insults my way) ,these arguments although less common,still happen now that i'm 22,which i can understand since smoking IS harmful and they're comming from a good place, i would not advise anyone to take up such a habbit but my argument was always that it is my personal choice and my right to do with my body and life as i please.

590,"My uncle's behaviour has seriously affected me and I don't know what to do. 
Here is some background to help explain where I'm coming from.

When I was 7 my mother took me away from my family who I was extremely close to; two of my aunties were mother figures in my life where my own was not. I was then raised in an abusive household. My mother was emotionally abusive towards me and had frequent psychotic episodes (she is very ill with something undiagnosed). She was emotionally and physically abusive towards my stepdad. I was very close with my stepdad, but I've recently realised we had an unhealthy relationship in which he treated me a lot like a peer when I was 7-16. There were also boundary issues - there was an incident where he masturbated when we were sitting together, for example, when I was around 16. When I reunited with my family and biological dad at 16, I once again had a mother-daughter relationship with my auntie and a father-daughter relationship with her partner (my uncle in law) who she has been with my whole life. I was incredibly naïve because of my dysfunctional background and didn't realise it was inappropriate when my uncle massaged my legs. When my auntie told him not to because it was inappropriate, he continued to do so when no one was around because he said she was overreacting. He brushed his fingers on my privates and also massaged part of my bottom. during this time and I became extremely uncomfortable but didn't know what to do because I didn't understand if it was inappropriate or just an accident. I told him I wasn't comfortable anymore and he asked me if it was because it turned me on and I replied that that was disgusting as he was family. He reminded me that we're not related. On other occasions he has paid me compliments, like that my butt looks nice in the skirt I'm wearing, when no one can hear. He has kissed me on the neck rather than the forehead. He has held me in hugs despite me trying to end them. He has asked about my sexual activities with my partner and forced me to tell him things when I have clearly been extremely uncomfortable, and complained I don't talk to him enough about the relationship. This is despite the fact that he knows that he has known more than everyone else because he asked me much more. Plus, why do I need to share personal details?!
This has all taken place while I've been 16-21 years old. I don't understand what it means or what to do. He's made me feel disgusting and uncomfortable and I've just moved in with him, my auntie, and their 2 year old. I've confided in my partner and best friend and both were disgusted and said I need to tell my family. If I do that and it really isn't an accident or just weird behaviour then I'll be ruining my auntie's relationship and breaking up my cousin's parents, not to mention just the overall turmoil in my family it would cause. My auntie would not be able to take it. I don't want to destroy her life, or take away the stable and happy parenting unit my cousin has. I just don't know what to do because I'm so uncomfortable around him and he's always hugging me and touching my face and I just hate it.",20Aug2020,1

My dad also does not like for the dog to go on walks because he personally thinks it's too hot outside. Whenever I am at my parents' house, I take her on walks and am constantly bitched at not to make her walk too far (even though it is not ""hot"" outside like he says).

My dad believes that, since she gets excited when she's fed table scraps, that a ""happy life"" is better than a long life. Personally, I don't believe that a happy life consists of struggling to stand and barely being able to walk down one street before laying down out of exhaustion. 

He gets angry when the dog is called fat and will get angry at anyone that tries to tell him that what he's doing is wrong.

I was thinking about moving to Massachusetts, Maryland, Vermont, Connecticut, or Pennsylvania. 

If I do get my certification in NY, can I take that certification with me to a different state? If I decide to move to one of those states soon, which one would you recommend? Do you know any good programs outside of NY? Was thinking online since of Covid",20Aug2020,1

597,"I(16M) and my best friend(also 16M) since kindergarden have been ""best firends"" for almost 12 years. In past years we used to hang out every summer evening in a nearby park and walk, talk, lagh and share some of our deepest secrets.


This summer it has been a bit different. Sometimes he brings what i assume based on our friendship good reasons for not being able to hange out( like going to his grandparents for tge weekend or being on vacation etc). But the times when he doesnt give any reason and just sais he cant have multiplyed.

The only thing that has changed is that he is working on a game that me and some other coleagues of him work on. He works a lot on it as he can be very persistent with things he really wants to do.


Also at the start if tge summer in a fit of rage he told me i am boribg and he thinks that for over a year which kinda took me by surprise as he didnt ever voice any concerns about out friendship before. He later apologises and blames the stress from his quote en quote ""employees"" not listening to him.


Here is the problem: if i dont hang out with him i dont have what else to do. I know its bad to have your personal time revolve around another person but other friends from my current school class live like 4-5 km away whereas my bestfriend lives 5 minutes of walking away. Also ny eyes have been a bit more tired from all the hours i spend on my phone/pc and i dont want to push them too far.

I have other hobbies like exercise and going biking but the dont take nearly as much of my day/are that fun as haning out with him. 

Any advice?


FYI our friendship when we do hang out is no different. We still have fun(or as much as i know i have fun).",20Aug2020,1
598,"This is long.

I am 37 years old, and I've had a difficult life. Years of abuse as a child gave me PTSD, causing me to drop out of college where I had a full ride. After a couple of years wallowing in the depths of depression and then more years getting my shit together, I went back to college and graduated with a B.S. in Biology on 2012.

I am also visually impaired. Like I can see to read but I'm not allowed to drive. This is relevant. Part of the reason I chose biology is because natural resources was a hugely growing field when I started school. I planned to get a government job with the Forest Service or US Fish and Wildlife because I knew they would be more likely to accommodate my disability. Then the great recession happened. 

Suddenly, those jobs were few and far between and the only jobs in my field required a drivers license or an internship which I could not afford to do since I had to work to pay my rent.

After I graduated, life threw me a surprise pregnancy curveball. But we made it work. I've stayed home with my now three kids while my husband works full time. I tried to find work between my second and third kids but had the same problems as before. Also I was diagnosed with severe ADHD at age 30.

Then I started freelance writing and was surprisingly successful. I wrote nine ghostwritten novels in two years plus video game scripts for a studio that went under. I wrote so much I was approaching burnout. So when I was pregnant with my third, my husband and I decided I would take this time to work on my own novel and he would get into this apprentice electrician program so maybe someday we'd be above the poverty line.

Our son was born in January. Then COVID happened. What this made clear was that I am not mentally cut out for homeschooling and my husband is incredibly risk averse and would rather stay home than further his career. His current job is always one bad day from the company going under anyway. I am fine with being the breadwinner. 

But I still have the same problems I've always had getting hired. I love writing but its not exactly a stable, well-paying career. So what do I do now? 

I could go back to grad school for Biology, but I already have 70k in student loans. The program in my city is also not that great, but its also the only city where we could afford a house. If we sold, I think we'd still be underwater on our mortgage. The program for writing is better here, but its not exactly a guaranteed career for the amount of debt I'd be taking on.

I'm willing to do the work to give my family a better life, but everything feels hopeless and I don't know what to do. I've applied to a bunch of jobs and haven't heard back. I guess I'm in the middle of a depression spiral and I need someone to tell me the steps to get out of the rut my life has been in. Also I'm trying to get into therapy and I'm already medicated so there's that.",20Aug2020,1
599,So my fiancé and I have been together for 3 years. We have been engaged since January 2020. We planned on getting married in October of this year. Pandemic hit and we had to switch some plans but luckily we had a great deal and were still having the wedding in October. Everything was going good and then my mom unexpectedly passed away 2 weeks ago. She was my best friend and she loved my fiancé they clicked the first day they met. My dad and mom we’re together 44 years so this has taken a huge toll on him so I been making sure he is okay and feels supported. My fiancé and I planned on getting a place by October we had already set a few townhouse and house viewings together and were leaning towards a townhouse for a year or 2 until we bought the house we wanted. We agreed to postpone the wedding till next year now due to the situation with my family. My fiancé agreed and was the one who wanted it pushed back because she know my mom was the foundation of the family. So now my fiancé and I find the place and she says she will move in and I can’t until we are married!? Now she wanted that before in our relationship and agreed and was ok because we would’ve been married and had a home at the same time so it was perfect but now situation has changed and now she expects me to pay for a place I can’t even live in due to her now morals? Which she hasn’t followed the same morals before? I’m asking if anyone has had a similar scenario or any advice on how to approach this. Thank you,20Aug2020,1
600,"Hello Reddit

My partner (M26) and I (F24) are expecting our first baby in February 2021. We're really excited but looking for some advice on what to do with our German Shepherds.

We have two 3 year old GSD's. They both quiet dogs and pretty chill, although are prone to bouts of excitement with the occasional bark to the postman or next doors dog. They're very well behaved and as far as training goes they're quite good with sit, back up and leave.

They're very affectionate and love children, but because they're quite big they don't seem to realise their size - for example, our boy tries to cuddle his head into you and can me quite pushy and headbutty and our girl goes crazy with the kisses.

We were just wondering if anyone had any advice for introducing them to a baby as we want them to be as gentle as possible and give them time to get used to their new friend. We don't want to keep them segregated as we think that will only lead to resentment and cause problems much later down the line.",20Aug2020,1

604,"&gt;***Throwaway, because my cousin uses reddit. TL;DR at the bottom.***

So. to begin with, some background: my cousin is in her early 20s, and is my favorite cousin because she doesn't just dismiss our concerns and interests as childish. She's a pushover, and is generally nice until she just gets fed up with other people, and is actually even nice when mad. She's also in her second year of law, as a post-graduate student. Due to the entire covid-19 thing clusterfuck that is 2020, most of us have been quarantined together in our grandmother's ancient house. 

My cousin is one of those people who are smart enough to skate through college with minimal effort, and has had no particular direction with her life due to being manhandled by her parents at an early age. She has self-depreciating humor that grows worse when she fails at something, but she never takes her anger or stress out on other people. My aunt and uncle (her parents) are also weirdly obsessed with making something out of her on ***their*** calls and choices, despite saying ***""We'll support you whatever path you choose.""*** If my cousin proposes that she'd  rather do *this* than *that,* they'll always find faults in her plans and coax them over to do their bidding despite it harming her mental (or physical) health.

(Personally, I think they just want to brag that their child is now a lawyer to some of our relatives who happen to badmouth them, but I digress.)

My cousin had decided after graduating college that she wanted to be a teacher. She attempted to tell her parents, but was shot down (in a semi-public conversation in the living room, no less) by them, in the presence of other older relatives that being a teacher was terrible, and that the wage was terrible. She had tried to explain that she would rather be a college professor, but her mom (my aunt ) changed the subject and started pointing out all the cons in her decision. This was part one. 

Then, because my cousin is a pushover, she was shoehorned into studying law. It seemed fun before the real shit finally came in. I feel bad for her every time she messes up on codal provisions and her dad (a former law student who didn't pass the bar), just verbatim recites them to her face with a smug look, and everyone joins in on teasing/berating her.  It makes me sick.

Then, when her second year arrived my cousin finally had enough and had a discussion with her mom, and said that she couldn't continue this, this wasn't her, and that she found absolutely no joy in this study. Her mom was sympathetic at first, but switched to blatantly manipulative by saying ***""This is for your sake,"" ""You're an only child, who's going to help you when your father and I pass,""*** and my favorite, ***""You're doing this for yourself, not for us, and besides, you chose this despite warnings from us.""***

The last one grinds on my teeth because she confided in us cousins that her parents had set her up to take law because *""it was her childhood dream,""* despite her protesting and asking them if it really was as easy as her father made it out to be. And presently, she remembers clearly that she protested *and* asked so many times about the difficulty of  studies in law, but her mom and dad just apparently waved it off by saying *""You're our child and we know your capabilities best, and we know you can do that.""*

The Final Straw hits when she finally manages to pick up enough spines and stand up to her mom, by compromising that she would take the four-year Juris Doctor program, ***but*** that she wouldn't take the bar exam, because she was tired, and that she did not want to become a lawyer at all, and she could not deal with the responsibility and study time of being a bar taker. She conceded that the JD Degree was a good thing, if she wanted a high paygrade in any job, but the Bar Exam was a stress she couldn't do about. Shit hits the fan when my aunt goes and pulls out the ***""I'm ill, and I don't know when I'll pass, and if you would take the bar exam, whether you pass it or not, that would be your final gift to me,""*** card. 

My cousin went blank, gathered up all her stuff, and ignored her mom when she started talking to her. I followed suit, and I think she was crying. She had locked her door and refused to let anyone in. Her mom didn't even check up on her. The next day, she seemed normal. Cracked jokes, smiled, whatever. But she refused to talked to her mom the entire half of the day, and refused to do the same to her dad when he came home. Now, she'd constantly alternate between bitter/angry and just morbidly cheerful. I remember overhearing her talk with a cousin her age when everyone was asleep, and I just felt so bad when she said *""I thought mom would understand why I wanted to quit.""* 

The problem now, is every time I try to ask her about this, she dodges the question. recently, she's been getting wounds on her hands. She says that's from when she was playing around with carving boxcutters and extra bamboo chopsticks we had from past visits to a fast-food chain, but I don't trust that one bit. The most terrifying thing comes along when I borrow her phone to google something, and her recently opened tabs are how to find and purchase sleeping pills without a prescribed doctor's note. She's been sleeping more and more, to the point of nearly waking up only for classes, one meal, and baths.

I'm terrified, because these signs aren't good. Her mother and father have their egos stuck up their arses and refuse to believe that mental illness is a thing, and that people who claim to have them are just dramatic. They believe that they know their daughter best. They believe that she's born to become the lawyer that her father and grandfather couldn't become. They think that she'll change her mind and that one day, she's going to gear up for the Bar Exam. These same parents refused to let her get a bank account of her own until she was 20, and even then, they only did it bc my cousin was finally asking around for where and how to get a bank/atm account. These parents refused to let her go home via public transportation until college, where she had to beg for it. These same parents laughed at her face and called her dramatic, when my cousin wanted to visit a therapist or counselor because her anxiety was apparently not normal, because even stepping into a classroom would just...set her off. 

They understand who their ideal daughter is; they do not understand our beloved goofball cousin who can make a dry poem funny, who wants to be a teacher, who likes Yu Yu Hakusho and Rose of Versailles, and Kingsmen, and fried chicken. I don't want to lose my favorite cousin.   


&gt;***TL;DR: I think my cousin might want to commit suicide, or is planning to commit suicide, because her parents placed too much academic expectations on her, despite her various protests. How do I breach the subject to her with some other cousins? How do I talk to her about it?***",20Aug2020,1

606,"My boyfriend plays video games, not a ridiculous amount but for a few hours every day before I wake up. I wouldn’t mind cause that’s what he really likes to do and it’s not like it gets in the way of us being together (as soon as I’m awake he finishes his game). But the problem is that when he loses even once, which is almost every morning, he gets really upset for the rest of the day. 

I understand being upset cause something didn’t work out and needing space to collect and calm your emotions so I always give it to him. But this is happening every day now so he’s in a bad mood every day. We only get back to normal about an hour before he goes to bed, and then the morning the same thing happens. 

He really loves playing and like I said he doesn’t do it all day, so I feel like the bad guy if I tell him he needs to stop playing. But I feel like he should prioritize us actually getting to have a normal relationship over playing for a few hours. I don’t want to take something he loves away. And I know it’s not anyone’s place to tell someone how to feel (“you’re not allowed to be upset when you lose”) I don’t know what to do. Any advice from girlfriends and/or guys that can relate to him would be really helpful

607,"
Ok so to start off me and 3 other friends have been best friends since 1st grade and we were all very close for a very long time, I’ll call them (Jackson, Mikey and James) then when we got to 7th and 8th grade we got another friend named ed and he ended up becoming one of our greatest friends also. Anyways later throughout 8th grade Mikey started to like this one girl named Emma and they talked but not very much and Mikey started to have almost an obsession with her and didn’t like whenever she got a boyfriend or so forth. He would get very sad and and complain that his life was miserable all the time and me and my other friends would try and cheer him up all the time and nothing was good enough. He started to get a group of people on ps4 and take out his stresses on his own life out on me in ps4 parties and would play Minecraft or any other game and start to bully me with a group of about 4 people and make very terrible remarks to me when i did nothing wrong. Some things they did to me ( call me a child rapist, say I’m terrible at everything I do and hope I never have kids to they can inherit these terrible genes, make rooms on Minecraft and fill them with red stone and put a sign that said “where (my name) rapes children”. Anyways this happened every night for the most part (I was scared I was gonna lose my only friends so I decided to stay with them even for this next part I tried to stay in contact with them over the internet). I ended up moving away and I played with them every night on ps4 still and the same things would continue to happen. I got a friend named Grant and introduced him to them online and he became really close to Mikey. At this point Mikey still liked Emma for whatever reason but he didn’t complain about it anymore(at this point we are in freshman year). Another thing about Mikey is he gets sad randomly even tho his life is completely normal and fine and no there is no personal reason for him being sad he just made bullshit excuses and told us things that didn’t make sense like (oh man this girl I barely ever talk to doesn’t like me even tho I never told her how I feel). He learned about my friend Ed’s secret (I will not say but it’s personal) to girls he never even met before and Ed decided to block him on everything and leave him forever. Mikey then became very depressed and told me in my dms that he was cutting himself and sent me pictures to. I then told my friend Jackson that this was happening and he told mikey’s mother  and he went to therapy for a month or 2 and then he didn’t go anymore. He still was super sad over Ed leaving him. Ed started to finally make me realize what a horrible person Mikey is to me and I started to finally think about it and actually notice that he’s a terrible person. I decided to block Mikey as well and I told him I don’t want to talk to him ever again and that was the end of that. My good friend grant still talked to him (this part is the situation I’m in right now). Grant is a very trustable friend of mine that is now talking to Mikey and Mikey has sent him messages like “I wrote my suicide letter and was about to kill myself but I decided not to” and sent me screenshots of these messages and now James, Jackson and I don’t know how to deal with this situation. 

I am conflicted because I hate Mikey because of so many things he put me through and seriously made me have some of the worst feelings in my life but I also don’t want him to kill himself I would feel extremely guilty and right now Jackson is planning to tell his mom about this again but I don’t know if that will help and I don’t know if I should dm him and lie and say something so he doesn’t commit suicide or tell him the truth so he thinks about his situation more.

So fast forward two months later, I decided to call them back (bc they called me a a few weeks ago) and I was just letting them know that I am still available etc etc, and they said they will call me up later. 
30 minuter later my sister texts me that they called (for the first time)but she didn't answer (idk why) I pushed for her to call them back and she did  and turns out she can work on tuesday like a testday??(sorry english isn't my first language)

I helped her a little with her application and I so regret it now. She literally applied for just this job, one job this year!! I've lost count of how many I've applied for. I'm struggling.

About two weeks ago, I logged into his snapchat because he gave me the password to it and I saw a saved video from some girl in her bra. I immediately asked him who she was and he told me that she was a  coworker who had a crush on him and that he would block her. Since I trusted him, I let it go and decided to let him handle it. Last night around 9pm, I get a text message from someone asking me who I was to which I replied with my name. This person then reveals herself as his coworker and asks me if I was his girlfriend or just someone he used to be with. I responded telling her I was his girlfriend and she then goes on to say that my boyfriend had been with her until 3am the night before and they had been hanging out for weeks, and that he told her that he was single. She says they went and got tattoos together, and that he had taken her on multiple dates on multiple occasions. She informed me that they didn’t have sex, not because he didn’t want to but because she just wasn’t ready for sex with him and he expressed that he respected her for it and still was interested in her. She also informed me that she was 22 years old.

I’m so crushed about the cheating. I’m conflicted about the tattoo thing tbh though.. why would he have chosen her to go and get his FIRST tattoo with? It was his first and I should’ve been there..I mean, maybe I’m looking too deep into it but not only did he cheat on me but he chose some other girl to go and get his first tattoo with even though I would of loved to be there with him. He’s telling me that he’ll stop talking to her again and that he loves me and will cut her off completely. I so lost on what to do...I love him..and although he didn’t have sex with her he still cheated. I am lost on if I should try to get past the cheating or if I should let him go.

618,"Im gonna start by saying I’m a bicurious guy and have realized this the past few years. Never acted on it though and everybody thinks I am only into women. 

There’s a guy I met a few months ago through mutual friends. There was a party at his house and I was only introduced to him briefly and he was really drunk. So the next time I saw him I didn’t expect him to remember my name and hug me. Since then we became really good friends. We moved to California with another friend of ours last month. He’s a real ladies man, when we were back home he would have sex with multiple girls a week and doesn’t really have to try much to get girls. He always talks about girls and how many he’s been with. He’s super good looking, great body and amazing heart and personality. 

I always had a hint he might be bi because around the time I first met him, somebody was talking about him to a friend of ours and I was only a few feet away, and he said he grabbed him or touched him in a way that made him uncomfortable. Other hints over time were certain things like a few weeks ago we just went out one night out of boredom and rode electric scooters. We stopped at an intersection and I wasn’t looking towards him and he put his face real close to mine like he was gonna kiss me. I felt him closer to me but never looked his way. There were just a lot of subtle hints until the past week.

A few days ago we were in the car with friends and it was just me and him in the back seat. He asked me to pass him a puff bar so I did and he took a hit of the vape and put his head on my shoulder. I waited like 5 seconds for him to move his head but he didn’t so I kind of rested my head on his and we did that for a few minutes and our friends in the front didn’t notice. Then last night we were on the swing on our patio listening to music and he started cuddling up to me. Put his head on my shoulder and we stayed like that for about 30 mins. The past few days he’s been talking about astrology and asked me what my sign is and he mentioned twice today about how our signs are most compatible for each other in a relationship. Also he said my name in his sleep twice this week. 

Whether he’s interested in me or not, I’m gonna let him keep making the moves because I’d rather accept his advances than make one towards him and get denied.

619,"I don't even know why I'm writing this, honestly. Maybe it's out of simple curiosity or just sheer desperation, but I honestly have nowhere or no one to turn to at the moment to talk about this, considering the hectic nature of my life...

I don't see any real value in myself, what I can do, etc., and I've lost the motivation and drive to go on any longer as I see any effort in trying to change my current predicament as fruitless, and I feel real difficulty in having strong feelings towards anything anymore. 

I think this all started during middle school/high school but didn't really go full throttle until around the fall/winter of last year. Up until about the 9th grade, I was a relatively happy person. That all changed as the years went by. 

I dealt with a lot of deaths in my family, my grades were slipping, I was getting bullied a lot, the usual stuff. 

Going back a bit When I was in about the 5th grade I started taking a liking to this girl in my class. She was really sweet to me and all throughout up until high school we started this really toxic on again/off again relationship, with her always dumping me and me coming back to her...

She would constantly talk about me behind her back to her friends about how shitty I was, would berate me and make me feel like shit for not knowing a damn thing about being a good boyfriend....but I was giving my best effort. I'll admit that I was pretty shitty at times, but I always tried to live up to what she wanted me to be...

Anyway, at around our senior year (2018) we stopped communicating until she got back into contact with me in around summer of 2019. We had sex at her house once during that point and stopped talking after that in a very awkward way. She told me after that that I was disgusting and she hated every minute of it, and I honestly didn't blame her even though part of me was pissed. 

Later that year I got news from my folks that she died in a car accident. I got this the night it happened and I was honestly devastated. I cried myself to sleep that night, and the nights after that and it's just spiraled out of control. 

My sleep schedule is abysmal, my routine just consists of chugging caffeine and hoping for the best, when I drive during the day to my current university part of me wants to just drive off the road and end it all...

I hate how I look, I hate my voice, my personality, everything, and I just feel that I'm not good enough. Every single fucking day I wish to be someone else and/or would honestly rather be dead than have to continue to live with this pain. 

I can't move on from all this. I can't just stop and believe that I'm worthy of love or whatever again. People keep telling me I am, but I don't see it, nor believe it.... 

There's more I could talk about but...


I just want it all to stop...",20Aug2020,1
620,"TW: Pedophilia and aggression due to disability and mental disorders and masterbation

Hi guys, 

This is a weird one and I'm really not sure where else to turn. Due to Covid I lost my job in Feb, I've been searching for a job since and finally got accepted into a role yesterday! I was so excited until I found out a bit more information yesterday. 

For context, I'm a 26 year old woman. I have had interest in working in care since my grandmother had a stroke and went into a care facility. The staff there we're amazing, but I wasn't very good at school so I was never able to branch into the field. 

A friend of mine has been working at a care facility for 4 months and when a job came up, he put me down for it straight away. They interviewed me yesterday and offered me the job an hour later. So last night, I was talking to him about it and he asked which area I was going to be in, as there had been staff moved around while they looked for someone. I said it was in one of two houses (there are 5 within the care home) and he was horrified. 

Turns out that one of these houses has two offending pedophiles living there. I had also apparently met one of these men yesterday without knowing, since I was directed to the wrong building when going to my interview. 

At the moment they think its more likely that I will be in the other house, but honestly I hadn't even thought about something like this being the case. 

During the interview I was told a bit about the residents living there, but that had not been mentioned, they had talked about a few of the residents having anger issues, due to either trauma, mental disorders or brain damage. I had understood this when I went for the interview, so I was prepared. 

My friend has now told me that they have on several occasions walked into the living area and found one of the two pedophiles sitting out in the open masterbating to children's tv, then attacked the carer who walked in. 

I've no idea what the point of this is, other than I'm honestly really worried and don't know what to do. I'm so excited to work, but I don't know if I could handle being around them. Any advice? 

TLDR; Have been offered carer job, but am nervous to work in a place that houses pedophiles. Advice?",20Aug2020,1
621,"So this happened literally this morning. 

I’m an 18M and not very active on Facebook. A couple days ago this girl who I don’t know requests to friend me, but on my friends list it says we have one mutual friend, so I’m just like “sure I can add them, what can go wrong?” So I added her back this morning, and I checked her profile a bit because I was skeptical that she was a bot or something. She has like 4-5 posts (one of them was like an photo album at some event, the others were just profile and background picture changes), so I think she’s real but I still feel it’s a little sketchy. Once I added her back, she immediately jumped into my FB dm and introduced herself (22F) and I introduced myself (my name, age, and area since we were both kind of in the same area) out of politeness... which I still felt a little uncomfortable doing cuz I don’t rly know her personally. Right after she asked if I liked sex and if I wanted to trade a dick pic for a pic of her chest and vag. 

Two thoughts immediately crossed my mind when I saw that message. 
1. “Ok she doesn’t seem like a bot, but asking me for nudes is really sketchy bc the fact that sending a dick pics is rly sketchy and potentially a big liability in the future, so I don’t rly want to put myself in that position”
2. This person finds me attractive enough (from her pictures/posts I thought she was decently attractive) to ask for nudes. I know I’m at least not ugly and probably moderately attractive, because a couple girls asked me out in high school, but I’m still in that phase where I’m a little unsure of myself and my body image. 

Being 18, there was a small part of my brain that was just a little horny and was debating with my rational brain like “ok so u definitely shouldn’t be sending nudes but also u would like nudes BUT THIS IS JUST SO SKETCHY.” I’ve never been approached like this before so I was very unsure whether to accept her invitation or not. In the end I just politely turned her down and said I wasn’t into that kind of stuff and I felt uncomfortable doing it. She ended up just blocking me on Facebook I think. 


So, I guess I have two questions from this situation:

1. Was she legit or was she just a catfish or bot or some shit like that? 
2. If she was legit, how should I have approached the situation? Was the way I approached it fine? Because I might have just missed an opportunity to send nudes/hook up with a girl I found decently attractive. 


Tldr: stranger (22F) slide into my(18M) FB dm to ask to trade nudes. I was horny but alarmed and new to this situation so I turned her down. Might have missed a chance to trade nudes/hook up with an attractive chick.",20Aug2020,1
622,"Is this dangerous for pregnancy?

Am I in danger of pregnancy? I had sex on day 10 of my cycle (not bleeding anymore it’s was just day 10 of the cycle, I had finished my period 2 days before) with a spermicide condom + not finishing? By not finishing I mean pulling out well before he would have needed to ejaculate. 
Also, if one was to be fingered after the partner had dried his hands off with a dried cum rag, does that put me in danger of pregnancy?

624,"so basically im in a group of 2 friends in which we have a strong connection and trust but for some reason i made a huge mistake. they r 2 girls and im a guy, lets call the girls lisa and meray. sooo weve been friends for 6 years , iv helped them with everything and so on. lisa used to rant about her life relationships ect... but once she told me something certain about her. i had problem with it so instead of facing her and facing meray (btw me and meray like each other and we were gonna date) so what i did instead, i went and ranted to lisa's ex about her since i personally have nothing against him. after i finished ranting about lisa to her ex he promised that his lips would be sealed and wouldn't utter a word and i explained to him that if lisa and meray knew about this, my friendship with them will come to an end. eventually for a while lisa's ex forgot about this and for some reason he decided to tell them everything and let them know what i actually told him. after they knew of what exactly happened, i confessed the truth and the mistake i made and didn't deny anything at all and in addition i apologized. so we had a mini conversation about how can we fix this and all of that and how could we solve the issue and regain my friendship back with them, so after we discussed things, lisa and meray mentioned that they won't cut me off or anything but instead they need time and to not pressure them or even text them too much only if i wanna check up on them. so to finish this my questiion is why do they need time to think through this and if they're going to take time to process everything that happened, is there going to be a new chance and a chapter opening for us?

note: since we established this long term friendship so far this is the only and first mistake i've ever committed and i would want to get any advices or suggestions to help me get through this phase since they mean a lot to me and i dont wanna lose them.",20Aug2020,1

626,"I am in my 20's leading a stable life. Have a good job, good friend circle, good physical and mental health etc.

But the most recent thing that keeps eating away my head from being happy is the following:

One day I set a goal and started to improve myself by studying more(related to my job) . I know that it will definitely guarantee a better job and a better pay. But i became extremely dedicated to studying,so that now i hardly have time to go out, spending time with friends and family, playing video games etc.

I began to question my decision for self improvement. Why am i doing this? i am already happy. If i can just lower my standards and chill, i can forever be happy. But at the same time, if i start to relax for a few days, then that feeling of shame and self-judgement creeps in, ""You idiot , you should be improving yourself right now, do you want to regret this?"".

So i think i am caught between this dilemma of ""Self improvement vs Low Standards"".

I personally think  neither is superior over the other. I am comfortable with both those options. 

So, What do you think? What should i decide? What according to you is superior?",20Aug2020,1
627,"How does one get themselves out of bad spending habits? I'll ask my boyfriend to go to the store for one 10 dollar item, and he comes home 100-200 dollars later. The other day, he spent $30 dollars at a coffee shop. A couple weeks ago, we had our nephews over. We live in apartments and not allowed to have pools or slip n slides or whatever. He went out and spent probably 100 on a pool, slip n slide,, water guns, water balloons, all without my permission, and it's just sitting there because we can't use it. Keep in mind this is MY money and I have been supporting him since he moved in. Every time he goes to the store, he buys something completely unnecessary, or buys the expensive stuff rather than the cheaper.
I can think of so many examples where he has completely wasted my money. Half of my stimulus was spent on a hotel (before he moved in) because he had spent his on weed and alcohol and couldn't pay. 
I was getting the extra 600 from unemployment every week and I SHOULD still have at least a couple thousand. I have a couple hundred. Over 900 (might be a couple hundred more, not sure the exact amount) was spent in a week. We have a baby and I feel like I'm taking care of an infant baby AND an adult baby.

631,"So I guess this is a bit of a long story, but the TLDR is I'm trying to find and take down revenge porn of myself online and I'm wondering if anyone has any advice about how to go about doing this.

A few years ago I got an email to my work account that had a number of nude photos attached to it. These were all photos I had taken myself and sent to my boyfriend. The email sender claimed he hacked me and tried to blackmail me for more--obviously I didn't comply--and he started sending these private photos to random people all over the place. Some colleagues at my work got them, and lots of random people I didn't know would call me or email me and say they had them (almost all were creepy blackmailing types). It was completely traumatizing. I deleted my social media because I was getting swarmed with requests and messages like that. Eventually it started to slow down and stop.

I called the police right away but after sending them everything they basically said there was nothing they could do and I should be ""more careful in the future"" and that ""once it's on the internet, it's there forever.""

About a week ago one of my old classmates sent me a link to a relatively recent on some porn site--it was one of my old pictures, posted with my name on it. She had found it by GOOGLING my name while looking for my email. I found the same photos on dozens of websites, including a fake subreddit using a variant of my name. It looks like they got posted frequently on various image boards like 4chan.

I've been working nonstop to get everything taken down. I'm shooting off DMCA removal requests constantly. Some websites acted fast and took everything down but others sure take their time. And in some cases, like the 4chan posts, all those images are out there still but they're not easy to search for (i'm going through archives that are hard to search). I guess my top priority has been and continues to be removing anything with my name that's easy to find on google. But eventually I'd like to get rid of everything. 

Sorry for the rant. Would to hear even just encouragement from anyone that's had success and how they went about doing it.",20Aug2020,1

633,"I very recently proposed to my (now) fiancé. She was incredibly happy as was I that she said yes. We have a child and a house together already so it was in the pipeline and we've already started planning. 

Here's the problem; her younger sister is incredibly envious of her. Always has been. After every success she has ever had in her life whether it be graduation, pregnancy announcement etc., her younger sister seems to turn into Mr Hyde, spouting horrible comments and just being generally nasty, seemingly for the sake of it with a view to upsetting my fiancé. 

This behaviour really hurts her and she becomes extremely stressed out and bothered by it. It's clear she has done nothing to deserve this abuse and that her younger sister is simply incredibly envious. She is the gentlest person I know and would never intentionally hurt anyone.

Ever since they were children,  the younger sister has thrown a tantrum every time my fiancé has either got something nice for Christmas or had some form of success. Her parents have fed this fire and made her behaviour by appeasing it and giving her what she wants simply (I think) to shut her up. E.g. fiancé gets a laptop for Christmas,  parents buy little sister the exact same laptop because she threw a tantrum about it. 

This behaviour has followed her into her adulthood and now when fiancé gets something nice, little sister shows this regressive and destructive behaviour. 

This is the last straw. She has displayed the same behaviour towards our engagement and future wedding and I absolutely refuse to have her day ruined by this petulant behaviour.

641,"Was told to post this here. I’m a teenager. My mom regularly discusses, at length, any emotional or marital or work issues she’s having. She sort of started doing it when I was in elementary school after she had a falling out with a close friend and she was asking me how I thought she should go about fixing it. Since then she’s sort of always come to me asking for advice on certain emotional issues or even just to rant about something like a tough day at work. I always thought this was pretty normal, even though there have been lots of times she’s asked me things that I’m not sure I can answer. In the last couple of years, she’s been talking to me more and more about issues she’s been having with my dad, especially. She asks me what I think of their relationship, how I think certain problems in their relationship should be solved, etc. Recently, she asked me if I think my dad still loves her, which was one of those questions I didn’t feel like I could answer. I guess I sort of put a lot of effort into emotionally supporting my mom.

I don’t usually talk with my mom about my problems because I’m worried about putting more stress on her, too. Because I know she’s kinda going through it based on what she talks to me and asks me about, and I don’t feel like I can put more stress on her.

I kinda thought it was normal, like something someone with a strong connection to her kids would do, but I sort of casually mentioned this in a conversation with a friend and they acted like it was super weird/concerning.

647," I (16, M) live alone with my mom in a small house. My room is right above the living room, separated only by some stairs, so I can very clearly hear anyone in the living room and they can very clearly hear me in my room, like they're right next to each other (but one above the other). I've always been ok with that and It didn't bother much, but since my dad left my mom started spending almost the entire day there. She works for 2 hours then comes home to work from home at her laptop and she's also writing this thesis that' she's been doing for some years.

Sometimes she'll ask me questions or try to talk to me randomly, like we're in the same room or something, some times I don't hear or honestly I don't want to talk to her because of something she said I'll explain later.

Most of the time she also just asks unnecessary questions and lots of small talk just to try and start a conversation. I'm a bit of an introvert and enjoy being alone and having my privacy at home, plus I'm not asking for a lot I think, I just want to be alone and have privacy in my room. I used to voice-chat with my friends and people in games back then, I also used to do livestreams and talk with viewers and other livestreamers I played with. I really liked doing that but stopped. while I like being alone, she's an extrovert and says she doesn't feel good being alone, so I guess this could be her way of not feeling alone, just listening to me and whatever I was doing so she doesn't feel alone, along with leaving the TV on while she works from home on her laptop or does whatever it is she would be doing so she doesn't feel alone, something I have to hear too, since we can hear anything the other is doing, she sometimes complained about me making noise with my mouse and keyboard...

She has her own room where she used to work and has her own office room next to her room, but refuses to go back to there I don't know why, even though she used to be there all the time before my dad left and she started spending more and more time in the living room, now she spends almost the entire day there, I should also say night since she stays there to watch TV or listen to radio until late.

One time she got mad at me for not replying to her, and I told her I had headphones in because I was playing with friends, (so I can hear them and reply to them in chat) and also don't want to hear her watching TV, and asked her why she even tries to talk to me or ask questions like that, as If we were in the same room. She said and I quote ""I like to hear your voice"" and this might be exaggerated of me but I felt disgusted, and slowly stopped talking to friends and people in voice-chat because of this, I just feel uncomfortable talking while she's hearing and said that she likes to hear me. This reminded me of some times I was voice-chatting with friends or talking with people in games, or whenever I was on the phone and she went from her room to the living room to do whatever she was doing, or became more quiet, like she was trying to hear what I'm talking about to others and my phone calls.

She'll also stare at me (makes sure to always look at people, something good that I don't do) and try to talk to me when I pass her to go to the kitchen/bathroom, I feel uncomfortable with this since I don't like being looked at and I feel uncomfortable with eye contact, makes me feel self-conscious too, but that's something I'm working on overcoming

Quarantine has been absolute hell for me because I'm locked inside with my mom like this. today I was just laying in bed doing nothing and she asks me if everything's ok, I tell her yes and asked her why she asks, she says ""she can't hear me"". It's like she's there trying to hear me or something. I want to talk to her / confront her about it and tell her she shouldn't be trying to hear me in my own room and that's taking away privacy someone would expect to have there, but she'll just ignore me like the other times or/and say I'm being disrespectful. This made me want to make this post to ask people If I'm in the wrong here.

I feel like she ignores what I tell her her and what I think, like other times I tried to talk to her about it. Last christmas we had a family dinner, at a point she started talking about how I had a bad result in a class I was having some trouble with. I asked her to please stop but she didn't care about it, (I have a variety of stories of her disrespecting me, making me look bad to others and putting me in bad situations... and then I end up looking like some angsty teen) I got a bit angry at her since she wasn't stopping and brought up how she ignores what I say and doesn't care about it and how she disrespects me and makes me look bad to others. My sister defended her saying that's just how she is and I need to grow up and deal with it, I think my mom's the one who would need to grow up a bit and that I've been ""dealing with it"" for years now, that I think my mom doesn't respect me and respect would be mutual once she respected me. I feel like my sister just sided with her without caring much to hear me out either and acted like she was there the entire time (she lived with us for some months). My dad thinks I'm disrespectful to my mom but later told me he knows how she acts sometimes and I need to have patience with her, which again I've been having for years, and my grandma agrees with me.

I also have no way of getting there. What can I do?",20Aug2020,1
649,"So a few months back my dog died from a blood clot , he passed away while asleep on my bed after making a moan I've never heard from a dog before. When the vet told us there was nothing that be could have done and was unsure or didn't say what could cause the blood clot. About a few days before the I caught one of the kids throwing the ball for him awkwardly so as he would land on his back, instantly I told her off for doing it as it would probably hurt him being a 30kg labrador. Now skip to present day and I still miss my best friend, my family have a new dog in my house. And its obvious everyone's alot happier with the new pup and that's good. However I feel extremely paranoid that something could happen to her if left alone with these kids. I havent told my brother or his partner about what I caught her doing, I save face alot when I'm around them as I know it's not an easy thing to hear. But this has been on my mind for months and although it's not a nice thought to dwell on with the new puppy around I cant help feeling over protective.

Not quite sure if I should explain what happend to my family, but maybe posting this someone might have experienced a similar situation",20Aug2020,1
650,"I (16, M) live alone with my mom in a small house. My room is right above the living room, separated only by some stairs, so I can very clearly hear anyone in the living room and they can very clearly hear me in my room, like they're right next to each other (but one above the other). I've always been ok with that and It didn't bother much, but since my dad left my mom started spending almost the entire day there. She works for 2 hours then comes home to work from home at her laptop and she's also writing this thesis that' she's been doing for some years.

Sometimes she'll ask me questions or try to talk to me randomly, like we're in the same room or something, some times I don't hear or honestly I don't want to talk to her because of something she said I'll explain later.

Most of the time she also just asks unnecessary questions and lots of small talk just to try and start a conversation. I'm a bit of an introvert and enjoy being alone and having my privacy at home, plus I'm not asking for a lot I think, I just want to be alone and have privacy in my room. I used to voice-chat with my friends and people in games back then, I also used to do livestreams and talk with viewers and other livestreamers I played with. I really liked doing that but stopped. while I like being alone, she's an extrovert and says she doesn't feel good being alone, so I guess this could be her way of not feeling alone, just listening to me and whatever I was doing so she doesn't feel alone, along with leaving the TV on while she works from home on her laptop or does whatever it is she would be doing so she doesn't feel alone, something I have to hear too, since we can hear anything the other is doing, she sometimes complained about me making noise with my mouse and keyboard...

She has her own room where she used to work and has her own office room next to her room, but refuses to go back to there I don't know why, even though she used to be there all the time before my dad left and she started spending more and more time in the living room, now she spends almost the entire day there, I should also say night since she stays there to watch TV or listen to radio until late.

One time she got mad at me for not replying to her, and I told her I had headphones in because I was playing with friends, (so I can hear them and reply to them in chat) and also don't want to hear her watching TV, and asked her why she even tries to talk to me or ask questions like that, as If we were in the same room. She said and I quote ""I like to hear your voice"" and this might be exaggerated of me but I felt disgusted, and slowly stopped talking to friends and people in voice-chat because of this, I just feel uncomfortable talking while she's hearing and said that she likes to hear me. This reminded me of some times I was voice-chatting with friends or talking with people in games, or whenever I was on the phone and she went from her room to the living room to do whatever she was doing, or became more quiet, like she was trying to hear what I'm talking about to others and my phone calls.

She'll also stare at me (makes sure to always look at people, something good that I don't do) and try to talk to me when I pass her to go to the kitchen/bathroom, I feel uncomfortable with this since I don't like being looked at and I feel uncomfortable with eye contact, makes me feel self-conscious too, but that's something I'm working on overcoming

Quarantine has been absolute hell for me because I'm locked inside with my mom like this. today I was just laying in bed doing nothing and she asks me if everything's ok, I tell her yes and asked her why she asks, she says ""she can't hear me"". It's like she's there trying to hear me or something. I want to talk to her / confront her about it and tell her she shouldn't be trying to hear me in my own room and that's taking away privacy someone would expect to have there, but she'll just ignore me like the other times or/and say I'm being disrespectful. This made me want to make this post to ask people If I'm in the wrong here.

I feel like she ignores what I tell her her and what I think, like other times I tried to talk to her about it. Last christmas we had a family dinner, at a point she started talking about how I had a bad result in a class I was having some trouble with. I asked her to please stop but she didn't care about it, (I have a variety of stories of her disrespecting me, making me look bad to others and putting me in bad situations... and then I end up looking like some angsty teen) I got a bit angry at her since she wasn't stopping and brought up how she ignores what I say and doesn't care about it and how she disrespects me and makes me look bad to others. My sister defended her saying that's just how she is and I need to grow up and deal with it, I think my mom's the one who would need to grow up a bit and that I've been ""dealing with it"" for years now, that I think my mom doesn't respect me and respect would be mutual once she respected me. I feel like my sister just sided with her without caring much to hear me out either and acted like she was there the entire time (she lived with us for some months). My dad thinks I'm disrespectful to my mom but later told me he knows how she acts sometimes and I need to have patience with her, which again I've been having for years, and my grandma agrees with me.

do you think I'm in the wrong in this situation?",20Aug2020,1

So instead of sending an apology I sent them a thank you note and let them know that I’ll be applying for the job. At this point I honestly don’t think that I will be accepted, but I still want to stay in touch with this person because they are experienced in the field that I’m interested in.

659,"To preface, my cat is 16 years old and currently 18.5lbs. 

Cat was always on the heavier side into his adulthood. When he got to 18lbs a year and a half ago, I started him on a strict feeding schedule with food targeted for weight loss, and made sure he got exercise by being active for short intervals throughout the day. I got him down to 15.8lbs and took him to the vet for a check up. The vet said his heart sounds really good, and the weight loss had made him more active. Other than being older and tubby, he was very healthy. About 4 months ago I moved out of my parents house where cat lives. A few days ago I went to visit him and saw he was significantly heavier. I weighed him, he’s approaching 19lbs. I can see when he walks it’s not comfortable for him, so he walks very story distances then lays down, which he never did before. He’s much more complacent then he was just a few months ago. When I was sitting at the table eating, he usually stands on his hind legs with his front paws on my legs to see what I’m munching on. This time he didn’t have the strength to do it. I know for a fact my parents have not been providing the attention and care that I had been when I lived with them, as well as over feeding him. 

My question is, should I take him to my new house to give him the special care he needs to get him healthier and have a good quality of life for the years he has left, or should I leave him at my parents house in the environment he’s known his entire life even though he’d stay fat and inactive? I don’t know how it would effect him to put him in a brand new house that he’s unfamiliar with, if the stress would be too much for him and make things worse.

660,"After doing some more thinking....I really don't think we'd be compatible with each other in the long-term.  

You see, I want a relationship where we're each others best friends. A relationship where we can talk about things that we wouldn't feel comfortable enough to talk about with our other friends. And from what I've gathered, it seems like you don't want to be that kind of bond with me. 

I want somebody whose very romantic. Someone who will leave me a sweet good morning texts. Someone who will give me flowers every once in a while. Someone who will make me feel like I am one of their priorities and not leave me talking to air 65% of the time. Someone who will actually reciprocate my flirtatious behavior and entertain my romantic fantasies at least SOME of the time. 

Look I understand you said  you haven't been very romantic because you're going through stuff and you have low energy. But personally....I think that just shows you need to work on improving your mental health before you commit to somebody else again. 

I am sorry it has to be this way but I can't be in a relationship where the other person is a ghost 65-70% of time or where there's no emotional intimacy or passion. I mean, at this point it feels like you only keep me around for sex. I am NOT saying that was definately your how you view me but that's definitely what it feels like. And what's more is....I can't be with a guy who won't be open with me when I made so much effort to be open with him.

I am sorry. Good luck with everything. I wish you luck in becoming more emotionally healthy and fighting your inner demons.

661,"Ok, so I would really appreciate some advice on my current distance relationship! We met on Tinder in April 2019, but it was while I was on a road trip and just happened to be swiping while driving through his city. We instantly hit it off, but him being from the DC area, and me going to school in NY state and living in CA while not in the school year, we hardly see each other. We talked a lot from April - June and then he completely ghosted me for no reason which was a big hurdle to overcome when we started talking again in August. 

I've never been in a relationship before, and I'm a very independent person, so I've struggled so much with the distance and opening up to someone over the phone from the very beginning. Anyway, we finally met for the first time in October 2019, and it was really fun! We have so much in common. But I struggled to hold on to interest after that, but he still had a plane ticket to come visit in November. I ended things and then quickly picked things up again because I wanted to see him again. I found it extremely hard to develop feelings over the phone, especially when I'm so used to being single. 

During the November visit, he met my friends and hit it off really well with them, which made me so happy. I was so into him then, which carried on for about a month. Then I went home for break, and the 3 hour time difference was so tough for me. I lost interest so quickly, but tried so hard to stay into it. We finally saw each other in January again and I met his family, which was really big for me. We've been going on for a while now, and obviously, quarantine was an obstacle, we saw each other 3 times between March and August. Every time we say goodbye, I go through a vicious cycle of missing him right away, and then slowly losing interest, and even becoming annoyed by him. Every. Single. Time. It's so hard because for the most part, once I get over the annoyance, I have a great time with him. I graduate this December and not sure where life will take me, but we've talked about moving to the same location together, which I know I should give it a try, but the time apart makes me second guess every single one of my feelings.

I feel so guilty because he doesn't have these feelings at all. I feel so much pressure to be as happy as he is in the relationship, but I can't get there. I feel so out of touch with my emotions and so opposite of him in that way. I feel like I'm gonna break his heart so bad, but I also don't know if I can keep living in this constant uncertainty of my emotions. We've talked about it together before, but it never really helps me understand. Am I just not ready for this serious of a distance relationship?

TL;DR I've been in a distance relationship for a year, I only see him about 1 weekend every month and I love our time together, but lose a majority of my feelings when we're apart. We have the potential to end the distance in 2021, but I'm struggling to get excited about that.",20Aug2020,1

Everything was fine until we started blocking and choreographing the more “romantic” scenes. I want to say that this musical is a comedy, so even the most romantic scenes are fairly tame. She gets extremely upset anytime I touch him, and upset at the prospect that I have to kiss him at all. She asked me to try and limit my touching as much as is possible. I never ever touch him or flirt with him when we’re not doing a scene. I try to be a respectful of her feeling as possible while still doing my job. She has been incredibly cold to me since we started having to do our scenes, and last night she cried while we rehearsed.

665,"Hello,

A little backstory:
My mom and me stopped talking after she threw me out of the house at 12 (editing to add that I immediately went to live with my dad, so I always had a place to live). She was very abusive (verbally), however, I was unaware until I left. I really thought my life was normal, that the treatment was normal. 

I’m older now and in my early 20s. I recently reconciled with her and am now taking a role of helping her out with cleaning. She has chronic COPD and still smokes. I don’t really think she’s going to make it much longer. 

I hate to admit it but when I saw her for the first time it scared me. Her teeth are gone and she requires air at all times. She cannot breathe and it’s scary hearing her gasp from simple tasks. 

I’m overwhelmed. This is the first time I’ve seen her in three years and now that I’m here, she’s dying. 

I feel guilty, like I truly ruined my mother. I was all she had and I cut contact off in order to protect myself. She has always had mental illness issues and been poor. So money struggles only made things worse, especially because she never had access to professional help. I just feel like over time I’ve killed her and her life has been so sad. It sounds like a self centered view, but my mother truly had no one consistent but me. 

She still scares me. It scares me to be alone with her now. I can’t explain it, and I don’t think anyone thinks I’m being reasonable when I say I’m scared. I saw her yesterday and she raised her voice at a spam caller. I went into panic mode slightly because that behavior scares me when it comes from her.

This is something that I can feel changing me. I don’t have a choice but I also don’t know if I’m being dramatic. I don’t know how to handle this or really what to think. I don’t want to bother my friends with this so I’ve kept it to myself. I just need another perspective.",20Aug2020,1
666,"Hello, I am a 17 year old male who was born in Germany and is currently living in Bulgaria. I don't go to school nor have I any job.

I always had a problem with going to school and played sick. It started to get really bad when I was in 8th grade and stayed away from school for 1 whole week. No one noticed. So I stayed skipped school again, but this time my father noticed. He spoke with 1 of my teachers and told her I wasn't in school for 1 week without anyone noticing. I just told them I wouldn't do it again and went to school the next few days. When I had the feeling that I could stay home again I did it. For multiple months. Of course my father noticed but he couldn't really do anything. One time he even locked the door so I couldn't run away during the night. I just escaped through the window and spent the night walking the streets. At this point my father knew I had a serious problem and we went to a psychiatrist. I told him that I had problems with the other students and the teacher. And we discussed that I go to another school. All went pretty average, atleast for my situation. But somehow the students in this class had problems with me as well. Some girls confronted me. Apparently I looked at them and I they got uncomfortable. I was confused, but tried to change it. Next day I looked at my table most of the time, but they still told me I was looking at them. I didn't know what to do so I just ignored them. Because I didn't go to school the first half of the year I failed. I repeated that year in another class and even found friends. But I started to skip school again. My teacher noticed but he was a chill guy so there were no real consequences. I passed this year. The next year was pretty much the same. Lots of skipping school but only a few days at a time or just the last 2 hours of the day.

My mother who is bulgarian wanted to go live there since my parents were divided and my sister wanted to go with her. So nothing spoke against her moving there. But then my sister said she didn't want to go anymore. I failed my exams on purpose so there was nothing holding me in Germany. I said that I wanted to come with her and she agreed.

I am in Bulgaria for 1 whole year now and don't have any work education or basic idea what to do. When I first came her I visited a school for a few weeks, but some teachers were complete assholes and I didn't really understand the language and can't speak. So I told my mother I wasn't feeling alright going there. My mother was in Germany at that time because she still worked there. It's stupid and I know, but I couldn't do anything. I stayed home all the time and occasionally she came home for a week or two but went back to Germany for work. Then she had a few strokes and needed medical treatment. That meant I would be alone even more. She will return in a month or so, but honestly that could mean anything. Yesterday she called me and told me I need to decide what I want to do as soon as possible.

This is why I ask you guys. I got no fucking idea what I should do and my time is running out. Should I get psychological treatment? Should I learn the language better and get a job? Should I just move away from this country? I don't know, but perhaps you do.
Anyways, thank you for reading and have a great day.

667,"Hi. I'm 16F, and I've got a few cats plus a rabbit. Today I'll talk about my rabbit.

His name is Luke.

I got Luke back in about 2013 for my birthday, if I recall correctly. Luke's a dwarf rabbit, meaning he's pretty tiny compared to regular rabbits.

Well, over the course of the years, I just feel like I've been failing him.

When I first got him, I was living at my moms which only had our one cat, so I could just put him in a separate room and let Luke run around for about 30 minutes-1 hour. (We were inside)

I did slack though. There's not much excuse to it. I got lazy, tired, busy, and only had enough time to tell him hello and give him resources he needed like water or food. I didn't take him out too much.

We moved back to my dad's, and Luke + my cat came with us. I was still slacking a bit at taking him out, but it got a little better. Unfortunately not too much better though.

It did make it difficult to take Luke out at my dads. He lives on an acreage, so I had the choice of letting Luke go outside or stay inside. I often chose inside because we have lots of cats in the area.

Years pass, the odd check-ins/vet appointments, etc. 
Today he's still alive and kicking at 7-8 years old.

For the past few months, I've noticed/discovered so many things I've been doing wrong. Since I got him, I gave him something called yogurt drops daily. I figured they were fine.

Up until recently, I found out that these treats are awful for him. They can cause bacteria to form in the gastrointestinal tract (?). I immediately stopped giving him them. I tried to make up for treats other ways.

I also didn't realize you were supposed to feed your rabbit vegetables daily. I just gave him some here and there. Not long after the yogurt drops incident, I replaced those treats with veggies.

In the midst of finding out all that, Luke's eye got irrated or something. We went to our regular vet, they gave us eye drops. Nothing. We went to a better vet, they gave us the same thing but ointment. Nothing. A third vet. Nothing. 

We started kinda doing our own thing with it and it went away itself. Kinda cleaning it, checking on it daily, that's about it. Now, it's mostly healed but it's a little grey I think.

Yesterday, I found something on his ear. Looked like he cut it and it got infected. We're calling for another vet today to get it checked out, plus his eye. 

All of this has gone on and I just feel awful.
I've realized my mistakes over the years and now I'm trying to make up for it, by buying him new toys, finding other safe treats/veggies he enjoys, letting him out more.

He gets scared so easy and I imagine it's probably due to my inconsideration.

I know he's coming up to the end of his lifespan soon, (not right away, a few more years left) so I want to make it the most enjoyable for him.

Does anyone know anything I can do to make his life more worth living?",20Aug2020,1

669,"So before I tell the main story I’ll give you all some context. I make Discord servers for random YouTubers occasionally, and this time was no different. The YouTuber created the server, invited me, and I went to work. Long story short, I started appearing in live streams and videos often. This is where things get rocky.


It started off like a regular day, nothing out of the usual. However, I noticed a user that didn’t fill out moderator applications had mod powers. I took them away, but then the YouTuber told me to give it back because it was his friend. I obliged, because I didn’t want anything bad to happen, but then the YouTuber started to complain about how I was so useless and how I was so replaceable. After asking him politely to stop, he just bans me. Over a role. Afterwards, I realize he uploaded a video “exposing” me.


The video had everything you’d think about to antagonize a person. Lies, things taken out of context, etc. Now everyone thinks I’m some entitled douche and I am the worst person alive. I don’t know what to do. I am too small compared to him to fight back, and even though most of the mods I assigned agree that it was unwarranted, they won’t testify because they don’t want to risk losing moderator.

670,"I’m turning 27 this year (M) and with each passing year I felt less of an adult due to the knowledge that there’s more things I don’t know. I thought I was an adult at 14, dear Lord what was I thinking. I’m still single and have worked for several years and have purchased a home and a car, the things adults are supposed to do and have. 

I don’t feel like an adult and I don’t think my mentality progressed much since my teenage days. I’m not proud to say this but I don’t do my own bed, wash my own dishes, peel the skin off my prawn or any household chores for that matter. I did them when I was studying overseas but not since I came back to my home country. (I’m currently staying with my parents as my own place is currently under renovation)

Even when I did those chores while overseas, it never felt like I was doing what an adult should be doing. Although I feel slightly disturbed if someone much older addressed me as a “boy”, I physically don’t look like a boy, I reckon I actually look more mature than my actual age.

I feel mature only when I’m playing with my nephews and nieces and find the stuff they’re talking about utterly redundant. 

Is everyone just faking it till they make it? What is an adult? Is anyone actually one?",20Aug2020,1
671,"Background: me and an acquaintance of mine are preparing for a very big, very important exam coming up. It determines if you'll get a stable job in our field or if you'll have to retake it in, say, 2-3 years, and work with what you get in the meanwhile. I should point out, also, that we are not competing for exactly the same thing, as we are in two different branches of the same field.

We both need to study the same book though, a big thing that is almost 800 pages of very small text. I've been studying since January, because I'm really slow and I got serious concentration issues when it comes to studying: I can't remember anything if I don't take notes and make summaries. It's tiring, frustrating and a very long process.

My acquaintance, despite my many warnings, has started studying at the end of July, and they've been telling me they're pretty overwhelmed by the sheer number of topics treated in the book. I gave them pointers and directions on what topics they should study first and how, I've helped them figure out the best way for them to take notes, and more than once we've studied together. Now they're away on vacation, and I got no clue as to how they're doing. To be fair, they've never asked me to share my notes which, by now, are a pretty accurate summary of the first half of the book.

A part of me thinks that it's their own fault for not beginning to study sooner, and that sharing my notes would be letting them off too easy. Another part of me thinks that everybody makes poor choices, and I should help because I can.

676,"I \[19F\] was recently diagnosed with autism. I've gone my entire life struggling with specifically clothing, food, and sounds because I didn't have the knowledge to handle my sensory issues properly. My mom \[48F\] is a lovely person, but has always nitpicked the issues that I now know are caused by my inability to process certain stimuli. The issue I'm addressing here is my diet.

Let me be frank: my diet sucks. I am extremely sensitive to textures and will barely touch anything green. Fruit will sometimes be an exception, but anything with too much of a skin or is too watery (for example, tomatoes or lettuce) is absolutely out of the question.

Juicing was recommended to me, and I went ahead and bought a machine and started trying out recipes. The current plan is to make my own juice to incorporate these fruits and veggies into my diet in a way I'll enjoy.

My mom has a tendency to go a little over the top with some things. She's always been very focused on my appearance, especially my weight. Every new exercise or diet I've tried, she's intervened and made it way more unpleasant than necessary. I tried out rowing and loved it until she told me that I would need to commit my entire life to it to participate; no intramural teams. I enjoyed the gym until she presented a fully fleshed out schedule without consulting me (five days a week, two hours a day, intense cardio and weight lifting), then insisted on coming with me each day to be sure I was following it. All of this might just be a bit overbearing until you factor in the lecturing and yelling if I deviated from her plans at all. Then it's just... unbearable. 

When she heard I was juicing, you know she was on top of it. Books, special bottles, mounds and mounds of organic produce. It got overwhelming quickly, but I'm trying to stick with it anyway because it's something my doctor recommended. Now she's insisting I try a juice cleanse (the practice of drinking six juices a day and only consuming that and water) because it will ""help me lose weight quicker."" I don't want to lose weight!  I just want to be able to have a healthy, adult diet. 

All of this to say that I don't know how to get her to quit obsessing over my weight while I'm trying to improve my life in steady, reasonable increments like I would prefer. I don't like big, sudden changes, and this is a big, sudden change! Any advice?",20Aug2020,1

680,"Hi, basically I have just graduated from university with a Bachelor of Arts degree in History. I got a Class I (top marks basically) and I’m not sure where to go next. I love history and I am good at it, but I was advised not to pursue a masters in history because it wouldn’t get me a job. Obviously this is something I have to consider due to the current recession. 

I ended up applying to two masters courses - MA Media and Politics and MSc Marketing. Media and politics looks like a very interesting course and it looks like the sort of thing I would enjoy and be good at. Marketing is a more valuable degree to have and would give me new skills as it is very different to my undergraduate degree and is a Master of Science rather than a Master of Arts. 

I have actually already accepted my Marketing offer but haven’t started the course yet and the closer it gets the more anxious I am becoming that I made the wrong decision. I’ve never done marketing before and I’m worried that I won’t like it or be good at it (I’m not entirely sure what to expect in terms of the course content; the descriptions online can only give me so much info) but it is a better degree to have than media and politics. It is £3000 more expensive than the media degree but I would get a £5k scholarship that I wouldn’t get with the media degree. Also, marketing may end up being a very interesting career. I’m not sure what sort of direction the media and politics degree would take me in.

686,"Hey everyone. I have been in a very stable relationship for about 4 years of my life. He, 20M, and I, 19F, are truly best friends and I have so much love for him and his soul. However, he struggles with undiagnosed depression and anxiety (but it’s clear that’s what he suffers from, as I suffer clinically as well) and he has issues communicating his feelings. 

Whenever he is feeling low, he shuts me out completely but when he does speak to me, it’s very blandly and at times can come off to be very rude even if it’s not intended. Sometimes it’s difficult to tell if he’s struggling from a depressive episode, or if I have done something wrong in our relationship and he’s just irritated with me. This, on average, can be 2-3 times monthly for a few days on end. He does the stereotypical “I’m fine” thing whenever I ask what’s wrong, even though it’s clear he’s upset. 

I’m traditionally a fixer, meaning whenever someone is upset I try to help even at the sacrifice of my own mental health, so it really hurts me to see when he’s suffering and I can’t help. He is not a big believer in getting help for his mental state either, as it’s not looked highly upon in his culture AT ALL. The whole “the man has to be strong and have no feelings” kind of thing.

Idk mayb they have a right to be mad, I’m practically just wasting away.

688,"So there's a girl who has been my closest friend for 5 years who I've loved for a large majority of the 5 years though it was never expressed, we've messaged and talked everyday, and that's not really an exaggeration either it's very rare we aren't talking. The reason for this is a combination of she had a girlfriend when we first met and then when they broke up she called me her brother- pfft so basically friend zoned in the best/worst way before I said anything. I was actually okay with this, no complaints because I would still be close to her as her brother which made me happy. 

Fast forward five-ish years and one night a month ago, while drunk I confessed to her, she in turn confessed to me. She sibling zoned me because she was meant to confess but effectively backed out of it out of fear of me rejecting (I'm still making fun of her for it), we got together, so all good there! Very good actually, not much has changed at all and confidant I have indeed found ""the one"".

This probably sounds all well and good but the issue that I need help with is, we both had girlfriends when we confessed. We both broke up with them before getting together but didn't tell them we were together, not at first but we'll get to that. (For the sake of keeping things simple and easy to follow, A: best friend, now gf, B:Her gf before we got together and C: my gf before I got with A last month). All three of us were very close, talking often and playing games and such, and me and B kept playing games and talking after the initial breakup. I felt bad, very bad for not telling her and it felt awkward for me but I didn't let it show and still had fun with her.

After a few days it got to a point where I either made a very good decision or very bad decision. I told B and C that me and A were together, and as I'm sure you can imagine I'm no longer in contact with either of them at all. I feel I may have told them too early as they probably weren't over it but at the same time I would want to know- though that isn't really what this is about but it does bite at me when I think of it as a whole.

I'm looking for advice on trying to be friends with both B and C as I do honestly miss them a great deal, though I wouldn't trade my current relationship with A for anything.

694,"I (27M) have a friend, Tony (27M). We've been friends since kindergarten, but kinda fell out of contact in recent years, and to be brutally honest, I prefer it that way.    
 
See, now that we're apart I feel like he dragged me down a lot growing up. He wasn't the brightest kid, and made a lot of stupid decisions. I was always his partner for group projects, and I always did all the work.  He seemed to do everything in his power to go down the wrong path in life. He would associate with the wrong crowd, and actively tried get into drugs and alcohol at a young age. I was the one who kept him straight. I told him when he was being stupid, and forced him to make better choices.  

Looking back, he was a troubled kid. His home situation was bad. He was kicked out of the house several times as a kid and he stayed with me when he was. In school he was ruthlessly bullied. I did my best to defend him, but a lot of the time he did bring it upon himself. He would do stuff like say creepy, uncomfortable shit to girls that would get him in trouble. I was the only one who would even consider being his friend. It sometimes gave me a bad reputation to be associated with him, but I always stuck by his side. Because of that, he was always really loyal to me. He would do anything for me. I knew if I was ever in trouble, he would drop everything to be there for me.       
     
There is no way he would have graduated highschool without me, but he did. I went off to university after we graduated, but we stayed in contact. He was kicked out again around this time, and was homeless on the street for a while. Not long after, he got a girl pregnant. They ended up having 2 kids together. I gave them money when I could, but as a poor student I didn't have much. They lived in absolute poverty in shitty apartments and on the street. Police and social workers were constantly checking up on them and threatening to take their kids. His girlfriend was addicted to some pretty hard drugs, and I'm pretty sure he was too.  I made up a lot of excuses to not see him, because it just became too depressing. I felt really guilty about it at the time, and I still do.   
    
I haven't seen him or really been in any kind of direct contact with him for a few years now, but we message every once in a while to catch up. Since I last saw him, his girlfriend was arrested and he got sole custody of the kids, and now he has a new girlfriend who seems a lot nicer, and they have a child of their own. It seems that nowadays he's really turned his life around. He has a steady job now and a place to live, and he just bought a car.    
  
He messaged me now, asking to hang out soon, but I really don't want to. My life has been better without him in it. I feel really bad saying that, because I was his best friend, and he's always felt a strong loyalty to me. I know that to this day he sees me as one of the best things in his life, and now that he's starting to turn his life around he wants me to be in it again. I don't want to though, and I don't want to always feel guilty about it either.    
  
I wouldn't mind messaging every once in a while to catch up, or even playing some online games together, but I don't want to hang out. I don't want to meet his girlfriend and kids. I feel like if I did, I would feel guilty and I would feel responsible to help him out like I've always done.   
What do I say to him? I feel like if I was brutally honest, it would crush him.

695,"This is going to read a bit like a rant. Think of it as me asking advice on how to escape these ways of thinking that I know are toxic, but just can't be rid of.

Whenever I get horny I think about sex, and then I think about womankind withholding sex from me. Momentarily I deeply hate women, for not choosing me for sex, and for the ease to which sex comes to them. Every time I read a story about rape or abuse I think, ""Good, if I can't have sex why should she be happy."" I wasn't always like this, I actually have always been a liberal feminist. I only became like this when the girl I thought was the one left me and I realized how impossible sex would be for me to acquire. And now I think I would rather be a rapist than a virgin. To me the increased violence that befalls them is the price womankind should pay for being the gatekeepers of something men need so desperately. Then when I masturbate these feelings fade. I've been trying to masturbate less to quell these feelings, but when I don't masturbate the hate just gets worst. I want to make womankind feel as miserable as they've made me feel.

It's strange that I hate women so much, yet simultaneously desire them so badly. I don't think of woman any different than men, but the only damn different is woman are gatekeeping sex. And I need sex, I think a man's life is not worth living without sex. I have been saving up for an escort, but at the rate of my allowance it will take me 2 1/2 months to save up enough for a good one. I don't know how I can keep going for that long, and after that, I don't want to wait for months between every time I have sex.

I hate myself for being a virgin, and I don't know why I have been cursed as so. I have done literally everything imaginable to make myself worthy of sex. And the fact that I'm still a virgin makes me want to kill myself (dw, I'm too much of a coward to kill myself). I feel like all the self- improvement was a waste of time if I can't have sex, and since there's nothing else I can do to attain it I might as well kill myself. I hate all my fucking hobbies, to me their all just useless distractions. I became a great musician and an incredibly intelligent student because I thought those would make me worthy of sex in women's eyes, but since they didn't it seems like they were just wastes of time.

In a heartbeat I would trade all my hobbies and even every aspect of my personality for sex. And why not. To me sex is god. Sex is the ultimate achievement, sex is the greatest bliss imaginable. To me sex is the meaning of life, and not having sex is as good as being dead. You're not a real man unless you've had sex.

I've already done everything imaginable you would recommend to an incel: hygiene, grooming, hobbies, exercise, even religion. None of it was worth it. To me life without sex just isn't worth living.",20Aug2020,1

My first semester of college i passed out at my friends party and they walked me up and i slept in his bed. I remember snippets of what happened after but I remember not being able to talk and a girl coming in and getting on top of me. Long story short it wasn’t consensual, but i havent told anyone because of the stigma around men being taking advantage of. I also just didnt want to be known as a victim i guess.

702,"Hi Reddit, I have nowhere else to ask this and this is my last resort, I just need advice or a viewpoint because I don't know what to think or do. It's gotten so bad. 

My (20 f) uncle (in his 50s) is a very violent and deranged man, he abuses animals and people, this man NEEDS to be institutionalised. I don't think we have any proof to get him put in jail or anything but me and my family are fearing for our lives.

My grandpa passed away in March and my family lived with him and my grandma (now widowed), my grandparents were gambling addicts and they passed that on to their children - my Uncle, Dad and Aunt - it's all really messed up but to make this as short as possible, this entire family has generational, systemic abuse - my dad (recovering alcoholic) and aunt (has 2 very small children) are settled down and more pacifistic, but my Uncle got worse now that he has nothing to lose (he chased his own family out, my mom told my he used to fire a gun into the ceiling when he and his wife would fight), he sold everything he and his wife and kids had to gamble with. 

Before my grandpa died, he borrowed money from people claiming that he has stakes in this house when my grandpa dies (the roof over me and my parents and siblings heads), which we found out from someone who wanted their money repaid. To be honest, I feel like my Uncle is fully capable of murder and that's why my parents are so scared, this man cannot be reasoned with. 

My mom told me they might sell the house in January (just to get the Uncle off our backs), so 
I told my mom to take out a restraining order against him and a few days later my mom told me that my aunt and dad and grandma are gonna do that. 

But a week or so later, I hear my parents talking about selling the house again. My mom told me that my grandpa left the house under my dad's name, but I think the intimidation from my Uncle must be unimaginable for my parents to be considering selling our house. 

My dad doesn't work, he has no skills, our only source of income is this house because we run a homestay. This feels so unfair - I know he won't stop even when this house is sold. He didn't care about his own children, of course he doesn't care about any of us having no roof over our head. This man is a danger to my family and my young cousins who are both under 10 years old - My aunt told my parents that my uncle said to her ""I'll be the one who has to look after your children."", it was malicious and my aunt feels like he was insinuating that she and her husband would be out of the picture from their kids lives.  

Please help, please just comment any suggestions or thoughts on what I should do or tell my parents, should I ask this in the Legaladvice subreddit? I have exams next week and I can't afford to be stressed about this but I am. :(",20Aug2020,1

710,"This may seem like prank, maybe even funny, but perhaps this is what the sender wants outsiders to assume to isolate me. Someone has been sending McDonald's orders to my apartment door three times now. This is concerning because I NEVER made those orders, there is no intel I could gather about who is sending it. Orders are already paid and there are no unauthorized charges to any of my financial accounts. 

The first two deliveries were through UberEats. A few cookies the first, a dozen the second. 

On the third delivery there is no UberEats receipt on the bag. Order contents: One McFrappe and two sausage muffins. I was able to stop the delivery guy. The only info he could tell me was that he is from UberEats, which franchise it came from which is very close by, the order number, and that it was not a mistake, the order is sent to my apt number. I can't remember the last time I ate at McDonald's. 

The message is clear to me. ""I know where you live and I am watching."" This person is trying to scare, provoke or hurt my feelings? (You're fat.). Or this potential stalker wants to make their anonymous presence known to me. There is this creepy neighbor that I can't seem to shake loose that makes my skin crawl everytime I see him. Whenever I leave or enter my apt, he seems to magically be there too. Since the covid-19 shutdowns, my habits are not routine so that creeps me out even more he is just always bumping into me at unassuming times. There is no pleasantries exchanges. Just non-verbal communication for his request for me to acknowledge his very unnerving presence. If you are a woman, you will understand this feeling. 

My downstairs neighbor is an old bitter lady who is extremely sensitive to normal living noises and tried to file complaints against me. We have paper thin floors. I swear I am as considerate as we can be with noise level. Everytime she texts me to complain, there are always backhanded compliments and subtle insults. I don't even have guests over which, makes me an easy target if they recognize I seem alone. It's just me and my elementary age kid. So it could be her. 

It could be my best friend I've ghosted after I learned she is only my friend when I'm down on myself and uses me for emotional support and punching bag. When she senses I am doing better (which I never feel this way only wanting to share victories no matter how small) she will try to play it down and insult me. Whenever she gifts me for birthdays and holidays, it is always something I hate that I'm sure I've made vocal to her several times before she gifted me these things. I.e. I hate practical gifts on birthdays. It's like shunning women to stay in your place, the kitchen. She gifted me a cookbook on my birthday. So she could be sending the McDonalds to try and psychologically hurt me by saying here's your MD's at 8am in the morning, fatties. (Which again, I hardly consume fast food). 

I could go in circles all day but we should know all too well that life-threatening problems arises when the receivers shrugs off the beginning signs and people ignored them because individual isolated incidents seem harmless. I want to take action before something bad happens. I am the only important figure in my son's life and I need to be there for a long time coming. I haven't been able to sleep well the past few weeks. 

I attempted to call the McDonald's the order came from and received no help. As most orders are encrypted and don't store customer personal info such as phone number order was made from or name of person. That is absolute BS. 

I am attempting to contact UberEats but they are not making it easy to get a real person on the phone. I am awaiting an email response. 

I will be filing a police report. 

Before the internet, tracing unwanted deliveries were easy as they were attached to a phone number and it could be blacklisted. I don't know what else to do. I am genuinely shaken and trying to not appear to be as that may be what they want. My feelings aren't hurt, but rather I'm disturbed someone is going through such lengths to try to hurt me and waste their life watching me. 

What else can I do? How can I send a message to this person I'm not one to be reckoned with?

712," 

To cut the story short, I'm (19/m) closeted gay, met a guy (22/m) on reddit in March and we're in a relationship. I just want to point out that my guy is from Philippines and my mom is also from there...so I'm half filipino.

I know some people may say I'm too young to be in a LDR or relationship but I can't afford to have a local relationship because my parents are very homophobic and my mom is restrictive to the point where I can't visit friends even before the pandemic. My mom says this mantra,""Don't be gay"".

Anyways, at some point my guy told me he'd loves me later on. One time we got into a fight, he told me ""I love you and I'm willing to be that one idiot who will be a martyr for you"". The reason why we got into a fight in the first place was because I kept asking whether he'll find someone that will make him happier then I do and I've kept saying negative stuff. Which I can agree is my fault. In regards to that, my guy told me ""yes, their are others who like him (my guy) such as his friends but theirs happiness only certain people can give and thats from me"" I tried to imagine my life without him and I didn't like it. He even told me he carved my name on a tree. I mean, I keep having the feeling that if I leave him, it wouldn't be the same. I feel wrong to date someone else. I would feel jealous if he met someone else. He even texted my best friend (I'd introduce him to my bestfriend and met his virtually) that he loves me and that he was talking a lot about my self growth to her. He told me, he would be respectful with my decision if I left him but he'll be very hurt though. Tbh, I love him and I really want him in my life.

This is the part that worries me. I'd finish college as its was only 2 semesters but it was a course that my dad wanted me to take into a career (electrician) I wasn't sure about. But not only that, but my dad wants us to move to his country, Trinidad (which is somewhat of a homophobic country) in 1-2 years. My relatives their are very very homophobic. With that said, if I were to move to there, I'd be hard for me to do things towards my relationship (and even have a local relationship) as I'd be around my parents. This also worries me a lot, my mom doesn't want me to move out as shes very against that idea. She wants me to be with them (my parents) for my whole life...Yes, I love my parents more then anything but they're very homophobic.

So yes, having an online long distance relationship is a lot more easier for me then having a virtual one. And to look at the positive side of my relationship, I've been to Philippines before, am very familiar with the culture, learning the language as I already can understand, and my family is going to be going to Philippines again. The only thing is that my guy isn't from the same part of Phil as my family but that isn't a big issue.

I also know my guy is broke so I won't be meeting him for 2-4 years as he's still in uni. This won't make a big difference for me as I don't have the independence to travel solo...at least for now. I have a part time job though and my dad drops me to work and picks me up.

One last concern is my mom snooped my phone (I don't have a lock on my phone) and founded out about my guy as she saw the heart emojis and the phrase ""my prince"" lol. She keeps bugging me whether I talk to him still which I deny no. She doesn't even trust me on my phone or laptop...Sometimes she spies on me or constantly ask who I'm talking too. Its so annoying. I'd recently started saying the guy is my classmate to twist the situation a bit. Anyways, I started hiding apps.

Anyways, my guy knows about all of this. And he tries to comfort me. I have to mention this guy also kinda save me from my suicidal thoughts.

I really want him and he really wants me. I've put this on this subreddit because when I put this on a Lgbt subreddit, some people say I've only have a pen pal, while some people are supportive.

How can I approach this? Thank you for your advice :)",20Aug2020,1

715,"TLDR at the bottom. (Sorry this is so long)

For context I am a 15 year old girl with divorced parents. My parents divorced when I was 2 1/2 so I don’t remember any of it. The divorce doesn’t both me in the slightest. The issue is my stepdad. 

I am at my mothers house the majority of the time, and she has remarried. It has been a few years, but ever since this guy moved in I have disliked living with him severely.

Don’t get me wrong, he is a nice guy in the surface. Very nice to most people. A lot of people that he meets seem to like him. And I can see why, he’s just nice to them, it’s as simple as that. He tends to be nice to me to a lot of the time. And he’s always nice to my mother, she’s the one person he never messes with. 

But there are just things about him that make living with him terrible. He is loud &amp; obnoxious, dirty, says some very harmful things about people (including family, and usually behind their backs), most of his humor consists of belittling, humiliating, and simply making fun of other people (including me), he often doesn’t do much housework (although he does do some) and is quite frankly SO emotional it makes it difficult to deal with him while talking about ANYTHING that requires a debate or two-sided argument (if you disagree with him, or course). Oh, and also his lifestyle is very unhealthy, which is his choice of course but it rubbed off on my mom in a terrible way. It also makes it a bit difficult to get ahold of healthy food, he has even criticized me for eating healthy and exercising before. 

Nowadays I really can’t stop myself from hating living with him. I know hate is a strong word but that is precisely why I am using it. I also have to constantly remind myself that he himself is fine, I guess, it’s just the living-in-the-same-house part that I hate. Because he is nice, especially to people he doesn’t live with and my mother. Also, she would like it better if I didn’t despise him so I try to stay positive. 

I don’t hold grudges, I keep a positive mindset, I ignore him when necessary, I take care or myself and walk away when necessary. So I am doing alright right now, but it’s still not an ideal situation. So I was just wondering if anybody has any tips that could help?

Note: I have tried talking to him. So has my mother on my behalf and for her own reasons. And he has improved some, the jokes have lessened some (mostly in quantity, but a bit in intensity), he stopped smoking inside, he gets less drunk, he now only plays music loudly till 11-12 rather than 1 (except on weekends), and he has actually started accepting requests from me that he lessen the volume when it is extremely loud rather than ignoring them like he used to. 

TLDR: I am a 15 year old girl and I hate living with my stepdad, he himself is alright but he has qualities that make living with him hell. Both my and my mother have tried talking to him, but he only listens so much and I mostly avoid him these days. Do you guys have any tips/advice that could help the situation?

Thank you for reading and any advice. It all is greatly appreciated :) (also if you think I am just being over dramatic or an asshole than you are welcome to tell me, because if that were true a wake-up-call would be necessary)",20Aug2020,1
716,"I'm at a loss of what to do. It's really driving me crazy. I found out she was cheating when I opened her telegram to find flirty messages with another guy. I confronted her about it and tomorrow we're meeting to set things straight.

718,"Is my mom mentally ill or does she just hate me?  I will do everything I need to do.  I keep my room clean, I bring in good grades, I even give her money.  She always wants more from me though.  She constantly wants me to be buying her stuff and giving her money.  She's always sided with my younger sister, ALWAYS.  What caused me to write this is because I’ve had enough of this abuse throughout the years.  They think it's discipline but hitting your children for the smallest things whatsoever is not discipline, shouting and screaming at them that they are the reason your life is terrible is not discipline.  Being the oldest child is tough, shit its hell.  You have so much pressure to be perfect but you're also the guinea pig for your parents.  You have younger siblings who are basically your children.  You are called ungrateful for them providing the basic needs.  You will complain about something to your parents and they will hit you.  When your parents have 3 girls and one boy and you're the oldest you're the one who gets all the blame.  For example, my younger brother he's very young, I love him dearly.  He is only 4 and he doesn't understand the world very well yet.  He brought in our moms phone for me to charge, which I did, but he somehow got confused and thought I wasn't.  He started crying and left crying, he said I hit him.  My dad comes in with an arrow, the ones you use to hunt animals with and hit me with it, without asking what the deal was.  Imagine having one small understanding with your parents and they're automatically throwing out all of your clothes and destroying it.  Or disagreeing with your siblings, like everybody does and your parents hit you because of it.  Imagine going to college and coming home to your mom already arguing with you.  IMAGINE paying for college out of your pocket and they want to charge you for living in their home and want you to pay their bills.  I’m only 17. I can't do much, I try to work, I go to school, I try to be a good daughter, I try.  I love them but I’ve had enough and I don't know how to get out anymore.  I have no vehicle, I have nothing that is mine, I have no idea how the world actually works, I’m not even old enough to do much anyways.  What happened around 5 minutes ago was I was watching a lecture, my mom was screaming at me again and I decided to ignore her, but if I would have entertained the idea of arguing back it would have gone worse.  She's shouting and saying I don't do anything in this house, when I did all my chores.  In fact what started this was me telling her my younger sister who will be 16 soon, hasn't cleaned the restroom and just has a mess going on there.  She got mad at me for that, when I was just telling her to tell her to please get it done.  Well I’m sitting on my bed watching my lecture.  She's still shouting at me nonsense and starting to shake.  I know if I entertain her it's gonna go bad for me.  I'm watching the lecture and she jumps on me and starts hitting me. Telling me everything is my fault.  Shes told me that she hates me, that I’m the worst things that's happened in her life and to get out of her house.

I understand that things take practice and I know trial and error is the best teacher, but it’s impossible for me to envision any sort of success from my actions.

I deem myself garbage at an activity before I even get a chance to see improvement. I get appraisal but yet it feels like pure emptiness. I don’t believe anyone, not even those closest to me even though they say I’m talented or good at the things I enjoy. 

It feels like a wall that I can’t climb to see the happiness in my hobbies no matter how much I’ve improved upon those things.

An emptiness that makes me feel like I’ll forever be a person without skills or redeeming qualities.

So some background story, this colleague of mine has become our team's scrummaster. Basically what it means is that she is going to do her normal job but as the same time, she is task to communicate between teams and make sure we have everything we need to finish our planned work on time.

Lately she has been ask for update like ""what i'm working on"" or ""how is my work progress' every day at least once and she is not even my boss. In fact my boss rarely ask these kind of questions. And we also have daily meeting in the morning about our work so there is really no point to ask me again during the day.

I'm actually the type of person who always reach out if I need anything or if I feel like we are behind etc. For example, last week, around 3pm, I gave her an udpate about a problem and told her i'm wating for another team to finish before I can start and I even said in the message if I have any update, i'll let her know. Then 4:30pm, she called me asked if there is any update...

Then yesterday morning, I said to her that I'm working on task X today around 8, then at 10, she asked me how is going with task Y which I'm not even working on.

Same thing today, 10AM we had a call then 1PM she asked for an update again.

I paint my sons toenails. I have mine painted all the time and he asked one day for me to do his, so we have been ever since. He picks the color, which is usually based off his weekly new favorite super hero and he loves it. It’s never been an issue until recently. My ex lives with his mother for the time being (mostly to help out with his sick dad), he called me the other day and said his mom was kicking him out because she “can’t support this type of lifestyle” meaning him not going to church and not taking our son to Sunday school, him dating different women. She can’t support it so he needs to find a place and leave. She told him that we were turning our son gay because we paint his nails. My son came home earlier this week and had his finger nails painted a light glittery green color. He said his older cousin did it. I don’t care, i don’t have an issue with it, his dad doesn’t care, our son is 3.5. He’s having fun. I guess after he got his nails painted his asked his aunt if he “is a boy or a girl”. Which he has never ever asked me before. My son has been wanting an Elsa dress, he told my mom this morning “i want an Elsa dress, but don’t worry I’ll still be a boy”. 

I’m upset. Nobody is pushing the issue of him “being a boy” besides my ex MIL and her family. My ex husband just told me that his family and himself was made to think that i was the one who painted his fingernails, like I’m stirring the pot or something. I want to hold my tongue and let my ex husband deal with this, but it’s getting difficult for me to not reach out to her and tell her to mind her own business on how I’m raising my child. She is the only one who minds his toenails being painted, she is the only one who minds him wanting to play dress up with an elsa costume, she is the only one worried about him “being a boy”. These concerns have never crossed my sons mind until recently. My ex husband has told her she doesn’t have a say in how our child is raised and that she’s the only one worried about his toenails. He doesn’t care what our son does, this is just a her (and possibly ex’s sisters) issue. 

I’m not sure what do to, or even what i would say if i reached out to her. She’s a nice woman who has helped me and listened to me a lot, even during our marriage she helped us a lot. But this is starting to upset me.",20Aug2020,1

The thing is since last year I  have had a lack of self-confidence because I met my GF and that has really put me off. Today I tried to take an online IQ-Test and then got the results of 97 which is under average althought I always thought to be kind of creative and intelligent since I have good grades in math and physics and can easily get better grades at programming without learning than some of the smartest kids in my class.

For 12+ years I had to busy myself with a different habit/profession. Now that I’m older and have more control towards my actions I certainly want to go back. Dusting my illustrating skills and storyboard has certainly been more challenging. Especially with so much more illustrators popular/known, I feel a bit discouraged. I also have the fear of might copying someone’s idea accidentally as I have followed tons of illustrators for a while now. 

I’m already too late in the game, and learning it professionally may cost some money that I might not be willing to spend. I’ve already established a style when I was younger but that style now seems mainstream now and again I don’t want to copy.

736,"Hi all,

This is my first time coming to Reddit for advice so I am not entirely sure if this is the right area but here I go:

Back in the winter, I started working as a nanny for a family I know. The pay was never discussed, but after time I noticed I was only getting paid $8 an hour. I was surprised by this as prior to this family I had always been paid a minimum of $10 an hour as a sitter. From research (online and asking around) the average a nanny makes in my city is $14 an hour.

As time has gone one, the pay has stayed the same, even when the family allows their young niece to stay over (adding another kid for me to watch). This doesn't happen often, but when it does it makes me realize how underpaid I am. Before, the money was okay as I am still able to live at home while I attend University. However, I have had many health issues this summer and have quite a few medical bills that I need to pay.

In summary, I want to bring up getting paid more but I do not know how without feeling guilty. The family and I are close friends (and I know they are trying to save their money to be able to have another kid). But at the same time, I know my time is worth more than that, and I have other job offers.

It just feels like such a big, insurmountable thing.

I'm pretty sure I have anxiety, specifically with intrusive thoughts esp. about death and really upsetting situations, and anxiety attacks every so often. I think it's what would be described as ""high functioning"" - it doesn't really visibly impact my life but does affect my thought processes, work stress, stress in general, and to a degree social relationships.

754,"I am a 55 year old man in a relationship with a 38 year old woman. We have been together almost ten years and work together as well in a business that I own. Yesterday we had a rare day off together, and I was looking forward to a relaxing afternoon with her, but she made it a very difficult day to enjoy because she started off the morning by making a comment that hurt my feelings. She said that when we have sex, it doesn't last long enough for her liking. This comment seemed to come out of nowhere, while we were just enjoying our coffee in the kitchen.

As a significantly older man who suffers from mild ED, this criticism immediately brought up feelings of inadequacy and concern that our relationship will not ultimately work out because I can't satisfy her sexually. I admit that I don't last long during intercourse; she usually gives me a few minutes of oral sex beforehand (she doesn't care for receiving oral sex, so that's off the table for us), and then we have sex for a minute or two before I finish. I am not able to last much longer than that, even with medication.

I am sensitive to the fact that my condition affects her life; that's why I bought her a custom-made, very expensive dildo for her to use, which we designed together online when we ordered. It should meet her personal requirements and preferences, since she had a hand in creating it. If not, I am happy to buy her another one.

However, this toy was something I had hoped she'd use on her own when she wanted or needed to, but she wants to introduce it into our sex life, and I am not comfortable with that. Seeing the dildo is a visual reminder of my inadequacy and age, and all my desire to have sex with her goes away instantly. She also suggested I use my hands, but here's the problem:

If I use my hands to pleasure her before we have sex, I become bored and lose my erection before we are able to have intercourse. If I attempt to pleasure her after I finish, all my desire is gone, and I become even more bored. It's hard for me to continue doing what I'm doing when what I'd much rather do is fall asleep, cuddle her, or just go about our day. To me, the best solution if she desires more time to finish after I have, is for her to use the dildo on her own. She doesn't agree and wants to involve me somehow in her climax, but she doesn't seem to understand that what she's asking for will diminish my self esteem and sense of security in our relationship.

I don't know what the solution is; I do plan to look into adjusting my ED medication, but there are side effects like high blood pressure that have caused major problems for me, so it's hard to increase the dosage. I am working on losing weight so maybe the blood pressure will improve, but in the meantime, how do I respectfully let her know that I'm not comfortable with the sexual activities she is suggesting, though I do understand her frustration?

I also really want to her to understand that I'm frustrated too, though perhaps for different reasons.

I also am hoping that someone might suggest alternative solutions to our dilemma that we haven't thought of.

tl;dr: How do I let my girlfriend know I am uncomfortable with using a dildo in our sex life without making her upset; also, what other alternatives might I present to her that I haven't thought of?",20Aug2020,1

She didnt want me hanging out with other girls alone, including my friend who had feelings for me, which I understand but it really set me off that she wont spend time with me but also controls who I do.
The friend was understanding, but I started to develop some type of feelings for her, we were really close and maybe I just was missing the friendship, and the fact that she actually wanted to be around me.
I know having crushes is normal in a relationship but this hasbt ever really happened to me before so amongst all the feelings and arguing I decided it was unfair so I told her Ioved her but I couldnt handle a relationship right now and discussed the communication issues and other things Ive tried to address, It was sort if mutual I think.

Anyways, after the break up I foolishly hooked up with my friend and admitted I kinda liked her too soon and idk it felt wrong so I stopped. I couldnt give her something serious which I was honest about but I still felt bad because of her feelings and such.

765,"I know that hurting animals as a child is a sign of someone growing up to be a sociopath, but I know for certain that I have at least some empathy based on the way I react to people getting hurt, people being sad, people vomiting, etc. I don't seem to act like a sociopath in ways of like manipulating others and feigning my emotions.

What I mean by ""hurt small animals"" is that me and my brother used to (when I was like 6/7, I think, and he is around a year younger than me)  sort of play with/sort of basically torture some animals like frogs, catarpillars, and one time with a turtle. I feel really bad even awknowledging it, and it makes me sad that I did that and to type it out. I strongly avoid hurting animals/other people on purpose except like killing bugs in my house.

768,"Hello reddit, I’ve been holding off on making this post for over three years because I always convince myself that there is nothing wrong. 

Ever since I graduated in 2013 my life has been a mess. I don’t have friends, my hobbies no longer bring me joy, and I’ve lost all purpose in my life. With the new Covid situation I’ve been left out of my work as a preschool teacher and have no one to talk to. My health both mentally and physically has been declining and I feel like I’m about to break. 

I’m [25M] and everyone tells me I’m still young and have my whole life ahead of me. It doesn’t feel that way. At this rate I feel like I’m on track to being a failure and not being able live my life. I can’t see myself getting married or having a happy future and it eats at me everyday. I don’t know what to do anymore and time isn’t waiting around for me. I feel like the only thing I can do at this point is just ghost my family and girlfriend and run away. 

I hate the idea of running away but I’ve overworked myself for so long I don’t know what else to do. I feel like my best isn’t ever enough. I don’t know where to start and I’m tired of being broke, unhealthy and miserable. 

Sorry if this is rambling but any advice is appreciated greatly ♥️

769,"I am just now realizing how loose I am on what I let myself tolerate. Because I let someone who wasn’t a LG work at my pool and I subconsciously knew it but didn’t have the capacity to get myself to tell him to scram. I did try to  get him to leave because I told him I could get fired for having him on the stand at any point in time. He doesn’t go on the stand for a few hours but when I go to clean the kiddie pool (super shallow pool) he switches off with another LG. So I come back, and I see he’s in it and I am annoyed, but I can’t think of how to tell him to get out of the chair without feeling awkward to myself for doing it. So I let him sit, I was somewhat okay inside because the health inspector came the day before and we had no problems, but he wasn’t in the chair at all that day. But by my luck my SUP comes in and I remember that he is in the chair and I quickly shoo him away. However that was not in time because the SUP saw me do that. However she was very forgiving about it because she hasn’t really had any other problems with me or any of the other two lifeguards besides forgetting chems and shit. But thinking back on it I am kinda pissed at myself for letting that happen. I know it’s kind of hard to ask how to teach myself to stick my foot in the sand and be more confident in those cases.

Anyways, is there any sort of mindset that I actually need or do I just need to rethink how I am doing certain things. Because I know that it’s dumb to put my in the moment feelings over my job. It is my first actual job and I don’t want to lose it in a stupid way.",20Aug2020,1
770,"So this is gonna be a bit of a long post. I’ve never talked about a majority of my problems out of embarrassment but I figured why not ask random people on the good ol’ internet haha. 
Anyway I’ll start off by saying I’ve been depressed and suicidal for most of my life. Ever since I can remember I’ve had an active death wish. It is what it is. I have terrible social anxiety so I have real trouble making friends and forming relationships. My one wish in life has been to have a friend to talk to because I’ve always felt so alone. I never went to a therapist or anything because of embarrassment so I bottled up a lot of emotions. In high school I started meeting people because I was doing musicals and stuff outside of school. I managed to get into my first real relationship and I definitely fell hard. Skip ahead, my insecurities and the burden I placed on my partner end the relationship. I quickly get into another relationship and shortly after I start cheating on her with my ex. I had tons of insecurities and I was constantly being suspicious of her even though I was the one cheating. I never took into account her feelings. I would always put myself in the position of a victim. I never had anyone. I just wanted ppl who cared about me around me. A bunch of bullshit excuses to make me not care about cheating on my gf with multiple people. I became known as a cheater and asshole further alienating me from people at my school. I lied through hoops to keep this going for two years until we broke up. Now I’m in college and after a suicide attempt resulting in hospitalization I was treated and began to take responsibility for my actions. I realized how manipulative I was and the burden I placed on the people around me. I played the victim all the time. I’ve tried to get back in the dating game but it always ends up falling apart either because my past comes to haunt me or I just have bad luck. Also been a bit of an asshole in my whole healing process, learning to actually be a normal human being. I’ve also chalked it up to karma coming back to bite me in the ass. I had a girl I was talking to mess around on me so that’s definitely tasting some of my own medicine. It’s been about a year that I’ve been trying to become better and I think it’s working. I don’t want to be a victim anymore. Or make people feel sorry for me. I’m done with it and never wanna cheat again. However recently with the pandemic and everything I’ve stopped going to therapy and taking my medication because of its side effects. I’ve fallen into a deep depression again because of how alone I am again and want to die every day again. I still want to be a good person desperately, however when I used to be alone and sad I took comfort in the fact I was a good person at least. Now my guilt says otherwise and I’m haunted by the things I’ve done and the views people have of me now. I just want to do good. I know I probably deserve it but I don’t want to be alone anymore. I want to be romantically involved with someone again but I literally don’t know how when I’m sitting at home all day. My insecurities are creeping back in. I work out heavily to try and stave it off but I constantly nit pick at myself in the mirror. I hate who I was but I still want to go back because I hate being alone. I’ve begun missing my ex again and it’s so pathetic because it’s been like a year since we’ve spoke. I don’t want anyone to feel sorry for me I just don’t know what to do. Where to go. Do I deserve to be unhappy? I’ve been unhappy for quite some time but maybe that wasn’t enough. I just want to move on but I can’t because everyday I’m alone with my thoughts. I have distractions but I’m always brought back to my past. Anyways apologies for the long post. If you read this all the way through you are absolutely an amazing person and I hope you have a happy amazing life. I just don’t know what to do so any advice would be appreciated.

771,"Hi! Where do I even begin with this. I don't even know if this is the right place to say it. I just need advice. I have no one. 

Since I was a child, my parents would fight a lot. Over the years I saw my dad transforming into a monster. 

All the fights would start from my dad. He always believed that my mom was cheating on him. Which is totally a lie. For the longest time my mom would be at home because of her health state. She was always weak and never able to do much, let along cheating. My dad won't even allow her to leave the house for the longest time. Since she got a job a few years ago because we were struggling with money cus I got into University, it became worst. I have no doubts that the cheating situation is just in his head. It's not real.

That would be the main reason. 
Usually their fights would've lasted for 2-3 days in the past. But lately its's weeks. Now, even months. 
At the beginning it would be non-stop screaming for hours. Now he is physically hurting us.

The only reason he is like that to me too, it's because I am defending my mom. I don't want to see her getting hurt. She is very fragile and just seeing her cry breaks my heart. 

My mom is a very loving person. She doesn't deserve all of this.

Since e year ago if I remember correctly, it got worse.

They started arguing again about a month ago. Since then, the house is a mess. There are things thrown all over the place. Me and my mom are able to eat only when dad is at work. We can't leave my room (she is staying in my room since then) otherwise he will come at us and get violent. When he is at work, me and my mom are cleaning the house. When my mom goes at work too, I can make my homeworks. 
My dad comes back home first, of course, already drunk (he works from 8am to 5pm). I have then to wait for my mom to come home (she works from 2pm to 11pm). My dad usually locks the door so my mom cannot enter the house at night when she comes back from work.
So I have to silently get out of my room and unlock the door so she can come in every night. My dad is drunk asleep so he won't hear me. But I am very affraid everytime. 

In the end he would wake up and come to my room and scream again, throw things and physically hurt us. 
We don't get much sleep at night because of that. 
Also we can't lock the door. He would break it. 
In the weekends when my parents are not working, me and mom don't get to eat much because we are affraid to leave my room. He would come in all the time to yell and hurt us anyway. 

Things are getting even more scarier because lately he's threatening to kill us. Me and mom started to hide the knifes around the house and potential weapons. 
He would always say things like ""You have 1 more hour to live before I kill you both. Enjoy it while you can"". And usually he leaves the house after that to go to drink more. In the meanwhile we are affraid he would come back to kill us. We are just staying silent and we're waiting for the sound of the front door opening. 

We are basically waiting for our own potential death. Me and my mom are weak. My dad is a strong tall man. He could kill us with bare hands.

I'm just tired. I am 20, and I am going to University. My health condition it's not very good either. I have asthma since I was little. Because of that, when he gets violent or things are too scary for me, I have panic attacks that triggers my asthma and I pass out most of the time. All I can think of in those moments is ""What is my dad going to do while I am pass out? Am I going to wake up to my mom being murdered by him?"". 
Those kind of thoughts have been in my mind since a child. Because of that, I never was able to be truly happy, and in school I had troubles communicating with others and got bullied a lot. 

My mom doesn't have any siblings. She was an only child just like me. Her parents left this world a long time ago when I was a child. She wasn't allowed by my dad to have friends so she doesn't have any friend that we can count on to run at theirs and stay for a while. Neither do I. I wasn't allow by my dad.

I just don't know what to do anymore... . I can't eat properly, I can't study properly, I can have friends... . 

I don't want things that other people my age want. I would be ok only if I could be happy and not afraid anymore. 

Many times I wanted to commit suicide. I just couldn't bring myself to do it. That would make my mother sad. I also have lots of dreams and I hope to live normally one day, so I don't want to leave this life without accomplishing my goals. 

I want to be strong but just for how much is this situation going to last... ?

... Tonight, dad came home later than usual. His face was very scary. Scarier than usual. He threatened to kill us again. Me, if I open the door again, mom, for ""cheating"". I think this time he put something heavy in front of the door. I could hear something heavy being dragged downstairs. He told me how he would kill us. I just have to wait and see. 

I just hope everything will be alright one more night.

Thank you for reading this. This has been my story so far. Please be happy for me tooー",20Aug2020,1
772,"Okay, this is the first time i've ever revealed this to anyone...but I have been thinking about it for a long time and I think I am a Lesbian. For a long time i've been feeling more attraction towards woman then guys. It's not that I was ever abused by guys, and no I am not a guy hater. I just never felt comfortable dating a guy and always freaked out when they would attempt to make a move on me, even if it's a little his or a hug. I honestly donno why and can't really find an explanation around it. But whenever i'm surrounded by a woman, I feel different. Relaxed and that something else....I will admit, I am 29 and still a virgin. I guess maybe I have no right to call myself a Lesbian, but I do find females attractive in general. Please don't think i'm a weirdo...I am certainly not one of those people who just stare at women. I respect people and don't believe in shoving my views in people's faces. 

This is where my personal view comes in on the situation of one revealing their sexuality towards the same sex partner. I have read and watched so many videos based on stories of Gay, Lesbian and Transgender people coming to their families, only to end up with family drama and end up getting exiled by family. 

I understand every situation is different and it's mainly based on people with biased, traditional views, also not all families react badly to it in the end. 

The thing is, I just feel if I straight out revealed my possible sexuality, it'll cause some relationship problems with my family who I've already got a good relationship with. It's also very difficult having two sisters, one who is married with two children (my nieces who I adore) and younger sister who's engaged with her fiance. 

My father doesn't really like gay people and made it known to us. Not in a everyday rant and he's not the type that believes they should go to hell...he just doesn't understand it and thinks it's all weird. He's a bit of an old fashioned guy. Not horrible, but just has limits on what he believes in. We have a good relationship and he's always been a good father, I wouldn't want to ruin the relationship over a conversation. My mother isn't too sure about gay people either, but also not horrible about it. She's just got the mind of the typical house wife. My older sister...who's always been a huge snob, once said she thinks there's something not right with gay people in general, like there's something screwed up with their brain. (yeah...she said that in front of me. I had to bite my lip). I think my younger sister will be okay, though I donno...haven't exactly had the conversation with her about it. 

Also I have noticed the way people in my community act towards gay people...often making a few snide comments. Word gets around fast in the community and so I wouldn't exactly want to become ""that lesbian girl"" for everyone to talk about. Despite everyone in the community knowing I'm a kind, loving sweet person. 

Also since I had minor Aspergers and had learning difficulties growing up, I'm afraid that revealing my secret might give my older sister's statement a point. Yes I know it's stupid and completely BS. But it would still make my older sister believe she is right...though she always believes she's right. 

So I have pretty much decided I am only going to use actions rather then say something about it in hopes to avoid drama. Again, I am not someone that believes in shoving my own beliefs or views in people's faces. So I will act pretty much normal, carry on but leave very subtle hints...like maybe wearing a rainbow bracelet or showing my support towards the gay community. I just feel using small actions will allow people around me to slowly adjust and come to their own conclusion, giving them time to think over and maybe slowly accept it. I don't want them to suddenly see me as a different person or a stranger. So I think slow and steady is a good choice.  

Sorry if I upset anyone on here who is gay or lesbian. I understand how difficult it's been for you to struggle out there and the difficulties you must have with your families over it. I really do wish you all the best. 

What do you think? Do you think i'm making the right choice here?",20Aug2020,1

My bestfriend failed his junior year in highschool and he got through a very tough phase after that. He quit school for that year. His relationship with his family deteriorated. he left the house. He became more addicted to video games and he suffers from what seemed to me to be a terrible depression. He isnt enthusiastic about his only serious talent which is gaming. He's now suicidal and talks about how he only wants to live a couple more years and end his life. 
For context, we live in a 3rd world country where it's extremely hard to get anywhere without at least highschool diploma. So he isn't going anywhere in his life and I really feel terrible just thinking about him.
It was planned for him to go back to highschool after the ""gap year"" but now he doesn't want to, in fact, he doesnt want anything. He even refuses to see a therapist. his mother called me and asked me to talk to him and convince him to go back to school to finish this one last year ( she could register him as a senior), school starts next month.
Before I was trying to be open-minded, and thought maybe he could do sthg else, maybe gaming or sthg. But his failure in school is the root of the problem and I believe it's the only way he could get his ""revenge"". How can I convince him to go back to school??

781,"I'm a fifteen year old girl and I just had an anxiety (or panic idk) attack... I've had them before but they're kind of becoming more frequent. My mental health has been pretty sh1t since I was like 12 or something and I'm getting really tired of it. I just haven't felt okay in such a long time and I know it's probably just puberty but there must be something that can help. I worry about a lot of things and it's just really stressful. 

About a month ago my parents wanted to go on holiday (I live in Spain and the corona cases where okay then) so we went. I'm really paranoid about corona but it's not like I could refuse to go. Anyway, we went to this town by the sea and there were a huge amount of people there, which made me have a panic/anxiety attack. I was hyperventilating, crying, couldn't stop thinking about it, looking around worriedly. It lasted like fifteen minutes. 

I didn't enjoy the holiday at all, I usually don't enjoy holidays as we never go places I like (probably sounds rlly ungrateful but that's how I feel). So I was in a pretty sh1t mood most of the holiday and obviously my parents got annoyed. My brother was constantly annoying me (He's 16 ffs). It was too much and I just felt really depressed and suicidal because they weren't being nice (I would never go through with it but I still thought about it). I've felt really sad and suicidal before, I have phases where I feel really bad and then phases where I feel normal-ish

Back to present time (kinda rambling a lot). I have my GCSEs (important exams) in the new school year and I got really worried that corona was going to ruin it. I'm a high-achiever and high grades are very important to me, like I won't be happy if I get a C. For years I've thought about getting the highest grades and hearing about all the problems they've had with this years GCSEs im really worried they'll have them next year. I really don't want to go back into lockdown but our corona cases are going up a lot atm. So I just had an anxiety attack about it and it's horrible. I was hyperventilating and crying and it just felt so overwhelming.

783,"Both my partner and I have issues, mine depression and ADD, theirs highly functioning autism and severe PTSD. 
We both try and help each other when we can, and individually go to therapy when we can afford it. 

I have a pretty limited amount of give-a-damns and sometimes I just literally cannot feel for my partners plights. I know they are hurting, but I can't do anything about it and I have no emotional connection to their feelings. I'm still very loyal and try to be kind; but due to years if emotional blunting, ADD, and whatever else the emotions are just not there. 

My partner has so many feelings, all the time, and they are big. And that's fine. But when they get hurt over something small, even though I know it feels big to them and is not invalid to feel that way, I am just empty about it. 

For example, I called a store in regards to an order. I told them my friend had dropped of the request and gotten some info, and I just wanted to clarify stuff. 
It was my partner who had dropped it off. After I got off the phone  my partner was very upset that I had said ""my friend"". 

I speak this way because I like to be vauge, dislike dipping into anything remotely personal in casual conversation, and literally that is the translation of how to say ""my partner"" in my first language. 

This has come up before and we have talked about it and I am trying to do better. It's been over a year since I last slipped up. But today I made the mistake, it upset them, and I just don't care. 

There are hundreds of tiny things like this that happen from time to time. They are exhausting for me. But they are very real important things with my partner.

The only issue is I've previously been disciplined for using homophobic slurs because I called a student the 'f' slur because he had an umbrella lol.

Obviously I don't want to talk to this guy as I'm in a committed relationship with my boyfriend so I don't know how he still has my number, why he's texting me now and if I should just block him or tell him I have a boyfriend",20Aug2020,1
792,"A few years ago, I met a guy online. We “dated” for a month (I was young, I don’t consider it an actual relationship but he clearly did). He was about 22 or 23 at the time, he’s in his mid-twenties now. Some things went down and we ended up not talking anymore, and we didn’t talk for nearly 2 years until I foolishly reconnected with him a few months ago. When we “dated”, I was still scared of him deep down - It might’ve just been paranoia but he would say some unsettling things. He frequently browsed the deep web (Which was true) and had access to really anything, and to be honest i’m 100% convinced that if he wanted to hurt someone, he could and would because he has nothing to lose. He also was into hacking (Which was also true); He actually found out the location of the guy I left him for and was considering “ruining his life” but ultimately didn’t do it. 

When I reconnected with him I found out that he was actually still “in love” with me for over a year after we stopped talking. He eventually found someone else (They didn’t work out) but he would still say to me that I was his dream girl, and say all these hypotheticals of how we would still be together if I didn’t leave him... All this stuff. In the time i’ve known him he’s never threatened me directly, but i’m more just terrified of the person he is and what he’s capable of. I’ve been trying to distance myself from him in hopes to completely cut ties with him again (Due to the fear mostly and I obviously don’t want him in my life), I haven’t had a proper conversation with him in weeks but today I removed him off everything. I’m still scared that it might piss him off and he might come for me or something, knowing who he is. 

I’m also constantly scared that i’m being watched; Since he’s into hacking and “has connections” and is able to clearly find personal information (I’m convinced he knows where I live too despite not telling him, also wouldn’t be surprised if he’s able to see what i’m doing at all times), i’m just terrified. Nothing has actually happened but i’m afraid it will because, again, I know the person he is. At this point i’m going through all the concerning things he’s sad and thinking about what he might be capable of. Am I just being paranoid?",20Aug2020,1
793,This is my first time asking for something like this so please try to be understanding. I am a 39m who is divorced. I had to move back in with my parents after trying to survive for a few years on my own. Everything has gone down hill and idk what to do. I constantly get belittled and made fun of by both my parents for being here. I had some bad health issues which put me in the hospital and afterwards I reached out to them for help. It was the first time in 15 years that we spoke. About a year later I moved in with them and it has been hell ever since. We live in a rural area which has made finding a full time job difficult and I cannot save enough to leave since I have to pay rent and bills for here. I am not sure what I am asking for but really looking for advice or help please. I live in Arizona if it helps.,20Aug2020,1

When someone's obsessed with you , it eventually ends and then he might not even want to talk with you


. I should be turned off , but i liked him from the start . I don't want to lose him when he'll stop being obsessed and Everything . We can't have any physical contact we can only talk from phone... 

I can have real feelings for him , but I'm pretty sure he's delusional . It happened some times before and if i was nice to a guy , he would stop all the i love you i want to marry you and then stop talking. Imagine now that we can't see each other. I'll be lucky if it's for a month...

In case there's a confusion , i don't like him because he says that stuff , i just want him to get over this phase of excitement and, you know ,feel more comfortable and have real feelings.


 When we text he seems to not like me at all . But then we have calls and says he loves me  .thus text is not enough and he "" remembers"" when we talk ..It's hard because no physical contact , like I can't see him in person .  

 How to act please help me . Please don't advice me to  be myself because i will anyways . I just don't know how to act ahhh",20Aug2020,1

798,"June 1st I let two kids, 19 year old guys, that I work with, move in with me. I live in my best friends beautiful rental house. I figured this might not work out, but I ultimately decided yes after numerous talks about what was expected of them, and it all sounded like it could work out. Also, the only reason I even considered it was because my hours got slashed initially from covid taking over. 

Anyways 2 months and 20 days later here we are. They have trashed the house countless times, and when they clean they do the bare minimum, leaving me to clean the hard to get things, ya know, the shit that actually matters. 

Since I let them move in I said feel free to use my ps4, Netflix, tv, living room furniture, blankets, basically everything you would need to live comfortably, when I’m not using them. In the kitchen I said you can use everything I’ve put in here (such as a griddle, and all the kitchen appliances) but please don’t eat my food unless you’re legit starving, I’ve been extremely generous. I clean as I go and I don’t make a mess really ever.

The past week, they threw a party till five in the morning. I leave my huge Bluetooth speaker out in the living room so I can use it. They were bumping loud ass music till 5 am until I was fed up and walked out of my room and grabbed it. A few nights before, they were partying in the garage with their rude ass friends who also take advantage of my generosity, and the next morning I go outside to see someone just broke 4 glasses and a bowl of mine right on the back deck/grass/pavement. I was fucking pissed. They didn’t even clean it up that night. They are just wildly irresponsible, and we are worlds apart. I took their words that they would respect the house and obviously they have reneged on literally everything. I do work a lot and I’m not home much, but they are. I come home basically every night expecting to see my food missing, the kitchen a mess, and they’re probably up late smoking dabs or drinking. 

I’ve had it. After yet another party two days ago, I came home about 7 am and they broke a kitchen cabinet door and the kitchen was a disaster. I could go on forever about how shitty they’ve been to me. I’ve asked them time and time again to respect the place and neither of them give a fuck. I literally was so fed up and I get nowhere talking to them, that I left a note on the kitchen very sternly saying that I was sick of their shit and they’re out by the end of the month. Went to my room. Came out about 1 to go work and one of them left me a note. Saying I’m a piece of shit greedy asshole bitch bitch bitch bitch, I hope you get hit by a train, I wish you would fight me, I got so many niggas to back me up and I’m like wtf...how immature. 

Today, I’m laying in bed and I start to notice it’s getting hot as fuck in my room. I check my app on my phone and one of the dumb motherfuckers set the heat up to 90 degrees. I get the feeling that in the next ten days there will be bounds of petty shit they will do. I’ve already moved anything worth value into my room and it’s under lock and key. But I’m just worried about the house. I trust them as far as I can throw them. 

What the fuck do I say to these leeches?  What’s the best way to handle this situation right now? Is there any way I can kick them out early? Please, any advice is welcome.",20Aug2020,1

801,"Okay, so she was in a bad relationship with this dude. He emotionally abused her and pressured her into sex and stuff. 

Recently he hasn’t been showing up to classes so she wanted to text him. I told her that if she was really worried email a counselor. The counselors at my school are actually helpful. He’s got a history with drugs, but I told her to leave that out in the email so he doesn’t get in trouble. I told her to tell the counselor she was worried about his mental health and she should ask to remain anonymous. 

I think this is good advice, but I think she wants to ignore me. I’m thinking she’s gonna try talking to him again. I obviously don’t have control over the situation, but I’d hate to see her get back with him. Is there anything else I should try telling her?",20Aug2020,1

She has had some crappy things happen in life, but also has a lot going for her. I am afraid to say the wrong thing, but am also worried that saying nothing or acting like life is normal could be more harmful? My go to when I feel down or when I am facing difficult situations is to pretend like all is well. But, I dont think that is the right thing to do in this situation.

She said she keeps going through the motions, trying to feel more normal. She says she feels so isolated. Any suggestions for how I can be supportive of her? I love her and want to do right by her. When I asked directly how I could better support her, she said she didn't know.

I do not give one shit that you adopted a dog or had a barbecue with your family.  I get paid to do work not to listen to your stories about your nephew. Why do they ask this in interviews? It has no bearing on whether I can do the job, am creative or anything else. 

As it is, I hate my job, why should I have to mix the two.

I’ve only really noticed him making comments at me personally in the last few weeks, but he’s always been funny about how much people weigh and how fat they look. Whispering insults about larger women on the streets, getting funny about food sometimes, stuff like that. 

He’s been nagging at me to go to the gym, convincing me to go on more/longer walks (when I mean longer I mean an extra hour and a half’s worth of walking) and making comments that include
“you’re starting to get fat” (why the fuck?)
“you really trim up after some good exercise” (made me a little uncomfortable ngl
“That jacket makes you look fat” (it doesn’t, I asked a friend)
“if you wear a black top and black jeans you look like a fat girl trying to be skinny” (I don’t even know where he got that from)

809,"About a year ago my grandmother had a bad seizure and ended up in the hospital, when she got out my uncle tried to physically assault my dad, and threatened him.

A few months later it happened again and he pulled a knife on my dad and almost hit my mom over the head with a statue because my dad ""had that big stupid grin on his face"" in his own words (he still says it to this day) there were witnesses there but they openly lie

For the last year my whole family has been afraid to go over there because every time they do he starts trouble. And they had convinced my grandmother that we didn't care about helping them or seeing them

About 2 weeks ago my grandparents asked us (me, my dad and my brother) to fix their house 

The first day he came up cussing at me for helping my grandmother in the house because I wasn't wearing a mask (he didn't even bring one with him) 

The next day he came cussing again calling us (me and my brother) theifs because our grandparents bought the lumber to fix their house, we told our grandmother about it happening and he blamed our grandfather because he said (it costed 10000, it didn't cost nowhere near that and he was cussing us before that) then he called my dad (who wasn't even there either time) and blamed him for him acting that way

Fast forward a week and we're over there helping my grandparents and my grandfather told my mom that he wanted people to start coming over there and helping more so he had her send out a text asking the entire family when they could volunteer to help.

Then my uncle called my grandmother cussing her out telling her that it was some BS that he'd been helping them for year by himself and he wasn't gonna help anymore, told her to choose between him and my dad and that he would ""come down there and cuss every damn one of us out when he got off work"" so we had to leave early

For context I have 3 older brothers (Ages 18, 20, 24), only th3 youngest one of them lives at home still.

Yesterday I was at work and I get a text from my friend saying that they're not allowed to be near my siblings pretty much at all because according to their dad they are ""biologically male and young and could do something to them""

I'm absolutely mortified at hearing that because, what the fuck?? I understand the concern, but their dad is basically implying that for one: all biological males are predators, and two: that my siblings are pedophiles even though they have never met any of my brothers and would have no reason to believe that

(I am am not biologically male, hence why I get a 'free pass' by their parents)

I have no idea how to handle this, I'm upset and angry and talking to my friend about it wouldn't do anything helpful

And for anyone who is curious, I am almost positive my siblings are not predators or pedophiles, if I had any reason to believe that they were I would report them to some form of legal authority in an instant, but as far as I have seen they're nice people and would never do something like that.",20Aug2020,1

As a property manager part of my salary includes a two bedroom apartment that I live rent-free in, only having to pay for utilities. I live by myself so I clearly have more space than I need. Back in May a friend of mine got divorced and his wife pretty much took everything except for personal belongings and his car. Being the nice guy that I am, I told him if things came down to brass tacks, he could stay with me for a bit so he can get back on his feet. The odd thing about this is he lived in NC and I in Colorado. Really didn't expect him to take me up on it since that is a long way to drive. Well, as you redditors have surmised he did take me up on the offer and at the beginning of June moved into my place. He managed to get a job shortly thereafter and has been working since. However, the entire time hes been here he has done really nothing as far as trying to save up and find his own place, instead preferring to spend hours smoking on my porch (not THAT kind of smoking) and chatting up girls on social media. I've tried to be nice, giving him advice that focusing all his energies on ""getting his dick wet"" is what landed him on my doorstep to begin with. Now here it is at almost the end of his third month here and nothing has changed. I've not charged him for rent, utilities, or anything, hoping he would put that cash away to get his own place but from what I am seeing, he is not doing so. My question is, am I being a jerk to want him out of my place? I don't want to lose a friendship because aside from his sexual proclivities, he is a decent friends, but at the same time I really want my place back. I got used to having the place all to my own (I've had this living situation going on for myself for almost five years), and it does not seem as if there are really any benefits to having him around. He doesn't hang out or want to do much of anything beyond sitting on the porch smoking and getting sucked into his phone. He's not contributing towards bills, and the one thing I asked him to do as a favor, proofread my Master's thesis, the only feedback I got was ""Oh yeah it's good,"" right before he went right back to his phone. I am slowly beginning to resent the fact he is enjoying the fruits of my labors and I fear it may end the friendship for good if I put my foot down and say enough is enough.

815,"I'm F15, an only child, and lately, my mom has been becoming more and more... clingy?  and sometimes it's really aggravating. I wouldn't call her strict, just really really overprotective. A prime example is, she's always chaperoning me on the way to school. Now, where I live, having a personal driver is extremely common, so she doesn't really drive me to school, just wakes up with me in the morning to accompany me there. Which normally, I wouldn't mind, except she's always complaining about it later on, and it sometimes ends up in me being late to school because she wouldn't wake up.   
This also applies to everywhere I go, I have to make sure that my plans always match up with her schedule because she feels the need to drop me off with the driver wherever I go. I understand how ungrateful this makes me sound, but sometimes it genuinely sucks the fun out of everything I'd like to do. She doesn't drop me off at malls with my friends, she goes in WITH me. Of course, she doesn't walk around with us, just goes off to sit in a restaurant all on her own, which ends up in me feeling super guilty about her sitting alone so I just cut the outing short. Her argument is always ""I just wanna be there in case anything bad happens."" which I totally understand, but at the same time, I want to feel independent, like I could take care of myself on my own, just for once.

She tries her best to make me happy but honestly just letting me breathe for a little bit would make me the happiest.   


For the next part, I feel like it's important to mention that my dad works in another city and only comes to visit once every month for like, 4 days.

When I was 8, her father died. She used to get lots of nightmares, sleep paralysis, etc.. so ever since then, I've been sleeping beside her. When I was ages 8-12, I didn't really mind, because I used to get nightmares too. I was embarrassed from the fact that I slept in the same bed as my mom,  I thought I was mainly the one being a pussy, not her.  
Whenever my dad was home, I realized I liked sleeping in my own bed a lot better, so I told her about sleeping on my own, that was when she told me about all the nightmares she's been getting, so I ended up feeling guilty and not bringing it back up again. That is until a few months before my 14th birthday, I told her I needed some more privacy and she didn't look too happy, but she agreed and told me to at least wait until it was my birthday.   
My birthday finally comes around and I'm telling her I'm going to sleep in my room, she asks for one more night, I give in, she asks again, I feel really guilty... and I never end up sleeping in my own room.  
I still try talking to her but every time I do, I get guilt-tripped.  


Another example is, I've been talking to her about university, what I wanna major in, where I wanna study, It always ends up with her trying to make me stay and study in my homeland, which I'd rather DIE than do. Saudi's education system isn't awful, but if I'm able to get accepted into a good university abroad, I am going to JUMP at that chance. About 2 years back, I thought I had no chance at being able to go study abroad because I simply thought I wasn't allowed to, at least that's what she made me believe, but after a recent discussion with my dad about it, I realized that he was totally down with the idea as long as it wasn't too costly, and my mom's only problem with it was that I had to leave her.  
And I understand that, being an only child and all, she's bound to be attached to me, but I didn't expect it to get in the way of my future? She's even made up her mind about renting an apartment with me when I go study abroad and like??? How much is that even gonna cost?? Can't I be independent?? Just for ONCE??? But I assume it's also a relief since I wouldn't really know the country, it'd be pretty dangerous for a young girl on her own. Still though, I imagined that uni would be the only time where I'd experience true freedom and complete independence. Especially since there's a lot of stuff about my identity that my mom does not know about and doesn't necessarily... agree with, but I'm not about to get into all that.  


I just don't know how to talk to her about boundaries and stuff like that without her making it sound like I'm ready to abandon her and put her in a nursing home.

819,"I (22F) am trying to decide the best way to approach my sister (B) about a relationship she is in that has shown a lot of red flags. 

Background: I was previously in an abusive relationship, and I know what the warning signs look like. I don't wish to go into detail. B is currently in a polyamorous relationship with a married couple (late twenties) with four kids. I have no issue with the polyamory, love is love, but it is relevant. She has been seeing this couple for less than 6 months. The red flags are as follows: She has moved in with them (1 hour away from where our family is) and has assumed babysitting responsibilities for the children. She is absolutely reliant on them for transportation. They are all unemployed, in B's case from choice and not the pandemic. B's unemployment was a recent change, presumably due to the lack of transport and distance from work, as well as babysitting responsibilities. The couple has recently moved to our state, and apparently fled the state that they are from for unknown reasons. 

The biggest reasons I have for concern is the last point listed above, as well as B's history with her mental health. She has always struggled emotionally, and recently (within the last year) started bipolar medication. I am afraid that she has attached herself to this couple and family because of the love they can provide her, and that she is blind to the red flags the rest of our family can see. I am especially afraid of several outcomes, for example: she relies on them for transport and is far from family or an easy ride, and she has no way to leave if she needs to. I am scared that they are going to take advantage of her financially, because they are living in poor conditions and she has a clean financial record. I can see the scenario where the couple gets a divorce, because there have been comments made about how the wife is unhappy. 

She has also been causing stress to our mother. My mom wants her home, and safe, and so when B asked if we can clear out a portion of our backyard for the family to move into (the 6 of them in a camper) my mother said yes. I suppose my mom giving in is a symptom of the pain I put her through once upon a time.  I understand the living situation for the couple is poor, but these people are still strangers to us, and I believe it would be a huge mistake for obvious reasons. No one supports this but my mother. 

My question is this: Do I let her be, let the situation play out, and let her make her adult mistakes? It is a very real possibility I see more than there is because of my own personal experience. This path scares me, because I believe the mistakes can have a huge effect on the rest of her life. There are some life lessons that are not worth learning, and certainly do not make you a stronger person. Additionally, I am not the only one scared by the direction this is going. 

Or, do I sit her down and finally let her know what I think? Me and my sister are very different people, and previously when I have tried to talk to her about some of the things she does it has ended poorly. She is known to deflect most criticism with ""I'm sorry you feel that way, but I disagree"" and then, if someone presses on from there, she becomes emotional and does the classic ""I guess I'm just stupid"" or ""I'm just an asshole then."" The rest of the conversation devolves into consoling her, and the original issue never gets addressed. Because of this I have been holding back on talking to her about the red flags I see, I can be very hot tempered. I fear that I will lose my calm, lose all tact, and further hurt our relationship to the point where she will not see me as an option if my fears play out and she needs help.",20Aug2020,1
820,"I have had a friend for over 7 years now. We first met in 3rd grade, and he has been my best friend ever since. Though we have always been quite different from each other, we have been able to get along just fine. But recently, he has been getting into politics more. He and I are on opposite sides of the spectrum when it comes to political beliefs. I have always been more conservative, and he has shown himself to be a liberal. I have always been into the idea of politics, but I normally don't like to get involved in political conversations. But as we go into 11th grade, I know I will have to talk about politics and my beliefs again because of our civics class. I normally don't like to talk about politics at my school because my beliefs are often looked down upon by teachers and other students. And whenever anything political is brought up around my friend, he'll always talk about his beliefs and what he thinks after the class in our Discord call. I know he is allowed to do this, and I would not have a problem if he didn't ask if I agreed after everything he says. He knows I don't agree and he'll down talk me when I say, ""Actually, I don't agree with that statement"". He will also try to force his beliefs into me, even though he knows that I don't agree with him. I want to know if I should keep this friend around and just move past the political conversations, or if I should end this friendship. Normally, it would be a no-brainer to keep this friendship alive, but He has been putting me on the spot a lot more lately and I feel uncomfortable whenever I am around him. In my opinion, This is not how I should feel around a friend, nevertheless my best friend.",20Aug2020,1

822,"About a year ago, a co-worker of mine was looking for someone to take in her cat while her and her husband traveled the world as travel influencers (what timing, huh). She agreed to pay me, this was long-term, about 1-1.5 years.

She ended up only paying me a handful of times, maybe $250 altogether, for the past YEAR. I am kind of a doormat and I want to help people out constantly and I have a lot of generosity and kindness to give (side note, I am trying to work on verbalizing things I like about myself so HA!). 

When COVID hit, they returned from their travels and were back to the US. You would think that they would come running back for their cat, right? **No**.

They'd been home for around 3-4 weeks before they reached out to me letting me know that they had returned. They wanted to see the cat, and ""stop by"" - not move him around just yet, just ""take things slow."" I obliged (hello, I am doormat!) and let them visit. They asked if I would be comfortable keeping him for another month or so until they found a new place to live. I said (doormat again!) of course. They asked if it would be okay if they stopped and visited him to check in a few times in the meantime. Doormat said, ""Of course!""

Fast forward 2.5 months later. I had not heard a **PEEP**. Radio silence. I had been digging out of my own pocket to feed/care for this cat since and doormat is getting sick of being a doormat.

I reach out to her, ask her what her plans are for the cat. I say that I am moving soon, so she needs to decide quickly and keep that in mind. She asks if they can visit this week. I say yes, you can visit. Well fellow Redditors, **that visit just happened and I need your advice**.

First of all, they stopped by my place in swimwear and told me they were ""on their way to the beach."" Ahem. So this was just a super convenient trip for them to make. Also f\*ck you for going to the beach during a pandemic. Anyways.

The visit lasted 10 minutes. The husband took initiative and skirted around the topic, saying: ""You know, you agreed to watch him 9-12 months, and we know that you were in the market for a cat, and we don't really want to move him around too much, and he seems to be comfortable here, so if you're feeling it, he's pretty much yours to keep."" **I couldn't speak. No words.**

They then proceeded to talk about how they are planning to get **a kitten.** One that they can ""train"" and can put into one of those cat backpacks to walk him/her around the city so they can take fun Instagram photos. Oh and also potentially a dog, the husband wants a dog.

**No words.** 

My doormat tendencies came out again and I stammered and I told them I would give it the weekend to think it over.

**My question then is: do I have a moral responsibility to keep this cat?** I am finding myself intertwined in a strange moral obligation question where it feels like a living being's life is now in my hands and I do not know what to do. I do not think I want a cat for the rest of my life (I am 1,000% a dog person and have thought about adopting a dog for at least 5 years now) - but, I have grown fond of him and it has been nice to have an animal around (I live alone) during this pandemic and all of 2020's messiness.

I have never really dealt with such ignorant, selfish behavior in my life. That interaction was only about 10-15 minutes and I don't think I have ever felt so drained. I feel sad, I feel angry, and I would love for any of you to give me some solid advice as to how to go about this in a way that is best for both the cat and for myself. Thank you, and happy Thursday!

833,"Hey Reddit,

Recently I finished my Master's in Social Engineering and Management and was wondering if it would be crazy to pursue studying another Master's in Fine Arts (painting). I use to exhibit and sell artwork in the city, enough to live semi-comfortable living (a little more than minimum wage), but then stopped and got an education in Communications and then later UX in order to ""Play it Safe"". I've always wanted to study art, but I'm afraid of the stigma, and that I'm getting too old, and that I should focus more on building a ""career"". 

I'm about to turn 28 and would start when I was 29 if all things went well. If I did go I would be able to fund myself by building websites and interfaces. They're a good chance though that I would have to do BA before taking masters, therefore I would be 35 when I graduate. Pursuing this would be a dream, but at the same time, the thought is really scary but also really exciting. I imagine my parents would be pissed, even though they have both been supportive of my art. They paid for my last master's but this education would be free for me as I live in Denmark.",20Aug2020,1
834,"
okay okay okay, i downloaded reddit just for this so first post. this is also the first time writing down what happened as i haven’t told anyone before. i apologise for any errors i make, same with spelling and grammar as i’m not great at either. this is the second time writing this down too because i lost my old draft i made about an hour ago. i was about to post this to r/relationship_advice but i felt as if it had a lot to do with mental health as well as that as i don’t even want a relationship at all with one of them. 
old friend: sam, gender fluid, same age
current partner: erin, gender confused, same age
(fake names)

i became friends with sam two years ago when i started secondary school. (11-12yrs). they had a lot of problems &amp; mental illnesses including self harm and an eating disorder off of the top of my head, and i had issues with anxiety so we became friends. they didn’t spend much time in class but i walked them to the special needs room every morning after form (homeroom i think) and they were a part of my latin class too. they told me about their problems during these times, we talked as much as we could and they helped me with my anxiety as i helped with their issues. they confessed that they self harmed, showing me their scars and telling me that they had a favorite blade they used and all of that. i didn’t ask, i dont think i wanted to know but i was there to listen to them and didn’t stop them. i don’t  blame sam at all for telling me, i told them i’d listen and i was apparently their closest friend. 

due to this i ended up hurting myself too, not as serious as them but i had scratches and bruises on my hands and arms and couldn’t stop hitting my head off of walls when i had the chance. they found out that i did it and gave me the same help and love i gave them but they never found out that i did it because of what they told me. again, i don’t blame them for this, i was just being too sensitive. i felt that it wasn’t fair that they went through what they did so i deserved the same things too. i’d didn’t do it to be closer to them or to be like them, i made an effort for them not to find out. in truth i don’t fully know why i did so. but they were everything to me, and when it’s all i can think about i ended up taking influence. a teacher asked me about the scars on my hand and when i finally admitted to scratching the skin off one time under a desk in class, she told me others could see and copy and i broke down. 

i was always really quiet anyway so i was generally more of a listener than a talker anyway. i’d give them advice, encourage them to stop, encourage them to tell their therapist the things they told me and all of that. we hugged and cried out a lot of our problems together and when there was nothing to talk about we chatted about tv shows we watched and musicals we listened to as if none of that happened. we were best friends and i had a huge crush on them. they kissed me twice, though only on the forehead and on the top of the head. i don’t know what i would have done if i had gotten the change to do anything but they kissed me the first time just before they left and the second time a teacher interrupted. i’m still not convinced they could have liked me, i’m still not convinced anyone can but you know that’s the standard, not having enough confidence. due to that i genuinely can never tell if someone likes me or if i’m being narcissistic so i couldn’t tell you if they liked me back or not.

eventually they stopped showing up in form, and then in class, and then at school at all. i knew that it couldn’t have been too serious as i saw their sister in the hallways every now and again and she seemed happy. if it wasn’t for that i’d have been convinced they killed themself as everything seemed so serious. i never had any credit on my phone so i couldn’t text them and they didn’t text me. but one day when i was waiting for a friend at the front desk, they were there too and we started talking. 
i can’t remember the details, but i was a mess and they told me that they didn’t want to relapse and was getting the help that they needed, i was really happy for them of course, they apologized and i told them it was okay and no need. that was the last time i talked to them in person as i started having my lunch in an english classroom instead of the hall when my anxiety or worse and i got sick of people asking me why i was constantly watching the front desk. 

i got some credit on my phone but knowing that it wouldn’t last long i downloaded instagram and asked for their username. our middle names are the same, for example lee. but our last names being completely different, that of their step dads and their biological dad. however, say my name was aaron lee lock, their username was samleelocke. i didn’t mention it but kept it in the back of my mind. we talked for a few days but eventually when i went to text them, their profile was gone. i went onto my art account, that using my full name and posting my art and i could see their profile still. i thought it was a mistake that they blocked me as i was first in denial before the sadness and dread set in. so, as it was a private account i requested to follow it. the request was denied, so i didn’t bother them anymore. trying to forget about them as they obviously didn’t want to talk to me. i still missed them and wasn’t over it but i forced myself to move on. 

i became closer with some other friends though i still missed them. i told those friends about sam but only that they were my old friend and not how much i liked them or what happened between us. 

when i broke up with my ex girlfriend, i confined in erin about what happened. it’s not important as to why i broke up. just that i didn’t really like her and i felt closer to erin as a friend which i thought was a problem. i told someone online about her once and he told me that i should break up i just needed to learn to be alone because i sounded like i liked the hugs and kisses more than her as a person. the day after though erin asked me out and i agreed. i guess that person online was right because i’m terrified of being alone again. it’s not like i didn’t like erin like that, i did have a crush on them, yet another reason as to why i broke up with my ex. 

but since then everything has been great between us. i still haven’t talked to sam since those two years ago. i love erin so much, we are really close and we have the same sense of humor and interests. we talk every day and have been seeing each other a lot since lockdown was lifted. but just recently i started thinking about sam again and i can’t get through the day without almost tearing up because of them. erin doesn’t know i still think about sam, and isn’t great with emotions. i just told them an hour ago that i probably wouldn’t be able to talk for the rest of the day because i was crying and felt like shit and they responded with ‘Fuck man- uh- um MEMES ok I'll get yOu memes’.  i told them it was okay and i just needed a bit of time to myself. i love them, genuinely i know i’m not just convincing myself like that time. the only problem i have is that we don’t know how to talk about serious things with each other. they have confessed that they don’t even care about anyone but me, they are so sweet and kind to me but they are a bitch to everyone else, they told me they genuinely don’t care about anyone but me and their mother and what scares me is that i believe them. though i do have only one positive to this situation, which is that i’m scared of telling people what’s wrong with me. due to what happened with me and sam i’m scared of being another sam and others taking influence from my shitty actions. i smoke weed, i self harm and i never talk about my problems. and i’m so fucking casual about it all with myself that i don’t want to tell anyone else in case they take influence from me. if someone found out i would want them to learn from my mistakes and not act like me, that’s the least i want. i would hate for someone else to end up like me. so i’m glad that i can’t tell erin because now erin can’t end up in my place and i won’t just be sam again. 

erin says that they care about me more than anyone else, so i’ve been encouraging them to talk to more people and make more friends as i know i’m their only friend. 
i don’t tell then about my issues for the most part so they don’t take influence. 
(they know about a few things, we’ve cried together before but we haven’t worked through anything together, we don’t talk about issues any further than just explaining what’s wrong and that has only happened twice.) 
the last thing i want to do is leave them, i want to stay with them until they get sick of me. i love them so much and the only way they’re getting rid of me is if they break up with me first, though i can’t see that happening any time soon as they made the same promise lol. 

i still have sams presents and cards on my walls, i still wake up to seeing the birthday card they made me years ago, next to erins hoodie hanging up on the back of the door. 
i still love erin so much and there is no doubt in my mind of that, i just recently have been thinking about sam a lot. 
i don’t want to date them still, though i wish i did. when i had the chance. i don’t even want to have a friendship with sam as it’s clear that i just remind them of bad memories and if i’m honest they do the same to me. i just wanna give them a fucking hug and  say goodbye so i have some closure at least instead of a chat i can’t respond to and a birthday card that i can’t throw away because the thought of even putting it in storage makes me want to throw up. i got a new haircut today and even know erin has short hair too, all i can see in the mirror is sam.

i’m gonna stop it there as i’ve cried so much i can’t see or breathe anymore, i’ve been at this for hours and i’m sure my mothers wondering where i am and i need to tell erin that i’m okay.

so, that’s it really, i just need to know what to do. how do i get over sam? how can me and erin communicate better? how can i tell them about my problems without the same situation happening over again? how do i forget about it when everything from the music i listen to to my own reflection reminds me of sam? therapy’s off the table, it’s not that serious and i don’t have the money. i just want to tell erin as i feel like i’m keeping a secret and i hate secrets but i’m scared they won’t take it very well. 

tl;dr: i can’t stop thinking about my past crush, even know i love my current partner. i’d do anything just to give them a hug, i don’t even want to date them anymore, but i don’t know how to open up to my partner to get it all off of my chest.",20Aug2020,1

836,"Hi everyone, today I had my first pelvic and transvaginal ultrasounds after having irregular bleeding for the past 5 months. When the technician started the external ultrasound she was looking at the right side of my stomach and after taking a few pictures/images (this is my guess based on what she was clicking on her keyboard) she sighed almost defeatedly and shut her eyes for approx 10 seconds before resuming. I found this odd but didn’t think anything until she started imaging the left side of stomach. She spent much less time imaging the left side of my body compared to the right. When the internal vaginal ultrasound was taking place she spent much more time taking images of the right side of me than the left. 

The technician wasn’t allowed to talk to me about what she saw, she said she does not interpret the images she just takes them and then i need to book an appointment with my doctor to discuss the findings. 

I know that maybe the machine was giving her difficulty or there was some type of technological problem that had nothing to do with my health but i feel very concerned that maybe she saw something wrong and was not allowed to say anything to me. Am i overthinking this? My follow up appointment with my doctor is still 1 week away and I can’t image feeling this unsure and stressed out for that long. Any input on how ultrasounds normally go or advice as to how to put my mind at ease would be very much appreciated.",20Aug2020,1
837,"Minor details in this post are altered for privacy reasons!

Me (mid teens) and my sister (preteens) have had a tradition of drawing together and talking about life since we were little.

She recently started including her friends in our drawing sessions. It started off as her FaceTiming or calling them and us all drawing together, but now they FaceTime her every single day and now she sketches with them longer than she does with me. We haven’t had our one on one drawing session in weeks, her friends are always on call. I feel like I’m third wheeling my sister and her friends during our designated time.

I talked to my sister about how I’m feeling upset about how she always chooses to spend our drawing time with them, and she said she wouldn’t call them for a day so we could spend time together. Her friends still texted her pictures of their drawings every single second. Literally every other minute her ringtone was going off and she refused to mute it because she wants to be updated on what they’re talking about. 

I can’t get a single second alone with my sister and I feel like it’s ruining our relationship. Her friends are always brought up in conversations, or they’re texting her, or they’re calling her. Even at 11pm at night. They have no boundaries and it’s too much. She sits on call with them for four hours straight every single day and afterward spends every other second checking their text messages. How do I save our relationship? Should I try to talk to our parents about this to see if they could help set boundaries?

I understand that sometimes kids gravitate towards friends more than family, but this is just too much. I’m practically the same age as my sister and even I can manage my time and priorities. I miss talking to my sister. If I can’t find a way to help her stop being so addicted to talking to her friends 24/7 I’m probably just going to abandon the relationship. It’s too exhausting and I hate being her second choice and an afterthought.",20Aug2020,1

sorry about the messey title. im 19 as of writing this. my brother (23) is the reason i am making this post. when i was a child he was abusive to me and it wasn't handle the best but my parents did the best they could. at the time mum (52) dad (48). over the years i refused to forgive him for what he did to me. this used to be a point of contention with him and my family till i told them everything he did and how it affected me. only recently told my brother how i felt. we hardly come into contact and his life has just fallen apart since he moved out of the family home a few years ago. i wont go into detail but he is a mess right now.

my mum and dad blame themselves for the way he turned out and the pain we are both in. my mum the most. i dont think its her fault antry and tell her that but she is stuck with the idea of of she had done better or looked a little harder she could have noticed everything and prevented this before it happened.

anyways the main purpose im making this is would me forgiving him stop him from getting worse. he is having a mental brake. off work because of it and he is in a really bad state. i feel like when i told him what i think of him and how much he hurt me he began to get wors and i think its my fault. he is in so much pain and he hates him self so much. i don't know what to do. i want to help my brother but he is also my abuser that i hate so much. i really don't know what to do. should i do nothing should i help him. should i just help my mum and dad. i really don't know anymore. so i'm asking people who aren't emotionally attached to the situation for advice. anything will be helpful. as i'm at a complete loss this time round.

Hello! This may or may not become a long post but please read and bare with me. I am a 23 year old woman and I fear that my issues with my mother are holding me back in life. I have gone through hell and back with my mother and just when I think things are getting better they get significantly worse. Since I was about 10 years old, my relationship with my mother became estranged. We had a lot of family conflict around the time and my mother forced me to pick sides. She isolated me from family member who loved me because of her personal beef with them. I went years without speaking to my grandmother, aunts and uncles during a time when I truly needed them the most. Fast forward a few years to when I'm a teenager. My mom starts dating a married alcoholic named M and moves us an hour away from everyone. The way she chose him over our relationship and the relationships she had with our family made me lose respect for her. When I was around thirteen the family that my mother tried to isolate me from were back in my life just not speaking to my mother which caused even more tension. My Aunt and Uncle see what's going on with my mom and essentially step up and become mom and dad to me.

My mother continues to date M and things eventually reached a head when I was 20 and she kicked me out after she'd gotten drunk with him and he'd convinced her to do so. Now, around this time I was attending community college and working two jobs so I could get away from my home situation. I admittedly let school take a backseat while I worked as many hours as I could to save for my own place. I took semesters off and it took me about three years to make it through community college. After I finished and had enough credits to transfer to Uni, I decided to move into the dorms as a way of quickly exiting from my mother's house. Around this time M finally broke things off with my mother after 8 years when he decided to go back to his wife. I'm sure this devastated her and she really began to spiral. She embezzled thousands from her job and we were facing eviction where we lived. During this time my mom was constantly asking me for money as she knew that I'd been saving to move out. I always lied about how much money I had and after a while she told me that she was leaving to go to Florida and that I could sleep in my car until it was time for me to move into the dorm. When she said this it was September and I wasn't scheduled to move into the dorm until January. I was beyond hurt that she'd basically told me to fend for myself while she covered her own ass but I stayed with my Aunt and Uncle until it was time to move.

My stay in the dorm was one of the most happiest and brokest times of my life. I was happy because I was finally able to put some distance between my mom and I and I finally felt like I could focus on me for a while. I had my first real job and things were on the up and up for me. My mom eventually moved into her own place and I felt like things were going to be ok. I decided while I was in the dorm that there wasn't a chance in hell that I'd be going back to stay with my mother so I worked my ass off to save for an apartment. I got the apartment but my grades suffered and I ended up failing two classes. Also just as I was getting things squared away for my new place, I discovered that my mother had used my social security number to open up many accounts and that she'd ran my credit through the roof. I discovered this when I tried to get my lights on in my new apartment. I was livid and didn't speak to her for weeks.

Fast forward a year and I'm doing well at my job, in the middle of my second semester at Uni and happily not speaking with my mother. I get a call from her and we reconcile. I inform her that I need her tax information for the FASFA and she gives me the runaround about it for a while but agrees to help. A few days later I get a call from her asking me to come by, I go over to her house for what I assume to be a friendly visit with my mother and she reveals that she's going to get evicted the very next day ...once again and that she was going to stay with friends. I could immediately sense that she was trying to manipulate her way into my apartment and I of course told her no. I went on with my life angry as hell because I feel as if she only tried to get in good with me just so she could have a place to stay when she was getting evicted. She waited until the literal last minute to tell me about the eviction because I feel she was trying to do whatever to guilt me into saying she could stay with me.

About a month later I get a call from her while she's at her friends house. She asks me if she can stay with me again. I tell her no again and explain why. She goes off on me and calls me every name in the book. In a nutshell , she basically says how dare I live my life without making her the center of it and she pulls the typical "" I'm your mother"" and ""you wouldn't be shit without me"" guilt trips. While it hurts I ignore it and stand firm on my no. A month goes by and my 23'rd birthday is approaching. I don't hear anything from my mother so I assume everything is good. On the literal day of my birthday, maybe 20 minutes before my birthday party I get a call from a frantic family member saying that my mother had been missing for the past three days. She then begins to curse me out and scream at me for not talking to my mom. I try to explain to the family member that my mother has disregarded me and treated me like shit for majority of my life but it goes in one ear and out the other. I was extremely disturbed to hear that my mom was missing but I was annoyed that this family member waited until my birthday to tell me. It was done intentionally to ruin my day and after all I've been through with my mother I was annoyed that it seemed as if I couldn't even enjoy one day to myself. I'd planned a birthday trip with my girlfriends ( that my mother was aware of ) and didn't want to bail on them and the money I'd put into this trip so I went. However, I couldn't even enjoy my vacation because every five minutes my phone was ringing with frantic calls from various family members about my mother being missing. I was so angry with her because I felt like this was all another ploy to ruin my life and while I was sad I was also extremely angry. I'd also found out that while she was staying with our family member that cursed me out on my birthday she'd told anyone who would listen that I was a terrible daughter who didn't give a fuck about her and that I wasn't even her daughter anymore. She'd drug my name through the mud without mentioning a single thing she'd done to me.

Fast forward a bit and we finally locate my mother at a psychiatric hospital. She claims that she's had a mental breakdown. I was happy to find her after a week and a half of not eating, sleeping, and crying and drinking myself to sleep because even though she's a horrible mother I didn't want her to be dead. She immediately tries to manipulate her way into my house and while I was happy she was alive the answer was still no and at this point the friend she did have who'd let her stay with them before she went missing wanted nothing to do with her either. With no one to claim her she goes missing again. This time I lose it, I become extremely depressed. I felt that as my mother's only child she'll always be my burden and I'll never escape her and her issues. Because of the bridges she'd burned with everyone else, she had no one who wanted to deal with her and I felt like I'd always be forced to be there for her even when I desperately just need a break from her.

After this we find her again and she's at a warming center. She manipulates her way into my house by claiming she wants to talk to me. Talking to me turns into her sleeping on my couch for two months. During this time, I'm nearing the end of my second semester at Uni and while I started out with all A's, the stress of my mother going missing and now living on my couch set me back tremendously. I'd taken weeks off work to look for her and missed a lot of assignments. I pull through just barely and pass my classes. At this point my mom and I have been arguing non stop and I want her out of my house. I find her a shelter to go to that'll let her stay for a year, help her get a job and a place to stay afterwards. She's ungrateful and decides to give me the silent treatment. It is also during this time that I stop believing the mental breakdown story and start to believe that she's gotten into drugs. A family member ( who'd been friends with my mother since 1986 ) reveals to me that M was a known crack addict and that she suspects that my mother had been smoking with him for years. She also reveals that a lot of the reason why my mother has so many issues with people in our family is because she's asked them for money lots of times and fails to pay them back. She'd even asked her elderly godparents (they're in their 90's) for thousands and hasn't paid them back. This makes me think back on all the unpredictable explosive arguments we'd get into, her constantly asking me for money, her embezzling money from her job, the lies and her just general irresponsible decisions. It made me feel better in a sense that I had something I could blame all of this on but also angered me because here I am now, 23 and I've gone through literal hell since about 10... when all my mother had was a drug problem. Not that that's nothing but all this time I just assumed she hated me. Fast forward to today and she's been at the new shelter for two months. They're really helping her and I'm glad but this has all left me feeling.....weird. Because my life has been a continual roller coaster, I haven't had much time to really sit back and think. I feel like I'm extremely anxious all the time and I find it hard to just relax. I feel like I constantly need to be doing something productive or I'll slip and have nothing like my mother. I also struggle with trusting anything my mother says because she has yet to come out and admit to the drug use. She's still claiming she had a mental breakdown and as time goes on it makes me angrier to see her hold on to this lie as if we all don't know.

I guess my question or questions after this long post are.... does this sound like drug abuse to you? She's never outright said it and I've never seen it but I've now heard from multiple family members about her and M. Plus her overall decline in appearance, hygiene, and mood would make it make sense for me but idk..... Should I confront my mother about the drug abuse?......... how do I move on? ( I want nothing to do with my mother until she can be honest about what really happened to her )......and how do I not feel sad about not having graduated college yet? I'm so close to finishing ( I have about 57 more credits to go) but my anxiety makes me believe that something new with her will happen and I'll never be able to. I also have a lot of financial hardships due to neither of my parents being active in my life and thankfully I've been able to receive scholarships to pay for college through my amazing job but this past Friday was my last day with my job and I'm worried about paying for college in the future. I applied for an override form so I wouldn't be obligated to provide my parent's tax information but my school denied me even though I had proof that my mother was staying in a shelter and proof that I was supporting myself and have been. I'm feeling really down about where I'm at in life right now... all of my friends have graduated already and in so many different ways are surpassing me. I'm angry at my mother for causing all this stress and continuing to do so. To this day she doesn't understand the effect all of this has had on me. I get so discouraged everyday and I'm really hard on myself. I don't want to constantly be going through issues with my mom because I know I'm reaching my breaking point and If I let it, it will stop me from moving forward. At this point if something else major were to happen ...idk if I'd make it through.

I know this was a lot but any words of advice / encouragement are so needed right now.

844,"Hochschule Rhein-Waal

In Germany. My sis is planning to apply and she speaks only English and has no idea about her career path and still 21yrs old. What are the chances of getting a job after you're done with studies ?",20Aug2020,1
845,"This is going to be so so long, I'll sum it up in as few words as possible. Obligatory throwaway because my husband is active on reddit. I'm really needing outside guidance, and I expect to get some backlash since my situation is fucked up.

I (22f) got pregnant with my now husband (21m), who we'll call M, at 18. I'm prochoice but when it came down to it I couldn't abort. We'd been in a relationship for 2 years prior to this. So we both decided to have the baby. He was really excited. At 29 weeks our son was unexpectedly born. That was really hard not only being teen parents but also parents to a baby with special needs. We love him so much. We got married when he was in the NICU due to our own excitement and also some pressure from family. We really struggled. He had 2 brain surgeries at the time and his neurosurgeon told us because of the brain damage he would likely never walk or talk. We were looking at full care for the rest of our lives. I was not the best mom I could be. I had issues with drinking in the evenings because it helped me sleep instead of staying up all night wondering if we would get the call that our son didn't make it. M was cold to me, and was easy to anger. He told me he'd go to the hospital bathroom to ""revenge masturbate"" when he was upset at me. Stress was getting to the both of us, and I don't blame him for that. It seemed to get better once we were able to move back home into our own place with our baby and nurture him. But things only kept getting slowly worse and worse.

Fast forward to three years later. Our first is doing amazing. He walks, he talks, he has his challenges and was diagnosed with Cerebral Palsy by a neurologist but we expected that. He's in intensive physical and speech therapy. We also have a 1 year old who is a shining light.

 Where I need help is that I have been living a progressively worse life.

It feels like over the past 3 years M has been increasingly getting more upset, and less caring of my physical and mental wellbeing. When I was pregnant with our 2nd baby he pushed me down more than once. I kept thinking it would get better. I thought if I did more things would change. I'm not an expert on mental abuse but he would tell me I shouldn't feel a certain way, calling me names and ridiculous in front of the kids. When I would say I don't appreciate him saying that in front of the boys M would say he was just telling the truth.

I tried to get out last year and I thought things would change when M pushed me out our front door so forcefully I hit the concrete and scraped up my arms. My neighbor was outside and scooped me off the ground and took me to her place. My dad showed up about 20 minutes later. He drove me around for a while talking to me. I told him I didn't like where I was, that I was in a bad place mentally and physically. His solution was to drive me back and try again. After that I honestly lost hope. Everyone in my family and his told me to keep trying and things would get better. I believed them, and I wanted it to be the truth. We pursued counseling. Individually and joint. 

About three nights ago he hit me really really hard for the second time in our relationship. He made me sleep in the car because I wasn't allowed to waste money at a hotel. I called a friend, we'll call him T, I've known 6 years because I wanted to end it. Not only was T incredibly supportive but he offered to get me the hell out. T was going to book me the first ticket out of my town. He says he's really worried about my safety and wellbeing. That things will only get worse. I couldn't leave my boys so I stayed. But now T is trying to help me build a plan to escape my situation with both my boys, he's very financially stable and a good guy. This means leaving in the next few days. 

I am SO SCARED to uproot my boys. I am so scared to seem like I'm being dramatic to my family and them resenting me. I am so scared of hurting everyone in my life. Mostly my kids. M loves them and they both love him. I don't want to strip them of that. Maybe I should stay where I at least know what the demons are and my boys can still benefit from their dad. Or maybe I should get the hell out of dodge. I don't know what I would tell my dad, or other family. I don't want to seem ridiculous. 

TL;DR I'm in a potentially increasing DV situation and have the option to flee with my kids or stay where things are ""stable"" and not upset anyone. I am so lost.",20Aug2020,1
846,"M21, I’m a bartender in a local pub/restaurant and I’m a traditionally good looking guy (i dont know how to say that without sounding vain), I constantly get comments about my looks when i’m working, from both men and women, and a handful of times people have felt my arms or tried to make me lift my shirt up. I kinda get it’s just a bit of fun but two different coworkers kept touching me during my last shift unnecessarily. I know this is all minor but it does make me uncomfortable and i’m tired of having to put up. If anyone has any advice on how to do deal with it it would be greatly appreciated. Again, I know it’s only minor which is why it’s difficult to talk about but I know if one of the girls at work had comments made about her every shift and was touched without consent by customers and coworkers it would be a different story.",20Aug2020,1
847,"My toxic ex has been physically and verbally abusive throughout our 2 year relationship. Our main arguments were about his controlling and obsessive behavior. He would always fight with me about wanting to know how many guys I have slept with, how many sexual things I have done before him like how many guys I “sucked” and how many guys did it inside me. My ex had major anger issues- anything and everything could set him off. He would always accuse me of cheating every day- when I never did. He constantly through the relationship broke up with me over anything such as wearing a tight dress to Walmart bc I’m an “attention whore”. He would find anything about me as a problem and things just started to get progressively worse with time... eventually during our arguments he would spit in my face and has even slapped me across the face. He was upset that I lied about my body count but I can see why I lied bc he is a very judgmental person- I have only been with 6 other people besides him. Recently we had a really bad fight in which he asked me again sexual questions about my past- I told him that I already answered these questions therefore why  is he continuing this toxic cycle- why couldn’t he move on from my past... he then called me a C*NT, WH*RE, B*TCH, stupid, F*CK YOU, you can go f** you’re self, etc... btw for context he has called me every name you could possibly think of - and has even wished me to die on a couple of occasions.. now I know what your thinking? Why didn’t you leave- why put up with thins behavior- bc he would always apologize and I would believe that he would stop one day. I know I’m stupid. Back to the previous argument- he broke up with me again- at this point in time he had access to all my social media even my location when I had none of his— after he broke up with me I changed my passwords - and unshared my location. Eventually the next day he was doing the same thing apologizing and asking for another chance . Finally after two days of him constantly reaching out, I caved and gave him another chance- I told him to post back the photos he took down on me on Instagram and he told me he didn’t have access to his account anymore- when I asked him if he needed help- I logged back inside of his account- and saw a message he sent to a girl that he blocked that said “kissing you last night was amazing”. I ended up reaching out to the girl and she was super kind and told me all the information- that he met her on tinder and has been talking to her for a couple weeks- I then went overthis girls house and she gave me all the screenshots- when I still had access to his Instagram I screenshot it all the girls he had blocked. I message them and they sent me screenshots of him trying to take out girls since we have been together- commenting on there photos and harassing them. Some even told me that they had to block him in order for him to stop harassing them. I ended up breaking up with him and he was constantly sending me messages saying that he didn’t do anything with this girl- which was obviously a lie- he made out with her and that he was sorry, he told me that he wanted us to be together. And that he would seek therapy. I told him that we were really done- I then decided to make a Tinder account- just like him (:- out of spite - I know I’m wrong for this. He ended up finding out screenshot in my account and send it to my dad. The same week I wasn’t feeling so good and I took a pregnancy test. I just recently found out that I’m five weeks pregnant with his child. After not reaching out to him for a few days because I caught him cheating- I finally reached out to tell them that I was pregnant. I contacted his mother and father and told them first- I didn’t want to meet him alone because I was scared of his reaction and what he would do. He doesn’t get along with his mother therefore he didn’t want to meet in front of his parents about this. He eventually came over and was super nasty towards me. He kept saying that he will pay child support and wants nothing to do with me. Obviously I was super heartbroken because after everything that I have been through with this kid I thought that he would be decent enough to figure this out with me. He was being super nasty to me and said “ have those tinder guys help you”. He also was laughing and kept asking to leave already. I was crying my eyes out and I said pretty fucked up things to him. I’m hormonal and pregnant and told him that he’s a cheater and a fucked up person. He was screaming at me and calling me a whore etc. I basically told everyone that if I was going through this pregnancy alone that I would terminate it. And he was being such a dick saying have an abortion I don’t care. The last thing I said to him was that “I will never forgive you for this”. For context purposes- my ex has never graduated high school... at some point in our relationship we did lived together with his mom- but bc he was fighting with her he moved out and stayed with a family friend that is a lawyer. This lawyer is 30 years older than him and from my experience has a huge crush on him. The lawyer would feel uncomfortable with him taking me out on dates- and has even paid to go on trips with him- I know my ex is not gay but takes advantage of the situation- since this guy does anything to please him even give him a place to stay for free. Back to the story- The next day the lawyer that he lives with send me a text saying that “ he is representing my ex and that he desires no further contact with me- that if I try to communicate with him or through a third party they will file a restraining order against me?! I was never trying to contact him- only to tell him I was pregnant- I was seriously done with him after I caught him cheating. I then decided to file a restraining order myself against him - for the physical abuse of last month by slapping me across the face and I also have a recording audio that you can hear him saying he will kill me and shoot me in the back of the head. If anyone out of the two of us needed to file a restraining order- it would be me. I contacted a family lawyer- and she stated that if I choose to have this child despite the fact that he has been physical with me he will still have paternity rights to this child. Regardless of the restraining order or not. I know that he will fight with me and will hurt me through the end of time with this child - and now that he has legal aid for free- and this lawyer friend of his practices family law. I never believed in abortion- I have insane guilty issues. A part of me wants this child and a part of me doesn’t. I recently graduated college with my bachelors in science- my intention was to apply for medical school in 2021- but because I just found out I’m pregnant I’m not sure if I should continue with this pregnancy or terminate it. I’m 23 years old, I’m devastated, and now I realize I will be going through this alone- I have a set court date to extend the restraining order- but I’m not going to attend it- based on what the family lawyer told me it won’t make a difference with his paternity rights- which is one of the main reason I filed for the safety of this child. I don’t want this child to Go through the abuse I did. I want to know if you were in my shoes would you go through with the abortion or would you have this child. I feel partially already attached is this child- I know I will never forgive myself if I terminate the pregnancy- but I do want to pursue my dreams and find the right person one day- and I don’t know if I can do that with a child- espicslly alone. At the moment my ex hasn’t contacted me but he’s putting random girls names in his Instagram bio just to hurt me. I wish I didn’t care about this kid- little by little I’m detaching myself more and more. Please give me advice about this pregnancy and if I should terminate it or not thank you",20Aug2020,1

I’ve been living with her over this covid period due to my contract running out back at uni and my course being delayed. 
I have a job lined up currently once I finish my last placement starting in January. 
She has been giving me hints that I should move out and have a place of my own after I go back to univeristy to finish my last placement. I completely agree that I definitley need to move out and she and I can both have our space.

Even though it’s understandable what she is saying and I am an adult now I guess I’ve been feeling slightly abandoned again after a lot of stuff that happened when I was 18 and being homeless because of her but I know I need to move on.

861,"I posted something similar a couple of weeks ago with only one response. The situation has continued so I thought I might ask again. 

TDLR; how can I encourage my boyfriend to keep actively looking for employment?

So, my boyfriend was fired a couple of weeks ago. He started to apply to some jobs right away and got some responses. He had a couple of interviews which all seemed to go well. He was offered one but upon further conversation with the company it became very clearly it was going to be a toxic environment so he declined. I agreed with him on it and told him it was better to keep looking for something that would be good for him. 

Now a couple weeks have passed and the well of interviews has dried up. Ive tried looking around for him but he just kind of brushes it off. Ive suggested he at least apply for some social assistance so we can pay bills. He's extremely against it. He figures we can just borrow from family if he doesn't find something. I'm very against this since we already owe money for emergency payments to our owe respective families. We've also worked hard the last couple of years to get our debts down and at this rate, we're just going to fall into a hold again. 

It's annoying me to see that he's only applying for a job or two a day and not making any other efforts. I know he feels depressed so I'm not trying to grill him but I'm extremely worried about having to support us both when I can barely support myself.

Any advice on how I can encourage him to keep actively looking?",20Aug2020,1
862,"Soo as the title says my boyfriend has been in Cancun for a little bit. We’re an interracial couple I’m 20 and chocolate he’s 26 and white (it’ll matter later). He told me that we can hang out the day he comes home I said no I’m not hanging out with you until you get tested and everything and then I realized that’s not even long enough. He doesn’t believe in covid he think it’s a plot for the government to see how much control they have. He makes a scene about wearing a mask he pouts or he’ll just not go into a store. From studies African American people are getting hit hard Because it’s common for us to have underlying health conditions (diabetes,hbp,obesity etc etc). Im a little concerned at how much he’s willing to gamble with his life and the lives of others. He doesn’t believe in covid I understand but the facts, the science,the doctors and nurses on the side of medicine are begging people hey even if you don’t believe wear a mask please and he’s like hmph no. God forbid he comes home And has it or spreads it to his parents or myself or I take it home and it seems like he doesn’t care as long as he gets to go to Mexico and his life and liberties remain the same. I understand covid sucks, being in the house way more than normal sucks , job loss, poverty ,death, ignorance ,racism everything in the world is a dumpster fire right now but people are literally being asked to just stay home and or wear a mask and having full blown ass tantrums like little ass kids.

I've spent around $150 since then on stuff for myself (mostly just games I've been wanting to play for a while, some makeup and food). My mom asked me recently what I've done with the money and when I told her what I mentioned previously, she said that's ""bad"" and I should save the money for college, saying that those $600 were my plane ticket to college (since I'm an international student), and that I should save the money. The thing is, I go to college a whole year from now. I don't plan on spending it all, I'd like to save at least $200 just for emergencies, but the money was gifted to me to spend.

865,"Hey there, so this’ll be part rant and part advice seeking. So 3 weeks ago, my girlfriend broke up with me. She “couldn’t open up” which I today found out was completely bullshit and she only said that because she didn’t trust me. Now the real reasons were that 1 she was in love with my best friend, and 2 she didn’t feel like we were a good fit. Today was the second time I talked to her again after the breakup, and she told me the real reasons today. The first time I talked to her, we agreed to being close friends. Today I told her that I couldn’t be close friends with her because she didn’t trust me, and she was in love with my best friend (only found that out today) but I still gave her another chance, because she is a great person and I love deeply as a friend.
Is this wrong?

866,"My husband and I live near a small park. We take our daughter there every morning and most afternoons. It has some zig-zag paths are perfect for small bikes or a stroller, lots of trees and a trash can on every corner. Despite this, people leave a lot of trash, so every other day we bring a bucket and pick it up. We genuinely don’t mind because we love this park and want it to look nice (and we don’t want our daughter picking up someone’s old napkin or Four Loco can.) 
There’s an elderly woman who sprinkles shelled peanuts around the base of the trees every single day. I’ve asked her why she does it, explained that it creates an artificial food supply, increases the squirrel populations, etc. She refuses to look at me for more than thirty seconds and walks away bidding me good day. Neither of us are nasty to each other, but we’re not getting anywhere. I’ve made one complaint to the city, but they have bigger issues to focus on than some squirrels being over fed.

He did throw our dog across the pond though, because there was poo all over the house. He admit's this, but when I told him that it is his fault, he say's 'I know, I should have thrown your Mum across the pond instead. Do you really think it is OK that there was poo all over the house, when you were kid's?' I was not saying it was OK, just that my Mum shouldn't be thrown across the pond for it. He does think he has never done anything wrong though. If I say that he think's he is perfect, he denie's it, and he say's, it is my problem. I don't know, maybe he really is that perfect. Sometime's when I bring up thing's he has said to me, he deny's them. He has said to me, 'what if the women's alway's nagging', and 'you're Granddad say's, he would not blame me, if I hit your Mum'.  I remember that someone hit someone with a frying pan, my Dad said it was not him, but won't speak about my Mum. I have alway's believed my Dad hit my Mum.

I did not see my Dad for six week's, and then we moved into a women's refuge. My Mum had another abusive boyfriend, who she did not leave, until I begged her too. He didn't frequently hit her, but he was very angry. He threw a baseball bat around, we had to run away from him, he threw wine over my Mum, and jumped on our car whilst driving. That's all I remember, so maybe, that was not as bad as I thought at the time. My Dad also used to speak to me a lot about my Mum, from a really young age. He has told me every bad thing she has ever done, so I am not really sure why he can't talk to me about this. Maybe, I am just being insensitive. I remember me and my brother telling my Mum she was a slut for dying her hair purple. Kid's don't just get that from nowhere. My Dad said he may have said a comment, but he was not abusive. I remember having to go out, late at night, to pick my Mum up, because she was at her friend's, and she was supposed to be home, so we had to go and get her. That was the night we left.

1. I lived in a dorm for 9 months, i guess the guy who is working there saw me smoking once and my dad has his number. He could ask him and find out.

2.My dad has close friends over here, he could just call one of them and send to my house.

898,"As a 22(f) I don’t feel like I have much of a temper in general. But when I am in the kitchen it’s like I am a completely different person. I think it’s actually difficult for someone to make me mad, I become sad far more easily, with the exception for when I am cooking/baking. I become some kind of terrible monster control freak of a person and I hate it. Whenever I leave the kitchen to cool down I regret the way I responded to the situation. Firstly, I love to bake and cook. I have been doing it since I was little, I especially like to bake sweets and my mother would always say “You’re baking again?!” In a scolding manner. This was because she didn’t like that I would make so many sweets but I hated hearing her say that because even if I didn’t eat them I felt like I was getting in trouble/being scolded for something I enjoyed doing. Now as an adult whenever someone asks me what I’m baking it triggers me and makes me feel like they are asking me and about to scold me for making food. I also become a control freak and actually hate when people try to help me cook. I never tell people that I hate it because that would be rude but I cringe at how they do things when I think I’m my head if I had done it, it would have come out how i wanted it done. Now there is no real right or wrong way of cooking, there are preferences, but omg when someone is trying to brown meat and they leave it on low flame and put a lid on it... that throws me over and I’d rather just leave the kitchen at that point.

But, I knew that it was wrong considering every time I would hear my mom come near the room he would rush to put on his pants and I followed suit. He kept saying that he wanted to put it in me and told me when he had to pee he would tell me to pull my pants down and stick it in me (I guess he thought a guy cumming was them just peeing). This went on for the entirety of his visit and I never told a single soul about this. For most of my teenage life I have been super comfortable and open about sex and hooking up with guys but after all of them even though for some reason I feel really powerful minutes later I want to scream and cry. Can this be considered some sort of sexual harassment or trauma considering he was also a child himself? I feel terrible because even after this I became increasingly sexual and interested in sex and stuff. I get petrified at the thought of my parents inviting my older cousin over again but I wasn't scared at the time. I am almost 20 now and just thinking about his visit makes me want to shrivel up and cry.",20Aug2020,1

I feel really bad and awful for hurting my mom's feelings but not so much my dad as he was belittling me throughout the whole thing. My dad talked to me this morning saying that  I should apologize to my mom but I think it's kind of awkward and I don't want it to seem forced or insincere. Should I apologize today or wait a bit more? Also, why did they get so angry if I rarely get into trouble?

910,"Basically, ive been friends with one of them (V) for like 2 years, another for 1 and a half (L), one for 1 year (I), and 2 for a couple months(B and S). We’re all the same age as well btw

V and I have been best friends for ages and S and V are together. We’ve got a discord and I’ve found out that I can only see some of the channels, and that everyone else talks in ones I can’t see sometimes. Ik they exist cause I’ve seen them when me and V went over I’s house and I used her laptop for a bit and saw them. Ik they talk I then fairly frequently because nobody will be saying anything and one of them will randomly level up. It’s not that I’m anxious they’re talking about me in there, it’s the fact that I can’t see them, and plus I had said multiple times that she only considers 3 of us friends and doesn’t really like the other 2, I’m pretty sure I’m one of the ones she doesn’t like cause they all talk in DM’s and I talk to no one, only in group chats.

We’ve had a few things come up before, like one big argument where I almost got kicked out the group, a smaller one that was kind of out of no where cause I said something, B got offended and I said “my bad”. I said it was an accident cause but they were still mad about it so I said sorry properly in DM’s. There was also another thing which kind of pushed this all forwards after the hidden channel thing. Turns out I doesn’t like being touched and I can be, quite aggressive, let’s say, when we meet. I never got that vibe from her when we met. But I said sorry for that so yeah. 

But like, it’s just that I can’t see their conversations and I’m pretty sure I doesn’t even like me. There’s a chance she does, cause she made me, V and L a pfp and no one else but she talks to S in DM’s a fair bit as well as V and L so I still don’t think she likes me. Like, I just dk where to go cause I like them, like I really do, and they mean a lot to me so I can’t lose them, but I just get the feeling that they don’t like me and don’t wanna talk to me. 

Fuckin like, and I feel like I might have a crush on I but I’m Tryna convince myself otherwise cause V always says how she (I) isn’t looking to be in a relationship rn and plus, I doesn’t even seem to like me anyway so it woudlnt really work.

911,"So around the start of the year we hired a new person to our team at work. We're a relatively small team of 4, growing to 5 very soon. We all get along very well however I grew quite fond of the newbie that was hired at the start of the year.


At first I just pegged it as nothing more than an infatuation and assumed it would pass, I didn't want to instantly pursue her because she was new to the company and we're on the same team so work very closely (By which I mean, we literally sit next to each other on a row of desks) which can always cause complications. The infatuation did not go away and has, in fact grown over the months gone by and it concerns me.


We're both single, we're quite close although it's hard for me to tell at times if she is flirting or if she is just being nice and the last thing I want to do is misread anything. There are some days where I think she could definitely be interested and other days where I think she would instantly shoot me down. Honestly? I can see it going both ways because she isn't the kind of person to pursue anyone, she is shy and nervous especially in emotional situations.


The issue is, is that I don't know if I should tell her how I feel. the more I think about the more I feel like I would be willing to take a chance on dating someone from work despite the pitfalls and risks that come with it, I just don't want to make things awkward between us if she doesn't feel the same as I do.


What should I do Reddit? Should I sit on my feelings or should I tell her? Should I be direct about it or should I try and beat around the bush and see if she gets the message? I'm so confused by all of this and I honestly have no idea where to go with it.

That blushing emoji means something? That too double emojis... During school days we both were kind of shy.  How do I start to text her out of the blue. Anything helps.

my mom is extremely controlling, paranoid and kinda just an asshole. im not even allowed to go to the mall with my friends and i am in highschool. she also is really emotionally stunted by the fact me and my sister are growing up, she constantly tells us old stories or guilts us whenever we want to go to a friends house. she also tends to favor my twin sister, for example one time we got into a play fight and my sister told my mom i hit her. my mom came upstairs and screamed at me while holding me in a chokehold against the wall for like 2 minutes really hard. i had bruising on my neck. , but if it was vice versa she would just tell me to stop being so sensitive.  but in the beginning of quarantine i got sick of it and started to do my own thing. the one thing i was allowed to do was go on bike rides around my community, so i would tell her i was going out on my bike and i would go to my friends houses, smoke weed, or get picked up by people like my bf. i was going out every day for hours. i was honestly really happy. but i recently got caught. i came home high, and she sort of lost her mind. now shes treats me like shit. 

she took my phone, calls me an asshole all of the time, says i dress slutty, am a failure and disappointment and i am going to end up dead or pregnant. she blows up on me, like yesterday i was literally in the shower and she started screaming in my face for ""being fresh"". its like nothing i do can please her and no matter how hard i try its never enough. ive been cleaning the house, doing laundry, cooking, taking care of our dog etc.

928,"Btw, i apologize in advance for my English, since it is not my native language.

I don't even know where to start, i am so lost and confused...

For as long as i remember, my dad has always been a very affectionate person. He always shows my mother how much he loves her, and i think it is good for a couple to kiss and hug in front of the children, i think it's healthy. What is not healthy at all is when the lines are crossed.

Would you touch the boobs of you wife and whisper dirty things into her ears in front of guests ? Or in front of your collegues, or friends ? I din't think so. Well my father doesn't do that too. However, he does this in front of me and my sister !

Back when i was a kid, i didn't see the problem. I mean, i would always make a weird face and puke, as many children do (i believe), but as i started to grow old, discover the sexuality, getting around the age of 12-13 and understanding what is intimate and what is not, i started to notice the things that happened in my home. I was disgusted, and i still am. Today, i am 21, i still live with them, and i witness these sexual touches EVERYDAY. 

Maybe i am exaggerating, maybe i am wrong, but i believe it's even more wrong to just get up from your sit, inserting your hand into the shirt of your wife and saying in a low tone dirty things to your wife's ear, all of this while you have 2 young girls around you AND while they are still eating at the table !

I've been seeing a psychiatrist for some time (it was because of my dad's mental health, he had some problems and at some point, i couldn't really handle the situation well, so i thought i might get some help and get better, and also for other reasons). This psychiatrist happens to be the same as my dad's. Okay, why not. When i talked to her about it, she clearly told me that it wasn't normal and that she needed to have a word with him.

I am so happy to know that somebody supports me in this. It may seem like it's not a big deal, idk, i am honestly so lost. I've already got mad at him many times for doing it and not understanding where the problem was, he doesn't even want to listen to me. Just today, we were in the living room with ny grandmother (my dad's mother), and my mom was sitting right next to me. He came to sit next to her and whispered nasty things again while getting his hand close to my mom's intimacy. I litterally yelled and him and said ""You know what i'll just leave so you can finger my mom's pussy in piece."" 

I also told him he had no respect for me for doing such things in front if me, nor my grandmother, nor my mom for thinking that she is just standing there waiting to be touched. He even told me ""We will se if you won't do that in front of your kids later ! We will see how you'll behave with you're husband !"". I am sorry, but no !!! Yes to the pecs, yes to the hugs, but no to the hands into your wife's panties in the middle if the kitchen !

My mom even scolded me (even if most of the times she also tries to refuse the touches of my dad) for telling him this, and she put all of this into the ""he is a very affectionate man"" box and also blamed his mental health. Sorry, but that doesn't apply. Even if it was the case, he has common sense (i mean, at least when it comes to other things, at least), he knows what is wrong and right, and what is fine to do in public, because i even asked him and he said he wouldn't do such things in public, so to me, it can't be all because of his mental health.

I admit that i was a bit harsh when i said those words, and i feel guilty for bursting out, but i just want to feel safe and not have to leave everytime they are in the same room as me. I want him to understand that he has a teenage girl and a young adult in his home, who has been telling him for almost 10 years to restrain himself, i want him to understand that PDA is fine until it gets sexual. I don't know what to do, please help me !

It was very long, sorry. Thank you if you read until the end and i wish you a wonderful day. Blessings for you !",20Aug2020,1

931,"I (21F) am about to enter my fourth year of undergrad and have had a student job as a graphic designer for almost one year now. My supervisor is a very outspoken and passionate woman—this was something I actually admired about her... until quarantine hit.

I understand that quarantine has caused everyone a lot of emotional stress, but this has resulted in my boss being harsher and aggressive. I feel like the outcome of our meetings is a gamble depending on her mood. Recently, I had simply asked if I could send her a draft of a project a day later than what she wanted (which she never mentioned that she wanted it earlier until I asked). Mind you, if she had politely explained why she wanted it sooner, I would have just said okay and we would have moved on. This wasn’t a situation where I was unable to complete the draft by the time she wanted.

But because I asked if it was possible, she completely went off on me to the point where I had a mental breakdown in front of her. I am very sensitive, and while I can handle direct criticism, I cannot handle being spoken to in a rude tone. I have NEVER submitted anything late in my entirety of working there and my work has always been quality. I did not feel like I deserved to be scolded for “not respecting the time of others” (even though she has given me very last minute projects before), when this project was literally just a few minute long video. All she had to do was take those few minutes out of her day to watch it and tell me what she wanted changed. Her argument was if she wanted to spend a few days to think about the changes she wanted.

That massive financial stressed caused me to not do well in my classes and because of that i was dismissed from my major and had to change to a general business degree because it has a lower GPA requirement. I attempted to take my own life after this happened and was put into a psych hospital.

Then a month after that i was arrested by my campus police for skateboarding and had to use all my remaining money for rent and living expenses on legal fees and then had to drop out during the summer term due to all the financial hardship and PTSD i develop from a violent campus officer who was abusing his authority.

Im going back to school next month full time but i feel like because i cant get aid the financial hardship will be too much for me... i just want to graduate but i feel like the education system doesnt want me to succeed. 

Im just so tired of working s**ty minimum wage retail jobs... i want a career and for the past 10 years ive tried so hard to finish my undergrad but now that im almost at the finish line i dont see any hope..

I had to downgrade to a ""dumb major"" and now i have an arrest record so who would want to hire me now anyways... i feel like a complete failure

What would u do in my shoes..?",20Aug2020,1

I texted her and asked if she was interested. She texted me back with, that at the moment she doesn't have the money and won't be ordering this years clothing item. Now I believe, that I put her in an embarrasing situation by asking her personally. How do I respond? I want to make sure I don't shame her or make her feel like it is a big deal or a problem.

939,"My [22] sister [17] just lost a friend [16]. It was out of the blue and very upsetting. 

We have been in quarantine for the duration of Covid because my mom is a germaphobe afraid of the world. The most at risk individual in my household is me, and I just have asthma, which is quite debatable as far as risk goes.

My parents have decided that there’s no way she can go to this funeral because we’re in a bit of a hotspot and there will be a lot of people grieving.

I feel like this not only takes away more control my sister has in her own life, but also robs her of proper grieving. She really wants to go and has not been eating much and sleeping all day.

I have tried reasoning and bargaining with them, saying that I will take care of her and sequester her in her room (I know that doesn’t do much for covid, but my mom thinks it does).

Is there a way I can sway them to at least give her the choice? Is there anything I can say to quell their fears? Am I wrong in thinking my sister should go to the funeral?",20Aug2020,1
940," For a background I'm a 13 year old female who is currently role playing with a 40 year old female. I didn't mind this sense. I'm one of those role players who genuinely doesn't care. Unless the other person ticks me off. which this lady did. Me and this lady have been role playing for 3 days and I know more about her then I know about my closest friends. (this oc was a double up meaning we were both playing multiple characters)

I definitely feel like a dick for this and I need advice. In the role play this female puts herself in an oc. To make her oc unique. which I find ok. there were a few things I didn't like about her oc that screamed ""I'M DIFFERENT! I'M AMAZING! IM PERFECT'' it wouldn't be the first time i've role played with someone like that. I usually don't mind it. thought it got to the point where she would change my oc's scenario or completely ignore my oc. She would either do this for her oc or if she had an idea. I found this aggravating and confronted it about it. she started using the sad emojis. not this (;-;) but an actual emoji. she started saying i'm sorry and stuff like this. I'm a person who is extremely sympathetic towards people and this leaves me to continue to keep bad people in my life. I forgave her despite her being pretty upset with me for it. I don't know if she was trying to guilt trip me to feel bad. Though It worked if she wasn't trying

The more we role played the more she talked about. This made me concerned how much she was talking about herself. because if i wasn't a 13 year old female and a 40 year old man. This could be a bad situation. This woman is in her 40's on a website that people my age uses. it was to the point where I knew so much about this woman and she knew nothing, NOTHING about me. she wouldn't even ask what I was doing. or if I said I was doing something cool she wouldn't really care. once again i'm going to repeat this SHES IN HER 40'S

Well I confronted her about this and she broke down. I mentioned these things, you're self centered, your oc is self centered, and your oc is a Mary sue. I had also given her constructive criticism to help her not seem perfect and op. She said I was making her cry. saying if she said how she felt i would think she was self centered. I told her that it was ok to talk about your feelings. she started getting defensive about how i shouldn't think her oc was a Mary sue for saying it was like her (which i didn't say) and that i shouldn't think her oc was self centered. while still acting like I shouldn't be saying this. Then after saying it she would use the ""...."" and say honestly is the policy. then proceed to get upset that i'm GIVING HER CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM.

Like I mentioned I'm 13 and we teenagers are ""so very heartless"". I did say things that could be considered rude. I truly believe I'm being an asshole. my close online friend says she completely disagrees. I had sent her screenshots (which I will not be sharing) I still believe I'm a major asshole for making a 40 year old woman cry. she fucked me all up. I do think I could have approached it easier. At the same time she is an adult. She told me she had mental problems which i will not mention. She's an adult and if she cries over a 13 year old trying to give her advice about an oc. I don't know. All that she said to me is really getting to me.",20Aug2020,1

942,"I'm going to try to keep this as short as possible. Is is possible to be HAPPY and successful in your early 20s? The overwhelming amount of stories I've heard from people has suggested otherwise. Usually, people who seem to have gotten things together are around 35-50 and they look back on their 20s with a sort of reserved condemnation for how young and naive they were, or more simply, how much they messed up during those early years of freedom. I am currently trying to get my shit together as much as possible but I find myself slipping up from time to time, indulging in things that I know I shouldn't indulge in. **I feel like I can give myself a pass in most cases though, because after all, I'm only 20.** These stories people tell make me feel like I shouldn't be so hard on myself. But I know it's completely possible to get my life together at this age, just look at people in history that have changed the world at this age.

943,"I'm going to try to make this as short and to the point as possible. 

My bf and I are in a long distance relationship and we lied to our parents to travel and meet up a few times on vacation. It is a year into our relationship and I have told him I no longer want to lie to our parents about it and gave him the month of August to tell his parents. I want him to tell his parents bcuz they are more strict then mine. I was to deal with that so that I could tell my mom and it would be easy. 

However in the mean time. 2 days ago I got into a massive fight with my mom which is rare bcuz I'm really close to my mom but during the fight my mom said 3 things that stuck with me: 

1. She knows I traveled with my bf and that I have a bf 
2. My cousin ratted me out to her 
3. My best friend is trashy 

So once my mom told me she knows about my bf and I I immediately told my bf I can't do this anymore unless he tells his parents and we can move forward and I don't wanna talk to him until he tells his parents. It's been 3 days and he still hasn't. 

Secondly I stopped talking to my cousin who ratter me out to my mom. He's like my best friend and actually met my bf already so I feel betrayed he'd do something like that to me. He said it slipped but idk. He hasn't apologized for it and instead made a group chat where he invited my siblings and I to his house for a movie this weekend and I don't really want to go or see him. 

Lastly, my mom's comment about my best friend really put me off bcuz he's always over and is so kind and loving ECT. He always is so nice to everyone including my mom and talks to me mom all the time but she thinks he's trashy? Just makes me want to not have the two of them in the same room because if she thinks of him like that it's not fair for him to be there and not know. Idk. 

Since all this happened I've been really hurt,sad, and confused. I don't know what to do all the ppl closest to me betrayed me. I'm not talking to my mom, bf, or cousin. 

Should I talk to my bf even tho he hasn't told his parents? Or should I wait til he tells his parents and if he doesn't just end it? 

Should I go to my cousins for the movie and ignore how he ratted me out even tho he has ignored it and hasn't apologized? 

Should I still have my best friend over and ignore my mom's comments? Even tho I think I would feel so uncomfortable having the two of them around each other considering she thinks hes trash.

I want to open up a bank account with a digital bank as they have a 7% interest rate annually compounded monthly. 

They relatively new to the block compared to other banks (I live in South Africa) however other redditors and forums had some decent things to say about them (besides customer support, that wasn't bad or good, just meh)

Anyways, I told my mum I wanted to move this R10k into that new bank account savings. She said no because the bank is new and she doesn't trust them.

Like I understand right. They new to the block but they got good reviews. I don't want my money just chilling in my savings account with a 3% max interest rate (still dk anything about how its compounded - very vague)

951,"A year and a half ago I(14M at the time) met a guy(15M) in a hiking camp. He was really talkative and we made friends while living together in a tent for 2 weeks straight. He said he had mental problems and I was supporting him throughout the whole trip. After coming home, we were chatting occasionally and at one point he invited me to his city(a suburb of mine). I went there and he offered to buy light drinks. Being a dumb curious teenager I was(I've never drank before), I accepted. Soon he became kind of a drinking buddy to me, as I had serious family problems and this became a coping method for me. 

Some time later I invited him to my place. He started sharing his opinions and it was a huge red flag that I ignored because I was blinded by a new feeling of feeling understood and being supportive. Don't get me wrong, I respect all opinions, but he was homophobic and atheist and he was really radical about his views. He cut a couple of his friends(and he literally bragged about it) because of them being Christian and he told me a lot of times how he hated LGBT and how he said that all homosexuals need to be murdered. (I'm not exaggerating, it is a real quote and it is a common opinion where I live). It was a red flag for me because I'm gay, but at that time I was closeted and wasn't taking those statements as dangerous. 

At one point I've talked him out of commiting suicide. I kinda took helping him as a responsibility. He was calling me saying that he was depressed and I listened to him and supported. I've encouraged him to seek medical attention and fight his problems but he seemed to be too weak(so I thought).

After one of my visits to his city he had to make a commute with his mom on his car and they offered me a ride. During the ride they got into a heated argument about his mental condition. At this point I opened my eyes. He just loved being ""depressed"". He didn't want to get help. He said that he didn't need any help. Later I found out he adored the depressive aesthetic). He was literally bragging about his problems and even got into a screaming fit when his mom said he needed to do something about it.  

In autumn I've switched schools. I was always interested in liberal arts and I was accepted into a hist/lit class in one of the better schools of my city. For the first time in my life, I've gotten real friends. I started digging into scientific litherature and binge reading (the pandemic kinda helped me out because I had more time), and soon I understood that I was no longer interested in being friends with this guy.   We just had completely different interests and I was convinced he was faking it and emotionally abusing me. We also didn't meet throughout pre-covid 2020 and I flat out refused all offers to meet during covid because I was adamant about quarantine - I have a weak handicapped family member and if he gets the virus from me, she may die. I explained it to him and yet still he was mad about my refusal. 

Now I need help. I need to cut contacts with him but:

A) we didn't meet for a very long time but he keeps calling me asking to meet and I know he won't just give up and forget about me

B) I'm sure he won't understand if I just tell him and we will get into an argument. I hate conflicts and I am afraid he won't just let me go on.

C) He might do something to me. He knows where I live and he is affiliated with a group of people who are known for beating people when they're asked to. I also don't have any self-defense (even buying pepper spray is illegal here until 18) and I walk alone a lot.

952,"Hello! I am new to this subreddit but I come here seeking advice for my current situation. It's been bothering me for awhile and I need help; I think my mother is trying to emotionally manipulate me and guilt trip me.

For context:
I am a 20 year old female who's currently in college and lives at home with my mother and two younger siblings. I suffer from major depressive disorder and anxiety disorder, and I think that I have PTSD as well. My mother raised me and all of my siblings (I have 6 siblings on my mom's side) in the church as she is an avid believer. Most of my older siblings fell away from church and do their own thing, and I find myself feeling the same way. I don't even know if I truly believe in a God and it deeply hurts to say that. I'm not an atheist; I'm probably more of an agnostic if anything and due to experiences I've had with church and religion, I really don't like going to church services anymore. We don't get a say in what church we go to as wherever she goes, we have to follow. It's suffocating; I even have mini panic attacks and break out in sweats on Sunday mornings because I get so much anxiety and depression thinking about church. It just sucks out all my energy and I've even had to run to the church bathroom to have my anxious breakdowns.

My mom doesn't appreciate that I don't enjoy church as much as I did as a child and early teen. She's forced me to all the time in the past, makes comments about how I'm not taking care of my soul or even care about it, she even got physical with me on some occasions (choked me, pulled my hair, yelled in my ear, etc.), kicked me out of the house, berated me and told me that I have demons possessing me, giving me the silent treatment and not acknowledging me when she comes back home from church or doing the opposite and rubbing it in my fave that the service was oh so great, etc. Keep in mind, I still live at home cuz I never got a job or anything while in high school and work part time on campus at a community college so I can't really afford to live on my own. Plus I love my family too much to leave my younger siblings alone as we are around the same age and have a tight bond.

To cope with my depression, I try to hang out with my few friends whenever I can. I never really got to hang out with my friends much outside of school growing up so I've been trying to get more freedom in my life while I'm still young. However, everytime I want to go out with my friends, my mother always makes comments about how I'm not caring for my soul but would much rather care about my friends, how I'm turning my back on God and my upbringing, how she shouldn't let me go anywhere if I'm not worshipping God, and all types of other passive-aggressive jabs at me. She says I must convince her to let me go; I could give her a reason such as it's my friend's graduation party and he's never had a proper graduation so this is very important, and she'll hint that I don't deserve to go if I'm not receiving The Word. The church we attend does live streams of the services and I said I can just watch those but she demands that I need to be physically present.

The party scenario was actually real and she danced around the church thing, expressing other concerns such as the pandemic and all that jazz cuz my friend's brother had covid but recovered, but it was still understandable. They had a couple months to make sure everything was good. I then brought up that she was just fine when a member from the church had it but came back almost right after she started to feel fine. That's when she changed up her answer and revealed that I wasn't going because I needed to show my loyalty to God and the church.

This has been all going on for a while now and it's driving me up a wall. What should I do?",20Aug2020,1

I hope it’s alright for me to write here &amp; sorry that it’s long. 

Learning driving is/was my 2020 resolution  so I was working on that and lockdown happened. Please note that I &amp; my family never had a car in my life, I never seated at the driver seat not even for fun, joke etc. I’m absolute beginner &amp; this was the first thing I told the instructor. Also I told that I want to try &amp; learn manual but I’m not sure about my hand &amp; foot coordination so if not promising I can change to automatic car.

I (F28) started taking driving lessons about a week ago, on 14th Aug. The instructor is obviously really experienced &amp; everything with his high scores, also more expensive than the most. I was pretty nervous at first lesson, I thought it was normal. I stalled a couple of times &amp; apparently I struggle with parking and stopping. 

I had my second lesson on Wednesday &amp; made really simple &amp; stupid mistakes ; stalled, forgot to signal &amp; mirror check, went too close to curbs &amp; cars etc. With every mistakes he started to get frustrated “why do you get sooo close you will hit the curb it’s not good for the wheels, why do wait so long for biting point it’s not good for the car,  move off already you don’t need to take ages (mumbling)” etc. With each of these comments my anxiety crawled up and I made more mistakes. 

When we were practicing turning right around the block, at some point freaked out and left the steer &amp; said “please stop it(car), please stop it” he stopped the car moved it away then gave me the control again, wanted to do a couple more turning around the block but after the first time, I said I wanted to finish &amp; go.  

I couldn’t sleep that night without taking CBD oil for I was so tense &amp; my anxiety was pretty bad. He wrote my about my next lesson but even the thought of it makes me wanna cry. I don’t know how to reply his message. No one owes anyone anything. I paid per lesson before each lesson, no block booking or anything.

957,"About two years ago my girlfriend (I’ll call her Beth), a publicist, quit her 9-5 PR job to start doing freelance work. Slightly before then her former colleague and very close friend started her own “PR firm”, I put in quotations because her clientele consisted solely of the business her parents owned. Beth had lined up steady freelance work within a week of leaving her job. Not long after that, her friend contacted her about starting to work with her to grow her business and they would split the earnings from potential clients 50/50. Note: ownership of the business was not discussed.

Fast forward 2 years later, Beth and her friend have grown the business larger than they could have hoped to this point. Both have signed roughly the same amount of clients and do the same work. 

The issue: the friend recently brought up that the goal of the company was to have it acquired at some point in the distant future. They had never discussed this before and technically Beth doesn’t have any stake in the company. This could mean that one day Beth’s friend could sell the company that Beth has had a monumental part in growing and cultivating and could see absolutely nothing for it. 

Beth brought this to her friend’s attention, proposing that she gain some stake in the company, as one might have in working for a start up. After all, half of the company’s success can be directly attributed to Beth’s work (not to mention taking on tons of financial instability). Beth’s friend was shocked by request and staunchly refused. 

I recognize that stake in the company should have been discussed from the beginning and her friend has the right to deny Beth. However, the friend regularly expresses  how “their business” would have never happened without Beth, how they are an equal team, etc.. As one could imagine, this situation has caused frustration and a feeling of betrayal. 

Seeking any advice on whether Beth has a right to be upset at this situation and how she could handle this moving forward.

I spent last night staying late binge watching videos of the chef on YouTube. Just watching videos about food and how its made and some nuggets of history and information and anthropology.

I worked on my socio-economics excel chart last night, then finished it up this morning, ready at 7:30am for a phone call with XX1. That went well, we talked about XX2, we solved some issues with the data - counting metrics regarding follow up calls for social engagement and attachment ( a new metric) - and I also helped XX1 with her Scroll Lock issue.

I spoke to my family, mom, papa. Me, XX3 and XX4 had a group phonecall and we could hear the baby cooing in the background.

I sent XX5 ideas for the icebreaker activity and she really liked my idea for a XX6 Bingo. We even had a phone call and made up some statements for the 5x5 bingo grid.

Now the rest of the day is my own.

What shall I write about. I am going to find prompts. Brb. 

WHO AM I?

5 people who I am spending most time with and why. How are they affecting my thoughts, behaviours and life.

The 5 people I've spent time with this week are:

1. XX4

I am spending more time with XX4 because I am in XX2 this week. We are both similar in the sense that we're quiet and shy and anxious thinkers. In different ways perhaps, but you can't escape the similarities. People of few words.

Spending time with XX4 is making me take more responsible decisions for my life ahead. He brought up conversations about why I choose XX7 of all places, what I want to do there, study, take upon as a career. Whether renting out my place before finding a place of my own or even a job was the best move. I got to talk about the work that I do at work. I got to think about job hunting in XX7 and taking that on more seriously by making actionable steps rather than just having a floating idea that I keep announcing (those are my words, not his).

Spending time with XX4 makes me feel a sense of support, that I have a responsible adult to my disposable for help. A big brother might I say so. I feel cared for in a way, in a material way. 

He also inspires me with everything he's able to pull of with the pressures in his life I see him taking pleasure in his biking and eating and some little things like that and managing and getting along so I find that inspiring and motivating for me to make use of my blessings at times when I feel depressed and pathetic.

I also feel like a bigger person when I am able to be patient with him, or celebrate little wins like when I am pretty sure I impressed him with my nice ideas like getting tandoori chicken that first Saturday, or when I suggested that he cook the meat before the mushrooms. He also liked how I sliced them. And that stew turned out so good. :)

2. Papa, Mom

I've made it sort of a routine to talk to them every night while here. Last night however even though we spoke, we spoke separately from XX4 because I got home before he did because he stayed outside to be on the phone.

I feel like the last 2 days we haven't connected as much, but staying in touch with my parents makes me not feel guilty for neglecting them. They also stay updated on what's going on in my life, my mood, and I theirs. I hope to bring more joy into their life.

My thoughts and behavours are affected by keeping me accountable for how I behave, what's appropriate and not. Keeps me connected to my roots, reminds me of what I am proud of about where I come from (want to learn XX) and what I would rather do without (the guilt, shame, anxiety..).

It also makes me more familiar with the life that they're living, their hopes and dreams and makes me think about how I can make them proud, provide for them, and gives me something outside of myself to keep me going.

3. XX8

I LOVED spending that evening with XX8 at XX9 park. She reminded me of all the things I love about being out in nature. She reminded me that I have friends, that I'm not alone, that our struggles are universal. I feel admired, loved, looked up to. I feel important. I feel safe.

4. XX9

This gives me mixed feelings. Feelings that I have made up on my own. He stays in contact, shares some really fun and interesting things but I find myself intimidated or pressured by myself to IMPRESS. But on the other hand I also feel known and safe in a way, because this is a person who knows me inside out.

It motivates me to not give up on my XX7 dream, and to pursue my interests and find my unique tribe. He is so supportive.

5. XX10

XX10 teaches me that I can be friends with anyone. That I too can enjoy little things. That I need to take care of my own self and only I am responsible for my own happiness. That we are all human and I need to do the little things to keep sane. I'm not above it. 

I feel accepted in an unconditional way and she inspires me to take action for my own wellbeing and to value my networks, my FAMILY and my craft.

She took two and the first was positive, the second negative, is there any way she could be pregnant, or why did the test read positive?",20Aug2020,1
963,"I've realised a person in my life has been buying me things to manipulate me. I've decided it's time to get rid of that influence on my life as much as I can, and that's included giving away everything she's bought me.

The problem: some of these gifts were personalised with my full name, middle names and all. I can't figure out an ethical way to get rid of them - there's a strong temptation to destroy them for catharsis, but I would feel uneasy with how wasteful that would be. I can't put out a call for some person who shares my full name to get their free personalised stuff, because that would trace back to me way too easily.

970,"So I [22f] just last week left my toxic bar job to get a regular 9-5. I left the day before I had a long shift which I know was an asshole move, but it was one of those jobs that makes your life absolutely miserable.

Anyway, my new job is good for now, but my close friend [23m] went into the bar for an  interview. This is strange to me because the owner is a pervert and they’ve only previously employed girls under 25.

In his interview, the manager (who was aware we knew each other) slagged me off. I understand her talking about me leaving on short notice, but she also attacked my character and the way that I look.

They want their uniform back. Do I go in and tell her to keep my name out of her mouth (in a professional way) in front of the directors? Will that hurt my friends reputation? Or do I risk my own reputation and keep my mouth shut?",20Aug2020,1

976,"I've been in an emotionally draining, toxic relationship with a friend who constantly makes me angry or feel drained when I finish an interaction with them. I keep convincing myself I'm ready to cut off contact with them, but every time I do, they do something nice that makes me feel guilty for ever thinking they were someone I was ready to cut. I don't know that I want them out of my life for good, though. I just want to tell them that we need to spend some time apart for the sake of my mental health. However, they are 1) suicidal and 2) the type of person who will say some extremely rude things to me and later come back begging for forgiveness. I feel like if I try to cut them out of my life, they will commit suicide or tell me it's my fault for feeling drained instead of theirs. Can I have some advice on how I should break off the friendship (or phase it out) in a way that's healthy for both of us? Thanks in advance.",20Aug2020,1
977,"I recently had a rather negative experience fostering through a local rescue that specializes in puppies. In hindsight there were several red flags that I chose to ignore, giving them the benefit of the doubt because they're a rescue that's trying to do some good, right? Well after my first hand experience I'm not so sure.

To give some background on the rescue, they have been around for like 13 years or so and like I said, they specialize in puppies. Each week, on Wednesdays, a group of volunteers drive in and around the state picking up puppies from shelters loading up several vans to max capacity with the goal of bringing them back for adoption. The puppies don't seem to get much vetting done aside from a dose of dewormer and some pink electrolyte water, although the shelters they are picked up from may have already administered some vaccinations; this is still unclear due to the fact that fosters aren't provided with any paperwork on the dogs in their care. The same day they make it back to the rescue the puppies are passed out to fosters who volunteer to keep the puppies for a whole two days before returning them for adoption that Saturday. Puppies are then sold for $300 plus an additional $100 spay/neuter deposit and the cycle repeats the following week. 

My first and last experience with this organization was when I chose to foster a 4 month old puppy that was left over following the Saturday adoption event. The plan was to keep him for the week and return him the following Saturday for another chance of finding his forever home.

When I got him home that evening he did nothing but sleep, which I attributed to the craziness of the day but the following day it was pretty evident that his lack of energy was something deeper. I wasted no time in reaching out to the medical contact all fosters are provided with and gave her a whole list of symptoms including diarrhea with worms, lack of appetite, dried blood in both of his ears from obvious infections, and nasal discharge in addition to being totally lethargic. The contact was slow to respond and when they finally did I was advised to feed the puppy some chicken and rice. They didn't have any follow up questions, made no attempt to schedule a vet appointment, and failed to acknowledge any symptoms aside from the upset tummy. 

I did as suggested with little luck getting him to eat and by the next afternoon I could tell things were worsening. I took his temperature to find him sitting at a fever of 104 and immediately reached out. Once again I found myself waiting for a response, this time with much more frustration. Eventually they agreed to have someone meet me at the rescue facility the following evening to check him out but once again failed to give me any advice on how to proceed in the meantime. By this point his fever had risen even higher to 104.5 so I made it a point to have another option should it get any worse overnight. I was told to go to a 24 hour vet if the fever exceeded 105 but I would be responsible for the initial cost of the emergency visit and it wasn't clear if I'd be reimbursed at all. I was up all night monitoring him and giving him cool showers to bring the fever down which peaked at 104.7. I managed to convince the contact to have someone meet me sooner than what was initially planned and I finally felt some sigh of relief. 

The relief was short lived. When I reached the facility that morning I was met not by a vet but by a medically untrained volunteer who was simply acting under the guidance of the contact I had been speaking with previously. As far as I know this contact was only a vet tech herself and was giving advice as though she was a fully trained veterinarian. No vitals were taken, she tested the puppy for parvo (which thankfully came back negative), took 30 seconds to flush out his ears and then loaded him up with appetite stimulants before sending us on our way. 

Another day goes by and the fever spiked back up to 104.7 with no improvement to his energy level, appetite, or water intake and he was now developing a productive cough and purulent nasal discharge. I took him in again, still not receiving any real help, just a repeat of the last visit and this time being told to force feed him through a syringe.

Anyways, I continued to take care of the puppy to the best of my ability and waited to see where things would go. Come Friday night, I looked at the rescue's adoption page to see what they had posted about him only to find that he wasn't listed for the event the following day. This was both a good and bad thing; good in the fact that someone wasn't getting a sick puppy but bad because I felt he would have a better chance getting help from his adopted family than what he was receiving through the rescue. No one had contacted me to discuss his arrangements and the last two messages I sent the medical contact went totally unanswered. I made a point to reach out to the adoption coordinator to see if they had a plan for the puppy since he wasn't listed for adoption and that seemed to be the first they thought about his future arrangements. It was around the same time that I had found out other puppies from his litter had also been suffering from similar symptoms but it seemed as though they were trying to keep this quite. 

I brought him in that Saturday as originally planned, as my schedule wouldn't allow for me to take care of him an additional week. Upon drop off I was met by a new set of volunteers and I wanted to make it known that he was sick and needed to be kept away from the other puppies. A few different volunteers came up to me asking questions to which I once again explained his illness. It only took a few minutes for one of the head volunteers to catch wind of it and rush over telling me to stop spreading that information because ""it might scare people."" In my mind, everyone should know so they can take proper precautions when handling him, but who am I? 

This volunteer was working in the ""medical"" room so I began to describe his symptoms throughout the week stressing how high his fevers have been getting, hoping that she'd have a better understanding of the situation. Instead she argued that it's normal for puppies to run 104 fevers and even 105 isn't bad. I couldn't believe it. At that point, there was nothing else I could do so I said my goodbye to the sweet boy and left. 

I'm not able to let this go and I have been looking into ways to report this agency in hopes that I can help this from happening to another puppy. Every attempt to get this guy help was met with a band-aid solution and they seemed reluctant to even assess his situation. I'm not the first to voice concerns as their Google reviews are scattered with comparisons to a puppy mill and complaints about unexpected vet bills immediately following adoptions. It's almost as though their business model is to adopt puppies out as fast as possible to avoid incurring medical expenses.

The whole operation is volunteer based and most of the supplies are donations. The rescue spends $25 on a 20 lbs bag of Kirkland brand puppy food if food isn't donated and I'm sure inccurs expenses for the initial transportation of the puppies but I can't see where the rest of the money goes. In the last 6 months they have adopted out just shy of 800 puppies at $300 a piece bringing in roughly $240,000. They do not cover the costs of spaying/neutering, no microchipping, and it's hard to say which vaccinations they administer themselves verses which ones the shelters had already taken care of prior because once again, they don't provide fosters with any paperwork. The facility they work out of isn't even theirs and appears to be a perk provided to them, although I can't be sure. 

Ultimately I'm looking for advice on how I can go about reporting them as an agency and to what extent I should pursue this. Someone is clearly profiting from this and it doesn't seem to be the dogs. 

TLDR: I fostered a sick puppy from a rescue that failed to provide proper medical care. The rescue's business model seems more like a puppy mill. Someone is making a ton of money off the sale of puppies. I want to report them but don't know where to start.",20Aug2020,1

980,"Since context and a backstory are in order, you guys reading might want to get a snack and a drink since this is going to be a bit long.

My uncle came to my mom(64F) 2 years ago asking if she could help out a friend of his by watching his kids while he was going through court and CPS. My mom took the job and after some time she bought me(31F) in because she needed some help and a sub on days she had appointments. When she brought me in, I was told the reason I was here. The mother who is a drug addict got pregnant by one of her drug buddies and thought that her boyfriend would be welcoming to her and her new baby. He was not. When the baby was born and tested positive for drugs, the doctors found out about her older kids. CPS was called and the friend(who I will call Boss (57M)) was given full custody of the kids. The kids (12M,8F,6F) were interesting to meet. The only boy believes white people lie and that his mom and grandma care for him. He gave me this dread that one day I will watch the news and see his name followed by the caption ""shot dead"" or ""shot by cops"". The middle girl couldn't read and had an issue with wetting her pants. The youngest had an addiction to sucking on pacifiers to the point her teeth are being damaged. I started steps to help the girls since the boy didn't want my ""stupid whitey help"" (his words).

The mom (who I will call Mother of Convenience or MOC) liked to break into the house to hide out from her new boyfriend, steal from Boss and the kids, and when she felt like it, visit her kids. The new boyfriend would come over to get her would be violent scaring the girls a lot. The MOC would go hide in the house when he came leaving me to call boss while protecting and calming down the girls. I remember she once asked me ""what she thought the kids needed?"" and I replied with a list of issues the girls needed help with. My list did not include the answer she wanted which was ""The kids need their mother."" I pissed her off with my reply ""not everyone needs a mother when they have a positive female role model."" She started going into a rant on why kids need a mother when I honestly zoned her out and focused on the girls doing their cutting craft. The middle girl accident cut her finger so I calmed her down and took her to treat her cut. MOC noticed I wasn't there and yelled what was I doing with her kid. I told her I was treating her cut when MOC came up to the child and slapped her across the face while insulting the poor girl for hurting herself. I told her to get out of there before my friend with his K9 unit get there. I had texted my police friend but didn't send the safe word yet. MOC left in a such a big hurry that she left the stove on. I turned off the stove and  turned on a movie for the girls in their room to help them calm down. I asked my police friend to take me home in case MOC was still around. I called my mom and found out MOC asked my mom the same question and didn't like her answers either. The police friend told me to give my mom his number just in case MOC threats her.

After a while, MOC came over less and less (which might have to do with my mom filing a police report when MOC stole from my mom's car which we have footage of) and her mother (who i will call Mooch) started coming around. Since I was raised to be polite until given a reason not to be, I would act politely towards Mooch and she would be the same with me. Mooch would try to make my mom run errands for her then get mad when she would load the girls in the car. I stopped being polite to Mooch when she started badmouthing my mom. I once got so fed up with her talking shit about my mom that I used how MOC and I turned out as adults since MOC and I both grew up in similar ways. Mooch didn't like that but still tried to use me for stuff. I was told one Friday by boss that my mom and I were not going to be needed that Monday which I was happy about because I was going camping and hiking with some friends. Monday afternoon, I'm getting calls from boss and mooch begging me to go take of the kids. I walked the 2 miles from my place to boss's place sore from my weekend to find out boss was going to let MOC visit the kids that day and her boyfriend had threatened to kill her and the kids if she didn't return to him. To say mom and I were pissed is an understatement. A few weeks later, boss told me mooch was not allowed in the house at all. Mooch pulled a knife on me and in self defense, i pulled out my taser. I called boss and the police. while waiting for the police and boss to come, the boy pulled a knife on me saying to let his grandma in. I called my mom and texted my police friend (who was off-duty that day) for help. my mom came quickly with my brother since my brother can look very intimidating. Mooch left to where MOC and her bf is while my family and I waited for boss and the cops. Boss came home an hour later and the cops never showed up. I went to the police station to file a police report and found out mooch flagged down the cop and filed a false report. They wanted to arrest me if it wasn't for the texts I sent to police friend telling him what was happening. I was so terrified and mom was pissed.

Mom told boss if he wants us to watch the girls, we would only do so at my mom's house since MOC and Mooch somehow knew where I lived. (my guess the boy told them since he was in the car with the girls when boss would drop me off when I worked overtime watching the girls). Boss agreed since neither mom or I would step foot on that property plus my uncle was a bit pissed boss almost let me get arrested. This arrangement worked out with the girls going to my mom's or my place until Covid quarantine. Boss recently begged mom and I to help with the girl's online schooling which we did for the first week then boss said he didn't know if he could pay for our services and asked us to be on standby in case he needed us. That pissed off my mom a lot since unlike me who worked online to earn extra money, my mom sold her crafts to make extra money and boss schedule and then cancel last minute making mom miss the craft shows where she could sell her stuff. yesterday boss called us to help with the girl because of a family emergency. We came and he told us the emergency wasn't as big as he made it seem. He still had us help the girls who hadn't had any work done or turned in since the last time we had been there on Friday. I remember showing boss in the simplest and most idiot-proof way on how to turn the girl's work in on Friday. All day Wednesday we spend trying to catch the girls up on their missing classwork. Boss was acting kinda rude towards us and the final straw was when mom and I overheard mooch was coming to visit the next day.

So now that I've explained everything but some minor incidents with both MOC and mooch.....Reddit, would both my mom and I be assholes if we quit because we are conflicted since we lost respect for boss but we really love and care for the girls.",20Aug2020,1

In 2019 I joined a basketball team and i dont know if that has any correlation, but a few months later I know had cracked of dry, peeling skin on the sides of my feet. I just didn't mind and thought the winter I dont remember motioning because I was so busy with basketball(my shoes were also tight). In March bball ended and my feet slowly (up to this day) have begun to be super dry, tight, and warm. I work on my feet all day and when my feet get sore , I elevate them, but they burn so i use ice, but during the night, they still are warm/hot and dry tight. For example, i woke up today to walk to the bathroom and my feet are super tight and dry and hurt when i walk due to soreness.

At night if i feel they are dry i use lotion but it just makes them hotter.

Also, i have so much dry skin. I try ever shower(sometimes i do foot baths) do get rid of the skin,moisturize, then put socks on. It doesn't work, I still have so much dead skin.

Please help me my feet are pretty tight right now. I dont know if I have an athletes foot, or chronic dry feet or I'm just normal idk please help.

983,"Sorry ahead of time for any typos, I’m so mad my hands are shaking rn.
Ok so I have really bad depression and anxiety, and since I’ve had to do my classes in person with all the COVID stuff it’s only getting worse. I’m 17 so my parents were able to decide for me if I did online or in person classes, but they can change it up to two weeks after classes have started (it’s the fourth day). Since we’ve started ive been so anxious that I haven’t been able to focus in class or sleep. I haven’t slept in three days. This morning I asked if I could change to online for the sake of my grades (and my mental health) and she said she’d email the person in charge of my schedule. She left her email open so I checked to see what the schedule lady said and I saw that my mom basically told her that she thinks I’ve been faking just to get out of going to school (Id still have school just online so that doesn’t make sense). She asked the lady for all of my teachers’ contact info to see if I’ve been showing “signs of distress in class,” but I’ve learned to hide my feeling really well and I don’t want to make a big deal in public so I’ve been acting like nothings wrong. This whole week I’ve been coming home, going upstairs to my room, and having an anxiety attack. It’s become routine at this point. I act like nothings wrong because when my sister was having some mental issues a few years ago they sent her to a mental hospital. All I need is to do classes online so I don’t relapse self h*arming again and she’s treating me like a child. I’m really hurt. I thought she cared. She’s talking to me as if she’s gonna do something for me and telling others I’m crazy. I’m so tired; last time my mh got this bad I got this close to ending it. I can’t do this anymore. I don’t know what to do. If I confront her she’ll know I saw her email, but If I don’t I risk relapse.",20Aug2020,1
984,"So an issue I've had for the last year at my job is that I'm unbelievably stressed out at work. It's always either based off my performance at the job or my behavior between my coworkers. I just got a raise and they've told me they like me several times (not as a patronizing reassurance, I haven't actually had a meltdown there yet) so I know I'm being totally irrational, but everyday I do something and then scream internally because I feel like it was too awkward. It's not a hard job, but it's the first ""adult"" job I've had and I actually like the people I'm working with. I'm playing poker with them tomorrow and I could run away, but I feel like I really need to force myself to be social since I'm a pretty isolated person in general, and want to work to fix that.

The other part of this that I definitely need to mention is that I have a crush on one of them. I already asked her out and got turned down last week, and I didn't really expect it to work out, but I know if she was out of the picture for whatecer reason I'd be (slightly) less stressed out. My anxiousness at work has been persistent through the last year even without her though, but I know its not helping matters since I'm always worried about over-stepping or doing something horribly awkward in front of her. I'm still being stupid and caring too much what she thinks even though it doesn't matter, but I can't just flip a switch and not give a fuck, as badly as I want to. 

Either way, I'm being worn thin, and even lying in bed my heart is racing just thinking about hanging out after work with them. I can't drink either, so filling myself with booze to take the edge off isn't an option, though I know they will be drinking so that might help.",20Aug2020,1
985,"I'm a teacher and I'm in charge of organizing my school's prom. I booked us a venue for June 2021 back in April. The venue and I agreed on a date in April, and they said they'd email me a contract by the end of May.

The contract never showed up. I should have set a calendar reminder for May so I would remember to follow up with the venue, but I forgot all about it. I just realized on Sunday that we never got the contract. Things were pretty crazy trying to teach online, and I got so focused on other things, and it dropped off my radar. (To be fair, two other staff at my school also got the email saying the contract would come at the end of May, and neither of them remembered either. But they probably assumed I would deal with the contract, since I get it signed every year.)

I am really scared that we lost the date the venue and I had agreed on. That is the only date that works for my school, and not many other venues can accommodate my school since we are so large. When I realized I had never gotten the contract I had a crying fit - my principal will kill me if I lost that date.

So I called the salesperson for my event on Monday morning and left a voicemail. I also sent an email right after, because I know sometimes people don't check voicemail.

I didn't hear back, so I called the venue's main line on Wednesday morning asking to be put in touch with someone. They said they'd let the salesperson know and ask her to contact me.

It's now Thursday and I still haven't heard anything. I am a nervous wreck - I'm having trouble sleeping, my stomach hurts, and I keep checking my email every 30 minutes. I feel like I can't focus on anything else but this situation.

I realize that perhaps the salesperson is just busy... the venue laid off most of their staff when covid hit, so she is probably dealing with a lot of clients on her own. But I just want a quick reply from her letting me know if I still have the date we agreed on. She never seems to pick up her phone and hasn't returned my email from Monday.

I don't know what to do next. I would like to try calling her again tomorrow, but I don't want to harass her or annoy her... but at the same time my mental health is really suffering. What should I do?",20Aug2020,1

987,"With food, it completely depends on the person, sometimes I have zero problem sharing my food, while other times I absolutely hate it to the point where I’ll get angry and lose my appetite which usually causes an uncomfortable situation. I think that when the person is generous in general and also shares, I don’t mind sharing with them, but when it’s someone who takes too much from my plate so that I’m eating less than them when it’s MY food to begin with, or someone who honestly I can’t remember the last time they shared something with me, I get irritated and protective. I don’t like this, I wish I didn’t mind with everyone, but food just means too much to me.

With material items, it’s much worse. It does not depend on the person. I always hate someone using my things. Sometimes even touching them, especially when they are careless and don’t put them back how they saw them. The more personal the thing, like a laptop or a piece of clothing, the more irritated I get that I was even asked for it to be borrowed or tried on or whatever. (I have a sister who borrows clothes from me, this is the only situation where I do not mind in the slightest, sometimes I even offer and if something looks nicer on her, I give it to her. Nobody else in my life gets even close to this treatment.) Or if someone opens my package... oh, the bitter anger. It’s deeply embarrassing. I got something sent to my bf’s house that he just received. He took a picture of the package and I was happy. Then he took a picture of what was inside. Since it was through text I was able to cover up my anger, so I jokingly said (like with emojis and stuff) like aww why’d you open it? I love opening the package. He said oh I feel bad now and then I said ah it’s ok. Then I said good night. The truth is I’m very angry at him for opening it, but I’m much more angry at myself for being so childish and materialistic. Disappointed in myself that I care about something like that.

And now I’m posting here because I am so tired of being so possessive over THINGS. Stuff. I’m tired, and, quite frankly, embarrassed of myself. Why is this such a big deal to me? I simply can’t get to the bottom of it. I do have an issue with being a control freak which I take from my mom, but I’ve been actively working on this for the past few years and I’ve made a lot of progress. Things that used to upset me and cause me stress, like a friend not following my (often unsolicited) advice (no matter how big or small the issue) used to drive me crazy, it would cause fights. Now, I don’t mind them nearly as much anymore, because I understand that what other people do is beyond my control and anyway I’m not right about everything all the time. I’m not God. This has helped me be a much happier, lighter, and a much more understanding and loving person.

However, is my possessiveness over my possessions possibly a manifestation of how much of a control freak I was/am? Is this another level of control freakery that I must spend the next few years attempting to conquer, or is it possibly a result of something else entirely?

I try to improve myself by understanding the source of why I am the way I am. Does it even matter with this issue? Can I start helping myself regardless and perhaps understand my emotions better while on the journey? Would you have advice on how to improve myself and be a more relaxed, generous, patient person? 

I hope you guys can help me because this is a very ugly side of me that I deeply dislike and want to improve.",20Aug2020,1
988,"This is kind of starting to get to a ridiculous point. I haven’t been too negatively affected by covid, but now my second year of college has started and I’m in a full house with loud people and animals. I’m working full time and have little time to myself.

Our mom is a clean freak so any little mess upsets her and today my sister forgot to turn the exhaust on while cooking and our mom got upset when she found out we hadn't swept and moped the floors. She got really mad, then exploded and demanded that we move out. We only have 5,000 dollars between us what should we do?

990,"Not sure if this is the right subreddit but my friend and I had spent 2 nights in a chain hotel this week. Everything was fine with our stay until around an hour after we checked out we received a call from the hotel telling us we had damaged the side shelf next to the bed. We asked them to send us pictures because that damage would be unnoticeable and we definitely didn't break it. We would've heard or seen it fall off from the headboard and it was still 100% stably in tact when we checked out. Pictures of the shelf completely detached and on the floor were then sent to us around half an hour later from a mobile number on whatsapp. We then asked them questions confirming if this was our room number but they avoided all of our questions and said we can 'furnish your response' once they've sent the bill. 

I honestly have no idea how the shelf even managed to fall off in the time we left to it being cleaned and I even have photographic evidence that it was still in tact less than 2 hours before we checked out as it's in the background of a picture I took. The weirdest thing is I asked my friend to send me the screenshots of the conversation on whatsapp but they had BLOCKED my friend's number so the whole conversation disappeared from there. We now have no evidence that they contacted us besides the picture they sent us of the shelf broken which autosaved into his phone.

We still haven't received a bill (this all happened yesterday) and I have no idea what to do when we receive it. I obviously don't want to pay for the damage as I didn't do it. I'm worried that since they blocked us and we have no evidence they contacted us we can't appeal against it.",20Aug2020,1

992,"The father and I had an agreement via email, reconfirmed as recently as yesterday, that I would continue to tutor (teach his son a language), until the end of this month (Aug).  With the whole pandemic, whether we continue past the end of the month is ""up in the air"", so to speak. They don't know what the son's distance learning schedule will be like.  I've been teaching him for a month.

They have a standing link for Zoom, so literally, all they need to do is click and up pops our session, so it's not a tech thing. The child did not show up online for his lesson today and my text and a voicemail to the father have not been answered - in his defense, I just sent a text and vm at 3:15 pm (the lesson was at 3 pm). 

I've read from other teachers that if that happens, the parent STILL gets charged for the no show lesson. I bill at the end of every week for 5 days - I teach his son for one hour a day, five days a week.

for example in when i am in maths class and i say that i do not understand the work the teacher , people call me things like: ''stupid' ,''retarded'' or they say that i am faking not knowing the how to do the work?

people just randomly say things about how i look (i am a girl with a short afro and have a trousers to school most of the time to school), they say i look like a male , i am ugly( i know i am not the prettiest girl in the world but i do like myself) , i am never going to boyfriend (that is the least of my concerns), people make false comments about me having poor hygiene when that is not true...

i try to be nice to the people who say these things to me and i tell to stop but they don't. i try to ignore them but they hurt my feelings too bad

\^\^people say things like this to my face or out loud in class for laughs

these comments have ruined my self-esteem/confidence, i hate thinking about these moments because they make me upset and i have thought of killing myself over this

people in my class stick up for me sometimes , sometimes teachers tell them to stop or people stop saying these things to me when i look visibly upset. my friends tell me to ignore them.

I am a licensed professional, this is not an easy or common license, there are around 400 active in the state I work in.

I was asked to write a report, it was going to a long and difficult one, and apparently somehow related to the deal it was associated with, it should have a certain conclusion. I expressed my concern over this and recused myself from the job. The next day my boss, who does not hold this license, and I had a few words about it, some of them rather choice, but based on workload and how difficult the bulk of it would be, I agreed to write the ""meat"" of the report, but would provide no conclusions, recommendations, or other opinions. Also, my name would not be on it. Basically just the leg work of the data and then handing it off and letting the lawyers or whoever make all their changes blah blah they get what they want. I wasn't super pleased about it and up til this point had a high opinion of my boss but it came down to, his name is on the door.

This was 3 weeks ago. Today I saw the report went out, albeit in draft form, with my name on it. This obviously can not happen so my question is, how do I handle this?

My grandma is in remission (?) of cancer. She gets sick easily and always has such a huge fear of death. But apparently her fear of my aunt is larger than that. My aunt is just a crappy daughter in law, really dislikes my grandma. My grandma also does not want to go because she will end up with babysitting duty for my 1 year old cousin. So because of this, she has refused to go stay with my uncle. When my mother confronted her about going to stay with my uncle, she said she wasn’t going to, and decided to go on a rant to all our other family members about how she ‘doesn’t have anywhere to go’ and how ‘nobody wants her’. 

My grandma is the type of person who even my parents (who throw logic and facts out the window for important things) cannot have an argument with, and just have to agree. She’s the type of person to compare whoever she’s talking to with someone else, and just one of *those* old people. 

What should we do in this situation?! It’s going to be much safer for her if she goes to stay with my uncle but she’s so stubborn.

My neighbor, who I am fond of, happens to have two very large dogs. The male, unaltered, becomes very aggressive when my female dog comes outside. He races along the fence back and forth with his big bark. Today I heard his nails coming up the fence as he was attempting to jump it....
I’ve spoken with my neighbor about the dog. Specifically after he destroyed her chain link fence trying to get to my dog in the front yard of my home. She laughed it off and asked if my dog is a female. I said yes and she laughed more, confirming her dog is unaltered and that is why he is obviously more aggressive with my dog because she is a female. 

I’m looking for ways to try and curb the aggressive behavior at the fence line. I just want to sit outside with my dog in peace, not worrying if this 80lb bag of muscle is going to finally find his way in and do god knows what with my much smaller, older dog. My neighbor does nothing about it. In the beginning she would come out and scold the dog and sometimes take it inside. For the last few weeks i’ve seen zero effort made to help the situation and feel like it is going to be on me to try and stop this.

1021,"Throwaway account, also on mobile, so sorry if the formatting is weird. I know this is probably gonna be long and complicated, but I’d really appreciate it if you read it and helped me out. Although, I do understand if you skip over this post.

My sister (25) and I (17) had a huge falling out a few weeks ago over the phone. A few days prior to the phone call, I showed her an art piece that I spent so long working on and was actually really proud of, only for her to just find every single thing wrong with it and make me feel like shit, and actually almost made me quit art. This phone call fight was initially about how I take too long to answer her texts and then don’t engage enough in the conversations, it eventually led to me snapping and confronting her about all the mean things she’s said and done to me (including the art thing. There have been dozens and dozens of other times where she’s teased me, belittled me, or bullied me. I only brought up the art thing because that was sort of the last straw to me). It ended with her not trying to play the victim and then calling me “delusional” and “immature”. I abruptly ended the fight and blocked her on all social media after that. I may have been a little overdramatic when it came to blocking her, but keep in mind that this isn’t the first time this has happened and I KNOW it won’t be the last.

(For some background) I had a really tough road growing up. I’ve always had to deal with anxiety and bullying, it got so bad that I was basically forced to drop out of school because of the bullying (which had it’s own effect on my life, specifically graduation, but that’s another story). I also have a speech impediment and body image issues to add on top to all that. All of which drove me to attempting to end my own life multiple times back in 2016-2019. I’ve went through years of people not believing me, not caring enough to help, that her calling me “delusional” (among other insults) made me spiral a little bit.

I’ve had her blocked for a few weeks now and never even thought about unblocking her. This may sound bad, but my life has actually been a little better without her. I’m really not trying to sound like an asshole when I say that, I’m truly upset that our relationship fell apart this much, but it’s the truth. I don’t have to deal with the constant criticism, or her condescending tones, or her narcissism. It’s like a breathe of fresh air.

Now for the main issue. She’s coming over tonight for the weekend (she lives far away, I live with my mom) and I REALLY don’t want to see her. I don’t want to talk to her, or interact with her in any way, since I’m still very very upset and angry. Knowing her, I know that she’s gonna bring up the fight as soon as possible. And trust me, it won’t be to apologize.

This is starting to sound like an AITA post, but I’m really only asking for any kind of advice on how I should go about this. I really really don’t want to have a conversation with her, but I know that barricading myself in my room for 3 days is ridiculous. What do I do??",20Aug2020,1

1023,"This is probably going to be extremely hard to read and comprehend as I usually tend to write thoughts as they pop up in my brain, but I'll try to keep it short. I have lost the feeling of joy. I have lost interest in most of the hobbies and chores that used to bring a lot of joy into my life, and I lost them such a long time ago that I can't even recall what would make me happy when I was younger (not that I'm that old anyway, I'm 17, but this is how I feel). As of lately I've been trying to focus more energy towards self-improvement and just figuring things out and getting to know me better on a deeper level, but I can't seem to find the root cause of these dark episodes that keep coming and going, and I just feel this weight on my chest as a manifestation of the pain that is engulfing my mind all the time. And all this started once I began talking and developing a relationship of sorts with this guy. We talked before too, around a year ago, but we didn't really stay in touch, but it was a few months ago when I discovered what he was going through from his Reddit posts, and I can only say that it was the first time I had ever been touched to the point of crying, because I could relate to absolutely everything that he was struggling with too. I felt that it was my duty to let him know that there is a person out there who truly cares about him, and so I wrote this 1000 word message in which I opened up to him about absolutely everything that was happening in my life, because I felt like it was the only option. I couldn't have ignored his struggles and just carry on with my own life. I fell in love with him from day one. We got to know eachother really well and have grown quite close to one another. The amount of love that I carry for him in my heart is truly incomprehensible, even to me. I've confessed my feelings for him whenever I felt like they were too heavy and I couldn't keep them hidden anymore. And I did it extremely early on, like a week after we started talking. The first two times he told me he doesn't quite feel the same, but then, as we got to know eachother better, his response is not as clear anymore. It's so unclear in fact to the point that I don't even know what he wants anymore, but maybe he doesn't know either. Not that I'd want to label our relationship in any way, I just don't know how to approach this situation and I feel extremely lost. Now that I provided some context, let's get back to my initial issue. Even before getting to know him, I was feeling the exact same way, my life was extremely boring and nothing would fulfill me. But when he came into my life, he was the first thing in years that sparked the joy of life in me, and I grew addicted to it. And he's still the only one that can truly bring pure joy, but this is wrong on so many levels and comes at a huge cost for both me and him. We talked about this and he told me that he felt responsible for my well-being and, because he's too scared of himself, he doesn't want me to only find happiness in him if that makes sense. And I don't want this to be the case either. I know it's wrong to rely on other people for emotional stability, especially when it makes them feel responsible for you, which is why I've been so desperately trying to work on this issue, but I can't seem to reach a conclusion. Maybe I'm not answering the right questions, or there just isn't an answer to this. My inability to live a happy life on my own is harboring extremely dark habits in my relationship with him, and it's hurting me so much that I barely have to energy to live anymore. My brain is constantly seeking for more from him, so that I can finally be happy for a few more hours again. And I hate myself for being like this. I want to be happy on my own, so that I can continue keeping him in my life without his mere existance causing so, so much pain, not because he's doing anything wrong, but because I'm so broken and can't mentally take care of myself. I don't want to just remove him from my life. Although it might seem like the easiest option for me, I just simply don't want it to come down to that. And even if he doesn't want me in his life anymore, I wouldn't be able to accept it, I just feel like I wouldn't survive. Maybe I'm just too clingly, but I cannot find myself in me, and I can't seem to find the exit out of this dark and cold room that is my brain. What should I do?",20Aug2020,1
1024,"ever since i was a little kid i’ve been on the bigger side, and i’ve always been extremely insecure about it. in the past, i used to think “oh hey by the time im sixteen ill probably have lost the weight!”, but now that i have turned sixteen and still look the same i’ve been extremely worried and stressed about it. i feel like i’m losing time and that i’m never going to ever feel confident about my body. this has plagued me my entire life, filled it with so much self-doubt and no self-confidence at all, and i just hate myself so so so much. i feel like i rely on what other people think about me and feel like crap when i know i can’t meet their standards. the small things get to me too, like when my friends talk about all the pretty clothes they wanna buy while i sit there knowing ill never be able to fit in those clothes and look good, or when i need an extra shirt and my skinny friend tells me i can borrow her shirt when obviously i wouldnt fit into it. i dont know... sometimes i feel like im so dramatic. i can’t even say that im fat out loud because i like to try and pretend i’m not. i recently asked my mom for a therapist, because i have never told anyone about how i feel towards my body. i had a few therapy sessions these past few weeks and i’ve cried so hard in every single one because it just feels so different telling a real life person about my feelings. 

now, here’s my question. are my problems valid? sometimes, i feel like im wasting my therapist’s time because i know a lot of other people struggle with this too so is it just how the human brain works? my mom told me that she doesn’t take my “depression” seriously because she said i’ll grow out of it. she also talked about how hard other people have it right now especially because of the pandemic which is causing people to lose their jobs and all. and i know im privileged, i do. i know that i’m able to have an education, buy the things i want, eat good food, travel to places, and all those things... so are my body insecurities stupid? is it dumb that i just want to look at myself in the mirror for once and see someone that looks pretty? is it so bad i want to be able to take pictures and feel like hey i should post this on instagram i look good! is it so bad i want to be able to take goofy selfies and send them to my friends? am i an idiot for wanting to go clothes shopping and not having to worry and feel embarrassed about clothes not fitting me and wear cute fits like any other teenage girl instead of wearing the same 5 outfits? i just want to know what you guys think because im at a loss. thank you.",20Aug2020,1

1027," I live with my mother together and we are getting financial support from the government due to being in the lower-income bracket. I have no job, my mother is working part-time and by contract we have to be in contact with the recruitment agency all the time.  


I used to go to an international law school, but I dropped out about 3 years ago because I have been dealing with depression and a severe anxiety.   
After lifting that weight off my shoulders, of course I had to go to the employment agency and talk to them about everything and my plans. And we decided to go for searching for internships and apprenticeships towards IT, graphic design and artistic related branches.  
But that didn't work out for a year, even after sending out almost a hundred of applications.  


Then the following year, I told them I will become a self-independent artist instead of keep struggling with the applications. And they hated me, where they ended up ganging up on me, discriminating me for being too young (21 at that point) and almost forcing me to not do something like that.  
I ended up having a discussion with those clerks and we ended up making a deal. - That if its going bad, I will quit. If it's doing good, that's fine.  
So it started low obviously, with making only about $100-200 every month.  
But throughout the year it was slowly getting better, yet they decided to call it quits at the end of the year cause it still not changing my mother's and mine income to something “stable”.

• I was forced to decide to look for apprenticeships and possibly even a university again, by the recruitment agency.  
• Cause of me dropping out 3 years and not having any finished intern- or apprenticeship, makes me not able to get into a university that I would love to go.  
• Cause of Covid-19 now, I am not able to do anything this year for anything work related.  
• I still haven't gotten any therapy or anything for my anxiety and depression, while this is stressing me out more and more.   
• And cause of failing to be self-independent last year, I fear that I won't be good enough again and have to quit when the virus is either gone or calmed down.

1029,"I haven't yet run this by him, because I was hoping for some input first. I don't want to seem like a nut, sharing ridiculous ideas.

My theory is this: rather than fire the entire kitchen at the restaurant (or have them walk-out, due to the owner taking my partner's side in all of this), I think his boss is waiting for him to just quit on his own.

This restaurant has suffered closures of it's chains during covid, and they're strapped for money. I feel like they aren't going to risk shelling out unemployment taxes on 8+ staff, and also might see an opportunity where they won't need to pay for my partner's either, assuming he quits as he has threatened.

He's the restaurant manager. Lately, the chef and other kitchen staff have started to just stop doing tasks. He jumps in each time, in an effort to get the orders out on time. Apparently they sometimes just stand there and watch, and to me, he is enabling this behavior by continuing to do their work in this manner.

They've started ignoring him - yes, ignoring him - when he's giving orders or asking them to do something. This is occurring during peak hours. Most recently, he discovered that staff have just been leaving the restaurant to get ""supplies"" and just coming back whenever - all without notifying him. WHAT??? This is absurd to me, and completely unacceptable and disrespectful. Sure enough, all he asked for moving forward was that they notify him when/where they are leaving. They all basically told him to fuck off. So, they are still coming and going as they please.

I told him he needs to quit. NOW. He can afford to, and want to just take some time to himself and figure out what he wants to do as an alternative career. It's his word versus a big group of people, and even if the owner knows they are lying, the risk is too big for him to pursue this issue. He told the owner last week he was going to quit if the situation didnt change, and the owner didn't have much concern. They met again today, and it seemed like the owner was siding with the kitchen. My partner gave a month and half's notice, citing the relationship with staff. The owner didn't give much of a reaction.

Surely I'm biased, but hopefully it makes a difference in me saying that my partner is someone who goes above and beyond to 1. get his job done and 2. repair professional and personal relationships at almost any cost. He's not really confrontational, which is why I think the kitchen knows now that they can just fuck around and do whatever they want when he's managing.

He's genuinely upset, feeling down, and it's been affecting his mental health for sure. Should I just tell him any of these insights, maybe suggest he quits sooner, or do I just let everything run it's course? I've offered support in any way I can offer, but that's limiting.",20Aug2020,1

I (23, F) really want to go camping with my boyfriend (29, M) and his friends tomorrow, but don't know if I should. I threw my back out and had a stiff neck a few days ago and I had a sports massage and did some yoga to help with it. I am still a little bit stiff, but there's no pain and I've regained full movement of my head. The massage therapist (a licensed physiotherapist) said that it's nothing serious and that I should be fine in no time. My boyfriend also bought a very comfortable air mattress for the both of us. 
Another issue I have is that my period is due and I'm supposed to get it any minute now - meaning I'll have it for the whole duration of the trip (3 days). I can think of ways to stay clean and fresh down there (bottles of water, baby wipes...) but I just finished fighting off a yeast infection and I'm scared it might come back.
It seems like my body is telling me to rest, it's just that I really feel like socialising with these people and having fun. Last year I lost my dad to cancer and I stopped going out for quite a while because I was grieving and didn't feel like it and it felt like I had lost a portion of my youth. I felt so defeated and I missed going out with friends and being careless. Then COVID-19 happened and I felt even more isolated. 
These past few months I have been going out and safely socialising (outdoors, with a small number of people at a distance and with masks when needed) and honestly I feel like I'm getting my life back!

1037,"I’m a CNA at a state psychiatric hospital. I’m a permanent employee. My actual position is called “institutional counselor” which means I have to do group therapy with patients regarding PTSD, substance abuse and coping skills etc. I don’t enjoy doing the groups at all. I don’t want to be a teacher and don’t enjoy teaching patients anything. I do like interacting with these patients and doing activities with them, but I hate doing these groups. I do get paid almost $20 an hour which isn’t bad. I also work on the most violent ward at the hospital. 

I’m pretty unhappy with my job. My schedule is Sunday/Monday off which is okay but it’s almost impossible to get Saturday off and that’s when my friends/family do things. I also hate how I’m treated. I feel like my boss is unfair and there’s a lot of favoritism. Some of my coworkers make inappropriate comments to me and I’ve even told my boss but nothing will happen because they’re permanent employees with the state. I was at a party with my coworkers and one of them sent a group photo of the three of us drunk to our boss! Then my boss has a discussion with me about it with ANOTHER coworker who wasn’t involved. I’ve gone home crying a few times and even cried at work. My coworkers give me nicknames like Toe because a patient pointed out I had camel toe. And sometimes I don’t wear socks with my shoes (when I wear toms) so they call me toe socks. Then sometimes I feel like I don’t work hard enough. They constantly point out that I need to prove myself to be an IC3 (I’m an IC2). Then I found out that one of the laziest mental health techs (lower position than me) is getting promoted to IC3 and it makes me so angry.


Even today, I mentioned how it’s not allowed to wear yoga pants on the ward because it’s against policy and a coworker was wearing them. My other coworkers mentioned to me that I definitely can’t wear yoga pants on the ward because that would give them inappropriate thoughts?!

I applied for a CNA position at a medical hospital nearby in their orthopedic surgical department. The pay is $17.37 and I tried to negotiate but they claim they base it off my years of experience. The position is three 12 hour shifts with every other weekend off. I used to work at another hospital within their system and I know how professional they are, they have a lot stronger union and don’t accept sexual harassment at all.

Should I suck it up with my current job and try to get a different position somewhere else in the hospital and get the same pay and possible get promoted to IC3 which is more pay.  Or leave now and go to an entirely different hospital and make only $17.37 and it’s most likely a lot more physical work, but I think the environment would be healthier. 

My end goal is to be a nurse so I do want to go to nursing school. I feel like my current job isn’t direct patient care which is why I applied for the orthopedic surgical department as well.

They're more like monologues. I'm stuck with James Bond villains 24/7. I'm a guy. I'm straight. I just have a sort of friendly demeanour and I really really hate listening to drunk peope (no offence) but it happens more often than I'd like. What do I say or do?",20Aug2020,1

1040,"Hi Reddit, I'm new and don't exactly know how to do this so I'm sorry if there's any mistakes! I'm also on mobile. 
I'm 16 and going to my first job interview tomorrow (in a restaurant if that matters) and I'd like to ask the manager some questions about pay, requirements, etc. The usual. But I don't want to be awkward and seem like I'm not capable of handling the pressure. I'm pretty confident about this job but I'd rather not mess it up. I'm also a huge fan of scented things (Cologne, body spray, etc.) And I know I shouldn't wear a huge amount of it while working, I'd keep it to the absolute minimum. Would it be awkward to ask him if I should stay away from certain scents (I know some people are sensitive to certain things and I don't want to negativity effect anyone) Advice?",20Aug2020,1
1042,"I was 167 cm for the longest time, the past month ive been going to physio and doing back exercises, my height is now 169(????????) which I checked multiple times and others have checked for me as well. Is this possible after the age of 25?",20Aug2020,1
1043,"Im 29 turning 30 next week im a senior in college about 10 classes away from a degree, the problem is I go to school in Florida and have excess credit hours basically if you exceed 120 credits the state of FL cuts off all your financial aid so i cant even take out student loans to pay for my books/school supplies/rent

I found out about this when i was just 6 classes shy from my BS in marketing AFTER my semester started i was waiting on it just for them to hit me out of no where that i cant get aid so i couldnt even get the course materials and fell behind in all my senior level classes.

That massive financial stressed caused me to not do well in my classes and because of that i was dismissed from my major and had to change to a general business degree because it has a lower GPA requirement. I attempted to take my own life after this happened and was put into a psych hospital.

Then a month after that i was arrested by my campus police for skateboarding and had to use all my remaining money for rent and living expenses on legal fees and then had to drop out during the summer term due to all the financial hardship and PTSD i develop from a violent campus officer who was abusing his authority.

Im going back to school next month full time but i feel like because i cant get aid the financial hardship will be too much for me... i just want to graduate but i feel like the education system doesnt want me to succeed. 

Im just so tired of working s**ty minimum wage retail jobs... i want a career and for the past 10 years ive tried so hard to finish my undergrad but now that im almost at the finish line i dont see any hope..

I had to downgrade to a ""dumb major"" and now i have an arrest record so who would want to hire me now anyways... i feel like a complete failure

What would u do in my shoes..?",20Aug2020,1
1044,I want to move to LA. I live on the east coast and at the beginning of quarantine I lost my dream job as a flight attendant. I’m now working at a coffee shop barely making ends meet. I have a lot of customer service and hospitality experience but I don’t have much college background. How would I even make it out there? Any advice? Am I crazy?,20Aug2020,1

1046,"I emailed one of my mutual Linkedin connections to meet online and talk about her company since I am interested in applying there. During the meeting I was very nervous and didn’t ask all of the questions or have a connection with her. I would like to send her a genuine note (2 weeks later) to apologize instead of acting like a robot.

I applied for the job and wonder if the note might come across as desperate and only as a way to get a job at her company? I also would like to get her feedback on my portfolio (which is focused on a different role than what I applied but she is an expert and a mentor in it) and I don’t know if that will be weird?",20Aug2020,1
1048,"My mum was drunk and I was video calling my older brother when he left to talk to his wife. I (15) was holding the phone and when he hung uo a text appeared that was a screenshot.

My mom was in the bathroom at the time and I read it. It was about their disagreemant about her opinion of my grandad and his actions. I never had a relationship with my grandparents since they were bad  to my mom (not going to talk about it since its more than personal). It was bad and because of that I never had grandparents. 

I found a text with my aunt who does let her kids have grandparents where she tells my mom that basically she is pos for treating her grandad like that or something. I dont remember the details.

I dont really know what to do or if its appropriate. My mom is a great mom and i trust her all the way to hell and back. My grandparents are bad people who did bad things and my aunt seems to look past that.
My aunt and mom love their father but one realised that they arent good parents.

I dont expect to get answers to all my problems but an anonymous second opinion would be good. Or more than 2 as well :/.",20Aug2020,1
1049,"Me \[F20\] and my friend \[F21\] have been friends for approx. 8 years. We were ""close"" in high school but she was really just someone I spent a lot of time with. Flash forward to now, we don't spend much time together but she considers me her best friend. She has literally no other friends, and also no job/school at the moment. She constantly tells me she couldn't imagine life without me and she loves me so much. I do not feel the same way. I always just stay quiet but she doesn't get the hint.

We don't spend that much time together and she honestly doesn't know that much about me. When we hang out I usually just listen to her, partly because I've learned she doesn't really listen to what I say, and partly because I don't trust her. She makes a lot of decisions that endanger herself and other people, and a lot of it does not align with my ""moral code"". Just for example; she says the n word but is white, litters, and has tried to drive drunk multiple times. Despite this, she has always been extremely nice to me. I think she's actually a sweet person, maybe just doesn't understand how her actions affect others (and possibly very messed up from her childhood). I've tried to talk about these things with her and I get nowhere. 

Admittedly, I should have ended the friendship long ago. I don't feel good about myself when we're together, and I think I'm essentially leading her on. I've tried to distance myself in hopes the friendship would naturally fade away. But she constantly texts me and I'm usually very nice and positive when I respond. 

If she were any other person, I would tell her I need some space and end the friendship. But I'm her only friend and she relies heavily on me (although I don't really do anything for her, I'm just kinda there). Her mental health is not so great and I know this would seem like it came out of nowhere. Problem is, it's become a huge stress for me. She literally messages me all the time, asks to hang out, and believes we are best friends. I feel really bad. I don't think it's fair to her to continue like this. She deserves people in her life who really care about her. I do not have the energy to help her change her life. It's very possible I'm the asshole. What should I do?",20Aug2020,1

1052,"I can’t be trusted. I need help starting a conversation that could very well lead to a divorce.

I’m a cor
Ward. My wife and I have spectate accounts. Back in January I lied to my wife about who was texting me. I was borrowing money on reddit and she rightfully accused me of being extremely dishonest and told me if I ever lied to her again/went to payday loans she would divorce me. 

Earlier this week I was hit with a large bill. Money is very tight and I went to reddit. I chose reddit over her, over other help, and knew a few hours later I had made the absolute wrong choice. 

I am so guilty and know I fucked up. I’ve been having extreme panic attacks. The well of forgiveness on her part has run dry. Even if I pay this off and delete my Reddit, the thought of it someday coming back to her is scary enough that I know I need to tell her and face the consequences. 

How do I do it? In what way? Where? We are about to buy a house together.",20Aug2020,1
