0,"Hi, so I'm in a very toxic friendship and I'm afraid to leave.

I meet this girl lets say her name is  Lucy about a year ago, she was great at first. She was kind to everyone and she was kind to me and our other friends too. However for the past 3 months or so she has been making racist, homophobic, fatphobic, transphobic and generally rude comments and remarks about other people that we know. 

For example, we have this other friend, let's call her Mary that we are really close with, she is really nice and she is kind to everyone no matter what.

 Mary happens to have a disorder called misophonia, this makes her react to certain noises in ways that may seem strange to other people. She might get extremely mad, annoyed or scared and feel the need to hide. So Mary sometimes reacts to something we didn't even notice and star crying, screaming with anger or just run out of the room. This isn't a problem, but Lucy will sometimes make fun of her fr the ways she reacts to the certain sound we know she doesn't like.

Mary is also very energetic and will sometimes out of the blue start dancing in class, or sing a song as loud as she can. Everyone likes this about her and som will even sing along, but Lucy thinks this is embarrassing, so when Lucy is around Mary sit still and quietly and doesn't say a word unless Lusy says something to her. I think it's sad to see Mary look so sad and bored all the time. 

Mary is only one example of things she says and dose. She also makes remarks on how I and others look. She made fun of a trans woman when we were at the store together and said that it was ""unnatural"" and then proceeded to misgender her. We came out of a store once and she was lived because the people behind us in the queue for the register were spiking a language she didn't understand and she said ""They can speak that at home if they're out among people they should speak a language that everyone understands""

I don't want to be friends with her anymore, however, I'm scared that all of my other friends will choose her side if I decided to cut my connections with her. That would make me all alone with no friends, I went through most of primary school alone and the thought of going back to that terrefise me. 

Please tell me what to do, I'm upset and confused. I don't know what to do, please help.

(Also please excuse any grammar mistakes English is not my first language.)",07Oct2020,1
1,"Sorry this is my first time using Reddit 
So I’m 16 and I learned a few months ago after my father passed away that my grandmother and aunt put my father in a foster home so that she could date a man and that the only reason my father even went over to their house was because of me. I don’t know if I should because they aren’t the best people my aunt literally told my father that if their mother dies she wouldn’t tell my uncle and that my father would have to. I still plan on having contact with my dads cousin and his son but I don’t know if I should still talk to my grandmother and aunt anymore.",07Oct2020,1
3,"Hey reddit,

i hope this is the right page for my question:

I'm getting married next summer :)

We just want a small celebration, nothing big. My future wife will take her sister as a marriage witness, but I would like to take one of my best friends. My main intention here is the symbol that I want to show that person: you are my best friend, I can rely on you 100%. This is where the problem begins:
I have some good friends, but I'm not sure anyone would be the perfect best man. I would briefly describe them here, hopefully you can give me good tips:

a) was my best friend since the 9th grade - we have experienced a lot together and I was always able to talk to him about everything - but since his new girlfriend and shortly after their marriage, the contact has been very low and he always only has a few hours - if any. Besides, we hardly ever write.

b) We have been good friends since kindergarten - were best friends for many years, have many common experiences and interests. Our parents are also friends with him. We still meet relatively regularly, but most of the time it's not as fun and relaxed as it used to be, the reason is unknown to me. Maybe we just slowly really ""grew up"" (30 is just around the corner). We only write every few days and often he doesn't write back for days.

c) I have known ""only"" for about 5 years - I did my 2nd training with him. We have absolutely the same sense of humor and at the moment we meet often, write every day, etc. However, until 2 or 3 years ago, he did not behave well towards me and person a). Blasphemed behind my back, and so on, which is why I can do a lot with him and laugh, but I can't trust things that are too private.

I thank you in advance!",07Oct2020,1
4,"About 6 months ago I struggled seriously with self-esteem issues and suicidal thoughts. I never told anyone about it and I never did anything to get over it, I just sorta ignored it. Now i don't give a fuck about anything anymore. All I do is go to the beach and drool over the same girl I have been chasing for months. I have no motivation or fear of punishment. I use to be a straight A student with a 4.5 GPA. Now I have like 15 missing assignments in every class. Whenever I am punished it doesn't bother me. I can't take anything or anyone seriously. Even when my dad hits me for missing assignments or disrespecting him, it doesn't even phase me. I'm not scared of dying. I'm not scared of pain. I'm not scared of being homeless. In the end none of it matters anyway. Is this normal? I use to have a almost obsessive crush on a girl and now I still like her, but I don't really care what she thinks of me anymore. I use to do everything in order to impress her and now I just don't give a single fuck. And like I said before I don't give a fuck about school anymore. I was the kid who would stay after class and takes only ap and college classes and now I don't give a fuck if I end up homeless and without an education. I was a d1 baseball player and might have a shot at college, but Idgaf about it anymore and I've started skipping practice for the past couple of months. I still don't have my permit, why would I need it if my friends could drive?    My mom was screaming at me about my grades and I laughed at her. It seemed so stupid that some one was mad at me for a grade. I just want to have a good time. I started smoking weed again and drinking alone. I know that's not healthy but no one knows any different so why not. I think I'm gonna drop out and move in with my brother and if he doesn't let me move in with him I'll just be homeless. What the fuck am I supposed to do with myself? What the fuck is wrong with me?",07Oct2020,1
5,"My friend keeps harming themselve and they won't stop
 I've been trying to be as cheerful as possible to cheer them up so that they won't feel sad. 
I listen to what they have to say when they vent out their feelings and I give them advice.
I try my best to not dump my life problems or mention anything about me feeling depressed or upset so they won't feel like a burden and harm themselves even more
I'm really exhausted I just want the best for them but it seems like everything I try to do is pointless because we always go back to to square one after countless days of trying. 
I feel like a sponge absorbing their emotions. 
I just want them to be happy but it gets exhausting sometimes having to help someone get through their emotions when I can't even help myself.

1. I take the trash out and she finishes my job in the back for me... ‘finish’ is a strong word. She throws everything on the shelf and didn’t stock anything. Not sure what the point of that was.

2. I put the trash can lid on top of the fire extinguisher like my other coworker does, whatever. I walk by that same trash can maybe 20 minutes later, the lid is now *on top of* the trash can, I bump into it trying to maneuver, she chuckles from the other room and I was so dumbfounded at her monitoring objects around her I stepped outside for a smoke.

She also tries giving commands which 99% I ignore unless a customer needs help, etc",07Oct2020,1

8,"I (29 f) am leaving my (32 m) husband tomorrow. I am very afraid to leave him because, despite him being an absolute manipulative narcissist, this is the first time I have ever been financially stable. Is it worth it to stay for the roof over my head?

I am Borderline so I have an extremely hard time keeping a job for very long. I know that if I leave my husband I will barely be able to keep up with rent. This fear of becoming homeless is the only thing keeping me with him most of the time.

I love him but he doesn't treat me well. He lies and has broken every promise we made to each other when we got married. Today he lost his temper and hit me. He says its my fault for being Borderline and it is making him crazy to deal with me. I don't think I'm actually that bad. I'm sensitive and cry more often than the average person. I feel like he has been gaslighting me all these years. I can't stand it anymore. 

He wants to get therapy together to work things out but I feel like this is too little too late. He says he wants to ""fix me"" and won't admit that he also contributes to our problems. He thinks he is the perfect man. My therapist says he is a narcissist. 

I feel like I have never been able to truly be myself around him. He makes fun of my hobbies. I have to act like a different person to make him happy. I moved to a foreign country to be with him and he often threatens to ""send me back"" when I do something he doesn't like.

The only time he talks to me is to tell me what to do around the house. I swear he talks to the dog more than me. 

I am really afraid to leave him. Im worried that my Borderline brain is making me think things are worse than they actually are.

Sorry if this is hard to read or understand. I'm really upset... And a bit drunk.

I need advice to know if I should trust my borderline brain and to also give me the courage to really leave him tomorrow.",07Oct2020,1

10,"I'm 24 M, just graduated college and started working. Living at home at the moment considering moving out because I want to learn to hold my own in the world (oh and I can afford to and have some good savings so financially it is not a issue). My parents moved here from India like over 30 years ago. So they've been here since their 20s. However, they are still more Indian then American (since they moved here at an older age, and didn't go to school here). We also have a lot of family here so they were never in need of making too many ""real"" friends outside of the family (or friends of family, also Indian just not related directly). My brother was born here and I was born in India myself, though I've been here since the first grade so we were effectively ""born"" and raised here.

Anyways, as such I'm mostly American (can't say 100% being raised by non-Americans somethings are bound to be different obviously). In our family/culture when kids get to marrying age they're parents start looking for a partner for them (nothing too unusual about that). There's no arranged marriage or anything so that's not a concern. Basically, for example, today my Mom comes up to me and shows me her phone with this girl's (who's from India, and still there right now)  picture and some info about her. Basically, a tinder profile :D, with height, occupation, parents, where she's from and yea that. They've shown me Indian girl's from America as well (always people they know or they know people who know them). Reliable first hand impressions of these girls. 

The thing is I'm 24 and have never even dated before (well one, not so great date off of an online dating app once) because I always anticipated the day my parents would start trying to marry me off to some ""good family"" that has been verified by people they know. Thing is in their mind marrying a Indian girls is the only option. You try to find one in America, can't find one then go look for one in India (in our community), can't find one marry ANYONE in India even if we don't know them (I'm not sure about this last one, it usually doesn't get that far). When I ask why she has to be Indian, they just say stuff like because we have connections that tell us she's a good person, we know she won't be marrying you for money, she won't divorce you because when it's within the community we can talk it out with her and her parents and make sure that doesn't happen yadda yadda yadda. Just the most ridiculous things. Like yea those are important things, like yea I don't want my wife to steal my money and run off or divorce me or do any of the bad things we hear happen in marriage but this feels so planned, and suffocating. My brother was okay with it and he accepted, and is married now. There's problems there but nothing crazy. I'm not saying one of these girls can't be the one but the fact that it is so controlled is making me crazy. Why can't I just do what I want. If I find a girl (ANY GIRL) and they think she is wrong for me for \_\_\_ reason they can just tell me and if I agree that's that. 

Nobody understands me. I often feel like I'm in the wrong and it would be easier to just fold and go along with it. But then I remember I have to live that life, how...how can I live that life when every fiber of my being is telling me no. My friends (Asian, if it matters, well it does just to clarify that they are not Indian I suppose), have told me it's my life and I can do with it what I want. While true, it doesn't feel that simple. I love my family, with or without their flaws. I already know how extended family will look at me if I come to a family event with a non-indian girl. Like I'm some kind piece at a museum that's strange. But I know I'm right, I should be able to date who I want right? Am I crazy? Of course, I tried telling my mom that if you have girls in the US that I'm interested in I'll talk to them, I'm not going to discriminate and not talk to them because their Indian but at the same time why do they have to discriminate if they aren't Indian. 

Sorry for the long post. Not sure if any of that made sense. Not even sure if I asked a question in there. But I needed to get that off my chest before I start crying :'(.",07Oct2020,1
11,"I feel like I need to explain. I’ve had a crush on this girl since we started talking on social media, which was about 2 and a half months ago. I know, not that long. We started school in august, and occasionally talked since then. Here’s the problem, she just got out of a relationship with my friend. This happened 3 days ago. She confided in me as soon as it happened, which was strange because she hadn’t talked to me for a bit then dropped the bombshell. We’ve been talking a lot since then, a mix of talking about past relationships, and other things. I know obviously not to talk about this to her right now, because it’s still fresh for her.

12,"I (16f) just got interviewed for a barista position at a local diner in my town. I have never had a job before, nor have I ever been interviewed for a job before either. I was very nervous, but I thought that I did my best.

The position would pay eight USD an hour. The shifts would be four to six hours long. The employer knows that this would be my first ever job. He stressed that it would be a high-octane environment. This intimidated me, and after I left, I got to texting with him.

I said something to the affect of: ""Is there any way that the shifts would be negotiable? I am a bit inexperienced and I am not sure if I would be able to work for six hours a day for multiple days in a row.""  


He responded, and I am not making this up: ""If you work more than six hours you will get a thirty minute unpaid break.""  


I didn't know how to respond to this immediately, so I started thinking up a wise response. I couldn't send anything, however, because he sent another message three minutes later that said this:

""Hold up on the drug screening tomorrow. We will keep you in mind for the future. Thank you for your time.""

I didn't know what to say past that point, so I simply said: ""Understood. Thanks again!""

I'm very confused. What just happened? Am I out of the running completely? And what about the shifts thing? I feel like I should just try and find another job or wait to start working if I'm not comfortable with this. What do you think, Reddit?",07Oct2020,1

We been through similar childhood traumas and when we talk....I just feel happier, more relaxed, and more at ease. The of us just feel like fries and ketchup...a classic combination.

A days ago, I met another guy on POF. Let’s call him Steve. I guess.....he’s interesting and cool to talk to but there’s one problem. He’s not Luke.

She told me last month that she was sleeping on her recliner chair because she couldn't get in and out of bed which compounded her physical condition and then went ahead and ordered a new adjustable bed that apparently does everything apart from making tea. Just after ordering the bed she was told she could get a different one through her doctor and has been using that after practicing for the last couple of weeks with me staying overnight to make sure she can use it ok.

Fast forward to her new top of the range bed arriving yesterday and sure enough it is too high for her to use. She is devistated because of the cost and sales pitch she was given.

I'm 16 and just started college a few weeks ago. For the last... What, 6 (?) years, I've had kinda severe social anxiety. I can't talk to people I don't know under almost any circumstances, I just start to stutter.

This is because I've always kinda been bullied, especially in my last years of school. This post is kinda prompted by that, and the fact I realised that my teachers knew, but that's... That's a whole different story.

I was wondering if anyone could tell me how to learn to talk to people? I have friends, but I've always been scared they don't really like me. That's cos of trust issues after my ex best friend told my bully personal issues.

I've met some people in particular, but then I start to get really scared they don't like me, and then I stop talking to them. I've had my record though, I've had at least one friend for three weeks that I haven't been scared they don't like me!

21,"First of all, I say ""a"" and not ""my"" because I'm hopefully switching doctors soon specifically because my current one basically told me I was lying about everything I said to her, and she doesn't have time for me. Every appointment I go to with her (when she's actually meeting me and it isn't her assistant) she rushes me through the appointment.

I'm 16F, and have been having some issues with my body (physically, as in pain and nausea) since I was about 13. I've had one doctor so far believe me, and she only ran an EKG scan which had no unusual results. That was around 2.5 years ago.

I'm looking to switch doctors, but how do I get my new one to actually listen to me? How do I feel comfortable enough to tell them my symptoms fully instead of being afraid of being shut down and embarrassed? At 13, I was told and believed them to be growing pains, but then I noticed they wouldn't go away and would just get worse.

• YOU CAN STOP READING HERE IF YOU WANT

For any potential doctor looking at this, here are some of my symptoms:
1. Chest pain (around my heart and in the right part of my chest). Sometimes it's a constricting feeling that makes breathing difficult and sometimes they are stabbing pains that start at my heart and branch out through the rest of my chest.
2. Aching ribs. A lot of the time, my ribs just hurt. It feels like I got punched or something all the time. This also makes breathing difficult.
3. Possible irregular heart beat. I say possible because it was an outdated machine one of my aunts uses (given to her by a doctor) before her appointments. It looked at my blood pressure (which usually goes back between being too high and too low, not really in the middle according to any of the doctors I've had) and apparently measured my pulse. The reading I got back was irregular heart beat. My worst blood pressure reading ever (I think) was 137/74. It's been like 113/84 before though (I don't know if that's normal or not).
4. Lots of limb twitching and sudden numbness. I can sit in a position for however long, and I get numbness with loss of circulation, of course. But sometimes I'm standing or sitting for 2 minutes in a normal position and my entire leg goes numb, or my arm which is just resting in my lap. My biceps twitch often, and they spasm when they do.
5. Nausea and localized headaches. I get nauseous out of nowhere quite often, and when I get headaches, generally they're in a specific spot that moves around my skull.
6. Pelvic and cervical pain. I get a lot of nerve pains (that's just what I call them) and pressure pushing down on what I think is my pelvis and cervical area. I'm a virgin, so no chance of STIs or pregnancy.
7. Spinal discomfort. About a year ago, anytime I moved my spine lit up and hurt really bad for around 3 weeks. There's no probable cause for why it happened. I've gone over and over it in my head, but I didn't fall or run into anything. No blunt-force trauma to my body anywhere. Standing up wasn't pleasant.
8. I got my first nosebleed a few days ago. My room isn't dry or anything. I've never had blood come out of my nose before, but it was bleeding a little the other day. Not sure if that's important.
9. There's more, but those are the big ones. I've never had a full-run of blood tests as far as I know. I'm not overweight for my height. Lots of conditions run in my family. No diabetes (that has been suggested to me for its symptoms) or allergies that I know of.

If you have any advice on anything, please let me know. I keep wondering what to do with this. I feel like I'm only waiting for it to get worse and worse, and it does.",07Oct2020,1
22,"I’ve (F20) had two crushes recently on makes even though I’m in a three year relationship already with a male a year older than me. The first one wasn’t too bad it happened about six months ago but this one is bad. I’m contemplating cheating though I’ve never done it. Today I blatantly ignored my crush who I can tell wanted to talk to me but I felt so bad doing it. I don’t really know him he’s a coworker and we kinda just stared at one another then he talked to me a week ago but it was small talk he introduced himself. I was so excited because I figured since I hadn’t seen him the rest of the week that I had to see him today. I did as soon as I got there I somehow managed to park right next to him in the huge parking lot at work. What are the odds? Again there was some starring and this continued the rest of the shift it was awkward. I also ignored my boyfriend who also works there it bothers me that he does as bad as it sounds I don’t want to be seen with him. I’ve realized that I’m ashamed of him and that I’m not really attracted to him anymore at least not physically. I kind of want to come clean to my boyfriend about my stupid crush but I’m worried how he’ll react. He mentions he sees our relationship leading to marriage in some years and though I once thought that I’m no longer sure if I think that. Not because of this guy I just met but because I had just started to think that recently maybe in the last year or so. One of the reasons why I don’t want to leave him is because there’s nothing wrong with our relationship I’m just a picky person. I feel that staying with him is me settling but leaving is risky especially because I don’t really have any friends hence why I’m resorting to the internet. I kept telling myself today that I shouldn’t do anything my bf wouldn’t want me doing but I felt so bad ignoring my coworker. I know I came off as mean this time, I’m probably already confusing him and feel bad. He seemed genuinely interested in me the first time we talked and even then I was already distancing myself. That encounter left me feeling bad too I honestly just wish I were single and could back to that first encounter. At this point though I’m worried of the issue I’m creating for myself. Should I just try to forget my feelings, wait it out, or talk to him at least? I don’t know what to do and feel trapped. Also if you made it down here thank you for reading!",07Oct2020,1
23,"I (18m) need advice on how I should confront my father on him technically cheating on my mother.

Hello all, for context and short reading purposes this is a second (sorta-update) post from my first RA post, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/j5nzva/i_18m_found_out_my_father_is_cheating_what_should/). Sorry in advance for grammar mistakes, I'm just trying to get everything emotionally out and get some advice. 

For a little background, my father who works in marketing, has recently (around 5 months ago) started a company that involves him and his group of business partners to travel out of state to manage a certain job site. It has been tough for him and us as a family since with the pandemic and all it has been hard maintaining a stable income to pay rent and bills and what not. With this job, he's been needing to commit to business trips that last around 1 and a half months, coming home for around 2 weeks to spend time with us (Mother, Me and my sister (27)). The business trips started around beginning of April to date and for what it seems it wont stop happening for a while now, leaving me mostly in charge with paying all the bills (Money coming from both his account and my mothers, yes but more work and stress for my mother and I). He has been asking for a lot of help recently from me, and even wants me to join into his business as a side thing until I get out of college to make a little money. He obviously, (or shows) in interest in staying with us for a long run even in talks with my mother about when he starts making good money on his business they will buy a good home somewhere nicer which completely throws me off guard with him cheating. 

Recently, my father came back from one of his business trips, used my phone to sign into his Facebook messenger app since his phone was dead.  A day later, in the morning, my mother had already left for work and I was about to start Online Zoom University when I over heard him talking on the phone in a discrete low voice. This being strange because he usually talks in a loud, but friendly manor way with everyone who he talks to on his phone. Since this was strange me being nosey me, I decided to lowkey overhear his conversation, it going somewhere around this,

""Hey how are you, have you eaten breakfast yet?... Yeah I miss you."" 

""Stay safe when you go to work"" etc. etc. 

He usually doesn't talk to anyone like this other than close family members or my mother and me. 

I was convinced something was going on and I decided to attempt to dig further on to who this was, so I had remembered that my father had logged on to his Facebook messenger app via my phone, and he had forgotten to log out. Knowing I was either gonna find something terrible or just something really stupid, I went into the app and looked at the recent chat, which was of another woman who had just called him. I looked throughout the chat and I was actually shocked on to what I had found. 

My father had been ""seeing"" or more ""texting"" another woman every time he was out of town, and even talking to her when he was with us. Now in my previous post I had mentioned on how he was looking to buy a home near her so he can live with her and what not, I misread that part and I actually saw that he was already renting a home near there to stay for his business trip, coincidently also near her home. 

I had to do some more investigation to see what actually was going down, so I managed to find that he had initially started talking to her around mid June. The conversation between them starting off like a usual business chat, him talking about his company and wondering if she was interested. Days later within the chat, he started saying how attractive she was and asking her if she found him attractive, with her only responses being somewhere along the lines of "" oh thank you thank you""  ""yeah"", typical responses that seem to give a ""not to interested vibe"" (or that's how I perceive it). Then I got to the point where 2-3 weeks have passed of them chatting, nothing much really going on just compliments from my father to her, and he says, out of the blue, that he's going to buy her a new phone. She of course doesn't deny and says thank you. From here the chat goes on to to the conversation of family, she asks  him if my father has a wife or family, he says 'yes but they live in another state', he asks the same to her and she says only kids (At this point I'm frustrated mostly on the woman for going on with this knowing he has a family) . From what I perceive of the chat for the next month, they just chat, meet with each other, my father buys stuff for her and her kids and what not but nothing what I see seems to serious (in terms other than him living near her or having something big). Even now that he is hear with us, he just asked me to buy a couple phones (with his money of course) on amazon so he can take with him, since someone had asked him to buy phones so he can sell it to them at a cheaper price (because of taxes, I don't know), which got me suspicious that maybe he's just buying these phones for the other woman, basically being a sugar daddy or something (even though he's not even rich) . Then I get to the point where, he starts saying ""I love you, you're my life"" etc, to her saying how he needs motivation for him to work and someone to be there for him when he's working. Now this is where it got me. I thought to myself, ""are we not enough?"" ""Are we not your motivation?"". 

I Felt truly hurt by these comments but then I got thinking to myself, throughout the past couple months to almost a year, its been tough on us and hes been working really hard in his job to provide for us. I myself are really shy and I don't really open up much to anyone, to be fair not really to my parents, I was told to be like a tough guy and what not. I have never been used to saying ""I love you dad"" or ""I love you mom"" because I had always thought that I didn't need to, that in a way they already knew I loved them and what not, sort of same goes with my mother to my father, she loves him but she doesn't show it verbally but just the little things that show that she truly loves him and vice versa for him with us. 

**Now currently he's with us and he doesn't know that I know. So I've been thinking, what if I talk to him about this, tell him that I know everything that has been going on with him and this other woman. Obviously keep it discrete between me and him at first and settle what will happen. From my understanding of the chat, he feels alone, with all the work that he is doing to maintain us, he wants to feel loved and spark that feeling of working towards something or for something. Keeping in mind that he has been doing this with this other woman for about 4-5 months now, I will tell him that all of this that has happened between him and that other woman has to stop. I will be upfront about everything and tell him that he might feel lonely and not loved, although he feels this way I will tell something like, '""I know what you've been doing when you have been out in your business trips' 'It is wrong and you should know that things like this never ends on a good standing, someone will always be hurt in the end'"" ""' I've read some of the messages between you and the other woman and from my understanding is that you might feel lonely and or not feel the love and support you should feel from us your family so you have resorted to this alternate situation. It is wrong and I want you to know that what you are doing is currently hurting me and when mom finds out about this, this will hurt her even more, and bring even more stress upon the family then what we already have. If it is something I can do, I want you to know that I really love you, and although I might not say it verbally I want you to know that I really do, me mom and my sister, we all do."".** 

Unfortunately because of financial circumstances I know what I'm about to say might be terribly wrong and unethical. After telling him all of that and if things go right, I would go on to tell him that I would not tell anyone about what is happening if he cut ties with the other woman, and be upfront onto what might be happening (that perhaps she is doing it for the money, him even saying that she wont be needing to worry financially etc.). Something I forgot to mention above is that when she asked for her age, (he specifically asked for her age first) she said she was 29 and he lied to her saying that he was 50, although in reality he is 64. Knowing if I promise that my father this, I will be carrying a heavy burden for the rest of my life knowing about what he had done, but if all he needs is more love and support at home for him to go on, then perhaps all of this of the cheating and secrecy can go away.  I don't know, this is what I am currently leading towards telling him prior to him leaving for his business month long business trip again. 

TL:DR, My father has started a company that involves him participating in business trips in another state. 2 Months after doing this, 1 month business trip, come home another month business trip, type thing, I found out he was cheating on my mother for a good couple months now. From what i've read on his messages it seems that he is talking to this other woman (Who knows that my father is married and has a family) who also has a family, ( Who I suspect might only be relying on my father for financial reasons, him mostly knowing but still going on) about how she is his motivation and how he calls her his love and what not. I find by reading throughout more and more of his messages that he is mostly with her because he most likely feels lonely, and doesn't feel loved or get the motivation that he somewhat needs in order to keep on working. What I plan to do is basically, confront him about the cheating, tell him things like that never end well, mostly someone in the end getting hurt, in this case us (Mother, me and sister). I would tell him that, I might not be upfront as much with my feelings and thoughts, but I will tell him that we all love him, and how he if he needs more motivation, all he needs to do is talk to us be upfront on his feelings. If things go right, I will tell him that I wont speak of him seeing another woman for a little time to anyone, only if he cuts ties with her quick, I will also be more upfront with him about my feelings and how we love him, I will help him out more with his job, and try to be more inclusive in his life. Should I do this? This is more what I'm leaning on so no one will get too hurt, or will this turn out more worse than what could happen?",07Oct2020,1

28,"Hello everyone, I need some advice here because I'm really stressing out about this.  I had stupidly lost the spare keys to my mom's car earlier today. My mom and I both share her car (I'm still in my teens, so I don't have my own car, yet, I have learners permit) I would usually carry around her spare set of keys and she would carry around the main set of keys. I was out on a run today, and I usually carry my keys on a lanyard, along with my house keys and phone. At the end of my run, I had noticed that the car key had fallen off the lanyard. I looked around my neighborhood and retraced my steps, but they were nowhere to be found. I came home and I had told my parents what happened, and now they are very upset with me.  They are worried that someone might come and steal my mom's car if someone comes along the keys and they click around the neighborhood. there is still the main set of keys, but the spare is gone. I was hoping I could walk around my neighborhood tomorrow morning and look for them then, but I don't know if I can find them, but I'm remaining hopeful. If I don't find them, my mom will have to pay a whole lot of money to have the key replaced, and I'm really worried and I feel like an awful person for being so irresponsible. What should I do? Does anyone have any advice on my next steps?",07Oct2020,1
29,"I am In college (21 years old, Junior), My grades are in the gutter, the reason is that I honestly do not care about my degree. The field im getting my degree for (finance) means nothing to me. I have no ambitions in life beyond having a family and taking care of the family I already have. I still live with my mom shocker I know, I live in nyc. I dont know what I am doing with my life. My mom worked hard to get us to America and to get us citizenship. I feel like i have to go through with thsi degree to make her happy but I dont care about. I dont care about much in life, the only things that makes me happy are entertainment and my girlfriend. Its too late to turn my grades around massively, so im gonna end up with a &lt;3.0 gpa. Which makes me think I will have great difficulty finding a job. But I cant give up because otherwise I have nothing. Im not depressed or sad, this isnt anything new. Not once in my life have I wanted to do something career wise. I know whatever job I do get I willl end up detesting unless there are people there I like. Im fine with that though, as long as I could continue being entertained and having a normal life with my girlfriend. Also, Im a heavy introvert. I have had opportunities to make friends and almost did but at the end of the day, when I come home I dont wanna talk to anyone except my girlfriend. I ignore the messages my friend sends, I feel like im being an asshole in this regard. He keeps reaching out and I just say enough to not make him think im gonna kill myself or anything. 

I dont think im talented or hard working enough to really deserve much in life. I dont want much anyway. I want advice on what I should do. Should you think im just a loser, Id say youre right. 

I feel like this world doesnt have a place for someone who lacks as much ambition as I do. 

I just wish I could start over, its too late now to start trying to find something I am ambitious about, a career path that I would have ""passion"" for.

I think eventually, my girlfriend will leave me.  Sometimes I wonder If I will eventually be dragging her down. She has something she has passion for. She is working to make that career choice a reality and shes almost there. 

If there is anyone out there who has been in a similar position, what did you do?

If anyone knows anyone in a similar position what did they do?

I feel like any day now im gonna hit a big wall and unless I start thinking of what Im gonna do when it gets here Ill be paralyzed by it.

38,"So...

I'm going to try to keep this short. This will sound like some real Lifetime movie type stuff to some of you, but please keep in mind when reading that this is my real life and this situation really hurt me. So...last year, I got hired as a nanny by this family in Brooklyn we will call the X's. 

The X's were not a happy family. The mom was never home, the father was constantly telling me about how unhappy he was, and the parents both hated it when I did normal things like send them pictures of their kids doing cute activities or take the kids out to parties.

It wasn't until 2 months into the job that I started having a bit of an emotional affair with Mr. X. At the time I was also super unhappy. I had just lost my apartment and was homeless for the first time in my life. I have a very dysfunctional family and the holidays were coming up, and I started leaning on him without really meaning to. I used to hate it when people say this, but I get how the phrase ""it just happened"" can describe situations like this. All of a sudden I had feelings for him.

Mrs. X was PISSED. She suspected something was up as soon as things started happening. When he came home early to see me, when he started giving me gifts...one night she snapped and made a rude comment about my race, and in turn I snapped and made a rude comment about her marriage. 

Mrs. X hated this and began threatening me. It was subtle at first, but then she was outright telling me she was going to hire a hit man to kill me while she and Mr. X were away on vacation with the kids. This only made what was going on between me and Mr. X more intense. We only got physical once thought, by holding hands and it never went further because 1) I was scared and 2) I didnt want to cross that boundary until Mr. X was single. But that was the problem. Mrs. X threatened that if she ended up single I would end up dead. 

Long, sad story short, me and Mr. X broke up because the police got involved and there were orders of protection put in place. Now I can never speak to Mr. X again possibly, and I'm so depressed because I feel like he was the love of my life. I know there were many things wrong with how I met him. I know that. But why would God even let me meet him if we weren't meant to be? 

I guess my question is, how do I move on after a situation as crazy as this? Has anyone been through something similar?",07Oct2020,1

40,"TLDR : High school has been hell, I have no friends and am too scared to make any, I would love advice.

Kinda sorta very long post ahead.

I am a 15 year old male currently attending highschool in the UK. I suffer from Asperger Syndrome and Anxiety, and I've never really had any friends. Well, I had a few in primary school, but we were only like 10 so they don't really count (even if they did I lost contact with them a long time ago). 

I wasn't diagnosed with aspergers until I was 13 (which was only due to my mum's boyfriend, who's son also had it). Due to my family not knowing of this, they were always pretty mean to me about things I didn't really even know I was doing wrong (they're not much better now, but they were pretty sympathetic when I was first diagnosed). In Primary School things weren't too bad, most kids were nice-ish and I wasn't really bullied, and I actually had a little friend group. However, none of this friend group came up to the same high school as me, and the first year of high school was absolute hell for me. I was in a new environment with tons of people (my primary school was pretty small) and I was too afraid to put myself out there and be friends with anyone. I was bullied my older kids and even some kids in my year, and the staff wasn't helpful at all. I would always try to pretend to be ill to skip school, and would always try and find a quite spot during break and lunch where I didn't have to talk to anyone and would just play some mobile games. Never make any plans for holidays, always just spend them with my grandmother (absolute godsend, about the only person in my family keeping me from breaking down). 

About 1½ years ago, I guess the school staff FINALLY noticed how much I was struggling in school, so they put me in a special unit in school with only about 30 students and smaller classes, we had our own kitchen and yard, basically it was everything I ever wanted. Just one teeny tiny wincy problem, it's filled with kids with fucking ADHD. And they all wanna fight all the time, act all tough, break things, cause hell, and this is exactly what I hate. So yeah, no help there. I wasn't really bullied here (thank fuck), but once again, no friends and lonely (and the staff are somehow even worse than the main school).

I've began integrating back to main school and I attend some classes in the main school and the other half in my ""special unit"", however I still struggle a lot. The classes are filled with different people and I really want to put myself out there and make friends, but I can't stop myself from avoiding everyone and keeping to myself, I'm too afraid I'll say something wrong and be back to the way it was a few years ago.

Please please please if anyone has been in a situation similar to me (even if you haven't) and have good advice, I could really use it. I don't know how much longer I can handle the loneliness and the worry 24/7, and I'm too ashamed to speak to anyone about it irl",07Oct2020,1

I’ve been bullied since the 2nd. I was so happy, but they had to ruin it! They stole my stuff, they used me, the hit me, they called me gay/lesbian, the made fun of my family, it’s horrible.


Every aspect of my life is religious. My mom is 8/10 religious. She gets mad if we do something that God would hate, like lie or say idk to her god questions.  I go to a Christian school but it’s not that great. I’m forced to be in this little box of bibles for my whole life. I don’t wanna be forced to do this, but I have to because my mom.


My parents are crazy about everything. They over react when I get anything under a -B. They make me feel worthless and ashamed for not understanding something.


They get mad at me when I have problems, and go “back in my day.” It may seem small but it’s super painful and scary. They get mad at me whenever I argue against their stupid beliefs, especially political.
They’ve brainwashed me into thinking that therapists are evil and that’ll they’ll take me away and put me into a foster home and give me pills that’ll make me be an emotionless zombie.

From a young age, my mom has told me I’m fat. I don’t mean the, “eat your veggies.” I mean, she would turn on videos of 1000 pound people on YouTube and would ask me, “ya wanna be like that?!?” I’m a skinny person, but my mom thinks otherwise.


In the 5th, I was told by my teacher that I may have depression. We set up conference and talked about my health.


When I got home... Jesus it hurts to remember. They started screaming at me telling me I’m stupid, spoiled, a brat, that they should send me to Africa to learn about how thankful I should be, that there’re people who have it worse.


I’ve stayed shut since that day, but I’ve changed. I’ve started to talk to myself and stuffed animals, and I’m a lot more aggressive. I’m not me anymore... I’m empty. I’m embarrassed to like something that someone finds weird. I’m self conscious and feel guilty for things I shouldn’t be.



Whoever I talk to or try to reach out, they always say, “look at the bright side of life!” Or, “pray to god! He’ll help you!”

I'm unhappy as a pharmacy tech and it seems like it's a means to an end, but I hate living like that.

I enrolled to get my masters in library and information sciences, but backed out because I was afraid I couldn't afford it and there are little to no jobs in my area. Of course I'd love to relocate, it just doesn't seem possible right now when I'm living paycheck to paycheck.

If I do go back, I can't decide between a medical lab technology AA, a BA in culture and media studies, or my MA in library sciences.

49,"So it appears that my sister(Eliza) has been going in a downward spiral and I don’t know what to do. She recently decided to dye her hair (half black half pink, I helped her bleach so she wouldn’t burn her hair off) on a whim, she walked in my room with half her hair black Saturday morning asking for me to help her finish. She’s been dying her ends pink for ahwile so I didn’t really think much of it until she didn’t even realize that picture day was Monday until the day of, so I kind of regret helping her with that because she obviously didn’t think it through. 

Eliza sneaks out at night on her bike to hang out with her friends, they go to gas stations and whatever is open to just mess around. Sometimes she’ll sneak off to someone else’s house who I don’t know. I ask her to let me know when she’s gone just in case and to let me know if something goes wrong so I can help.

Her friend asks me and my bf to give her a ride to her boyfriends house, and we take her. It’s not in a great part of town, but I’m thinking “he’s probably a good guy” and I text him beforehand to ask if they’ll be doing anything illegal and he says no and thank you for giving her a ride. I find out today he’s a drug dealer and sells weed at 16. 

Eliza comes home from biking around and tells me that she just picked up a vape for her friend from a hot guy. And then tells me that she got high from a bong with her friend, and said friends boyfriend. 

She is very moody, like your typical teen, but I think she cuts herself. And her mood swings are so bad. She gets angry VERY easily and over almost nothing, and perceives my parents as if they dislike her which isn’t the case. My mom has her issues with yelling and saying not the nicest things so for that I’m not surprised, but my dad is a bit(emotionally) absent, and she said he called her names. I asked what? And she said odd. Eliza said that he called her names by saying her hair is a bit odd. 

I can’t tell my parents about her activities because I want her to come to me when something is up and she needs help, but at the same time I don’t want her to be smoking weed, vaping, and sneaking out with suspicious people. 

Not only that, but if I tell them, I know how it will go. When I was her age, I got into legal trouble due to weed at school, and had/have mental health issues multiple times in my life. My parents will just yell and get angry rather than dealing with the issue at hand. I’m sure the root of all of this is either the transition from middle school to high school, or some mental health issue, but I don’t know what to do.

50,"Ive known Mark (not real name) for a couple of years and we used to talk and joke with each other a lot. About a year ago, he started hanging out with a bunch of people who have been stalking/harrassing me for a very long time now. Then he started making all kinds of uncomfortable jokes based on what the stalkers were telling him, stuff like how i always eat raw chicken and other crazy stuff. It didnt seem like he was doing it on purpose to hurt me and I tried to not let it bother me.

A couple of months later, I noticed that Mark wouldn't talk and joke with me anymore. He stopped responding to anything I said, yet he seemed fine when talking and joking with others. I asked a couple of his friends in private if they had noticed anything different about Mark, whether any big events happened in his life, whether he was busy, stuff like that, but they all said nope, he seemed perfectly normal to them and he was still talking and hanging out with them like normal. And I could see he was playing games like usual.

Tried sending Mark some messages in private to see if anything was wrong. He only replied with a few short sentences. He would only say nothing was wrong and claimed to not receive notifications when I sent him messages. When I tried to help him troubleshoot the problem, he suddenly stopped responding and wouldnt talk about it anymore. I suspect he was making up an excuse for not responding to my messages.

I waited a couple of months to see if anything would change. Nope. I tried talking to him again and basically said hey, tell me what the problem is, we can work things out, if you dont want to talk about it, at least let me know instead of leaving me hanging, etc.

The only reply he would give was a vauge one sentence reply that didnt answer anything. And he never bothered responding after that.

Tried giving him a few more months of space. Saw that he was talking and joking with some people so I tried to say hi and stuff. He didnt reply.

I suspect the stalkers have convinced him that he should avoid me because all of this started shortly after he started hanging out with them. This is something they have done in the past, they would start hanging out with my friends and then a few months later, they would suddenly cut off all contact with me, no explanation at all, and none of our mutual friends would have any idea what happened.

Any advice?",07Oct2020,1

Lately I’ve lost touch with how to initiate sex. Mostly it’s been my partner that has initiated or I ask if shes down to have sex that night. But I want to stop asking BC she sees that as ‘wimp’ish and I do agree. The reason I ask is before I used to initiate but she’s given me a hard deny a couple times and I’ve learned to just stop.

She was already underweight since the start, being somewhere in the high 90s, but now she's dropped to the lower 90s. She's been trying to eat more etc and test out diets. I was wondering if anyone would have any diet recommendations to try etc. 

She does have allergies though, which makes this kinda tricky. 

 \-most fruits and veggies unless they're cooked? or blended (kinda funky)

\-coconuts + all nuts 

\-no dairy but fermented dairy (yogurt) is fine and she can drink oat milk

55,"I was blackmailed into doing something I didn’t want to do and I am so depressed about it(long) (f)

(21F)

A little while ago, my friend and I used to stream on a website and if people wanted to talk to us privately, we would make a private group that cost to get into. 

Anyway so we did this for a little bit (less than a week we just wanted some quick money) the groups were always platonic and some would get pissed as they expected more “sexual” content which we were not comfortable doing- so we said okay we will make snapchats for these people and talk to them (most were just lonely some would send inappropriate pictures and we would block)

One of the guys I ended up really liking and we started  chatting all the time and sending pictures, video called, and I honestly thought “I really like him” he told me personal things and showed his ID (now I know was fake) and we would talk about meeting...

Anyway after a week of talking he sent explicit pictures/ videos. I didn’t want to be prude and I really liked him, so I sent back some. He did a livestream (he showed everything) and I did one too (just topless in a thong) I just felt so comfortable and trusting..and wanted to be sexy 

He then wanted more and I refused to do that... so he got mad and saved everything to camera roll and told me he recorded the livestream. He said my name and address and had my Facebook somehow... and said he would send the videos to my family / friends unless I did what he said or paid him $10,000

I was devastated, obviously couldn’t pay that and wanted to die. 
He wanted me to do the private group with my friend explicitly and ask for tips and send half of them to him.
(He said think of this, all your information is safe, and you make money)
I was horrified and didn’t know what to do. I told him I would rather die than do it. 
He said what about just take your top off after reaching a certain limit?
So my friend and I did it. We promoted it and (acted bubbly/flirty overly sexual like he asked) we cried for hours after. We probably did it 3-5 times. 
It stopped being profitable quickly cause no one wanted to pay for that. (There was about 10 viewers, all who I did trust a little cause we talked on Snapchat) 
But of course we were still devastated 

After that stopped earning money, he wanted my snap password. I gave it to him. He wanted me to make an OnlyFans which he had access to. (And promote it) I did that, only agreeing to post feet pictures, but he posted my nudes and some of my live-streams on there to sell. I believe he also sold it on my snap. 
I was furious and wanted to die. (Still do) 

So I decided to delete everything the streaming app , I had to wait for OF to delete after a month bc it’s a 30day subscription. 

I messaged him on snap saying I was going to the police and talked to a lawyer family friend. There was proof I sent him money on cashapp.. and I had taken pictures on a different phone of his threats.. I told him I wouldn’t do that if he deleted everything, and moved on and never harassed me again.

He just said “ok, fine goodbye.” Just that ... 
This all took place in about a 5 week period. 

I haven’t been able to eat or sleep very well, I’ve just thrown myself into my studies. 
I’m sure there is stuff I repressed or just forget I am so traumatized and scared he posted my stuff somewhere and I am so embarrassed 

How do I stop being scared? How do I stop feeling shame? (Btw I moved to a new country) My mom has been amazing I don’t know what I would do without her 

Also my friend was blackmailed too, but that’s not my story to tell

57,"Let me put this in a more detailed way without details.

Every time we have sex, during I’m okay but immediately after I fear something happened, something went wrong, she’s pregnant or something, and it never fails. I use a condom and she chooses not to be on birth control due to how bad it makes female hormones, I don’t know much about how that works so I didn’t and won’t really push it unless it’s a viable option. This isn’t the first time either, with a previous girlfriend I did the same thing, and it got to the point I was actually depressed after sex. Isn’t that kind of sad?

Idk what to do if I should end it or stick it out. I love her but this is hard to watch and I make sure to ask if I can do anything or go above and beyond to spoil but get pushed away each time and there’s separation. I’m worried about her health. She’s been dealing with it for long time and is on medication rn for it and also talking to a doctor about it but nothing seems to be helping.

Since then I’ve lost weight (185) and I play for the varsity team but there isn’t a lot of competition. This is our second game and we lost 8-0. I would like to say that we have a decent team and if we keep working we could be a great team. 

The first half we conceded two from stupid mistakes. And after that we conceded the fourth in the second half we just gave up. And conceded a additional 4 goals.

Today was a reality check for me especially because I feel like I didn’t try my hardest and that I should have played better. I did some good things and some bad things. I am extremely good on the ball only passing. But when I have no options I really don’t know what to do. My coach told me to just kick the ball and I kinda hate that but I geuss I have to do that.

I feel like I don’t get along with a few of them, and one of my managers is being a huge dick to everyone, and I’m getting really irritated with it. The other day he YELLED in my face for moving away just a little bit while he was talking to me. I’m a junior in high school, and it’s rough right now, so I explained I could only work 3 days a week for my mental well being and for the sake of my grades. I was pressured into working at least 1 day during the weekend, so I explained to my boss that I could start working Sundays.  Well, according to him, that meant working 5 days a week, NONE of them including Sunday. And now I’m always anxious about work, I can barely concentrate on school or get anything done. On top of that, I have really bad seasonal depression, and my mental health is starting to deteriorate, and having problems with my coworkers is NOT helping.
I am a very spiritual person, and after having a chat about Chakras with the owner of a local metaphysical shop, in order to turn my life around and to be happier, I have to do something with my natural talents.

I had a chat with my therapist, and I think that the best thing for me to do is have a chat with my boss and tell him I can just work 4 days a week. If that doesn’t work for them, then I can get a new job. My mother isn’t so keen on the idea, however, because she thinks skipping jobs won’t look good, but I’m sixteen—is it really that big of a deal? I don’t know, and I don’t care.

79,"My dad obviously does not love me. He never says ""I love you"" or tries to help me when I need help. He never shows any love to anyone, and he seems to make everyone an enemy. Not only is he uncaring, he is also very mean to people. For example, he would make an inappropriate comment about something, and then everyone stares at him angrily. He doesn't apologize for his bad behavior. Not only is he socially awkward, he is also very rude and unrefined. For example, he thinks it's okay to drink right out of the carton. There would be a jug of milk in the fridge, and my dad would drink straight from it. He then rips out a nasty fart, and it's so gross. The whole kitchen smells bad for the next 30 seconds, and his farts echo throughout the entire house. He also doesn't flush the toilet after using it. I don't know why, and I'm too scared to ask him why. Someone else goes in there and flushes, and he takes that for granted. Every single day, he goes to the bathroom about 50 times, and he fills the toilet with toilet paper, and he doesn't flush. It smells terrible when he comes out, and I hate using the bathroom. We only have one bathroom in our house, and often I have to go to a friend's house to use the bathroom or just go to neighborhood clubhouse. Our bathroom stinks because of him.

Another thing is that he is very aggressive. I don't see why he has to stomp on the stairs. It's so scary when he does that. He also pounds the table when he talks to people, and he constantly farts and burps in front of people. For example, he would walk in front of someone and squeeze out a loud fart. Or he would be in front of someone at the grocery store line and just suddenly release a gross fart. Or maybe we are the movie theater and he spreads his legs out, puts his feet up on the seat in front of him, and let out an enormous rip that everyone hears. He could at least do it in private. I can't imagine why anyone would fart so loudly in public on purpose.

Even worse, he has terrible table manners. Every time we eat, he puts his disgusting feet on the table, eats with his bare hands, and constantly drops stuff on his clothes, on the floor, and on his chair. If we have soup, he often drinks straight from the pot. That's what ruins my appetite. He picks his nose when he eats, and he smears the booger on his pants. All his pants are stained with booger marks, and he wears those pants all the time.

The worst thing he does is he embarrasses me in public. He often sticks his hands down his pants in public, and he wiggles his hand around for a few minutes, then takes his hand out and sniffs it. I don't know what's going on in his mind. In the grocery store, he drinks milk right out of their cartons before even paying for it.

I get along with most of my coworkers, my managers are pretty cool, and I have a high hourly salary for someone my age.

88,"Hey, I’m a 16 year old female. I’m going to try my best to describe my situation and I really do hope I can get some advice. This is my first time using readit so I apologize if I’m doing this wrong-

Basically I’ve always had lung problems. ( I’m not sure if those problems are cure-able but if they are I’d like to get them fixed.)My dad has smoked ever since I was young and I suppose me taking in that damaged my lungs. I have trouble breathing in a normal mask so I decided to look for a different mask that I could properly breath in. And believe it or not I found one! It was a black fake leather mask in a beak shape. ( basically a plague doctor mask but just the beak.). I have school in person so we have to wear mask everyday. It’s already been a month with the pain of a normal mask. So the switch obviously caught people attention. At first it was nice, people would compliment me or call it cool but that was short lived. Soon kids began to make bird noises at me. I thought nothing of it even though I knew it was directed at me. And I just couldn’t stop thinking about it. I didn’t want to believe that something as stupid as that had gotten underneath my skin so I ignored it. Over and over again the kids would do the same thing freaking out laughing and saying “ oh she understands!” Every time I reacted. 

I know this is probably the case of “switch your mask” but I really don’t want to do that. I understand though if that’s the only logical option. Any advice would be nice. Thanks for reading through this.",07Oct2020,1
89,"So for a bit of backstory, I'm really close with my little cousin. I always have been. I see her as more as a little sister than a cousin, and we've always spent most days gaming online together. 

Her behaviour started to change somewhat recently which obviously concerned me. She was previously somewhat obsessive with always wanting to play games with me online, and would always choose me over her other friends. But, that has changed.

At one point, she was really excited because her 'friend' had asked her to make a 3d model for him, and so me being curious, I asked her what for. She mentioned that her online friend was a developer/programmer, which obviously concerned me because nobody around her age would be considered that.
At that point, I asked her how old he was and she said 19, to which I told her she shouldn't be talking to someone like that.
She then told me that it was just a random guy on a Discord server, and that he didn't know her age anyway. So, I left it at that.

Later on, during a gaming session with her, she started giggling etc etc because her friend had bought her Nitro, to which she then decided to pay them back by buying a game on their wishlist. She was really excited about it, but I had my suspicions.


She never had anyone on her Steam friendlist other than myself and a couple of mutuals, so when she mentioned she wanted to play another game with her 'friend', I'll admit that I did some snooping. I found that there were 2 new people on her friendslist that I didn't recognise. Going to the profile of one of them revealed that it was a 19 year old guy, as it said this in his bio. It also said that he was a programmer, and so it was pretty easy to piece things together.

Since then, she has sent me multiple screenshots of her stats in some games, where she probably didn't think that I'd notice the username of the 19 year old guy that she is talking to in Discord. She also seems to use a different discord to talk to him, than the one she talks to me on.

So fellow Redditors, I'm not sure what to do. I don't want to risk damaging my bond with her if she finds out I've been watching over her like this, but it also seems like her parents aren't taking the steps that are needed. I'm just really worried about her, even if it's just a normal albeit weird friendship she has with this random guy.

Any advice on what to do?",07Oct2020,1
90,"I was best friends with this girl my first year of college. There was a lot of drama where I went out with some guys she was interested in (I wasn't aware). This was 10 years ago. 

&amp;#x200B;

That is the context for why this girl doesn't like me essentially.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, it basically boils down to... I went to a costume party dressed up in a sombrero and poncho when I was a freshman because it was an easy costume and wasn't too slutty. Like I said we were best friends and so we took some pictures together. I thought the pictures were purged because this was nearly a decade ago. I have now learned how insensitive and wrong it is to dress that was as a costume. I found pictures today that I thought didn't exist so I messaged her on Facebook today to ask her to remove the pictures and she didn't respond to me at first. I messaged her again and she said she would ""review the pictures"".

&amp;#x200B;

93,"My 20th birthday party was 2 days ago and the theme was the roaring 20’s. One, I went with my family to get the supplies. Two, my pops and I were the only ones that got dressed out out of 10 people. three, I felt completely left out..since no one really seemed to conversate with me but, with each other. And four, my sister didn’t just show me the cake she was baking for me but I knew all the details. I didn’t feel welcomed, and within 8 minutes of the “party” starting I instantly wanted it to end..I got two cakes. A $10 cheesecake from Walmart and another $20 cake from Walmart (no one thought there was gonna be cake so that’s why there’s two) Now, this Sunday is my sisters 21st birthday and it’s a surprise party. They’re going all out and doing everything in their power to make sure she doesn’t know. They already have the location, food, and cake planned out. I guess my point is, is it bad that I feel like no one cared about my birthday? And suddenly want to make it a secret and go all out on this one?

94,"I've been dating this amazing girl for a few months now. Since the beginning I knew she had very strong social anxiety so I have been taking things really slowly.

Whenever we're about to get a bit more intimate she apologizes for not knowing how to act, and I thought this was pretty normal since she hasn't really dated before, but then things got a bit strange.

Things are ok if I'm kissing her boobs, I know she's enjoying that part, she gets properly aroused, however, as soon as I move down to her thighs the anxiety levels shoot right up to the point we have to interrupt the act. It is very disproportional - still I was attributing it to being anxious.

One time we were on the sofa and I touched her thigh, she got an anxiety attack and went away crying. I thought maybe I was the problem. I asked her if she wasn't ready to have sex with me yet or if her feelings towards me changed. That's when she revealed she had an ""obscure sexual experience"" before and she couldn't talk about it.

I decided not to go sexual for sometime. We kept making out innocently, until the other day things went the spicy way again, and again she had to quit as soon as I went south.

I asked her if she wanted to talk about it. Her answer is she **cannot** talk about it. She'll cry and shake. She won't speak at all. Afterwards, she'll get profoundly sad.

The maximum I got her to say - and I really had to fish for words there - is that she is really saddened by the fact she cannot have sex with me even though she wants to.

I don't want to overwhelm her with questions. It just bothers me that I don't see a way to possibly help her out. I truly love her, our relationship has been amazing and I wouldn't change a thing, but it's very hard to see her in that state.

She says she has no money for therapy (we discussed that because of her social anxiety) and she won't let me pay for it either.

I am willing to read and learn whatever the technique is necessary to get whatever that obscure event was out of her mind. I know she has done self-harm when she was a teenager as well, and that seems to be the kind of habit assaulted people develop, right?

Sometimes I wonder if there's anything I can do as we're about to have sex to help her through this, some kind of hypnotherapy... but honestly, sex can wait as long as she needs.

Does anyone have any experience with this kind of trauma? How would you handle this situation?

Thanks!",07Oct2020,1
95,"My fiance and I have been together for nearly a decade, and his mother has mixed feelings about it. She was fine when we were just dating, although every once in a while, she would feel so threatened that she would say or do something to really hit me where it hurts- but so casually, she wouldn't be called out on it. I'm so nonconfrontational, that I'm more than willing to deal with the insults if it means there won't be a fight. 
However, when he and I got engaged, something snapped in her, because shortly after she began to insult everything. From the wedding guest list to the theme and colors and, of course, the budget. We asked her from the get go if she'd be willing to contribute, to which she said a tentative yes. She said we needed to be more direct with how much we're wanting to spend. We came up with a plan- a $12,000 budget which we'll pay $2,000 of, my parents will pay about $1,000 of (I come from a very, very poor family), and the rest, he can take from his own untouched college fund (with, no joke, about 8X the amount we need) that he never wanted to use for college anyway. And now? She won't contribute at all. She is now claiming it's all her money, and he's just going to have to figure out for himself how we're going to pay for this thing. One hundred percent serious, I work 3 jobs already because Covid put me in the red, and she frequently sends me JOB APPLICATIONS. He's going to have to start working over nights as well as his day job help support the wedding. Which, under normal circumstances would be fine, except that we lost our jobs in the pandemic, and it literally was not our fault we had to use our savings on food and rent.

97,"Ok so for context, I live in a building that's one of the first residences built in my state (in Australia, so this residence is 145 years old). I don't have a yard connected, just a balcony and a carpark downstairs with some dirt areas to walk around the building and to store bins. Recently some of the area down there was dug up to set up NBN in the area, and they uncovered some old medicine bottles which they left in the discarded dirt/stones after their work was done. I'm an anthropology major and became pretty excited by these finds, it made me start thinking about the possible history of my building and its importance, because it's not a mansion like the other buildings from that time, so it has a very low heritage status because it was just a house for regular people and not for the elite of the time. And if they discarded medicine bottles behind the house, this was likely their rubbish/bonfire spot, so there could be a lot of interesting things just under the surface out there.   
My question is, would it be illegal, wrong or unsafe of me to rope off some of the dirt areas and dig down like 30cm? Since its just dirt, I can easily just refill and tamp down the hole when I'm done and besides not doing damage, it could really only help the soil and remove weeds anyway. But are there wires/pipes I'd end up coming across? Is it illegal to do this? Do I have to take certain safety precautions?

Marriage and kids come up a lot and up until a few months ago I’ve been very keen to the idea of being able to have my own kids while I can and then fostering/possibly adopting when the others are grown. My boyfriend is also on board with this idea so he is well aware of what my plans are. 

A few months ago though I was visiting my oldest brother (i have a middle brother, and then I am the youngest) and he had mentioned something our mom had said to him. He told me “mom straight up told me that once you have kids, she will no longer be coming around to see mine or give them any sort of gifts since you’ll need all of her attention”. So basically, her grandchildren that adore her so much would be dropped the second I had a positive pregnancy test. 

Considering everything my mom has put my oldest brother through, I feel as if it’s not fair for me to take that away from his kids. He has told me that it shouldn’t change my decision as to whether or not I will have kids but I told him it has. I know it isn’t my fault for the way my mom chooses to act, but I feel like since I can prevent it from happening I should. 

It should be mentioned that 1) I am hands down my moms favorite. All three of us (us as in my siblings) know it. My mom really only communicates with my oldest brother at this point because of his kids and 2) there are other reasons as to why I’m hesitant to having kids not just her but she’s definitely the biggest reason. The other reasons include mental health (a new study has shown that it is possible for parents to pass down mental health problems such as depression, anxiety and other things) and also I don’t want to perpetrate any cycle of abuse. My dad abused me when I was younger so knowing that cycle could continue through me is also scary.

I’ve been running around for him everywhere meeting on his terms. Ever since this separation he has been constantly cruel/bitter towards me, refuses to mend things for our child’s sake, refuses to take any responsibility and ignores/avoids any reconciliation. Treats me like crap in front of our child and shifts all the blame onto me. I haven’t reacted at all to his threats or arguments. Stalking me on social media etc. making me look like a bad person and painting himself as this amazing person. He’s left me so many times before this too. I’m not upset, I’m just fed up. 

Now I’m not saying for him to leave me alone in spite of the break up or to keep our child away because I am more than willing to allow it. I’m cooperating and putting in the effort to get along.

At this point I’m at wits end. Any sort of communication with him turns into him gaslighting me, manipulating me, attacking me and getting really defensive. There’s no winning at all - or so it seems. 


So the advice I’m asking for is:
Are there any boundaries I can put in place so that I can live comfortably without him getting upset that I don’t want to meet up for just one day? Am I allowed to limit the meet ups to at least 1-2 days a week? I’m exhausted and he won’t get off my back about anything. Is there anything I can do to have a peaceful life?

108,"So I live in an apartment with three roommates. Where I live, we were in mandatory quarantine from May - July, and during this time two of my roommates “fell in love” and began an intense romantic relationship. My third roommate left during this time to pass the quarantine with family, and I was stuck as a third wheel as the lovebirds went from 0-100. I’d overhear mentions of marriage, calling each other soulmates, etc. I believe they are generally nice people with good intentions. However, they quickly became a duo that passive aggressively controls the apartment. They can be quite selfish and inconsiderate. I feel as if I’m living in the spare room of a married couple who expect me to live by their rules. They are extremely spiritual: full moon rituals, yoga and meditation, tarot, crystals, and more.... I can appreciate meditation/spirituality but I wouldn’t say I’m quite into that stuff so intensely. Once I managed to get away for a weekend and when I returned they told me that there are ghosts in my bed and in the art above my bed. They “felt and saw the energy” while on drugs. What the hell even is that? Maybe there are ghosts there lol anyways... I have many other examples, but I’ll cut to the chase. I feel guilty for having such negative feelings towards them. I really can’t stand to be around them anymore. I’m sure I am not a golden roommate, but I try to be kind and respectful. I definitely have built up a wall and don’t engage as much.

Im just living here as some sort of “average joe.” I can pick up a few hobbies sure. But none of them will be a genuine passion that i’ll be willing to sit 24 hours working on in full focus. Just busy work like learning html or guitar practice. I dont know what to do. Advice?,07Oct2020,1
112,"So basically I’m (15m) a freshman in high school and me and a really good friend of mine still hang out and stuff, but it’s just us at lunch and walking around school. Another good friend of mine is in this friend group that I would definitely fit in with, be in, and hang out with. Throughout middle school, I was never invited to stuff and never really hung out with anyone, and this could be my chance to “flip the script” if you will. I don’t just want to leave my best friend in the dust though, but I do realize sometimes I’ve gotta for things for myself. Really good friend and I would still be good friends and be in classes and clubs together, we may just start to drift apart a little bit. What do y’all think? I know this is of like super unimportance and I should probably be worried abt other stuff, but I just want some advice before I make the decision.",07Oct2020,1
113,"Ok, so I'm an artist. I'm 18 years old so I can legally view NSFW at on twitter. However I seem to analyze the quality of the artists. Seriously, their quality is what I always wished my art would be. I want to ask them questions but it's difficult since they are all professional artists. However when I draw NSFW art or even just normal art. I get no attention or criticism. I feel that people seeing my art would motivate me to do more  but I'm starting to lose my motivation and seeing all the art that the other people on twitter post and with the amount of attention they get is starting to make me feel envious and jealous. I know that getting controlled by your emotions is a bad thing but I feel like i'm starting to break. I see all this art on twitter and I want to stop constantly going there because It reminds me about it but it's like I constantly hope that my art gets noticed and I keep going on it",07Oct2020,1

115,"Hi, so as it says in the title, I've been struggling a lot lately with feeling superior, and then as a result feeling guilty and very, very lonely. 

I've dated a couple of guys over the past few years. A few of them were great, mature, intelligent, handsome, just awesome in every way, but somehow that romantic spark never developed, which I think is because I didn't *buy into them*, if that makes any sense. Other times I made a stupid decision, or they did.

In terms of friends, I have two people in my life who I feel are ""on par"" with me in terms of emotional intelligence and maturity. We each have our neuroses, but we're all relatively aware of them, and often talking to each other helps us see them better. I love these people, and I would not trade them for anything.

But when I go out into the world, it's hard not to feel really smug and apart, because I can't shake the sense that most of the people around me are terribly lost, unwise, and emotionally stupid. Maybe it's because most of the people I end up talking to are nerdier types (I go to a somewhat nerdy college, but also I'm a nerd). I get the sense that some of the more ""normal"" kids are emotionally intelligent. But since I have Asperger's syndrome, and also because I hate being dishonest on principle, I sometimes come off as very blunt, and I think this is why I have never successfully made friends with any of them, despite many attempts.

Conversely, I have a lot of friends who are immature (despite being the same age as me). That's fine, but it's the majority of my friends at at this point almost every friend I hang out with in real life (fuck covid) is less mature than me, which means I often feel like a parent or therapist. I can't shake the feeling that these people don't and can't *see* me, on a fundamental level. And it makes me worry about my romantic prospects. I'd very much like to get married someday, but I can't imagine marrying someone who is meaningfully less mature than me, because I feel like they wouldn't fully understand me. I know that these people exist (my friends, one is a girl and the other is gay), but my heart is generally very picky about who it's attracted, and I worry that the overlap between ""people I'm attracted to"" and ""people who can understand me on a deep level"" is really fucking small. 

I feel like these worries are at least somewhat unjustified, because I like to think that everyone has something useful to add to the world, and I hate to feel superior to others. It feels morally wrong and sets up a certain distance between us. But I can't shake the feeling, because so many of the experiences I've had at this point are of other people needing my advice and wisdom, and not vice versa. (I know I'm just twenty, but I've been through some shit). 

Do you think this will go away as everyone gets older? Should I start hanging out with grad students, somehow? Is this just my big fat ego, which I should try to deflate as quickly as possible?

**tl;dr:** I can't help feeling superior to other people based on my experiences with them, and it hurts and makes me feel lonely. I want to stop but I don't know how. I don't even know if that's possible right now, or if I have to wait for everyone else around me to ""catch up"" emotionally. Or am I doomed for good?",07Oct2020,1
116,"This is going to be long.

I (21F) haven’t been studying for very long as I only did a short 12 month course on becoming a professional makeup artist. I know exactly where I want my career path to follow but I don’t know what to do, or where to start. Basically I want to expand my career in the beauty industry and further my study in nursing, and later onto cosmetic nursing. There are a few pathways I can go, by Defence, or through university. I come from a military background and prior to this course I was going through basic training myself. The reason why I’m no longer in the military is due to mental health. I was discharged in 2018, and have been working on managing my Depression/Anxiety and believe that I am at a point where I have overcome the sadness and self hate. I’m ready, and quite proud of my achievements in my life. I would rather this pathway for job security, a better income (it’s a good wage in my country), and because I wasn’t very smart throughout high school when it came to choosing subjects (I had no direction and had already applied for the military). I’ve submitted all my assignments and have my last block this week which I’ve been avoiding because I’m at a standstill. I feel like I’ve lost direction and passion. As a side note my lease ends in February and I don’t know whether to move out or extend it, and this is adding to the confusion. I have a partner (21M) who has to be included in all my plans too, but he’s deciding whether or not he wants to be in my life and it’s frustrating. What is your advice on what I should do?",07Oct2020,1
117,"Long story short, I helped a girl with mental disabilities ( I never felt it polite to ask what her diagnosis is) with some computer stuff and she asked me if she can sit with me  at lunch. I said yes because she was super nice but also because we had the same lunch together and I didn't want to say no just to have her see me sitting by myself at lunch making her feel excluded.

The first day in the cafeteria she began singing very loudly and it made me pretty uncomfortable. 

The next day I have no class after the period I have her in, so I could either go to lunch or go home but seeing how uncomfortable that was last time (I know she can't help it) I said I was going to my math class. This was the truth but a little twisted since I did have math class... a few hours later and I could definitely go to lunch. 

When I told her I couldn't today she became super quiet and visibly upset. That freaking hurt to watch but I know I can't go every day like this.

I avoided lunch mainly because of her but now I don't go to lunch on those days at all. I was going to still eat lunch with her every other day but I don't think I could've handled every single day. I am patient but she also can have an attitude and doesn't understand a lot of social norms nor the fact that Covid is a serious issue. My mom is high risk but she likes handshakes and fist bumps and such. 

I found some people I knew and sat with them and she wasn't there. It was really fun and we had a good time. Now that she is there it gets uncomfortable often but we still try to include her while also blocking her a little bit since she doesn't know when to stop. Like I'll be having a conversation with someone and she'd shout GUYS GUYS YOU HAVE TO WATCH THIS and she'd have some power rangers thing going on. So again, lack of social norms and attitude are becoming very obnoxious (again, I know she can't help it) and recently became a huge party pooper. 

Today I was going to sit with my little brother with his friends since I couldn't find the other people I felt I was becoming friends with (maybe because of her or because of the level change we had where the student size in a day doubled) and she obviously came with me. She has no one else I think. This time it took less than a minute for the entire group to disappear since she began singing louder than ever. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently going through some extreme levels of stress from my workload and the shit life has been throwing at me and so while I have been able to control it, I am often on the edge of being very irritable and lashing out. Not at her but mainly just because of the shittiness of life right now. I had such an outburst twice today and it's almost uncontrollable but they always happen when I'm alone. 

Anyway, she is making me and everyone around me uncomfortable and lunch is the only time I can actually socialize and have a good time with people so while I hate to say it, it feels like she is robbing me of the few joys I have left.   


I went into this with the mindset of, if 30 minutes of me being uncomfortable makes her day then it's worth it. But this 30 minutes is leeching into other aspects now too and I don't know what to do. I am scared to tell her to tone it down or sometimes outright shut up because again, she can't help it and it's not necessarily her fault, but I am just lost as to what to do.   


I still wish to have lunch with her every other day because it seems like I'm the only one who she really has but because of her snappy attitude at times I don't know how to address it. I can't just teach her social norms. She is special needs and I don't even know what she has.   


Someone help please. Maybe I can go to a counselor? But right now I seriously don't have time. I am already falling behind by writing this post. I am stressed, irritable, and I don't know what to do.

126,"To provide some background context, I'm a 20 year old uni student who's had some really high aspirations in terms of career paths and life. Earlier in the year, I've laid out some very specific goals to pursue a career in high-finance i.e Getting elected as president of an elite finance club, winning competitions, landing summer internships, etc.

However, in the past few months, regardless of the intensity or amount of desire/willpower/focus I've had when pursuing my goals, it's like the entire universe has completely conspired against me, and deprived me of even the smallest victories. I've been having on the receiving end of rejections from nearly all the companies (with 1 company left) that I've applied for summer internships to, even though my background in terms of academics/extra-curricular etc are strong. I just got screwed over in the elections for the club, which I'm very bummed by because it was always a dream of mine to be president. Even my search for a GF has gone off the rails, and frankly at this point, I'm very bewildered and flustered by all the shit that has been happening. 

I've done a lot of introspection to identify my flaws, and learn from the mistakes I've done, but external factors that I have no control over have just been increasingly derailing my chances of even achieving the slightest of goals. I also do pray a lot, but at this point, it feels like an entire exercise in futility.

I'm going to college next year.

My eye lids are very droopy and I've hated them every since, however, I have found a surgeon (in another state) which provides 'canthoplasty' in order to correct my eyes.

My mom is skeptical and slightly disappointed whenever I bring up surgeries.

I have brought getting my rhinoplasty once, and she accepted reluctantly, saying that she will let me as long as she is confident that I already love who I am and I'm already confident with what I have.

She has also told me in the past that people keep getting surgeries non-stop and it turns out to be like an addiction. I totally agree with this.

Rhinoplasty and canthoplasty will fix both of my obvious issues and I don't have problems literally anywhere else on my face.

To her, the eye surgery will obviously sound way too invasive, but I need to convince her. I have already found a renowned doctor who performs canthoplasty (Dr Taban in Beverly Hills for reference).

So we’re pretty much together all the time, and there’s not a huge difference in how much we work. Well, recently I’ve been dealing with a lot of depression and pain. My husband suggested that we buy a game that I like to play and that I should play it for awhile until the stress goes away. I told him I liked Animal Crossing, and so I spent over $500 for the gaming system and game ( I don’t make a lot, about 1/3 of what he does)

Hey guys i need help

On Sunday October 4th, i called in sick for work. I felt like shit after a conflict the night before. Im a bartender and have been for the past 5 weeks and i'd like to say im pretty good and have gotten the hang of things pretty well. The shift the night before (October 3rd) started off pretty well. I took care of the girls and kept them stocked up as i worked. Refilled their jugs of water as they needed, and got them more glasses as they went. The day was medium busy, and was spitting out drinks faster than the servers could keep up, all while taking care of the girls. The day got busier and my 
supervisor/higher up, told me he would be taking over bar as he thinks he could go faster than me and overall help us all out. And so i was stuck with bartender assistant for the night. I took care of pouring draught and grabbing bottles, and my supervisor took care of cocktails. I did my job as assistant bartender and stayed out of his way as much as i can, as the person doing cocktails needs to run around the bar for ingredients, juices,  and liquors. The night was going smoothly, so smooth, that my supervisor even tells me ""I like this."" Assuming he likes the work being done, and we have a good flow going around. Night slows down a tad, and my supervisor asks for more limes to be cut, as we were running out. But i saw he had more bottles that needed to be grabbed maybe a draught to be poured, so i did those first. The moment i went to cut limes my boss(also the owner) says to me ""Billy your priorities are not in the right place motherfucker, you should be helping with these drinks, not cutting limes"" and immediately my day was ruined. I dont if its me being fragile but that completely ruined the night for me. I felt so unappreciated and that im working for a guy who doesnt know how hard im working. This comment stuck with me the entire night and even impacted my ability to work. I crashed, i slowed down, i put on my mask so i could hide the fact i wasnt too happy. Throughout the night some of the girls asked if was okay and i said nothing, except for one girl, we'll call her B. Now when B asked how i was, i felt like she cared, and so i simply told her ""I feel like im gonna crash"" she asks if ive been getting enough sleep, ""Yea, it was just a comment that the boss said to me, wasnt too great"", as the night went by my supervisor asked how i was, thats when i couldnt hold it anymore and tears started to come out my eyes, and i went to the fridge and B was there. She asked if it was the comment from earlier, i said yes. ""Billy, go take 5, just go to the washroom"" I thank her. I break down in the washroom, gather myself and continue with the night. Thats the context of that night. I was later sent home a bit earlier than closing. Next morning I get a text from my boss with a picture of the bar floor being 30 with a few sticks and a peach or two and some bottle caps. i call the restaurant and I called in sick i told B Who was there in the morning and told her I was feeling under the weather. She immediately understood and just told me to call your boss to let him know. I called the boss and told him I wasn't feeling too well and he asked me if i could stay for atleast a few hours as it was gonna be a busy day and said something about ""if you're not deathly ill, i say suck it up."" i tell him im sorry, as im not going in today. ""k"" and hangs up. Its now October 5th, Monday, I get a text from one of the girls saying my name got crossed off on the schedule.. did i get fired? from calling in sick for a day? I also usually get my tips e transfered to me every monday, @ around 5pm. I didnt get any. Monday night rolls around, no tips. Now it leads us to today. Tuesday October 6th, My boss texts me ""Billy, I did not hear back from you yet so I covered your shifts off this week. I hope your feeling better and wish you a speedy recovery."" 
Ok.. they thought i called in sick** and didnt want anyone else getting sick. To which i respond ""oh hey boss! I was just about to call in today to ask about the next move. I hope you know i called in for a mental health issue and just needed to take care of myself and my well being. I appreciate you taking the precaution as if I were ill, but I'd like to inform you that I am good to go for Wednesday if that works with you."" No response. I emailed his wife which does all our tips, asking if she forgot. after emailing her, she responds later in the night ""Yes i missed yours. I just sent the e-transfer"" She sent me 43 dollars. For the week. I usually make between 400-550 a week with tips alone, i missed one day and i made 43$? So now im here. I dont know what the next move is. No one has replied. I dont know wether or not im getting fires, or if they're playing me for a fool. Pls help:/ 

TDLR: bad conflict with boss made me call in sick the next day, now am crossed off the schedule for the week following and have not been paid my tips properly.",07Oct2020,1
141,"Before you say this first part doesn't relate...please stay with me. Also if any of these problems make me a freeloading asshole, well ok. I completely agree with you, but I am feeling miserable about this and I'm asking for some advice. Feel free to call me any name you want, but I am posting this anyway, because I know there will be some others who sympathize and I don't know what else to do/who to ask. Even my psychiatrist has been no help, and I have no friends irl (don't feel sorry for me, it's my choice not to have them. I don't connect with others  and I'm happy that way).

I am a 27 year old woman. I've struggled with severe mental illness since I was born. Fortunately, I was very lucky to be born into an upper income family with parents who have bent over backward to give me whatever I wanted. 

I have a bachelor's degree in liberal arts that has gotten me nowhere. It was supposed to be in education, but I couldn't finish my student teaching due to my mental health. I have been in a career hole since I graduated in 2016 because I can't hold a job for more than two months. I have an absolute crippling fear of work that I can't pin down or figure out. I've been seeing a therapist and psychiatrist, and I've been taking meds since I was 13, but nothing has ever touched this problem. However, my parents have always paid for everything for me, including my rent at my apartment, so it was never a big deal in terms of getting by financially.  Because I can't hold a job, I am completely financially dependent on my parents. They own my car, my phone, everything really. My bank account right now has less that 1400 dollars in it, and I share my credit card with my dad, who pays it off for me.

I realized a few years back that the only way to get a job I know I can handle (teaching community college, so I get college breaks at summer, Christmas, and weekends) was to get the teaching license I could't finish in undergraduate school. In 2019 I went back to graduate school, and I'm supposed to graduate in May. My student teaching starts in February.

Here's the problem: my parents have lost their minds over this pandemic. My sister and I had to come back home when our school closed our parents said so (she's dependent too, so we had to listen). My father is 75, has smoked since he was 20, and has high blood pressure. He is also extremely mentally ill, like I am, but his is different. He has crippling OCD and is terrified of germs and disease, and he has been since he was a kid. He's the type who would refuse to go to the doctor if there was an arrow through his head because he'd be afraid of catching leprosy or some other obscure thing (leprosy is actually one of his biggest fears, tbh). Unlike me, he's terrified of doctors and won't take any meds or see a doctor about his OCD at all. He is completely convinced he is going to die of covid.

My sister and I came home in early March. Our parents would not let us leave the house. Not at all. They owned our cars and would not let us leave. My sister is a wonderful follower and believes all their paranoia, so she was okay with that. I was too at first; I don't care much for being around other people anyway. But I was never scared of covid. They started letting me go to a store every once in a blue moon, but all these ridiculous rules were created. I think I remembered all of them?

1. Our mail can't be brought in the house. It has to sit outside for days and be drenched in Lysol before coming in, while the person spraying it wears a face shield, gloves, and a mask. This includes valuable information, sitting on our porch for anyone to see.
2. My mom is the only one who can go grocery shopping.
3. You have to get up at 5 am to go anywhere, so you can be home before 8 when other people might get there.
4. To go out, we have to wear gloves, a mask, face shield, long sleeves, long pants., and sunglasses. God knows we can't let the covid in our eyes!
5. We have to sanitize our GLOVES before we take them off. More than once.
6. We can't wear clothes we've worn out into the house. We have to strip on the deck, OUTSIDE, and change, so we don't bring covid clothes into the house.
7. Any shoes we've worn out must sit on the porch for two days before we can wear them inside again. Can't have that covid on the floors, for god's sake!
8. Only a certain brand of cloth masks with filters can be worn. Of course, everything else is counterfeit and won't work.
9. Most groceries can only be delivered or picked up from the curbside pickup.
10. God forbid we get within 60 feet of someone else!
11. Anything the outside air touches must be disinfected instantly. When we come home from anywhere, all the doorknobs must be wiped down.
12. If the store was crowded, we have to take baths as soon as we get home. Even though we get  no hot water here because my deadbeat dad refuses to buy a new hot water heater.
13. Every dish we use must be absolutely wiped clean with all food scraped into the trash can before being washed. We have no dishwasher thanks to my wonderful dad's refusal to spend money on anyone but himself, and he doesn't do the dishes so he doesn't care. God forbid a MOLECULE of food get down the sink and clog it, so then covid-carrying workmen would have to come in the house! (my dad literally said this)
14. No eating out, no ordering carryout, OHMYGOD THERE'S COVID IN THE FOOD!!!!!!!
15. Don't go to the doctor or ER-even if there IS an arrow through your head. The Covid is worse!
16. No one can work any job that isn't virtual.
17. Anything we buy-including our tons of groceries every weekend-has to be all set on the outside table, wiped off with Lysol wipes and/or bleach, meanwhile getting covered in bugs and melting in the sun (if it's frozen stuff), before being brought in and put away. Gotta get the covid off the packaging!

&amp;#x200B;

My parents both teach-my dad is a professor and mom teaches high school. When my mom found out she'd have to go back to actual school, she promptly called our loser doctor (virtually, of course!), who told her that if my dad catches covid he will absolutely die. How the man can predict the future, I'm not sure. He gave her a note, and the school gave her special permission to work from home. The work has become so ridiculous that she is working from 4 AM to 10 PM, every day, even on weekends. She is sobbing over it constantly. She is going to retire early, at Christmas, despite saying we do not have the money for her to do that. My dad has been teaching online and will most likely be asked to leave as well. They want to get rid of him anyway because he's so old and he's nuts.

My parents are also absolute radical liberals. They're tried to force their agenda onto me my whole life, but I hate politics because I simply don't care about any of it. I don't care what Trump and Biden do or don't do because it doesn't affect me, and think both parties are equally to blame for all the bullshit in our country. My dad is utterly obsessed with Trump. He argues, literally SCREAMS at the Republican politicians and newscasters on the TV as if they can hear him. He says they're Nazis, evil, Satan, all that nonsense. My parents have this warped belief that if Biden wins the election, the pandemic will end because he will ""make"" everyone wear masks. First of all, it's a virus. Masks are not going to kill it. Second, we can't make people do anything. They will wear masks if they want to , and most don't. Biden winning will not change anything with the vaccine development either.

Here's the thing: I have maybe been out of the house 6 times since February. My parents will not let me do ANYTHING. They have become mean over this and they do not see it. We have had downright screaming matches over this, because they cannot see their flawed thinking here. Even my therapist and psychiatrist both said my parents are delusional, but if I say that, I get shut down instantly with my mom sobbing and guilt tripping me that I don't love her anymore. Or my dad, who curses in my face and tells me to go away. (maybe he should, considering this is his stupid obsession that's ruining everything and bullied my mom into her insane behavior. He has NPD and it shows. She enables him like crazy and always has. Yet, if my mental illness gets in the way, I'm nuts, delusional, etc....no one kisses my ass like that. Or the opposite: You're just depressed! Take your meds! It will get better!)

Honestly, I do not believe there will be a vaccine for this virus. It's been eight months. We keep hearing ""good"" news that seems to disappear the next day. We've never successfully vaccinated a coronavirus before. I feel like the world is waiting on someone to wave a magic wand that may or may not exist. The world simply wasn't designed for this and can't go on this way much longer. Neither can I. I have millions of physical health problems that  I can feel getting worse every day, and I can't go to the doctor to see about them. I even tried going on a mood stabilizer to get through this with my parents, and it caused me to develop a severe skin rash, so I had to stop. That's what I get for trying to feel better. If I say this to my mom, she stares at the floor and doesn't speak. Or, like today, she'll tell me I'm bringing politics into it and to get over it. It's not politics to say people will have to just go back to normal because the world can't sustain this forever; it's common sense. The problem is that my mom wants just that: for me to sit here, in this old rundown house, suffering from five or six major health problems, for the rest of my life. So my dad won't be exposed to covid.

I don't have the money to just leave, as I said. If I leave with my mom's car, she will call the police on me (she told me this). Most of all, despite my family's insanity, I love them and do not want to hurt them in any way. I know I can't live without them. I've tried to have a friendly discussion about what we'd do if there wasn't ever a vaccine, and all they say is, ""there'll be one. That's irrelevant."" I am feeling absolutely trapped. I don't know what to do. My mother is not going to let me do my student teaching if there's no vaccine for me before February, which there won't be. My school has said that if I take a leave of absence, I cannot get back in and finish the degree later. My advisor and head of my program has made it quite clear that this is delusional to her as well, and I will most likely not get into a school again anywhere because she will tell them I'm a nervous wreck and not fit for teaching children. I cannot sit here for the rest of my life.

If anyone has any advice for me, I'd appreciate it more than you know.",07Oct2020,1
142,"Hi. Not sure where to post this but could use some advice.

Try to find a company or routine based on your specific needs and face conditions, such as if your face oily or dry, or is your face have cysts or small blackheads, etc. If you find items and products that work well for these conditions it helps a surprising amount. Even better is finding a company such as Lumin for men that can personalize a routine for you and send a free trial. But always try to stay away from the dermatologist office if possible. I personally went to the office for months and saw little to no results in my acne treatment. Most clinics will try to give you products that are expensive and make you keep coming back, some of these even have harsh chemicals that make you very vulnerable to burns! As soon as I stopped going to these clinics and found a new routine I had already a significantly clearer face!

146,"So I have been dating my boyfriend for over 3 years now. We grew up together and we had a conversation reminiscing of when we were in highschool/cadets. He then said that back then I had an amazing body. Which kind of made me raise an eyebrow. He then proceeded to say this and I quote: “Well babe I don't lie to you. It's not as good as it was, I can't lie about it. But you're working now so it'll get there” 

For some background I when I was 19 I got pregnant and half way through the pregnancy I lost the baby. I decided that I didn’t want to have another baby for a while so I got in birth control. Specially I got on the depo shot. I was in it for 2 years. Within that I went from 120lbs to 150lbs. I’m off of it now but my weight is an extremely big insecurity of mine. When he said that I “had” an amazing body and then proceeded with the above quote it just made me breakdown. I’m crying while typing this right now. 

I’ve been trying to lose this weight for months and for some odd reason it won’t budge. My boyfriend has never called me beautiful or anything. It’s so frustrating feeling like I’m not enough just because I’m now 30lbs heavier. My body composition is roughly the same, I just have a wider midsection.

Recently, she came out about her sexuality to her mum. Her mum did not take that well at all and is sending her back to her abusive dad, now living with his girlfriend. Furthermore, she is getting all her electronic devices taken away from her so she has no way to communicate with her friends (including me). It should be noted that her mum despises her friends.

a few weeks later we get news that some of us will change classes and to my surprise me and 3 of my other friends are in the same class. i was so happy. 

ever since i came back to school i haven't really been raising my hand a lot. you may be wondering why? two reasons. i'm shy and believe it or not i was scared of what my classmates would think of me. in what way you may ask. well basically the way and talk and how i sound. i know it's weird but it's just how i feel. lately i've been terrified of embarrassment. i always seem to think that people think i'm weird with every move i make. from fixing my hair to getting something from my backpack from the way i dress and act when we can go outside.

there's also this thing i experience where whenever i'm late to school i get really emotional and end up bursting into tears. i'm not entirely sure as to why but i think it's because of the embarrassment and shame. i know it's weird. ive been experiencing this ever since last year.

so to keep a very long story short, I was wrongfully transferred from my job 3 months ago and finally just this week got transferred back. I never got anything in writing regarding my initial transfer (they did not follow policy with this transfer either), I went from part time to full time back in March and never got that in writing (nor did it reflect in my time card that I'm full time), and when the transfer happened I was cut back to part time hours which also was not in writing.

Now, they've brought me back to my original job and given me full time hours again, however none of this is in writing... still.

My regional manager told me a week ago to expect an email from HR in a day or 2 with official transfer paperwork and updating my time card to reflect that I am a full time employee. A week later, no email, nothing changed in my time card, etc.

I was working Tues-Friday but now they expect me to work M-F which I'm fine with, but I *really* did not want to accept any more schedule changes without receiving things in writing regarding my transfer. (I did receive a text from my regional manager saying she wants me back at my old job M-F, is that technically enough...?)

My school and I were on the beach. I was in the water. The demon, she looks like the girl from the ring, started swimming towards my floating device. She came right up to me and stared into my eyes without saying anything. She became a student at my school, except no one else knew she was there. Her presence was only real to me. I tried to tell my Mom about her, in my dream, but my mom said I was a liar. 

There was also an image of the demon attaching itself to me and draining my age quickly. The old host of the demon is only 54, but she (literally) looks like she is 75. 

\*DREAM END\*

In sum, I do not want to have anything to do with this demon. The demon is also relatively powerful so I am going to need some profound ideas to get rid of her. 

Tldr; a demon is trying to possess me. How do I get rid of it?",07Oct2020,1

174,"I’m gonna try to keep this short but here it goes (btw on mobile). So me (16yo female) and my best friend (17yo male) had met when I was three and he was four. We went to the same pre-k, elementary and most of middle school (I moved to a different city at the end of 7th grade). We kept in contact through the rest of middle school and we still contact each other now as juniors in high school. Halfway through sophomore year (around last December) I realized that he is really cute! I thought it was gonna pass by the next month but nearly a year later, it hasn’t. I don’t know if I’m in love with him or it’s just a crush and I’m so confused. But I knew for sure that I liked him from the last time we saw each other on Saturday. I didn’t tell him then cause I chickened out. 

In a nutshell, my questions are, 
1) how to do I tell if I’m in love or it’s a crush
2) should I tell him how I feel? If so how?

175,"Hi, I’m a high school senior. All my life I was a “gifted kid.” School was so easy for me. I never had to study, and homework was very easy. But last year my classes have gotten harder. At first I procrastinated, but it was never a problem. Then I started turning assignments in late, and once covid hit I stopped turning them in at all. Similar things are happening this year. I’m really scared. When I think about the person not turning in assignments, it doesn’t feel like it’s me. I should be able to do them. Everyday I make a list of what I have to do and I just don’t complete any of it. I have nothing going on outside of school. Other people like to set mental deadlines or go to a quiet space but nothing works for me. I can’t focus or have the willpower to do them.

176,"I no longer have that feeling of safety I once had when I was a kid. I may not have been the happiest outgoing kid but I still felt grounded.

Now at almost 23 I constantly stress about so many things. Heres the top of the list:

1. I've realized that no one knows why we actually exist, how we got here, or where we are going. We just exist in this world where we can all imagine a better reality where people are not abused, mental illnesses are nonexistent, where people only know harmony and peace. But we are stuck here trying to be happy with what we have and I am consistently weighed down by the mystery of it all. At this point I can only hope theres a better place to go once I meet death.

2. Relationships. I myself am a sucker for intimacy. I crave genuine connection with a romantic partner to the point where I can be a bit codependent. I have been dating someone for a few months now and it has been great but I feel pressure to be successful, to make something of myself, to be desirable where I feel I am not yet. To become financially successful in the rat race with no college and a lot of depression that makes it feel impossible to take on more than I already have on my plate. I cant make $15 an hour in customer service the rest of my life even with the 401k and benefits.

3. Feeling like a kid. I've always been sensitive, I was the kid in kindergarten and first that cried every morning from anxietywanting to go back home where I was confortable. I've grown a lot but I still feel like I'm just fumbling around lacking the strength to get at life and conquer it. 

I just made an appointment with my old therapist, hopefully they will help but in the meantime does anyone have any advice?",07Oct2020,1
178,"This might be kind of long, so I will sum it up at the end for those not intending to read so much. I tried posting a more summed up version of this in another reddit, but didn't receive much advice. I'm hoping for more from here. 

My boyfriend and I met at our shared workplace in September of 2019. In the beginning of October, about a week or two later, he asked me out. I had no interest in him of that sort, and politely declined him. We stayed friends, talking almost everyday. About two months later, I started dating a guy I went to school with. I decided not to tell him at the time, since he had asked me out and I didn't want to hurt his feelings. At this point, our communication dropped until around March. 

When covid hit, I was let out of school, and me and my boyfriend at the time decided to end things. It was sort of mutual, we were both hurt but new things weren't working out. In the beginning of April, he (my current boyfriend) asked me out again. It was odd, seeing as we hadn't communicated frequently for so long, so I rejected him again. At the time, I had begun a FWB situation with another coworker. We kept it on the down low, seeing as my workplace is prone to gossip. Around the end of April, a month or so after we started things, my FWB guy and I ended things. He caught feelings and I didn't, and he was going to college across the country, so it wasn't going to work out, no hard feelings. 

That was when I gave my current boyfriend a chance. We started dating in the end of May, and for that month that we were talking, I was the happiest I had ever felt. I had wondered why I had never given him a chance. Things were great, until we made it official. 

That's when I saw a change in him. The communication and effort became one sided. I was constantly asking to hang out and being rejected, he never texted and never wanted to FaceTime, which he knew was important to me. He just kind of dropped out. After a month of unhappiness I broke up with him. That lasted for two days. We started things up again, had a much needed conversation, and I told him what I needed from this and he told me what he needed. 

Now we're here. Things have been great up until now. Our transition of me moving to college two hours away was great. We talked and FaceTimed almost everyday, which he had given me some pain about before I left but eventually realized it was what we were going to need if I was away. But I can't seem to make things work anymore. Yes, we still call, but he does his own thing. I often find myself watching him play video games, my conversation either not heard or getting short replies. He also will go places and the time frames won't match up. We have a smoke shop 15 minutes from our work, which he will get rides to since he doesn't have a car, but the trip will end up taking an hour or more. It's fishy. Today he went to his uncle's new house, and didn't reply to a single text of mine. He was gone for two hours, there was no way he could've been too busy. Now tonight we got on a call and played separate video games. I asked if he could hop onto my game and he said no, not even a reason just flat out no. I asked why and he said he didn't want to. Then I asked if we could play something else together or just talk, and he said no again. I played my own game for an hour or so and then he went to bed at 8. I asked if he could please play with me or talk to me, he said he was tired and still we're on the call, but I am typing this and he's sleeping. 

Another thing to mention is that whenever I want to talk about issues, he kind of goes off on me and tells me that he feels that he's always doing something wrong. I told him that it may feel like that because I bring up issues and he doesn't, so that's why he may feel this way. He proceeded to shut down and answer my questions shortly.

179,"So I’ve [25F] been hanging out with a guy [25M] for a couple of months (hang out like once a week). Only started hanging out recently, but we’ve known each other for several years. We usually just watch a movie, grab some pizza, talk about life and then go on evening drives. Completely platonic. Thought we were becoming buddies at this point.
He usually goes to meet his other bros (a couple of guys I’m acquainted with) after we hang out. They call him quite frequently when we’re hanging out (can recognise their voices over the calls too), and when they ask him what he’s doing, he always says something like “I’m cooking”, “I’m out on a walk” or some bs that we’re clearly not doing. I never said anything, because it’s none of my business. We’re just friends who like hanging out sometimes.
But I find it super odd that he’s lying about something this trivial. I find it hard to believe that he is worried about his friends assuming he’s hooking up with me, because he usually tells them when he does hook up with someone.
Why do guys lie about this?

I’d say I’m a pretty normal person. Had great grades, great career, zero drama, pretty boring life. So it’s unlikely he’s ashamed of chilling with me. I have a pretty good rep in general, so this is throwing me off.

TikTok is filled with a lot of dumb, crazy shit, but there’s always been one I respected the most. Long story short, her fans found her old account when she was younger and I DMed as a joke since it was already known information. After I forgot about it, I got a message back from that account. The account seemed inactive but I gave it a shot. I was being careful since she was hacked really bad a few months ago, with her Snapchat, last name, her two current Instagram accounts being publicly hacked, she never got her secondary account back. 

I talked like I normally would, I’m not one of those crazy ass horny dudes, I’m just trying to start a friendship or something since I have the chance. I texted and immediately thought something seemed a little off. She would type “:)” after every message. I’ve never seen her type it that often, and even then, she’d type shit on her account a little differently, but I just let that slide. Lemme shorten this story up rq, I kept talking and yeah... this ain’t her, this is most likely that hacker.

I’ve talked to two of her friends before, one doesn’t text strangers anymore, one’s just hella busy with her art business she’s starting.

184," Idk if this is the right forum to ask about this but I was hoping to get some advice regarding finding the right therapist? Idk what resources to use or anything.

I have some issues but I am too scared to admit them out loud to a stranger through phone so they can match me with someone. Its hard for me to open up and I'm scared I might cry or lie. 

When I look for therapists online, they say they specialize in one issue that I have but not the others. I was wondering if there is a way I can talk to a psychologist or a professional that could recommend me to someone that can help me with all my issues?

189,"Hi! Sorry this got kinda long. So, I'm a 23yo professional student living with my family. I lived alone or with a partner for 4 years during undergrad and I loved the independence, but I had the chance to save some money by living rent free when my family moved close to my school. I've been living here for 1.5 years and it definitely has benefits (don't pay for groceries, rent, utilities), but I am severely missing my independence. 

My family isn't horribly annoying, but they are borderline hoarders and the house is always cluttered and messy. They get fast food pretty much every day, even after an obesity-related health scare, because the kitchen is too cluttered to cook in or all the dishes are dirty. My siblings have mental illnesses and it is frustrating to watch their self-destructive behavior all of the time. They are awake at night instead of the day, which I try to deal with using white noise and music, but they like to have lights on and make a lot of noise. I am always trying to help them and encourage them to go to the doctor but it never makes an impact, and they don't listen to anything I say anyway. For example, I told my sibling to please hold off vacuuming for a few hours while I studied since he had been doing it for over 5 hours at that point, and he couldn't even stop for a few hours. I feel like their depression ""rubs off"" on me because nothing I do can help them and I hate seeing my loved ones like this. 

Nothing really changed since I last lived with them in high school, but somehow it is worse to be back in the household after being independent for so long. It's also hard to bring my long distance boyfriend over because like I mentioned, they are awake all night and it's a turnoff to hear them chatting one room over (that's also a problem when using my toys). Obviously it seems like moving out is the solution, but I expect to be $155k in debt by the time my education is done (even with working 2 jobs and getting several scholarships!!) with a starting salary of \~100k. If I live on my own, I can expect that debt to go up to $175-180k... which is a lot. But at the same time, I have worked really hard to keep my debt low (my field has a serious problem with student debt) and I have plans to live rent/utility/insurance-free in my partner's city after graduation so I can attack that debt over 4-5 years. 

I guess it's hard to determine if it's worth $20k+ to live on my own for a few years, so I wanted some opinions. In the long run it would not add much time to paying off my student debt, but it's not an insignificant amount of money for what is essentially my mental health and comfort.",07Oct2020,1

Some context. My wife has General/Panic Anxiety Disorder. I have a history of asthma. Two years ago I landed my dream job. This year, due to COVID-19 and the nature of my job (interacting with larger groups of people at once), my wife has encouraged me to take FMLA and not return to work until either a remote setting is offered or there is an effective treatment/vaccine. I’m about halfway through the leave and no longer receiving income. We have a decent safety net in savings but will likely be running short when my FMLA ends. I feel super confident that my place of work is taking all the proper precautions to keep me safe (they’ve invested millions in reopening protocols), but she is terrified something will happen to me if I go back.

196,"I don't know if my mom is abusive or if I'm overreacting. Please help.

I'm 19m, sophomore in college, currently at home due to coronavirus. My mom is a great person. As a single mom, she worked her ass off to give me a top tier education. She doesn't have much money and yet she buys me everything I need and much much more . She cooks for me almost every night. She supports me in every way a son could ask for, financially, emotionally, etc.

But she can suddenly be quite  violent, usually verbally/emotionally, sometimes physically.  Examples since March when I came back home:

1) Mom told me to be ready in 5 minutes to leave the house. I wasn't ready by end of 5 minutes. So she threw a waterbottle full force at my face. It landed on the floor. She made me pick it up, give it to her, and threw it at my face again, four more times.

2) Mom made me stand still against a wall for 5 minutes when I had a disrespectful tone towards her (I genuinely was not trying to be disrespectful in any way)

3) I opened fridge, then a glass container that my younger brother had misplaced, fell out and broke on floor. Mom said I should pay for it, to which I said, ""Mom, why should I pay for it? It was \[younger brother\] who misplaced it, causing it to fall when I opened."" She then said, ""If you ever talk like that to me again, I'll shove my fist down your throat"". On God, I said it very respectfully, without any attitude or anything like that.

4) Mom asked me to find location of a store we didn't remember name of, but knew general location of. After looking on google maps for some time, I was unable to find it. When I told her I couldn't find the location, she yelled at me a ""jerk for not trying hard enough to find it"" and the ""biggest idiot ever"" to my confusion. As she was yelling at me, she thought she heard me chuckle. She then said, ""You'll wish you were never born if you disrespect me like that. I'm ordering you to put down that glass of water and get the fuck out of my kitchen""

the list goes on 

Now here's the most important part of my question:

My college is currently only letting people back with ""special needs"" for housing. I could request under the reason of ""emotional abuse"", but this might be too extreme. It would also significantly fracture my relationship with her, which would suck for personal reasons, and for the fact that I am not yet financially independent, I have only &lt;$1000 (I'm working part-time but I'm a full time student). Should I request for special needs housing? Or am I overreacting and my mom is simply being mean occasionally, and I should tough it up until I can go back to college?

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, let me preface this with the fact that I respect everyone no matter what their sexual orientation, gender identity or whomever else you choose to be as long as you aren't hurting anyone. The events that happen in my story are unfortunate to say the least, but I want you all to know by no means am I trying to make any group of people look bad, this was one person and their actions and do not reflect the group as a whole. Anyways onto the story...

&amp;#x200B;

So this happened about 3.5 months ago, I live in a medium sized city in The Great White North. I have dreams of being a musician and a model so I had been doing socially distanced networking middle of this summer. I have been told I am fairly attractive (compared to a young Elvis) and so when I met an agent at a fellow musician and friend's birthday dinner. This agent immediately was making his moves to get my attention. We ended up becoming friends and he gave me a job and also helped me with my music and modelling and gained me a decent bit of following from his help. This is where things go wrong. I was at a small party one night with the agent, two of my friend, and three of the agents friends. They were giving out shots (I had a problem with alcohol straight out of high school which I got past and now rarely ever drink) and told me it was a tradition of theirs to take shots in a round. I agreed, however as the night went one two shots turned into four and then into eight and before I knew it I saw so drunk I couldn't even think straight. At this party one of the friends of the agent was a transwomen, who had not had the surgery done. She seemed super nice at first and I'm a generally polite and too nice for my own good kind of person, but I treated her with respect like everyone else and we had some interesting conversations throughout the night. Not once did I try to hit on her or anything of the likes. I think it was around 11pm when the agent and my friends were going to go and by this point I was extremely drunk and somewhat incoherent and didn't follow behind them. She yelled down to them that I was puking and she'd drive me home right after them, so they left. Right before they left my other friend L had called asking if he could come and I said yeah. After they left they all said we should have one more drink then go, so we did. (At this point I was so out of it I had smoked a J and had idek how many shots and then later found out that she had slipped some molly in my last drink) She ended up driving me to her house and took me to her room and had her way for about 5 minutes. Luckily my friend who had showed to the other house to find no one had followed my snapmaps to her house. He is the type of person who never learned any manners and just lets himself in if his friend is in the house, and thank god for this because he walked in to see what was going on and got me out of there. I don't really remember much of the event because I was one three different drugs and absolutely not in the condition to do anything other than sleep. He drove me home and took me to my apartment and stayed the night to make sure I wouldn't die in my sleep etc. The next morning he filled me in on what he knew but wouldn't go into explicit detail in his words ""to protect me"". I asked him to tell no one about it ever and he said he'd take it to the grave. That day the agent comes and picks me up and is frantic. He asked if I had slept with her and I was so fuzzy still but explained that I didn't really have much say in the matter. He scared me by saying that this had happened before and the guy pressed charges and she went and blasted him all over social media and the kid killed himself. It was then that he told me that she told him she slipped molly in my drink. He was mad at himself for leaving me but didn't want me to go to the cops in fear of hurting my blossoming career. (I think its gross that having relations with a transgender women can ruin a career but society sucks ig). So I never ended up doing anything or telling anyone, and its been eating away at me, in the end it also ruined the relationship between the agent and I and he revealed he was gay and started hitting on me and told me it was unfair that she could do it and he couldn't when he had helped me with all of this stuff. I just feel like the colour in life is gone and like nothing I do or say can change things. I wouldn't have done what I did sober and because of it I feel like all my inspiration to do the things I loved are gone as well. i feel like the agent used me and all the things he told me about talent and potential were just to get me to sleep with him aswell. Its just send me into another bout of addiction, I smoke so much weed because it's the only time I can get the few flashes in my head to go away. I just feel drained. I don't want to tell anyone out of fear of judgement (the area I live in is somewhat conservative) but at this point idk what to do. I tell my mom a lot and I love her but hearing that I was (idk can if I can call this rape but whatever the fuck happened to me) would break her heart and I can't do that to her. I just hate it. I am stuck between wanting to die but also knowing that doing so would hurt so many people and that's selfish of me. What do I do? If anyone with similar experiences have advice on what I should do or who to talk to would be nice.

199,"The friend (let’s call him K) had been friends with me for around 2-3 years, in which the first year we became friends we were pretty close. We’d hang out a lot and trusted each other. However, K always struggled to open up to me about his life, emotions, etc. 
When a third person entered our circle as close friends, lets name them L, K became extremely close to them. I thought at first it was because they were both male it would be easier for K to open up to L, and form a brotherly bond. I expressed that I felt that I was being pushed out of the picture but K always shut my feelings down when I brought them up. K fell out with L and repeated the same scenario of bringing a third group in, being a male, and forming a very close bond with them, pushing me out, etc. and then it ending badly. 
After the second person fell out with K, I grew distant from him but always kept in touch with him rarely messaging me unless he needed help. Eventually a big project that K wanted to work on came up and he invited me to help him work on it (think video games / web design). I was happy to be included but still felt that K was keeping his distance from me. At this time he also had a male best friend who he hung out with a lot. After an argument during the project about my involvement not being appreciated, along with my feelings of frustration and sadness that I felt like a “secondary” friend thar K could go to only when things were bad, I removed K from my life and went a year without speaking to him. A mutual friend brought us in contact again and he was quiet at first, but kept reminiscing about the past and making jokes like when we first became friends. 
I added him and tried bringing up what had happened but he brushed it off. I removed him again out of frustration and humiliation since I had opened up to him - a simple “dont worry about it” made me feel as if I cared too much and eventually ended up in the same group as him again through mutual friends. He spoke to me very frankly in the group chat and started to act friendly again, with jokes here and there. Surprisingly, he seemed to open up more than he has ever had in a private conversation between us. 

I really miss having K as a friend but I do not want to keep guessing how he is feeling and to be locked out of his life, especially since he opens up to mutual friends but not me. I never thought he liked me in any way, but a friend brought up that he mentioned having feelings for a close friend but having to block them off a few years back. I don’t want to push a relationship that won’t happen and make K uncomfortable since I want to respect his wishes, but I also do not want to emotionally exhaust myself since I feel that I care more about him than he does for me. 

How should I approach this? Do I really need the “closure”? Should I try reforming a friendship knowing that it will probably never develop into a deeper bond? Sorry for the long post and thank you! :/",07Oct2020,1

203,"Heya! I’m F15 if that helps anything.

I have a friend, (M15 Who we’ll call Jay) We’ve been close friends for a little over a year now and see each other somewhat regularly. Over the summer we started talking more and Jay really opened up to me emotionally. I also have depression and had spent the last few months working on making things better for myself so we shared our experiences and gave each other advice.

Jay is a little relationship happy though. Since we first met he’s had crushes on so many girls and dated around 6 or 7 of them. All the relationships lasted less than a month and he never seemed to care that much as long as he had someone to talk to.

Problem is, I became the someone to talk to. We talked every day, called each other, we were always in touch 24/7. If I looked at my phone, boom, another text. I was fine with this for the most part though because I don’t have many friends to talk to.

A few days ago though he said he really liked me. He asked me to go out with him and was really sweet about it. We were up late on the phone and at the time I basically just said “yeah, sure. Why not?” I woke up the next morning and everything finally settled in my mind and I almost puked. I’ve never been in a relationship before and that was wayyyy too fast for my liking.

That day I ran through everything in my head and basically realized I didn’t like him in a romantic sense, and needed to tell him that, the sooner the better. I called him that night and straightened everything out. Telling him I wasn't ready for a relationship with anyone at the moment and just wanted to be friends.

He was again, very understanding and said that what mattered to him was that I was happy and he didn’t want to make me uncomfortable.

We were talking again today, and he just wasn’t in the right place mentally. I asked him to truthfully tell me what was going on, and he said he was upset that I don’t like him like that. I told him that I would give him space if he needed it, but he said he preferred having me around. I asked if there was anything I could do to help, he said no.

I don’t like seeing him upset and I know he’s hurting but I don’t know how to help. Advice?",07Oct2020,1

205,"For context, I live with my grandparents in a sparsely populated area in Texas, my cousin who I will refer to as “A” has recently moved into an abandoned trailer near our home that is in total disrepair. He’s been there for around 4-6 weeks and isn’t doing well. A is a long time junkie with little to no assets such as clothes, transportation, appliances for food storage, my grandparents and I feel for him but do not have the means to help his situation and the limit of our interaction is occasional conversation and paying him for odd jobs when we can. He hasn’t shown signs of drug use recently but it’s not out of the question, I didn’t make to many assumptions about him because he’s family and very polite and respectful. 
Today a very disturbing event took place that has me fearing for the safety of my grandparents and our property.
He came to me and seemed lucid but the subject matter of what he had to tell me was incredibly worrying. I took a video of our 20 min conversation. He went on an unhinged rambling about “I have autism and it is a superpower” “I have traveled though dimensions” “time travel is deja vu” “I am having conversations will bill gates in the other dimensions” “I don’t have thoughts just conversations with voices in my head” “I tried to kill my self, I died, but I saved my self with schizophrenia and autism”
He came back multiple times over hours to further explain his theory and I told him not to come back until the morning because it’s late.

206,"Im 22 and living with my partner while I attend college a few hours away from my home town. For background, my mother has diagnosed bipolar disorder as well as possible psychosis (she becomes violent and aggressive at random intervals and also is convinced a famous rock star and his family are stalking her and purposefully sabotaging her life). My dad ditched when I was younger and didn't really adhere to the shared custody schedule so I rarely saw him, and my mom was my main provider and parent. Dont get me wrong, she's a wonderful mother when she's in the right head space and I love her very much. Considering her mental health and other circumstances, I think she did a really good job raising my brother and I. But of course having burned most of her bridges, her children and her cats are basically all she has left.

There was emotional abuse and rare physical abuse when she would have an episode. She is also very codependent and sensitive so any time we would reject her she would insult us to hell and then gaslight us about it later. I began having symptoms of severe anxiety and depression in middle school and the environment did not help. It was even worse in high school, partly due to the increased school workload. I moved out to go to college as soon as I graduated and have basically stayed gone, though I am close enough to visit and I can handle her company for a day or so at a time. My mental health has drastically improved since I moved out. 

Basically, the situation is she has been living with her parents for the past several years to try and ""save money"" to get her own place. She hasn't saved much of anything and constantly fights with my grandparents and my brother (18, also lives there). Recently she had a freak out and cursed my grandmother to the point that my grandparents wrote and signed an official eviction notice. It gives har and my brother until the end of October to move out or they'll call the police to have them removed. So she called and asked me if she could stay ""for a few weeks"" and save money to move to Denver. She claims she will pay our rent in return but how can she do that AND pay our rent AND be gone in a mere couple of weeks? My fear is it will turn in to the same situation as with my grandparents and she will basically move in with my partner and I indefinitely. 

I CAN NOT HANDLE THAT! My academic success and improved mental health are a definite result of me not living with her, and I know if she moves in I will experience nothing but stress and anxiety and depression and it will be high school all over again. But I also know that if I do tell her no not only will she proceed to verbally assault me and threaten me, but she'll be basically homeless. I dont want to be the reason the person who raised me the best she could becomes homeless....

Does anyone have any advice for how I can peacefully approach this? Or have you experienced anything similar? I am very stressed out at the moment...",07Oct2020,1

The problem is, is that there is NO WORK in the middle of no where. So I would have to scrape by selling things online I guess to pay for food etc? I would focus on growing vegetables, raising a family, and just enjoy being free really...

211,"14 f  a year ago i was very very sad. Overwhelmingly sad, and i felt guilty and wrong and just an outburst of emotions. Over many things but one large reason was my dad dying, he died  7 years ago but it felt like it hit me then. I felt wronged and like i did wrong, the saddest i ever been. Very depressed, i would barley ever get out of bed, just cry and watch movies. 

but for the past 3 months i’ve felt nothing not at all. No sadness, or  happiness. Completely emotionless. I started to not feel real,i feel like nothing is real. None of the people in my life are real even my closest family. I use to be have lots of empathy for others and now i have none. I never feel bad for anything which is so different for me, no remorse.  When i think about my dad and don’t cry like i use too. i just feel numb, all the things that happened that mad me feel bad just make me feel nothing. honestly i think it’s worse than feeling.

At points i feel so unreal i have the undying urge to do something very dangerous, something quick and impulsive. like jumping out of a movie car,
jump in front of  moving cars jump of of balconies. Large urges that i don’t actually want to do but it’s obsessive.

Hello, 
         I’[M] a 22 year old living between two large corn fields in small town Missouri. I’m fairly new to dating, three months in two weeks, so I don’t really know if this is a normal thing or not. Expecting that it isn’t (normal), I really do sincerely hope I can get some endearing advice without too much judgment. 
         Before getting into the “main theme” of this post I would like to give some background information about myself to ensure you have a well understanding of my situation. Growing up I was raised in an Amish community. To be entirely more thorough, my mother and father were notoriously known for being the town’s alcoholics. My grandmother stepped in and began raising me on her own when I was 6 years of age. While being my guardian we became friends with a young man, 16y/o Joseph, who had just left his Amish community to take part in Rumspringa. In short, my grandmother died when I was 7years and 10 months old. Without having fit parents (or really even knowing them), Joseph asked me to join him in his Amish community. This is where I would stay until my 16th birthday. I decided not to return to Joseph, in lieu I began working in coal mines after being offered the job by a man who, quite ironically, went by the name Tiny. I kept to myself and worked in the coal mines, sleeping in Tiny’s pool house until I turned 20. Tiny helped me adjust to the world that I know now as well as how to finance. With his help I had saved enough money to buy a house of my own and quit my job as a coal miner. Fast forward to June of this year, I had been working as a Brickmason when I was introduced to the most beautiful woman I had ever met, 26y/o Susan. To my surprise, she took interest in me the same way I did in her. Fast forward again to the 15th of September, I asked Susan to move in with me. We’ve been living together since. 
Now for the request for advice (optionally too much information)
              Ever since Susan and I have started living together I’ve been struggling with my aim whilst using the commode. I’ve never had a problem with this before, but Susan says she steps in urine every time she has to use the facilities. Could I just be nervous that I am now accompanied by such a flawless woman? Susan teases me about this, asking if I turn the lights off and shut my eyes when urinating, but I assure her that isn’t the case...
Please help me, I’ve never felt so ashamed for something. I’m afraid if I can’t fix this issue she will grow repulsed by me and we may never have children. 
Thank you in advance.",07Oct2020,1

He has said he would be open to more children if I wanted to though. I think this is far too complicated to even consider, and am unsure on how to proceed. It’s more complicated than just dating someone you’re attracted to and want to be with that was my own age. My own dad married someone 22 years younger than himself and that was strange for me, so I’m having a hard time swallowing this. I’ve interacted with his kids a few times which was fine but I know I would be more of a sister than a mom, which is how I’d prefer it and would never expect to be more than that, but I don’t know how much he’d really like that in the end.

228," I’ll likely not receive much response, and that’s okay. I’m just desperate and wish to try here in the hopes that someone with sound advice sees this. I had an issue with a dental business scamming me that I’ve asked about in various places, but have not received answers on. It involved debt from a loan that they pressured me into. A partner insisted. Long story short, finally got sick of paying for work that was not actually finished and stopped paying the remaining $1k of the nearly $7k loan after interest ballooned it back up to nearly $5k. Decided to look for help instead but I am such a failure that I could not find any advice on what to do, but also could not afford the exploitive debt. 

 That debt was sold. Absolutely could not afford $360 a month. Now, have received a threatening letter from an attorney. Looking them up, their reviews are covered with tales from people made homeless by them, abusing their power. I can’t afford a garnishment. I’ll lose everything I’ve spent over two years rebuilding. I don’t know where to turn. Legal advice subreddit lead to no response, I have nowhere to turn, I feel as if everything is falling apart. 

 I just am begging for some form of advice to direct me. It took two years to find an apartment I could afford, it’s still being built, yet I’m already at risk of losing it. I worked so many hours just to save the funds for it, for the furniture for it—finally achieving something of value with my pathetic life. I managed to do something, yet it’s all at risk. What can I do? Can I ever do anything? I feel preyed upon, yet maybe I wasn’t. Maybe I am just a failure. I don’t know anymore.

She was someone who I could always talk to about any matter and kept me grounded. I feel like I have no direction and others around me will pass me by and go on with their lives while I will be stuck wondering what to do. Are these feelings normal?",07Oct2020,1
230,"So let’s start from the beginning. My boyfriend (22m) and I (23f) have been dating for roughly 7 months. He is a wonderful man, and we’re talking about getting engaged sometime after our anniversary next year and having a wedding in 2022. He comes from a very messed up home life. His mother has been absent most of his life (drug abuse) and his father is severely emotionally and financially abusive. 

When we started getting serious, I asked my boyfriend if he was looking into getting a full time job, as he was working part time at the time. I didn’t pressure him, but simply asked the question. He said that he hadn’t thought about it, and that he was planning on going to fire academy post-COVID when they reopen. A few weeks later, he told me that he was looking for a full time job with benefits, and was actively studying for the fire academy entrance exam. He stated that he wanted to “man up” and that it was time to become independent. 

He has been living with his father, who has a back injury that rendered him “disabled”. I say “disabled” because his level of disability changes according to his desire to do something. If he needs to go to the store, he sends my boyfriend because he’s in too much pain. If he wants to go on a weekend bender getting drunk, he practically dances out the door. My boyfriend pays for his half of all expenses while living there, plus more since he makes the most money. 

This is where it gets ugly. He and his father share a bank account. My boyfriend created his own bank account, got a new full time job, and enrolled in healthcare benefits. I work for a bank, so I obviously helped him choose the appropriate health insurance plan and bank account options. Everything was his decision, and I just laid out his options and gave him my professional opinion as a bank employee. His dad flipped his lid saying how I was “controlling his life” and that I need to stop meddling in their personal/financial lives. My boyfriend’s car is in his father’s name, so it has been confiscated except to allow my bf to go to work and to run errands. His father is threatening to get rid of their dog purely out of spite, and he’s telling my boyfriend that after he moves out that any chance of a relationship with him will be gone. Every time my boyfriend and I make plans, his dad texts or calls him saying that he’s depressed and going to get drunk because nobody cares about him anymore. 

I’ve been so worried about his situation that I have barely slept in weeks. I love my boyfriend endlessly, and I’d do anything for him. I’ve tried to build a relationship with his father, but all I am ever met with is coldness. I’m honestly not trying to meddle. I’m just trying to encourage my boyfriend to achieve whatever goals he sets for himself. Any advice on how to navigate this situation, improve the relationship with his father, or anything would be helpful. I’m at my wits end and I’m willing to fight for this relationship, but my own mental health is suffering. TIA",07Oct2020,1

233,"Long story short: My best friend sent me a message from her ex’s Facebook account trying to trick me, he had proof it wasn’t him, and she still denied it. Should I forgive her?

My best friend is going through a messy breakup, and things got really bad. They both did shitty thing to each other, however, I won’t go into details because they don’t matter, but what does matter is that she sent me messages from her ex’s Facebook. She has a history of white lies, and her ex has never lied to my boyfriend or myself. 

She specifically told me to not tell him how she was doing, and I honoured that. My boyfriend and her ex have remained friends, and still hangout. I often go elsewhere, but do sometimes hangout with them as I am friends with him as well. I was honest from the beginning and told her my boyfriend said he would remain friends with him, and she appeared to be okay with it, but I could tell she really wasn’t. I would distance myself, but I’m not going to be rude to him, it just isn’t in my nature. She’d ask me 100 questions about what he said anytime he visited us, and I wouldn’t make a point of telling her he visited unless she asked - I would never lie to her. My theory being it doesn’t matter, they are broken up and if anything it’s going to upset her. He would ask about her, and I would tell her, but I’d always tell him I don’t think it’s fair for me to be a double agent. 

One day I get a weird message from him, very unlike anything he had ever sent before. He said “How is my ex girlfriend, do you think she has a new boyfriend??” We don’t talk often, and if we did it was about what my boyfriends plans are or our pets, and if he did ask about it it would be more like “Hey, how is she.” 

Anyway, I didn’t respond to the message, and he sent another message immediately after asking the same thing, which I left unread. I felt guilty so I decided to respond and when I did respond I noticed the messages were gone! I decided to call him out about the deleted messages and say look buddy I know you miss her but I can’t be the middle man. He had no idea what I was talking about, and then sent me a screenshot of her phone (they have different brands) logged into his account at the time those messages were sent. 

I went a few weeks without confronting her because I knew she wouldn’t admit to it even though I have solid proof, and when I did confront her she told me I was a bad friend, that I was never there for her, and to go be best friends with him since I always take his side. 

I know she is struggling, but I’m not sure I can forgive this. Any advice helps.",07Oct2020,1
234,"I had a mom who essentially ruined my life. Up until I was like 10/11 she'd wipe my butt after I shit. She'd choose what clothes I wore and she'd by the clothes I wore. She'd get my hair straightened to look more ""asian"" (mines is really curly because I'm still half black). She'd never let me speak for myself.   


And these thoughts are probably the things I'm most senesitive about because it really does seep its way into every asset of my life. I barely have friends and can barely talk in general, I dip in and out of completely hating myself or thinking other hate me.

235,"My friend and I have known each other since elementary school. We are now in college. She’s struggled with an eating disorder since middle school and recently I believe she has relapsed. I know this because 1. She has lost an unhealthy amount of weight, and 2. Doesn’t eat around me or other people and makes excuses for why she isn’t eating. 

I know this is an incredible touchy and sensitive topic. Especially since I was the friend who had to go to her parents back in middle school. They had to place her into an inpatient-hospital because of how unhealthy and weak she was. She was near death at that point because of low nutrients. 

I am fearful for her health once again, but since we are both adults, nobody can force her to get the help she needs. I am fearful of approaching her and being perceived in the wrong way. 

What is the best way to go about this without pushing her further away into isolation.",07Oct2020,1
236,"*I need to preface with I have severe misophonia. To the point where 22yr old me hasn't been able to get through a meal with someone since the 9th grade. For this reason I've written off any sort of chance at a relationship due to me feeling like they'd end up settling for me and regretting it later down the road.*

My best friend, R, and I are really close. I've helped them through some really dark times, they've helped me with mine. We just click really well, I've never meshed well with anyone like that before, and for that reason I was convinced I should leave my anti-dating bubble and give it a shot. Needless to say I learned in a 2 week span that my mental issue doesn't care about my feelings towards someone. So we had a mutual breakup.

Overtime mine and R's friend groups merged with each other since everyone got a long relatively well. About another 2 weeks after our breakup R is getting flirty with one of my other good friends (an old crush), N, but I was happy for them, they knew I wasn't planning on dating any time soon and they wanted to pursue them. I helped them get together, I couldn't be happier for them.

Over this past week and a half it's hitting me that the happiness I'm seeing R and N experience is something I'm robbing myself of by saying I can't date anyone. Anytime I'm talking to one of them they just become ecstatic and say how happy they are to be together. After a long talk with R, reassuring them that I harbor no ill feeling towards her or N, but I just can't be around the group until I sort myself out.

I just don't see how to get out of this rut. I want to be back with the group, I want to be happy for them. But as soon as I'm with them I just shutdown emotionally and can't really even do anything. I'm just generally happier and my mental health is in a much better place when I'm away from the group as of right now and I hate that.

237,"I've been overweight for pretty much all of my life. Only recently did I finally decide that I wanted to get in better shape. Everyone in my household is overweight, but I'm the lightest, and the most active of everyone. My parents are very overweight and they always tell me they don't want me to be overweight or ""end up like them for the rest of my life."" I decided I wanted to lose weight due to the fact that I play in drumline, and have to have 35 pounds worth of drums strapped to my waist. It's incredibly heavy and I finally said that this is where I turn my life around. 

I started losing weight around the beginning of June. As of right now, I've lost 45 pounds and I'm very proud of myself! I'm still overweight so I'm continuing on my path to lose weight but it's become more difficult.

I suffer from ADHD and I've been prescribed Adderall in order to help with it. For those of you who don't know, one of the side effects of  Adderall is that it pretty much completely removes my appetite. After doing some research I found out that Adderall is unintentionally good for weight loss! Now you would think that's good for me, however it's not. While yes, I'm losing weight, my parents are always trying to get me to eat food. They know I'm not hungry and yet the try to force me to eat. The medication pretty much completely removes my appetite for the entire day, but usually wears off at around 6-7 P.M. I don't eat in the middle of the night, but I might get up just to have a quick drink of water or milk because I'm thirsty.

They always say things like ""Your going to end up starving yourself to death,"" when that is so far from the truth it makes me laugh. After doing some research, the body has ways of telling you that you're hungry which involve your stomach grumbling or your stomach aching. When my medication wears off, none of those symptoms are present. Yes, I'll be a little hungry, but it's never like ""HOLY SHIT GIVE ME FOOD I'M ABOUT TO DIE"" levels of hungry. It's more of ""Yeah I guess I'm a little hungry."" 

Also, they try to get me to eat sugary foods and desserts even though they know I'm trying to lose weight. They always say ""It's okay to have something once in a while,"" but I'm sick and tired of hearing it. If I eat it, I'm immediately going to want more, and more, until I've gained all my weight back. It's happened with my parents when they've tried to lose weight in the past, and it's not going to happen to me!

Last bit of information I should give is that my mom is not the main problem here. My mom is pretty nice and cares for me. My dad on the other hand is a complete asshole. He says he cares about me, and yet he once abused me and he's never afraid to talk about the possibility of me dying from starvation. I fucking hate him and I can't wait until I never have to see him again. 

Does anyone have any advice for me in order to get my parents to stop caring about what I eat, when I eat, or how much I eat?",07Oct2020,1
238,"i’m an 18 year old female from the UK. recently i became sick with a cold and i haven’t been up to much apart from sleeping and playing games. over the past few weeks i’ve realised that i keep imagining things. things such as people, i can hear things being said to me despite the room being empty and sometimes i see blocks of very vivid colours in the corner of my eyes, just to see that they are gone when i look at them.

my sleeping pattern is more than fine and i am not on any medication currently. although i realised that my emotional state has been everywhere. i’m happy then suddenly i’m upset, or i get angry. i am very irritable for no reason. i get set off over nothing and it changes dramatically- very quickly. 

i genuinely have no idea what is going on. i feel like i am going completely crazy. it’s driving me nuts. i haven’t changed my sleep schedule, i haven’t changed my diet.. nothing has changed dramatically recently. the only thing that i’ve been dealing with is a cold but it’s completely unrelated to whatever i’m feeling/seeing all the time. i don’t even feel like i’m living anymore. i feel like i’m just imagining everything. i haven’t had any injuries either- something i ruled out the moment i realised it was happening.

my memory has been really bad too. i can’t remember things even if i’ve just thought of it ie. i can’t remember my phone number so i went to check for it on my settings and repeated the 3 numbers that i forgot to myself and within 5 seconds i had forgotten already. i can’t even remember what i ate for dinner most days.

i have no idea what is happening and i genuinely need someone to give me advice. anything please. i feel very trapped in my own body and need the best solution i can get.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate seeing couples in public, or even in movies. It just feels like a constant reminder of something I may never experience. Tbh, all of my dating experiences have been through tinder, because I am so shy and socially anxious in real life. Now, the tinder dating experiences have definitely helped me with this. I am much more confident and less anxious. However, I also go to STEM school where my classes are like 85% male so that isn't exactly helping either. 

&amp;#x200B;

What gets me the most is just when I see how the rejections have stacked up. Each individual rejection doesn't particularly bother me so much anymore, its rather when I look at it holistically and realize that I'm the common denominator, whether its something I am doing wrong or not.

She’s in her 60s and I watched her mock a younger colleague today when she made a dumb rule at my branch for some people she has nothing to do with. A rule about throwing away paper at the printer if unclaimed after a certain time. Just some dumb rule that shouldn’t be a concern in the first place. She likes to flex and be right all the time. Tells people she wants feedback, then argues and interrupts when given feedback. 

Someone dared to give feedback and she started mocking them like what a little kid would do, twice.  It was fucking weird. The saddest part is that I know absolutely no one will say anything or turn her in. So it’ll probably keep happening. 

She hasn’t mocked me yet, but when me or anyone on my team tried to give feed back or tried to tell her how something is, she interrupts and gets combative.

I’m not comfortable sharing the exact amount I have, so let’s say I have 15,000 saved up. I could either purchase the car, live in it for awhile and then get an apartment later  with a new job bc of the car OR I could rent the apartment and use a bike and save up for a car later, but it would still be a long process since my walking distance jobs pay like $350 biweekly at most.

246,"The header pretty much says it all, but I’ll give a little more context to show what type of a person he is.

Roughly a year ago one of my close friend’s father died unexpectedly of a heart attack (early 50s). This friend was obviously beyond sad, but he admittedly does not really show his emotions all that much. I sensed that all he wanted from me was to just be a friend as usual to give his life some normalcy until he came to terms with it.

This weekend his mother (also early 50s)also died completely unexpectedly (no known underlying illness nor covid). He’s visibly more distraught than he was than when it was just his father due to a) being parentless and b) the legal and financial responsibilities he’s now burdened with (luckily he is well off, so financial security isn’t all that much of an issue - more just having to deal with bills, taxes, mortgages, etc. while in school). 

He’s conducting himself in a similar way to when his father died and seems to be asking the same of me as he did a year ago. But this situation is just so much more unique and heartbreaking than one parent dying so early in his life and so unexpectedly. I feel as though I should be doing more and I really want to as well, but I’m not sure how/if it would overwhelm him to do so. Any tips or similar experiences?",07Oct2020,1

Afterwards I made up all other work and did work ahead of the time! By the time I was done, it was only 8, so I went downstairs to eat dinner with my parents, I was surprisingly attentive during conversation, funny even. Afterwards, I went to my room worked on some music sideproject stuff I haven't worked in a while, and actually made progress.

When I boiled down my day, I thought, ""wow, I was really happy today"" and then went to bed and woke up the next day and did basically the same thing but without the, I dunno, joy?

For as long as I could remember, I have been afraid to use public bathrooms alone, no matter how big or how small. I tried to go in bathrooms alone for a long period of time, but I still got the same feeling that something bad was going to happen and the moment that I skipped a day, I was back where I started. I’ve given up at this point.

I’m also afraid of caution signs, signals, warning signs, or anything of that nature. I don’t even have an explanation for this one, honestly.

On top of that, I still can’t go to sleep alone. I HAVE to have something playing in the background that involves a human talking. It can’t be music, and I have to see the person moving for me to be able to go to sleep. It wasn’t always this bad, but after having sleep paralysis back to back during a certain period in my life, I can’t go to sleep in the dark, but having bright lights in my face all night obviously messes with my sleep schedule.

My boyfriend and I want to get married as soon as possible because we want to finally be together, move in together, and build our own family. I have very Christian/ Conservative parents who restrict everything I do thus restricting our relationship. It is exhausting to constantly be limited by my parents. We make the best of the freedom I have, but it gets exhausting to always have to be worried about curfew, our location and not doing anything to disrespect my parents. My boyfriend and I can’t wait to finally be able to be free from my parents constant restrictions and be happy together. The only way for us to get married is for him to start making more money and get his life together. And get a car and be financially stable enough to buy a ring and afford a wedding. 

My boyfriend applied for a great job out of state and everything seemed to be going well. The interview went great. They followed up with him stating everything seemed to be good on his resume and that he pretty much was going to get the job all he had to do was get tested (for drugs) and finish his background check. We were worried because he is an avid user of cannabis and he had a suspended license for driving without insurance then getting caught driving with a suspended license. We pay all the tickets and get his license back. Then he gets tested and we wait two weeks. They call him today and tell him he didn’t get the job. 

Upon hearing these news my boyfriend was heartbroken and me too. With the money and advantages of this job we were planning to get engaged and married in a couple months and finally fulfill our dreams. We had already calculated all his bills and he was going to get everything he need up to date in less than 3 months. But now we don’t think that’s going to happen. 

Since everything was running smoothly with the job he had applied to he had already submitted his two weeks. So my boyfriend only has a week and a half to find a new job. Today he applied to two jobs. 

Idk how to feel. Idk how to help him. I’m currently working on getting my bachelors and can’t afford to help him.

I applied and was called to interview at a paint- night shop by my house and I was soooo stoked. I brought in my whole portfolio and crushed the interview.

To try to show how much I wanted the job, I painted the practice picture at home and made a visual set of instructions as I went along to demonstrate how I teach. 

After my second interview tonight, she just told me the only thing I would really need to work on is explaining the steps in simpler terms because I accidentally was using technical art terms that people who aren’t artists would know. Then she told me “so if we decide to hire you, we’ll just let you know within like the next couple of weeks” and tbh I got a lil stressed.

And to make it a little more suck, the garbage guy is the best friend of the one I went on a date with and am interested in pursuing further. Long story short: I’m lonely and socially inept, I’m worried I won’t be able to or will fail at retaining these relationships with my two buddies (who are both dry texters tbh) and severe my connection with the game. Sorry if this isn’t the sort of thing to ask about advice for, I’m honestly just looking for some guidance or possibilities since I’ve been feeling this way for about a month of the two month campaign.",07Oct2020,1
256,"So I just got out of a serious relationship. It wasn’t great, and we’ve been breaking up for a while, so I feel pretty content with breaking up. 

I’ve been having a small crush on a friend of mine recently and it was definitely amplified when I broke up with my ex...because of course I ran into my crush while I was breaking up with my ex. 

This feels like a crush I’ve had on a boy when I was in middle school. I don’t see him often or talk to him much, but I think about him all the time. I fantasize about the next time we’ll run into each other. And that’s not really a good thing. I’m not trying to date right now, I want to be in a relationship with myself. 

In summary and also TL;DR: how do I get myself out of having a crush on someone? I don’t want to think about boys right now.",07Oct2020,1
257,"Sorry if this is super long.

But any-who.. I hate my job, coworkers and my overall workplace! I am mentally, physically and emotionally drained. I work as a receptionist for a SMALL / very small law firm. I've been here for over year and i feel its very toxic. And for my amount of experience &amp; degree and the pay that I make, I honestly feel like I am being robbed. I want to make this short as possible but I deal with so much and wanted some opinions...
So essentially my work is to answer calls, greet guests etc and handle paperwork etc. Call volume is VERY high - maybe 30 calls an hour and 120-200 on a very crazy day and maybe 75  calls a day on a slow/quiet day. It’s 4 attorneys, one paralegal, two office assistants who run errands, one law clerk and myself. I am the “FIRST LINE DEFENDER” as they call me to answer calls. So I literally can’t take breaks, make/place calls, eat, use the bathroom etc. Anytime I leave my desk I get looked at as if Im crazy, I “usually get help” with calls but not enough to see a difference. When I work from home I use my cell phone which becomes infuriating since I can’t actually use it in peace without being interrupted every few minutes. And even at home, I can’t make/place calls, eat, shower, be a human in my own home. I understand this and try to schedule anything personal before or after work but still impossible to please anyone. But Anywhere from 4-6 missed calls in a row (because they all literally come in at the same time or seconds apart) my boss questions me if I’m alright because a lot of calls are getting through to the office. It’s as if I can speak to 6 people at once (the app we use only allows for one call at a time). I feel like a prisoner.  

With the high work /call volume and my personal matters, It became impossible to do any kind of interview, even before COVID! The amount of time I need to get to the interview, have the interview, return from the interview, etc just the perfect way to get fired. I am so stuck at this job that I don’t even have time to think! But When I say I HATE it here I REALLY do. Don’t get me wrong I love being busy working and speaking with clients but this is straight up slavery. I’ve been doing this kind of work in this field and I have a lot of experience and have been doing this for a long as well as I have degree but I am READY TO CALL IT QUITS. I don’t want to outright quit due to COVID and the difficulty of me finding work. Plus I got a new car but I have no real way of maintaining myself financially the way this job barely does. 

I don’t want to burn bridges but I am beyond stuck!? Whats do I do?!? 

**** I basically typed a book initially but I summarized what I dealt/deal with on a day-to-day basis:
1. Immature/inappropriate attorney
2. Inappropriate/rude clients
3. Snitch attorney who is extremely anal and who likes to escalate matters and CC’s the boss for everything
4. No lunch break :) - I have to eat while I work
5. SMALL office. SMALL “desk” - “desk” is a slab of wood :)
6. I can hear/smell everything from the bathroom (“desk” is next to bathroom)
7. I have no personal space.
8. I am a literal slave to my job.
9. I get harassed before and after work hours with emails and then harassed during work hours to see if the work has been done
10. I have a lot of personal issues going on that hinder me being in the office or online when working from home at times (my boss is aware of everything going on) and now think my boss thinks I’m lying OR he is just straight up tired of me.
11. 0 respect or any care for me as an employee (constant issues with health insurance &amp; I’ve been here for over a year still no 401k - I mentioned this and he left me on READ)
12. Pay is trash
13. Expect overtime ALL the time
14. Less help with calls due to COVID and get blamed essentially for everything that goes wrong.",07Oct2020,1

260,"My (16m) best friend (17f) and I have gotten really close over the last year or so. She is in a relationship so I never really saw her in a romantic way, and she has told me she doesn’t feel that way either. We are both super comfortable around each other, and always have a lot of fun with each other, but in the last few months things took kind of a strange turn. It started with her telling me she loved me (platonically) and ofc I said it back. 

We started saying “I love you” at every greeting, goodbye, and even at random times throughout the day. This seemed irregular from other friendships I’ve seen, but I brushed it off as a cute thing we do.

Then she moved away from both me and her boyfriend. They are trying long distance, and it’s going well, but I think the move proved to be quite stressful for her. She didn’t have any friends where she lived, so that led to us spending like ~8 hours a day on facetime. 

As we couldn’t really touch each other or anything in real life, she started constantly asking for fake kisses at my camera, faux head rubs, and shit like that over ft. She started talking to me until we both fell asleep almost every night. 

Then some really strange things started happening. She started casually bringing up hypotheticals to me. “If I wasn’t with my boyfriend would you date me?” “You know if I had met you before [boyfriend] I’d probably fall in love with you.” I’d usually answer honestly to these, telling her that I probably would date her outside of her current relationship, and things like that. 

She started casually calling me hot, and started saying things like “I’d fuck you to prove it.” and other shit like that “jokingly”. Usually I would reciprocate any expressed attraction with compliments or otherwise, but nothing specifically sexual, trying to be respectful of her relationship.

Then we started getting into really deep conversations about sex and sexuality, our bodies, and she turned the convo into hypotheticals about what our sex life would be like if we were together. 

At this point I am reasonably suspicious of a crush or something, but honestly I’m not sure. She told me before that she likes bringing up hypotheticals and things with people, and that her boyfriend doesn’t like it so she does it with me. I’m just wondering if she is a friend without much self control as to what she brings up, or if she wants more from our friendship. 

I’m honestly just curious. I would never do anything to infringe on the boundaries of their relationship or anything, although if she did want more out of our friendship I would not deny her.",07Oct2020,1
261,"TW: mentions of abuse and suicide 

Anybody I’ve told this before has reacted adversely to it so I keep this under wraps.  I believe I began lying like this because when I was in an abusive situation when I was younger I had to lie to keep myself safe when confronted. Now whenever I’m confronted I lie. I lie about my sex life, I lie about my regular life, I lie about what I’ve done in the day, I lie about homework, I lie about my work in general, etc etc. It’s usually just white lies but sometimes a big lie happens every once in awhile. Big lies (usually lying about death but there are other things like money or drug use) happen when I try to persuade someone out of (or towards) something. I mean I’ve persuaded people out of suicide saying I lost so and so and how much pain blah blah blah so I haven’t really convinced myself that was bad 😅. The worst part about all this lying is that now Im starting to believe the lies. I can’t tell what’s a fake memory and what’s a real memory a lot of the time. 

*
I’m obviously too far down this rabbit hole with most people I know so eventually I will have to go through with everything I lied about. Ig that’s my way of convincing myself I never lied, just “said it ahead of time”. It’s a breath of fresh air when I meet people who have no connections to people I know. It just sucks when I’m confronted with something and then I lie. And then I get stuck in the cycle again. 



*

Though one sorta good thing that came from this was that I managed to lie about being confident and eventually believed I was. Only problem with that is that I went overboard and I think I might have a mild god complex, nothing too bad but enough to get me into bad situations when I think I’m invincible and can’t get hurt and then I get hurt and regret it afterwards.

264,"I’ve recently started college. It’s been extremely difficult for me to connect with anyone. There are no organizations on campus that I really enjoy, and whenever I’ve tried to participate in groups I feel ignored and out of sync. 

In high school, I had a friend. We’ll call her Angela. Angela and I shared so many things together. We were very similar people. However, Angela is very reserved like me, and after graduation, I haven’t seen her. She doesn’t use social media at all (due to family and personal issues that are a story in itself...I would share the details but that would take paragraphs) but I miss her companionship. I looked up to her, and now since I am far away in a completely different town and setting, I know that we won’t see each other ever again. I’m not sure if she felt this strongly about me, but I miss her a lot, and now I have no way to contact her. Because of those personal/family issues, I will never be able to meet up with her in any way. 

I’ve been trying to find someone that I could relate to like Angela. I consider myself a very strange person with unique likes and interests, and I can’t find common ground with anyone. People tell me to meet others outside of my bubble, but whenever I try, I get extremely bored, let down, and I feel misunderstood. Angela was the only friend I’ve ever had. College so far has been difficult and exhausting. I don’t like the people I’m around here. I wish there were more people like Angela, and I am heartbroken that she is in a situation where we will not be able to reconnect.

272,"I work in retail, and very much do not *want* to be working my job these days due to covid and the public becoming more volatile with each passing day, but financially I am really stuck because I can't afford to miss a paycheck. It's important that I say this off the bat because quitting isn't an option for me no matter how much I want to.

I witnessed our security guard catcall a woman just outside of our store last week, and I was really torn about how to handle it. On the one hand, the words themselves weren't vulgar and in a totally different context, they'd be perfectly fine. On the other hand, I've been on the receiving end of relentless catcalling and street harassment starting all the way back from *childhood*, and after decades of it, it's worn me down. Catcalling is catcalling to me, it doesn't matter whether you're calling me beautiful or being crass and talking about my tits. It's unwanted attention all the same.

I thought about just talking to him about it and telling him that while I'm sure he meant well, it really wasn't an appropriate thing to do, and it could get him in trouble. But then I thought about every time that I've done this in the past, and the truth is, it's never worked, and this security guard has had multiple incidences of being inappropriate and sexist toward female customers. He's asked them to smile for him while standing in line to get into the store (and gone on sexist rants when they've complained to the manager and he's gotten reprimanded as a result). In general, he really singles out women every chance he gets, and in the event that a woman doesn't like that attention, he takes it badly.

Another incident took place last night, when he pulled his mask off ""corona!"" to me while he was standing just outside the door. He expressed a desire to do this out in public, so he clearly not only *doesn't care* about other peoples' comfort... he actively enjoys causing them distress.

Well, the day after the catcalling incident, I made a tough call that I really didn't want to have to make, and I told one of my managers what I saw. My choices were to either be silent and let him continue making an ass of himself at our store, confront him and have it fall on deaf ears, or report him and not know how it would be handled. I was torn and asked a few close friends for advice, and they pressured me to report him. So... I did.

My manager went to our HR department and told them about it, and our HR rep contacted me later in the day to confirm my side of the story. She contacted the agency our security guard was hired from, and they handled it from there.

Well, the other day, our security guard came back to work (we have multiple guards that work different days of the week), and he told me that someone had complained about him. Thing is, he gave some very specific details, and while he didn't outright confront me, I think he knows that I'm the one that reported him. By the sound of it, my HR rep threw me under the bus and told his boss that I was the one complaining, even though I wanted to remain anonymous. I understand that, for legal reasons, she needed to be specific about certain details, but I doubt it was necessary for her to share everything that she did.

I found all of this out because our security guard surprised me by following me to the bus stop. Apparently, his car needs work. And he took that opportunity while we waited for the bus to tell me all about being reported.

Now, here's my dilemma: I go back to work tomorrow. I don't feel safe returning, and while I haven't felt very safe at that job pretty much since I've started due to our temperamental customer base, now, that feeling's coming from another side. I don't want to wait alone at the bus stop late at night with someone I don't feel comfortable around during the best of circumstances, let alone what's going on now, and I'm very limited on methods of travel as it is, otherwise I wouldn't be taking the bus in the first place. Even if I figure out a way not to take the bus tomorrow, it doesn't solve the long-term problem: I'm working with someone who I (and a handful of my female coworkers) don't feel safe around, who enjoys upsetting people, and under a management that is all too happy to throw me under.

I don't know how to handle this going forward.",07Oct2020,1

He is mentally and emotionally abusive to her. The marriage is dominated by his unreasonable behaviors. Everything is according to him.

I would like to help her so I am here to seek information. Without bothering with restraining orders and filing for divorce, because I don't know if she will survive through it all, can she prepare a minimal of belongings, have a plan in order, and leave suddenly?

I don’t have anyone in my life who cares about me.

In the year that I’ve been using the apps I’ve had 0 dates, probably 10 matches between all of the apps and a couple replies. I craved that emotional connection so badly that I spent hours every day trying to get matches.

While my former classmates  get awesome jobs, I worked at an after school program, and I am  currently waiting on getting a start date for a human services  representative (which is a lot better but still).

Some  the changes I want to bring connect to being scared as well. I have not  even learned how to drive. In fact, the test booklet has not seen the  light of day since the day I got it.

In  a way it is also interesting that whenever someone compliments my  skills I practice self-sabotage and stop doing a good work no matter how  hard I try to get back on par. One of the main ways this happened is  through my writing during my journalism major. Teachers claimed that my  writing was excellent, to the point of thinking that I plagiarized, and  after that my writing worsened. This actually occurred two times.

It  would not be a joke if I also mentioned that my elementary teachers did  not respect me either. I just relieved a fourth grade teacher telling  me that I did not deserve a pet; an 8th grade teacher claiming that I  should be studying for her class instead of reading ... During these  times I knew what they were saying was wrong but I could not find my  voice to counter their statements.

My  25th round with the sun has just passed and I have not been in ANY  relationship -- which could be connected to me being a bisexual male.

The  worse part is that I do not even practice willpower with myself. I have  so many projects, including a blog and going to grad school, but even  though I start the process I have a hard time getting through once the  honeymoon stages passes. The only reason I have been able to lose weight  with intermittent fasting is because it is something passive.

I  am in the process of changing this story. I am already taking the first  step of being aware of it but now what should I do practice my  willpower?

Please help! Thanks! &lt;3",07Oct2020,1
284,"A year and a half ago I (16f at the time) dated this really immature, toxic and abusive guy(16) for less than two months. He had A LOT of problems and when I broke up with him he took it really hard and ended up stalking me, trying to guilt trip me by sending me letters and pictures of us and saying he was gonna kill himself etc... 
Obviously a lot more went down in that relationship and I don’t think anyone cares for the details but regardless, I broke up with him in May of 2019 and in August of 2019 he joined my sport that I’ve played since 3rd grade just to spend time around me. I started dating someone new around that time who was also on our team and they became friends and my ex ended up convincing my bf to break up with me. Very messy and complicated, I know but since then I’ve had him blocked on everything. 
But today someone sent me something he posted on his finsta story that said something like “fuck that bitch *my full name*, no one likes her”. And when I first saw it I laughed but soon after I started shaking with anger because I don’t understand why he’s so immature and still trying to fuck up my life or make people not like me. 
So anyways I have a study hall with him and I was thinking of confronting him and basically just saying if he has something to say he should say it to my face but I’m not a confrontational person at all and I have the worst anxiety and I’m worried I might stutter or make a fool out of myself, so any advice??",07Oct2020,1

288,"So I (20f) have always been apprehensive to drinking. I come from a long line of alcoholics, my mom and I  are the only one in my family on both sides to not have a substance abuse issue (beside caffeine). 

Anyway I just recently started to try alcohol, I haven’t liked much of what I’ve tried, I’m a picky person but I tried the mikes hards and I didn’t have an issue that I noticed with them. But the next time I drank, I drank smirnoffs and after the first bottle I noticed I was a little out of breath, I could breath fine but not as well as normal and if I tried taking a deep breath I would start coughing a lot. I freaked out a little, stopped drinking and took a Benadryl thinking I was having an allergic reaction and it knocked me out. 

I haven’t drank since then, but my boyfriend got really drunk last night on beer, fireball and captain Morgan and I kissed him quite a bit and I started having the same issues. Not to where I felt like I couldn’t get air but I was short of breath and deep breaths would cause me to cough and when I woke up today the issue was gone.

290,I am a freshmen in high school and I play football. I started the season and with in a week I wanted to quit but my learners made me play until first game. Well I got moved up to JV so I played for a few more weeks. About the 4th week I wanted to quit again and now before every practice I get anxiety. I sometimes need to call my mom in the middle of the day to calm me down (she is a councilor BTW). It interferes with my school because I don’t want to do anything because I want to utilize my time before football. Now I have been begging them for three weeks and they say that if I quit it might makes the coaches not like my brother he is a 7th grader.

294,"(also posted on r/off my chest) 
Hey guys, this is a throwaway account but I am still new to reddit in general. If this is the wrong place to put it let me know and I'll delete 
I just want to preface that I'm sorry if this is a ramble, I suck at words and getting my point across in a precise manner. This will be long.
This is the first time I've really spoken about this, so it's hard

I need help understanding how to make friends essentially and if it's me that's fundamentally wrong, and how I can improve myself.
Backstory, sorta,
I've had a crap life, and in short I never got a childhood, I never learnt the social dynamics between people and what social cues are the norm. I've always been a loner and introvert and I'm happy with that. But sometimes I do feel lonely like I'd love to have long meaningful friendships.
Ive found over the years people come and go so easy. When I think I've made a close friend and we chat heaps it always drops off, too the point where it's 1 week and then nothing for months.
I message people asking how they are going, and how they are. I leave it for days so I'm not bothering people. But I just have found it's always me who has to engage in conversation and start the conversation.
People always mention how they miss me and how we should catch up, it'll be on twitter, twitch etc and I'll respond back saying yea of course message me when with your free time and let's catch up
Or they'll say that we should have a game soon to catch up and again I say message me your free time cause I'm available whenever. And it's nothing, I never hear anything. It makes feel unwanted and maybe to them I am
I'm getting sick of always being the one to engage in conversation to be the one who starts. Or should I be reading between the lines?
Is it all face value and they don't wanna hang out? Are they actually friends or just acquaintances?

I started twitch streaming as I have always wanted to do something in the gaming industry and felt I wasn't smart enough to do YouTube, and Twitch is all live. On the upside I thought it would help me get out and socialise.
I started out small and made some mates, then I used Facerig as I was uncomfortable with showing myself.
Over time I grew bigger and more confident made friends and was so much happier.
I was interacting with people making connections, this whole socialising thing was fun, then I was picked as a Ubisoft Star Player and I was on a high. I learnt how to photoshop and edit YouTube videos, I was so proud of myself, I got more confident showing myself and it was great.
Until one of my ""friends"" started playing mind games. I don't really know what happened tbh she was a streamer to and bigger than me, and was my first close friend when introduced to the real world.
She was the first person I was close to when introduced back to socialising. Which is why I think it's hit me hard.

She started being very manipulative, and controlling. It was all about her. To the point she stopped talking to me one weekend after multiple attempts at trying to say hey and is everything ok, I left it to give her space.
I ended up doing things with some new people I met only to be yelled at, at the end of the weekend for ""moving on"" from her and how I failed the test as she wanted to see what I'd do when she wasnt talking to me.
She would always yell at me saying I was trying to show her up, when I honestly wasn't, I don't care about numbers, I just wanted to socialise and do what I love, I just wanted friends tbh. 
Long story short she drove me to the point of me wanting to end it. I just couldn't take it. I wanted to end my life.

After I finally worked up the courage to block her with the help of some people. Everything just stopped, my stream died, people stopped talking to me, and I fell into a year of depression socially. It messed with my mind. Was it her, has she been spreading rumours.
Was it me? Do I just suck? Am I just whining and should shut up? 
It has made me loose confidence. The confidence I grew in myself. I want to give up and run away back to my hole but I know logically I should just keep pushing. Surely it'll get better and I'm trying, doing little bits here and there, but I don't have the will for it anymore. And that's what's depressing. Streaming for me was my go to. My stress reliever and something I would look forward to after a long day at work. Gaming has always been my escape. But it's made me so jaded. 
I don't think I'm a bad person, I always try to help people where I can and do good, I'm someone who will always put others over myself. Someone who loves to help people as I've been through so much so I have a better understanding of most situations. But sometimes I wonder.
I know it's a negative way of thinking but when people don't respond or I just can't seem to keep friends in general, apart of me wonders logically out of all those cases it has to be me statistically.
I dunno what to do or how to do it.
I be myself, but I feel like it's not enough.

In a tldr way. How to I keep and maintain friendships? How do I know they are genuine?
Am I wrong in this?
I genuinely want to know the bad and good.
I need to know where I am wrong
Thank you for your time

298,"I'm a woc (woman of color) and when I was a kid I had to move to a mostly white town where I got severely bullied from elementary through highschool. I don't really blame the kids, because they probably didn't know better but I was made to feel lesser than for frankly my physical traits. I was taller than most other girls and wasn't built ""delicately"" with delicate (European) features so I was called ""manly"", a gorilla, my dark brown hair was called ""sh*t hair, and I was called ""nappy head"" and ""fuzzy"" because of my thick curly hair. I got one girl who I thought was my friend and when we were on the bus she looked at me for a while and said ""I want to say something but I'm not sure if I should"" I out of curiosity said ""what?"" and she said ""I'm proud to be white.""

304,"Throwaway because this wouldn't fit on my main account.

For the past two years or so, (possibly longer) I have had the habit of ripping and eating the skin on my legs. Not just my legs, usually my arms too, sometimes even my hands or neck, but it happens most predominantly with my legs. Every summer, I get swarmed by mosquitoes, and end up with hundreds of bites. I start scratching at them little by little, until eventually they turn into wounds and become scabs. This has been normal for me all my life, I've always gotten attacked by bugs, but these past few years I have gotten into the habit of peeling the scabs off after they've grown and usually just eating them. I don't really know what got me into this, it's not something I do for pleasure or some kind of taste or because of anxiety or anything, it's just a thing I do. By the time summer ends, the skin has healed and can't be easily picked at anymore, so I usually stop by then, but unfortunately by that point the skin has turned into a scar and the damage has been done. This has happened non stop these past few years every summer, I've tried to stop but it's just something I do so naturally I don't even think about it while I do it. At the moment, both of my legs have about twenty of these small scars covering them. My arms and feet have a few too but none are as bad as the ones on my legs. I've gone to doctors and I've told several therapists about this, but because my mom is with me, her main concern is how ugly my legs look and just grills the doctor about that. I've been prescribed medicine, I've worn longer pants/socks to cover myself, but nothing has helped. My doctors say that the wound marks are not scars and will heal eventually, and I have stopped peeling at old, healed cuts, but nothing has worked or changed. I've been trying to ignore my legs as much as possible; last year I had a huge boost in self confidence and started becoming more social and becoming much happier with my appearance, but it sucks anytime I walk or sit in front of my mom and she just immediately peers down at my legs and shakes her head. She isn't trying to be mean or anything, but she's already a super self conscious person and definitely a bit OCD, so she always acts like me 'looking ugly' is an embarrassment to her and she has always found a way to slip her thoughts on how I look into conversation, even though she knows damn well it really hurts me and I'd never do this kind of thing on purpose.

I don't know why I do this or if anyone else does; I've heard of people biting at fingers or their feet or whatever, but I've never seen or met another person with these many scars or with a feeling like this as strong as mine, I don't know what's wrong with me or why I do this, and I just don't know how to stop. I feel it's worth mentioning that shortly before I got into peeling at skin, I had gotten into this really bad anxiety phase, where I would do things like force myself to throw up or cut my arms with knives just so I could stay home from school, but even when I was home, I'd still spend the whole day absolutely terrified of having to go back to school the next day. This phase didn't last too long, and I'm much better at controlling my anxiety and feelings now, but I still feel it's important I bring up that self harm is not at all anything new to me and I've had a bit history of this in the past, too. I looked up my symptoms of eating skin recently and found out about this thing called Dermatophagia, which from what I understand, is basically just eating the skin around your fingers. I haven't researched this too much, I know close to nothing about the medical world and I know you really shouldn't ever self-diagnose yourself based off of google symptoms, but this and (possibly?) pica are the closest things I could find without a doctors help. Because of covefe-19, all doctors offices near me are either closed for research or has a waiting list of like a million people, and I don't think I'm really in an urgent position to talk to a doctor; but if anyone knows anything about what I'm going through or if they've been through anything similar, it would be  much appreciated if you could tell me about it. Thank you.

TL;DR : I have an issue with peeling the skin off my legs and eating the scabs, and doctors have been useless thus far. I think I might have something called Dermatophagia, but I don't want to self diagnose myself with anything off of google. Anyone who might know something about this is very much appreciated.

310,"Hi Reddit,

For the past few years, I've been doing my MA in a counselling profession, and long story short, I might fail the entire degree. Basically, I had a very bad supervisor (eventually a bunch of her students reported her and I got transferred to another prof), and I became quite depressed. This resulted in me not finishing some of my clinical work to a satisfactory level. I recently did some remedial work, and the higher ups are basically debating whether to give me my degree or not, essentially based on the quality of this remedial work. I have put in my best effort, but the work certainly was not perfect and there is a decent chance that I might not be conferred my degree despite having technically finished all requirements, including my thesis.

Basically, I don't even know what to do if I fail. It will feel like the past few years have been a waste. Luckily I can stay at my current job so I won't be homeless or anything, but I will be so embarrassed since all my friends and family and coworkers know I am in this degree. How would I explain this to future employers? Future education programs I may want to reply to? It basically feels like my world is ending.

313,"So we all know how covid is a thing. My family has been relatively good about wearing masks, and we have no problem with it. However, my dad and my younger sister are 100% against masks. They're also radical trump supporters but honestly I could care less, however I do think that's connected to their hate of masks. I've tried so many times to explain to them how they are making a terrible decision and possibly putting lives at stake, but they won't listen. A little extra background, my family has to be very careful about covid because my older brother has a weakened immune system.

How do I convince my dad and sister that they are being idiots and to wear a mask? I'd rather not see my brother in a casket next time I see him.",07Oct2020,1
314,"I won’t “move on” just yet. This is not up for debate. 

Long story short, an ex-girlfriend really hurt me and I cut her off in all ways possible. It seemed like I would be satisfied with that, but that’s not the case anymore. My friend told me she found her Tik Tok... and all the bad memories of her emotional abuse started flooding back. 
I’m in no mood to take the moral high road, so I reported her last video and it got deleted. Today, I learned she must’ve filed an appeal because it’s back up, an reporting the video doesn’t work anymore.

316,"So, I'm a 22 year old uni student. I've been actively looking for work for the past 5-6 years now. I've never been invited for an  interview and I've never had a job. I got so desperate that I actually took a class last year about how to get employed but they focused on interviewing which would actually be an issue for me if I ever got one.The country I'm living in provides a lot of support for students and I live with my parents so money has never been an issue. I know this makes me lucky but I feel like I haven't accomplished anything.  I hope this changes soon when I hand in my 4th year thesis but other than that, and the skills I've acquired, I've got shit all going for me. My question is: am I an exception or is what I'm going through normal? Am I the only 22 y/o here who's an unemployed bum? And should I be freaking out bc I've never been employed? Is there any advice you guys can give me on looking for work as I'm due to graduate in a month?

317,"Title pretty much says it. My parents are attending a wedding in Southern California in a few weeks in a hot spot of covid. The wedding is outdoors, but there will be about 100 people, and masks are there “for anyone who feels like wearing one”. I understand my parents wanting to go to this wedding, it’s my cousins, but my husband and I aren’t going because I don’t want to be the reason someone else gets covid because I just *had* to go to this wedding. I really don’t know how to express to them it makes me uncomfortable. Also, I’m watching their dogs for them and I’m thinking about dropping off the dogs at their house an hour and a half away just so I don’t have to worry about interacting with them.

Little bit of background info;

I(18F) and best friend (18F) have been friends for years. We're closer to each other than anyone else in our friend group and always have been, my parents were big on discipline growing up as in studying, getting good grades etc. Things like sharing and being happy for other people? Not so much. Things like how to be happy for others and keeping my temper in check I ended having to figure out myself. I've gotten a lot better, here's where the problem starts though.

Towards the beginning of last year I started noticing things about her I hadn't noticed before, I could write a book but we'll keep it to the basics. She'd get mad or annoyed over the tiniest things, she has a really crappy attitude when she gets frustrated, and I mean really really crap. She's called me useless, irritating, stupid and a bunch of other crap I don't have the energy right now to think about. I generally let it go because I know how she gets when she's frustrated.

Now we've come to the one thing that's been getting on my nerves, I'm not sure how to describe it but she compares our situations and will say things like 'can't be as bad as mine' or 'mine's so much worse', shit like that. I don't know maybe I'm overreacting but we had english oral exams today, she did bad and my friends and I comforted her and all but then came my turn after she'd left, I ended up flopping pretty bad and cried about it in the bathroom then texted her about it and almost immediately she said exactly what she always says, ""It can't be that bad, have you seen mine?"" and an ""It's okay mine was so much worse"".

I'm sorry, I'm so tired of competing, I really don't have the energy to even reply. Am I overreacting? I feel like this is so petty, but how do I talk to her about my issues?",07Oct2020,1

I have issues with perfection, my GPA is around 4.14 and I hate this because it is an unsustainable venture. I am terrified of getting low marks and thoughts of this, plague me every day. I continue to worry about my marks, and I overthink everything. I think all of this might have to do with my health, I have not been getting as much exercise or eating as well as I could have.

321,"I’ve been hiding my instagram stories from my siblings for like a year now and earlier today, my sister went on my instagram to show me a trick.

Please help. What do i say?? Do i lie?? I’m a very bad liar and she will probably see through me.

323,"I have a girlfriend and I love her so much. 

My colleague from school posted on Instagram (close friends) story about her being really sad basically. We chatted back and forth and I tried cheering her up the best I could, it seems like it all stems from her just being lonely, her boyfriend left her and she’s a transfer and is living alone at an air bnb. She can’t get a pet because she’s financially unstable either. 

She laughed and sent me a picture of herself. And said look at my unicorn but she’s the focus of the picture. I just said wow lol (I had no idea how to respond and it was really random.)

This also happened once when I was giving this other girl advice and she randomly out of no where said I remind her of her best friend and her ex boyfriend. This was during a lunch break at work I normally like eating by myself so no one bothers me but she told me to go with her to the cafeteria I didn’t want to be rude and said okay. And said I was cute and she liked my personality. Unlike the Instagram one this was in person and changed the tone of the conversation. 
After this conversation I tried to stay away from this girl. 

I see myself in this situation a lot where they either start sending pics or being to forward and at that point I just want to stop talking. I’m just trying to be nice.",07Oct2020,1
324,"Hello! So my boyfriend and I both have a childhood friend who passed away via suicide about 4 years ago now. Him and my bf were super close, like talked every day and did everything together. When he moved halfway across the country, my bf would fly out to see him. I still was close with this friend, but kinda lost touch with him around the time of his death. I know my boyfriend kinda blames himself for the death too. 

Every once in a while (especially on landmark days like the birthdays and such) my boyfriend will get super sad. It'll just be a day where he's really bummed out and misses his friend - which is fair. I have days like that too but I'm not as outwardly sad all the time as he is. 

Anyway, I really have a hard time comforting him. I try my best and try to say things that i think will help, but I always feel like I'm saying the same annoying clichés.  It also gets hard because I want to be there and be like a rock and a shoulder he can lean on- but I also am grieving this person and inevitably get really sad too, and then he feels the need to comfort me when he's already going through it and it makes me feel horrible. 

Does anybody know what I could do better?",07Oct2020,1
325,"Okay so a little bit of background info.
My husband (21) and I (20f) have been roommates with my best friend -we'll call her K -(20f) for a little more than a year. I've known my husband since I was 14 and my best friend since I was 16. Anyways, she started dating this guy at the end of 2019, and I don't like him and want her to dump him. I really didn't know why until recently, when I realized that I am like really attracted to her. 

At first, I thought maybe I'd ask her about a threesome with my husband and I (her and I are both bisexual and my husband has mentioned wanting to possibly try a threesome) but I realized I want more than that? So I've been thinking of a thruple thing, but I'm not even sure how we would go about that and all. I don't think she'd leave her bf for me and I definitely don't want to leave my husband bc I do love him. But I don't want to just hide my feelings. At least where we are, polyamorous relationships are generally frowned upon so I'm not even sure any of us would be okay with it due to society and all that. Anyways, I think about her a lot and I'm pretty sure I'm in love with her. I guess I just have no idea what to do or how to do it. I don't want to push the feelings to the side but I also don't want to risk ruining our friendship or my marriage.

Any advice?",07Oct2020,1
326,"this is a really long vent bc im super frustrated. I also posted this on r/Vent bc I just need some advice or just anything to make myself feel better. 

TLDR: I want to make friends, so I went on bumble and met with a girl without telling my mom and then she belittles me and makes me feel like shit when pried the answer out of me bc I smoked weed with the girl. now ""all of her trust is gone"". My dad also pities me for having no real friends and it makes me feel pathetic. if anyone could comment or give me some advice on how to cope with my mom bc she's crazy that'd be nice. I know I can make friends but I feel like she's keeping me now. 

\---

god I am so mad right now. I am so mad. I'm so mad. im 18 and pretty much my whole life I've been living with hatred and anger in myself bc I got teased a lot in school and I've had a bit of social anxiety self diagnosed. I've had friends that come and go thru out the years, but none of them are very close and I've been longing for a close friendship my whole life. my closest ones was probably when I was in 7th grade and younger than that. recently I heard about manifestation and I meditate sometimes, and my life has been getting better since last year. im starting to love myself and love others and be patient in some aspects of my life. also learning how to be kind, working on my confidence and paranoia and stuff, too. 

since I'm manifesting good friends, I was led to download bumble and look thru the friend section and see if anyone would want to hang out. im going to community college bc of the virus, but I really wanted to go to university this year. all of my classes are online and asynchronous so I can't really make friends thru my classes. that's why I got bumble. I met with this girl and we got a long well so we decided to hang out today. it went well and we smoked weed. ofc I still live with my parents, and I didn't want to tell them about this hang out bc im going out with a stranger. I knew if I told my mom she definitely would've said no bc im a small girl and anything can happen to me. It went perfectly fine, and I decided to stay a littler longer than I should have at the girls house which was the biggest mistake. when I got home, my mom was home from work. the first thing I did was take a shower. then I said hi to her after I got out and she asked me where I was and I told her. I left out the weed part. she got really angry with me as expected, bc I didn't tell her, its with someone I never met, and also because of the fact that the girl is black. she didn't state that part outright, but it was obvious. then came her lecture. her lectures last a really long time where she constantly repeats the same sentences over and over again for some reason like that will get the point across better.

 then she had to go to a meeting and said we'll discuss this later. she comes back and asks to see the girls picture, her bumble profile, and our text messages. I showed her the profile and picture, but I said that she couldn't look at my texts, those are my texts, and its my phone. then she asked me if im hiding something because she can tell im nervous and she repeated the question a few Times. I then told her what we did which was smoke weed and then she was like ""I knew it, you can't hide anything from me. I could tell you're nervous, you're a horrible liar. you're a horrible liar. this is where I draw the line. no more lies. no more going out. if you do this again, then you will no longer get help with paying for schooling."" I replied to these with ""ok"" and I got really frustrated and my dad was there, too. I could tell he was pitying me and it made me feel pathetic. I started to cry because I was so frustrated and I explained to them that I've I just want to experiment having different friends. my mom asked what kinds and I said ""outgoing ones"". she said that the types of friends I had are fine. but I never got close to them, I felt like with both of our personalities it didn't seem like they were willing to be vulnerable to each other. now I want to be vulnerable and find different people to hang out with. 

my mom got mad at me for crying and she blames me because I made her feel bad because im crying now. How dare I cry and make my mother feel bad. my dad said ""why don't we just try to work as a team because we dont want our daughter to go out with the wrong people."" and my mom says ""well im trying to show that I care for her but Im always the ""bad guy"" in this family. fine. husband, you can take care of YOUR kids. (my brother and I are hers and my dad's, tho). I dont want to deal with them anymore. they can do whatever they want. I know that she's is going to go out and do this again anyways."" even though im not because I literally said that I would delete the apps and not go out with the girl again. then for some reason my mom starts talking about all of the past mistakes I've made and how I one time hung out with a ""weird kid"" who was literally my classmate and I've talked to him before. she goes back to my past mistakes to avoid being seen as the ""bad guy"". so now she's making me the bad person even though its supposed to be about ""teaching me"". she somehow turns the story onto herself and how she's always the bad guy and she's just trying to help the family. I know she is trying to help us, but she does it in a completely stupid and insensitive way. she also loves using the ""im the bad guy in the family"", ""when im dead you'll appreciate me"", lines EVERY ARGUMENT. 

 she has gotten just the teeniest bit more patient and self controlled over the years, but she just seems so unaware of her self and how she makes people feel. because its all about her and how WE make her feel. she takes everything personally, which is an unfortunate trait to have your entire life. My brother was completely depressed and frustrated when he lived with us. he's so much happier now that he's moved out. I just thank God for my dad because he's the complete opposite of my mom, and if they ever got divorced and I had to live with my mom, I'm sure my life would suck ass and then I would have adopted all of her personality traits. its like my mom can't improve herself to become a more understanding, patient, and less manipulative person. I admit she has gotten a little better, but its still really bad. its like we have to change our responses for HER so SHE doesn't get upset while she's lecturing us. but it seems impossible because what she says is just so ridiculous and blown out of proportion and prolonged and sarcastic. I just can't get myself to simply say ""ok"" when she's talking to me sometimes because its just so stupid. 

today this argument just really made me so infuriated and pathetic because I can't experiment hanging out with different people. that's why I wanted to go to university this year because I would've been in a dorm and my mom won't know what im doing and I could've hung out with whoever I wanted. im pretty sure my mom loves the fact that I have no friends because every time I go out, even if its been a couple weeks or months since the last time, she just hardly ever wants me to. its my dad who says its okay. one of my friends I've known for 4 years, and it was fine for me to go to his house for 3 years. but all of a sudden, this year she no longer wants me to go because she read some internet posts and is super paranoid about me being raped or something. except we both know him well he is such a chill and reserved dude, no one would ever expect him to do that. my moms reasoning Is simply because he's a man I shouldn't hang out with him anymore. 

 of Course I have to end this with the obligatory ""I love my mom"", which I do, but I just can't do this. she is really loving and fun to hug, but today this argument really got to me. I dont know why she lectures me so much because it obviously never works. they're a waste of time and I hate them. I WISH she could be more concise because these last hours. GOD. im so frustrated and its so pathetic if I talk to anyone about this. I am so angry.",07Oct2020,1

331,"Hi I need advice about my dad. We have a very shaly relationship and im not sure what he is like is abusive or just strict parenting.

First of all just to out it out there in 16y/o Male from the UK and am diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorder. 

My dad is technically my stepfather and has been in my life since I was about 10. We have had a very good relationship until about 3 years ago when we moved and he lost his job in the police force. Since that he has been a good father but has been very tough on parenting. I am not sure weather he is abusive because when he regularly has meltdowns he screams and shouts at me, my siblings and my mum. He makes me feel like shit on a regular basis because I like to hang out with my friends sometimes after school finishes and not come home till about 8:30 pm. When I come home even straight after school I am expected of him to do chores which I don't really mind but am often extremely exhausted when I come back from school. Since I have gone to college I am very stressed out and I feel as if I am going to burn myself out. He expects me to walk the dog everyday as it is a sort of payment for living in this house which again I don't mind doing but if I forget one day or just am to exhausted to, he will call me a lazy pig and that I am good for nothing and all I do use him and my mother. He regularly has a go at me for buying food after school as a snack because I am hungry after a long day and he also has a go at me because I ask for money for the bus and for my music lessons. This has put too much stress on me so I have just stopped going to my music lessons as he will end up having a go at me for using him like a cash point. He also seems to call me a junkie on a regular basis because I tried a lil bit of weed a year back and insists I have a drug problem which I don't as I smoked weed once at a party and haven't been near it again. He has never hit me but regularly calls me lazy and good for nothing if I don't do what he says or I argue back with him if we have a disagreement. Hope you can help!",07Oct2020,1

334,"So I am currently living with my parents since January because of the pandemic and restrictions. I was hoping if I could find a solution here cause I don't really have close friends who I can talk to this stuff about. 

My mother has been constantly pitting me against my brother and him against me in order to ""instill a healthy competition amongst us"". This is completely out of my comprehension because it just makes me dislike my brother for reasons he isn't even in control of. This has been going on forever but as I didn't live with them for a few years it was ok. But now that I am stuck again, it's getting worse. She constantly compares both of us be it academics or personality or whatever. This doesn't help me become better than him in any way cause I cannot see my own brother as a competition if that makes any sense. But she doesn't get it. 

Yesterday I told her that I miss the city I live in (China) and I wish I could go back sooner (I am from a small town). I showed her some pictures of it. And she said that ""oh the city your brother lives in (Singapore) is more beautiful, he must miss it even more."" I don't understand why would she say that. I know this sound like a silly little thing to get worked up on. Maybe I'm just overreacting or overthinking it but these little things bottle up over time and after a while I just lose my mind. 

I don't know how to deal with it. I just hope I find a way to control my emotions towards these things or else I might end up resenting both of them for life.",07Oct2020,1

l currently have a bachelors in international Business and am planning on doing a Masters degree in either political science or public policy! To begin with, my reasoning behind choosing either an MPP or MPS is firstly because, I believe governments play a massive role in todays economic environment, secondly I would like to be able to apply to public sector jobs and not just private sector jobs, thirdly I believe the knowledge I could learn from an MPP and MPS can go hand in hand and be useful in both the public and private sector and lastly I would like to learn more about social responsability, sustainability, ethics and leadership.

340,"To rephrase, is it ok to spend thousands of money for a course I'm not even sure about just to be free from the toxicity of where I live? 
For more context, I'm doing pretty okay. I have both my parents providing for the family. I have a small room. But I've spent almost the majority of my life here and I feel stuck. I want to experience something new and learn how to be more independent and be more happy with my life. We've already enrolled for a fashion design course for 3 years in a pretty expensive school, which I'm fine with but not crazy about. I honestly don't know why I feel this way because I've always wanted to be in the fashion industry all my life and yet,  I'm starting to have second thoughts now. 

Anyways, my mother and I are not in good terms due to previous arguments that over escalated to a lot of violence and shouting. I now avoid interacting with her as much as possible which means I always have to sneak around the house and lock my door. I know this kind of lifestyle is not healthy as it makes me feel smaller and less happy. I can't fully express myself and I have to pretend to be someone I'm not. My family is religious which means I also have to be. I'm tired of pretending and maybe that’s why I would rather study abroad but idk if it's the right thing to do.

I have a lot of hobbies like piano, painting, YouTube, etc. but nothing I can make a living out of. If I do study abroad, I'm going to live with my grandma who is also pretty religious so I would probably still have to attend but at least we won't have bad history and I'd feel better.

341,"About 6 months ago I struggled seriously with self-esteem issues and suicidal thoughts. I never told anyone about it and I never did anything to get over it, I just sorta ignored it. Now i don't give a fuck about anything anymore. All I do is go to the beach and drool over the same girl I have been chasing for months. I have no motivation or fear of punishment. I use to be a straight A student with a 4.5 GPA. Now I have like 15 missing assignments in every class. Whenever I am punished it doesn't bother me. I can't take anything or anyone seriously. Even when my dad hits me for missing assignments or disrespecting him, it doesn't even phase me. I'm not scared of dying. I'm not scared of pain. I'm not scared of being homeless. In the end none of it matters anyway. Is this normal?


 I use to have a almost obsessive crush on a girl and now I still like her, but I don't really care what she thinks of me anymore. I use to do everything in order to impress her and now I just don't give a single fuck. And like I said before I don't give a fuck about school anymore. I was the kid who would stay after class and takes only ap and college classes and now I don't give a fuck if I end up homeless and without an education.



 I was a d1 baseball player and might have a shot at college, but Idgaf about it anymore and I've started skipping practice for the past couple of months. I still don't have my permit, why would I need it if my friends could drive?    My mom was screaming at me about my grades and I laughed at her. It seemed so stupid that some one was mad at me for a grade. I just want to have a good time. I started smoking weed again and drinking alone. I know that's not healthy but no one knows any different so why not. I think I'm gonna drop out and move in with my brother and if he doesn't let me move in with him I'll just be homeless. What the fuck am I supposed to do with myself? What the fuck is wrong with me?",07Oct2020,1
342,"I (22F) live in a different city to my boyfriend (40m). No, he's not forcing me, I fancy older men. Get over it. I know the age gap looks strange and a lot of people will cringe but please understand that I have always been and acted a lot older than I am. Most people presume I am 28 because of how I act. I'm not some partying teenager and most would say I'm sensible.

I am the oldest sibling in my family and my parents seem to expect me to do exactly as they ask. My younger brother (19M) lives mainly with his girlfriend who lives like 5 minutes from home. He has a reputation for partying (and drinking heavily) and hasn't attended church in years.

Because of this, my parents have always seemed to think I'll be the one to 'follow them' and go to church every Sunday. They want me to be part of the worship team and attend meetings all the time. I don't want to do this, but as I live in their house and under their roof, I feel as though I have little choice. Up until early this year, they had a tracking device installed on my phone that I wasn't allowed to take off. It was on until my brother found a way to make it stop working so I could therefore get rid of it. They've always been very strict and have high standards that I just can't compete with.

My boyfriend has been with my for a while and we do love each other. He's understanding of my problems and does his best to reassure me. He's wonderful and we honestly do intend to spend the rest of our lives together. I love him. 
He moved to a different city recently (for a new job and to be closer to his family) and I intend to follow him. We plan to move in together next year in summertime once I've finished my degree. 

But I have no idea how to tell my parents! They'll get so angry and disapprove. I don't know if they'll let me go or if they'll help me move. Previous problems have proven that they'll go and tell their church congregation everything so once I tell my parents, loads of people in my city will know and they'll set up prayer groups for me!

I honestly don't know what to do or how to approach those! Can somebody please tell me what they would do?",07Oct2020,1

345,"I live in Europe (which is beginning to experience a second corona wave; things still not too bad where I live but it's starting to get worse) and just started grad school. My program is very small (15 students this year) so I'd like to be on good terms with everyone and make friends, especially since I'm usually not too good at it. However, making friends in Europe = having a public social life, going to bars and parties and hanging out in large groups -- things I don't want to do right now, I've already had a corona scare and have lost family members because of it. But everyone else doesn't seem to be as cautious, and they're all pretty friendly with each other because they're still going to bars and all -- and I'm the only one who's left out.   


I can't believe the choice is making friends vs. not falling sick, but we live in strange times. I obviously pick the latter, and I wish I could interact with them online (zoom happy hour etc.) but they don't seem to be into that because why would they be when meeting irl is no big deal for them?

346,"Kind of a long story. 
When I (21F) was 13 (2012) my mom died of cancer, I was supposed to get her ashes. By the time we went to pick up her ashes, my moms non biological father had driven from out of state and signed them off and left with them without saying a word. Obviously I was devastated and furious amongst other things. No one had told me, my brother, or father where they ended up. We were going to take my family to court over it but I ultimately decided this wasn’t what my mom would’ve wanted. I think since then my grandma has ended up with them but I’m still not 100% sure. I have tried to ask her about it many times, it gets pushed off. My grandma is very emotional and a little manipulative if I’m honest. The last time I asked was about a year ago, to which she said we needed to talk in person. (She lives 4 hours away) and we have tried to talk in person? But she gets so emotionally explosive that I never actually get answers. My moms birthday is on oct. 10th and I feel kinda bad to bring it up now, but I feel the need to try to basically demand her to just tell me over text. I don’t know how else to get answers and I’ve spent too many years wondering if they spread them in secret, or if they were lost. What happened to them? 

I want to point out that my family and I are very close, and I even lived with my grandma after this all happened for a few years. This is a very tough conversation to have not only because she’s emotional about it (obviously) but also because the answers may greatly effect our relationship if they were mishandled. 

Any advice on how to have her tell me over text?

347,"I am a 19 year old Indian Male, living in India.

I am in a MedSchool, so there's not much time to loaf around and date...
Personally I don't even know whom to date and what are criteria that should be important and what should not be.
I want to be having this 'Awesome College Wild Hoe Phase' too. I feel like I am heavily missing out. Because in 3more years, I want to attend a Residency in the US which generally have 80+hour work week. They are called residents because they literally reside in the hospital... Again 5 more years gone. 

So then I'd be 19+8=27. 

And Oh boy 27 and a virgin, It's hard for you to hookup or date (people look at you and judge you as incel) especially given that I would be a virgin, and it's just that I'd miss out on all the best times while others will have had it. Then again I'd like to have kids by 30(+2) so that I can also end up seeing my grandkids too. And Once you have kids, hell Once you get married you can't fuck around. And I don't wanna be jelly over my wife's past... I want to be fucking normal...


Now, My morals....

I don't/can't/won't ever cheat on my wife.
(But I can't be a sulking mess either)

I feel as if I am ruining those girls by having sex with them, I am pushing them to be 'bad girls'

I am pretty scared of falling in love with someone promiscuous and then I can't get past her past and feel shit about the future... I mean I don't want my kids to know what a hoe their mom was... Unless I was something of that myself. I mean I don't want to be some consolation prize. You may not agree but those are my feelings.

I have no problem in waiting for Marriage.
But most people don't. And if my wife hasn't.. why the fuck should I wait? 

Somedays it's YOLO! Go have fun!
Other days it's Think About your future generations... You'll be a fucking disgrace!

I want to start my own dynastical family kinda thing.. And I need to be a good role model...

Also my parents are against Love, Premarital sex, relationships, they said even if I want to date I can when I am an MD... Which means at 30 and even said we won't look after you then you're on your own, you are no longer our son, but if you marry our choice and shit goes wrong we'll be here for you...

No privacy for me so typing this took a lot of time...

Also this slight Madonna Whore complex know kinda ruins me.

Plus there's my own insecurities my penis size...
How am I ever gonna be my future wife's best When I barely have 5 inches of meat down there...

How am I gonna compare to those 6,7,8,9 inches long who have way more experience confidence and meat...

It feels like running a race I can never win...

I feel so evil as if I am soliciting sex from these good girls and the ones who smoke and drink and get high don't push my buttons...

I understand my parents sentiments, I would quite possibly get distracted by this love and sex affairs but i can't miss out on it either...",07Oct2020,1

350,"In elementary we were very influenced by the media, aka tv, celebs, etc. so the idea of being “grown/dating” was pressured onto us and kids would get together left and right at my school. I somewhat did the same, I always had new “crushes” every few months so I could be “cool” too like the popular kids at school. 

Because of this it’s hard for me to identify my real crushes from my fake ones. But as highschool has progressed even more, it’s been a damn roller coaster for me because I’ve ended up genuinely crushing on some of my best friends. So honestly, my sexuality has always been a mess, and I haven’t had real loving crushes until after months of freshman year.

Right now I have two crushes, on friends A and G, although my crush on A is dimming back down to 100% platonic feelings though. A month or so ago, I told him how I felt, knowing that he’s straight I knew he wouldn’t feel the same way but I just wanted to let it out because I hate lying to myself and others in general. He acknowledged my feelings and that made me feel heard even though the feeling isn’t mutual, and we’re still super close- I couldn’t ask for a better friend and his happiness/comfort is what matters most. He means so much to me, he’s such a dork and always makes me laugh, whenever he’s feeling down I want to be there for him, I want to watch him grow and whenever he shows me his new art pieces I can’t help but beam at his improvement, even if he can’t see it. I hate it when he puts himself down, because he’s genuinely an amazing person. Even now still, sometimes I wish I could kiss him on the forehead and just hug him for reassurance.

I think I’m starting to have a crush on G, but I really don’t know for sure. We’ve been friends ever since middle school and he’s always been a little brother to me (we’re a year apart, I’m older than him.) It’s so weird that I’m slowly starting to see him differently. He has a girlfriend now, and I 100% support their relationship and I’m so happy for them, they seriously deserve the best. If they get married, I wanna be the first to cheer them on. But idk there’s just something about him that always makes me smile, whenever I get the chance to call him I instantly go for it, I really love his voice and it always makes me visibly melt, he’s so understanding, has the cutest personality, and would even take time out of his nights sometimes to read bedtime stories to me over calls. Sometimes I get a little jealous of his girlfriend lmao. Sometimes I wish I could straight up hold his hand, kiss his cheek, or whatever. Is it weird that I 100% support their relationship and wish the best for them, even though I feel this way?

Do I actually have a crush on him?, or am I just bored because friend A rejected me and I’m just unconsciously turning to the next best friend I’m closest with? For the record, I kiss almost all my friends on the cheeks/foreheads, lean on them or lay on their laps, because that’s how I feel most comfortable with showing affection.",07Oct2020,1

I’m yet to get my study loan for August and September, thanks to idiots at the college telling the agency I hadn’t quit which is not true I’m out of money till next month.

I’m at a loss, I don’t know what to do, I can’t continue this job and probably destroy my health. At the same time I can’t quit because of the obvious money issues.

354,"(This is related to my previous post on this sub-reddit, I'll give a basic rundown but if you need more context feel free to quickly check it out)
(Also, my brothers room is right next to mine, and his gaming computer is right beside my wall)

My brother (21) keeps gaming online with his friends into the night, which is all well and good save for the fact that he does it on week night's when I have school (F/17), and though I get tired and go to bed at 10.30 pm, I don't end up sleeping until 1.00 - 3.00 am because of how loud he is. It's an ongoing issue which has become increasingly worse in the recent weeks, though it started earlier in the year.

I've tried everything to fix this issue, from playing calming nature sounds on loud to try and drown him out, trying to ignore him, trying to be so tired that it isn't an issue etc. But none of that's worked. Sure, I tell him when I'm going to bed, and each hour after that (If I'm still awake, which yep I am) I'll go back to his room to tell him to be quiet (Usually ranging from 'hey your still really loud, please quieten  down' to 'please dear God shut the fuck up it's 2am and I have school tomorrow' (the latter gets used when the crazy insomnia kicks in)),  but even then asking him or letting him know in advance doesn't work, and I still get a shit sleep. When it gets really bad I have to go and sleep in my mum's room, which usually wakes her up and makes me miss my alarm for school since I leave my phone in my room. 

Recently, I told him last night that I had an exam the next day, which I had to go into school for at 9.30am. I went to bed at 10.30 like usual, and low and behold he was still loud as all Hell. Both mum and I asked him to keep quiet, but he didn't. Later, at 12.00 when I was now wide awake because of the noise, i went back in and cracked it at him, because honestly I'm sick of him not listening, and he said that my exam didn't matter, basically implying that even thought Its important to me, since it's not important to him I'll have to suffer. I didn't end up sleeping until 3.00 am, and today I was so dead that all the questions and numbers seemed to mesh in my brain. Sure I tried to AVOID this problem, but apparently I'm not allowed to sleep when I want to.

Today I asked him if he could at least stop playing at 10 - 11 pm at night on week night's, he said that he shouldn't have to change his life style because of me. Mum got involved, and supported my idea, and also suggested that he could move his computer into the spare room next to his. He said that I should be the one to move rooms (even though it would be counter productive since I'd still be next to his room anyway) and repeated his opinion that he shouldn't have to change his lifestyle, and that I should alter how I sleep, where I sleep, and when I sleep since I'm the one with the problem. He also said that he wasn't being loud at all, and that since he can sleep during loud things, I should be able to too.

He said to me that 'Mum's the King of the house, so anything she says goes', but when she agreed with me he cracked it and said she never supports him. He also said that since I'm still a child, I should be the one who deals with it, despite the fact that I'm in schooling still, prepping for Uni, and that he's the reason I'm having these problems. I went onto him about how bad it's been, but he casually interrupted and said that he zoned out, wasn't listening, and won't agree to my suggested compromise. He told me 'we'll talk about this later', but i stood my ground and said no. I told him I won't leave until he agrees, so he did. Then he told mum that he was lying.

Am I in the wrong? Is it wrong of me to ask someone to change their lifestyle because it's directly affecting the quality of sleep (and by extension, life) I have? Am I being unreasonable, or is he? Damn it I just want to go to sleep when I'm tired, and not have to stress each time I try to. I can normally sleep through noise, even people talking if their distant enough, but even if my brother speaks at normal volume, I can still hear him through the walls, especially if it's quiet at night. Even after everything that's happened today, he's just started playing again, and even though I'm in the lounge room at the front of the house (his rooms at the back) I can still hear him. 

Please give me advice on what I should do in this situation, I'm so tried of this, and honestly I don't know what to do. I feel like I've tried everything, and I'm even ready to turn to holistic methods, like spells and stuff. I'm already not coping with other things in life, and the interruptions in my sleep schedule are making them worse. Truly I'm ready to explode, and cry. I'll be going back to in-person school next week, so I'll have to get up earlier than I already do, so it's gonna get worse I'm guessing.

TL;DR - honestly I'm not sure how I can summarise this more than I already have",07Oct2020,1

356,"Zoom University has really gotten me thinking as of late.

I've been debating withdrawing for the remainder of the semester because these online classes feel like a waste of time where I am not learning and my professors are struggling to teach and I cannot work on other self-improvement things to the extent I would like, and this internal debate has carried over to whether or not college itself is worth it.

Arguments for college:  
\-There are some upper-level careers in my field that pay incredibly well that require a degree and 5 years of experience.  
\-It's a good time for self-exploration.

Arguments against college:  
\-I'm studying in a relatively new field and sometimes feel as though I either already know more than my professors are teaching me or could find out the same or more information via a quick google search  
\-I passed up the chance to apply to a job this past Summer at a company I really like, practically a dream job, that I was already fully qualified for that would've allowed me to work remotely and paid $68k, with the opportunity for upward mobility. I did so because everyone around me encouraged me to prioritize my education. Now I'm regretting it.  
\-There are other jobs I'm more passionate about that have the opportunity for higher pay and wouldn't necessarily require a degree. They'd certainly be risky and incredibly competitive, but so then would be those upper-level jobs in my field that *do* require a degree, and although I thought university would be good for connections, so far the career fairs my school has had have been utterly useless to me. None of the companies have been a good fit or even slightly the type of company I'd want to apply to work at.

I know that there's something to be said for buckling down, nose to the grindstone, and getting through or even excelling in academics. Pre-COVID I had a 3.7 GPA and really enjoyed studying. However, although my perspective could be naive... if my career options are risky whether or not I get a degree, why not take the remainder of the semester off to avoid wasting my time on the direct equivalent of watching educational YouTube videos and try to build career skills elsewhere instead? Hell, if an opportunity arises, why not just leave university altogether and work in my ideal career field if the pay is good? 

Most friends and professionals I've spoken to have encouraged the idea of withdrawing for at least the remainder of the semester, but my parents have presented the alternate perspective that sticking it out would make me more resilient. There's also a difference of opinion between ""Life is short, take a bit of time off from college while it's a dumpster fire to focus on passions and building career skills"" and ""Life is short, speedrun college as much as you can so that you can move on to Real Life sooner"".

Im 15 nearly 16, and my life is in fucking shambles, im speaking to a therapist on Thursday  I officially have no friends (either on their terms or mine) and I hate society, I know I sound emo.

Im doing my gcses right now, or at least studying for 
them, and I hate everything to do with it, the idea of getting a family, the idea of getting a desk job, the idea of growing old and having kids, i hate it with all of my being.
I hate the idea of higher education as well, im not dumb or anything like that, I do about average in school maybe a bit more, I just hate the whole thought process, my life so far has been shit so wasting more of my life doesn't sound like a good idea.

I officially have no friends, they took the piss outta me for 3 years calling me everything under the sun (incriminating shit mostly) I know its a joke, I can take a joke, but I'm struggling mentally and so I thought it would be a good idea to miss a day (Friday) of school and reset at the weekend, so what do they do? Send videos making fun of me, look i know its a joke but the day i stopped going, I was silent, I didnt say a word or do anything and they still took the piss out of me, they had no fucking respect for me whatsoever, so I wasn't mad at them but I decided homeschooling would be a better option so I could feel better mentally.
Cut to them having a go at me making me feel like a bad guy because im off school????
I just can't be asked with them so I delete my insta and snap (which I normally don't use) and its funny they spoke to me in a snap group chat thats months old which I was never even invited to, and when I'm finally invited its onlt to argue????? Im so nice to them, like im not being naraccistic and calling myself nice, because im a cunt, but to them, I never made jokes or tried to hurt their feeling because last time that happened we weren't friends.

And on a final note im depressed, my life is shit, always has been shit, my sister whoes my best friend moved out a couple weeks ago, my mum has cancer, we have no money, and im just really struggling, i dont do anything at all, I just watch YouTube, eat junk food and go to bed, I've tried to help myself but I feel like its impossible, I have no motivation, no drive, no hobbies etc
I just feel so fucking lonely, like society isn't for me.
I just feel so confused about my life, so, I considered joining the royal marines, or the british army, Im not fit or anything I dont eat healthy food, im a pathetic person  dont get me wrong, but something just seems right, I've seen videos and shit, it looks tough but I still have it in my mind, I wanted to be a police officer then an artist, but now I wanna join the royal marines.
I gonna start going to the gym just in case I really do wanna go, but I feel like ill fail straight away, I know I can push myself but at the same time my lifes in shambles.
I dont know if I should even join, I dont know if I should even try and lose my virginity before hand (not that I like people anyway) I dont know if I should try six form or college,
Im lost, I just need some advice.

Recently I have had a change in thought and mindset, optimism I guess, which has made me change my perspective on life quite a bit. Beside the point, though I don't think I will ever be 100% cured, my life has never felt better. I cannot remember my life ever feeling like this. Contempt? In-fact, I get excited thinking about waking up the next day and how I can productively fill my day. I don't know if this feeling will last long but damn. I am definitely enjoying the ride. 

The problem now is my relationship with my best friend for 4 years. We have practically grown up together and I expect to be friends with her for more years to come. While I have mentally progressed positively, I see her struggling. I don't know if before we were both miserable and so I didn't see, but I can see how her mental health is completely deteriorated. She is in a recent toxic relationship with her boyfriend. I see it as they are each others punching bags. They both emotionally and physically abuse each other and I see how much it is taking a toll on my friend. She is self-harming again and though I want to be there for her and console her, I can't help but have many things in my mind. I feel like I am an extremely ""fix the situation"" person when people come to me with their problems. We are both terrible at emotions and she often tells me how cringe and how it pisses her off when people tell her things like ""It'll get better"" and all that stuff. I don't know how to console so I tell her to break up with her boyfriend but then gets angry at me, I tell her please stop self harming and she tells me that she's numb and can't control it. (which I understand and can sympathise) She tells me VERY often when we meet that ""oh I was really about to kms last night"". Dead Serious. Before I would laugh and she would to and brush it off but now I feel like she really might. She sends me photos of her crying and I don't know how to reply to it. 

I used to relate to her and felt fine but now I feel like I am getting the life sucked out of me. Every time we meet I hear her talk about how she punched her boyfriend in the face and her showing me her bruises from him. She comes to me crying about her boyfriend is telling her to kill herself but get extremely defensive when I tell her that is not ok and should break up with him immediately. I used to feed into her stories and we would laugh and joke about this. Now I feel like my heart shatters every time she tells me this kind of stuff and sets me back into the head-space I was in before. She low key guilt trips me when I kinda dry talk her so she doesn't keep telling me this stuff and says things like ""This is why I never tell you anything because you don't even care"". I care. I feel so heart broken when she tells me this stuff and that's why I don't want her to keep putting her self in this situation and crying about it later to me. It's damaging for everyone but I would never break this relationship because of how long we are friends for and even if we do. We all have same friend groups so I would inevitably be with her till graduation. 

FINALLYYYYY. My question is - How do I maintain happiness in this situation as well as keep our friendship healthy. How can I better this situation. Just give me anything you got.",07Oct2020,1
362,"Ive known Mark (not real name) for a couple of years and we used to talk and joke with each other a lot. About a year ago, he started hanging out with a bunch of people who have been stalking/harrassing me for a very long time now. Then he started making all kinds of uncomfortable jokes based on what the stalkers were telling him, stuff like how i always eat raw chicken and other crazy stuff. It didnt seem like he was doing it on purpose to hurt me and I tried to not let it bother me.

A couple of months later, I noticed that Mark wouldn't talk and joke with me anymore. He stopped responding to anything I said, yet he seemed fine when talking and joking with others. I asked a couple of his friends in private if they had noticed anything different about Mark, whether any big events happened in his life, whether he was busy, stuff like that, but they all said nope, he seemed perfectly normal to them and he was still talking and hanging out with them like normal. And I could see he was playing games like usual.

Tried sending Mark some messages in private to see if anything was wrong. He only replied with a few short sentences. He would only say nothing was wrong and claimed to not receive notifications when I sent him messages. When I tried to help him troubleshoot the problem, he suddenly stopped responding and wouldnt talk about it anymore. I suspect he was making up an excuse for not responding to my messages.

I waited a couple of months to see if anything would change. Nope. I tried talking to him again and basically said hey, tell me what the problem is, we can work things out, if you dont want to talk about it, at least let me know instead of leaving me hanging, etc.

The only reply he would give was a vauge one sentence reply that didnt answer anything. And he never bothered responding after that.

Tried giving him a few more months of space. Saw that he was talking and joking with some people so I tried to say hi and stuff. He didnt reply.

I suspect the stalkers have convinced him that he should avoid me because all of this started shortly after he started hanging out with them. This is something they have done in the past, they would start hanging out with my friends and then a few months later, they would suddenly cut off all contact with me, no explanation at all, and none of our mutual friends would have any idea what happened.

Any advice?",07Oct2020,1
363,How can I live with this piece of shit in our house?,07Oct2020,1
364,"Back story:

In 2014, during some troubling times in our marriage, my then wife and I got into an argument at a command function (is recently found out she was having an affair). We were both active duty military. I was accused of being verbally abusive (I said something like, “fuck you, go hang out with your boyfriend), and forcibly removed from my home. I accepted it, we were going through a bad time, I lost my temper. I learned from it. After about a week, they determined it was a marital dispute and it was over and I was back in my house. 

One day (less than a week later) while my family was visiting, I found her looking at naked pictures upstairs on her phone. When she set her phone down, I picked it up and she tackled me into the bed - hitting her shin on on the lip of our Ikea malm bed. I realize none of this was healthy. I subsequently find out that the person who reported our initial fight was someone she was sleeping with. 

Fast forward to two days later, we are in the midst of what appears to have been 3 affairs. I’m sleeping one night, my family is still in town, and I’m woken up with a gun to my head - she’d gone through my phone as I was sleeping and found a text message where I’d told a female friend (absolutely platonic) about her affairs and that we were getting a divorce. She chased me downstairs with the gun, and my mom and sister called the police. By the time the police arrived, she’d put the gun down and I’d loaded the firearms into a bag and put them in my car. I told the police she was threatening herself, I’d taken all guns out of the house, we were leaving, and they left. Me and my family went to a hotel for the rest of their stay. 

I come back to base, and I’m accused of some form of physical abuse and once again removed from my home. My then wife pretended to have no idea who accused me of hurting her, and claimed that she was telling the truth - I’d never hit her, shoved her, pushed her, etc.... 

We were required to go to marital counseling, where I never talked about anything that was going on. It didn’t matter, I’d previously came to work with a black eye (she found porn on my phone), she told her friends she was going to kill me (this was the first time she pointed a gun at my head)... I didn’t want to get her in trouble. 

Fast forward, I’m out of my home for about 10 months, we go to marital counseling for about 8 months. Never got anywhere because I couldn’t say anything about what was actually happening without subjecting her to punishment. At the end, I was telling our marital counselor in a private session that he has no idea what’s actually happening, but I’m not abusive and I’ve never laid a hand on her, I have no idea who said I did or ever had. He said to me something to the effect of “if she wasn’t saying you’d abused her, do you really think your command would still have you out of your home?” It wasn’t until then that I realized she was the one intentionally keeping me out of my home. She wanted me gone so she could pursue her new relationships without the obstacle of a husband. 

At that point, we had decided on divorce and we ceased marital counseling. I later found out (from my immediate SNCO) that the physical abuse I was accused of was a bruise on her leg... the one she got when she hit her shin on the lip of our bed. I got out of the military, she did also about 2 days before me. 

We had just bought a house before all this happened, so I went to home across the country for about 2 months before returning and staying in our finished basement while enrolled at a university about an hour away. She was dating. We were separated. Once I got to school, I started dating a woman (that I’m marrying this month). 

It got to a point where my now ex wife was threatening her, and refusing to allow me to leave the house, or starting altercations about how I am “breaking up our family...” After my previous experience, I realized I needed to protect myself in the event that she lied again... So I began recording anything that resembled a confrontation. At one point, she was mad about something and tried to call police and tell them I was refusing to leave the house. In reality, I’d recorded the entire interaction - which included her shoving me as I was trying to exit out the front door. She was arrested, charged, and convicted of domestic violence. 

I stayed in the house, I had nowhere else to go being 4000 miles from nearest relative, and enrolled in grad school in the state. Despite the charges, it didn’t stop. My soon to be wife had to contact campus police, who barred my ex from coming to campus. One night, she started another confrontation about how I was ruining our family, and climbed on top of me. I was, once again, recording. This time I called the police, and with the recording of our confrontation and me repeatedly asking her to get off of me, she was arrested, charged, and convicted again. I spent 1 more month in the house, before I was able to leave and rent an apartment. 

She was dating another service member (while married to another, it’s consensual) until about a month ago... when it ended abruptly, which is great, my daughter hates him. But I noticed a lot of similarities in what she was doing to him, compared to what she did to me. It was really abrupt, and suddenly she was done. She’s told his command he was abusive to have him removed, and he was. I suspected she’d found a new boyfriend, and wanted him out of the way. She just told me last Friday she has a new boyfriend. On Monday, I found out that her now ex boyfriend was arrested and charged with strangulation and abduction that occurred in February and July of this year, respectively. 

Knowing what i went through, and how willing she is to lie to meet her own goals, I’m considering reaching out to this guys defense team to tell them of my experience. He has three kids, a now ruined military career, and I’m worried he could hurt himself. 

I’m worried that he could be innocent, based on my experience. But at the same time, if she really was abused, I don’t want my experience to invalidate her real abuse at his hands. 

What would you do?

Tl/dr: My abusive ex wife has previously lied about abuse to get me removed so she can explore a new relationship. She is now accusing her most recent boyfriend of abuse, and conveniently has a new relationship. He’s in jail right now on two felonies. I’m worried that he may be innocent. Should I do anything or just let it play out in court and stay neutral?",07Oct2020,1
365,"I’m pretty new at this whole relationship thing, so sorry if this sounds dumb. I’ve always been told that you have to flirt with a girl (I’m a dude), let them know you’re into them, talk to them and text them a for a bit, and THEN ask them out.

If there’s a girl that I’m interested in, but we’ve only been friends, is it strange to just ask her to hang out with me straight up? I mean no starting with flirting or the whole “I like you” thing, I mean just letting them know you’re interested by actually asking them out. For instance, a girl who’s been my friend for a year or two, but we’ve never, you know, “been together”, and I just ask if she wants to catch a movie or something about of the blue, will she be weirded out?

I’m just sort of tired of all the dumb drama that goes along with this stuff, the whole “you have to talk to them about deep stuff before you become a couple” thing. Can’t you just pull a move like from the movies where you just ask them out without being super close?",07Oct2020,1

368,"New here so please bare with me. I give NO permission for any of this to be shared outside reddit. 

Okay so me (21) and bf(19) have been together for 4 years. There's issue with his mom side (his parents split) when it comes to me. We don't like each other. (Shes have fucked him up emotionally and mentally ans financially before he could even start. But atlas another story for another day) So for the last year and a half hes lived away from our hometown. In March he moved back to be more involve qith his healthy family and me. While he lived away I would visit said family, and his cousin (7f) liked me alot! But now that he lives her she freaking mean! I understand she's a kid, i understand she's now probably jealous. But some things she says and does feel weird. My bf plays favorites, and he favotites her. Like he will buy her 3 toys and the smaller kids who can't really grasp things only one ans they cry when they see her getting more toys. I've talked to him how that isnt fair and it falls on deaf ears. Okay. Not my family, i will juat buy thr smaller ones extra things qhen we buy for them pr no one gets anything. But the other day me and bf fought. She LIVED for it. Like she had a shit eating grin because i told him no we weren't going to use my car to go buy them snacks and him ice cream juat for the little ones to feel like crap because 7 y/o WILL brag to thier faces about them. Idk its like she LOVES seeing them cry. And the little ones are 2y and under with high pitch crys. After a good 10 minutes it starts hurting the head. But she loves it. But again I chose not to invole myself. I only spoke up when she hit the youngest super hard for no reason! I've had to take my bf brother and his 11 m baby to the er because 7 y/o waited till 11m step on a pillow to yank the pillow from under him and he fell on tile floor!! 

So my issue lately is that I just get rubbed off wrong and idk if ita a me thing. Me and bf were going into his room to talk about an issue we were having and she tells my bf not to close the door. He says he is and she tells him she's gonna walk in to watch what we are doing or look through his windows to look at us. Qhen he tried to laugh it off she said she will be listening. Than when we closed the door she kept trying to get in. Bf told her mom but I still found it super weird and ever since I've been on edge. My bf will literally ignore me qhen I walk into his room for his game but will acknowledge her when she goes in right behind me and sits next to him on the bed. (Hes done this only once and I told him I didn't appreciate that crap) shw will stand between us to talk to him and him alone when we both are sitting at the table. She flushed his mask down the toilet because she thought wr were going to the store together!

Now shes trying to be like me. Wearing hair in a high pony tail with the braid covering the rubber band. Switching hair styles to double braids if i have double braids. I was making the dogs a cute little foam hat for pictures she made a paper hat and when everyone walked away told me hers were prettier. (Didn't really care she is 7) she even said i hit her and left a bruise on her arm! And when my bf caught her lie (she said her mom gave her a shot and the bruise went away) she just laughed! I recently got a bunny,  now she wants one so ""he will like me more"" 

Im sorry for long post but am I tripping? Is it me?  Is this normal? I feel like im going crazy and I remind myself she's a kid but at the same time I'm like uhhhhhh. What should I do?",07Oct2020,1

374,"We have a pretty solid relationship, more so than other people we know. We like a lot of the same stuff and have cute traditions. We fell in love FAST, he said it just a month into dating.  We traded V cards and were annoyingly happy to everyone else for a long time.

 Sexual incompatibility is a bit of an issue. He wants to try anal, eating my ass, finishing on my face etc, I'm boring and like normal penis/vagina and oral sex. He reassures me it's OK if I never want these things but I feel super guilty about it. I've never orgasmed despite him going down on me for 30 minutes maybe 10 times in the last 2 years. I've lost interest in sex with him in the last 3ish months, probably cos I had a bad infection and he kept asking me was I ready to have sex yet every time we hung out, it got really annoying (sex hurt so I had to stop for a few weeks).  I also struggle to get past his incest kink he had as a teen. He still thinks it's OK that he read erotica about full blooded siblings for years? But he doesn't have a sister so I guess it isn't *that* bad? Still disturbs me. 

Then there's his friends. I got along pretty well with them initially but I was younger then. They haven't matured at all and act like high school girls, always causing drama and making my BF the scapegoat. One of them called me a stupid ""B"" to my face because my BF wouldn't walk to class with him 10 minutes early, because he wanted to wait till I was done my soup? To be fair, my BF said that wasn't OK and the ""friend"" tried to pretend it was a joke, but didn't apologise. He is also a really picky eater. He won't eat anything with onions or peppers or a salad, so we can't eat in a lot of places I want to. What makes me really sad is on 2 occasions he went for a meal with his ""boys"" at 2 different restaurants I always wanted to go to. When I got upset, he said he doesn't get the deal with eating out and only really likes it with his boys but does it with me to be nice?. 

I feel like repeated COVID local lockdowns has caused some of this. My mental health is at an all time low and I'm super anxious and negative, which might explain this. I went 8 weeks without seeing him at the start of summer because of lockdown and since then (June to now) I only saw him 2/3 days a week because we have no college. We used to see each other every single day in college so we have way less time together for the last 7 months and next 10, until college opens again.

376,"So in the last month or so a few things have happened. 

After the last event I started to get evidence of my dad and stepmoms abuse towards me and my siblings, I hadn't gotten much until one morning I was arguing with my brother. I was switching clothes from the washer to the dryer and went to grab more laundry from my room, I came back to my brother trying to out clothes in, but explained to him I was still doing laundry, I was in a time crunch and couldn't wait because he will restart his clothes multiple times over to avoid folding them, or will straight up leave them in the washer. I tried to convince him to wait until I was done but he wouldn't listen, so I called dad to mediate. Dad told him to wait his turn, and I thought that was the end of it, 15 minutes later he called back yelling becuase my brother was yelling on the phone. He told me to take my wet clothes out of the washer, and wash them at my moms place, I told him i wouldnt be able to take any clother to moms becuase i already have clothes there but he wouldnt budge. He then came home, and threw them in a bucket full of concrete and rocks and told me i couldnt take them at all. I asked him if i could leave before things escalated and he called my mom, proceeded to change his mind twice, his final excuse being ""Im not gonna let you win."" I ended up leaving without much and met my mom downtown, who i stayed with until she could legally pick my siblings up at the start of her visitation time. My dad tried to pretend like nothing had happened. I had planned to go to a shelter then stay with friends until i turned 18 (i have about 9 months left) but ended up going back to dads after he and my mom started talking about letting my stay at her place for a bit. 

Within the same two weeks of that happening, My brother got in trouble after shooting my stepmom with a nerfgun, and she decided to take his door back off, (i dont remember if i had mentioned it, but we dont have doors, dad and stepmom had gotten into a huge argument over giving them back that resulted in us leaving, but coming back and getting new doors) i was in the bath as this happened, but she ended up stabbing my brother with the screwdriver (thankfully didnt injure him) and hitting him in the leg with a mallet, which left a large bump that turned into a bruise. My dad was at work, but gave my brother a mouthful about it, and made him apologize, my brother went on to ask him why we are treated this way, which resulted in dad being super pissed. The next night at work my brother shows up with my mom to tell me that dad had stepped on his foot so he couldnt get away from him, and started throwing him around. My brother called the police, and DCS got involved about three days ago. Me and my brother are currently staying with Mom, and my other two siblings are at dads. I feel like shit leaving them there and i can tell they are upset being stuck there. My mom is trying to figure out custody with dad, but we already know its not going to end well and she will be going to court soon. Suprisingly DCS didnt take us, we have all been interviewed and dad and stepmom lied saying my brother has threatened to beat her up mulitple times. I told them everything but i already knew they couldnt help us. 

I had to delete all the evidence off my phone after dad went through it, apparently he was watching when DCS interviewed me and wanted to make sure i wasnt recording any evidence against him. He yelled at me all the way to work, told me i was ungrateful and that our mom did nothing for us. Things are steady right now but i cant garuntee how long that will last as dad is controlling my every move, if i want to stay with mom i have to do what he says.

379,"Back in the old days of yore, when I was in my earlier teenage years, I would play Halo all day and I loved it. I cared whether the team won or lost, but I didn’t care enough to get angry about it. I especially didn’t care about how well or poorly I was playing. I just got on with it and had blind fun. I don’t know what’s changed, maybe that I can’t help but be really bothered about my K/D ratio nowadays, but most of my sessions of the game nowadays end with me cursing at the screen and shutting the game off in a rage. 

I don’t know if it’s because I took a pretty long break and I’m just not used to it anymore, or if I’m more competitive that I used to be, but I just can’t help but get so angry at it. I keep thinking, I used to be good at this, or at the very least I used to not care that much. I can’t help but call things bullshit or stupid when I can’t get a kill that I feel like a should have easily gotten. I know that the stress isn’t good for me and that I most likely should just stop playing if it makes me angry, but I like the game and I desperately want to be able to play it without getting angry. I want to be able to die in the game and just shrug it off like it’s nothing. 

I overcame a similar issue with the dark souls series up until a certain point. Bloodborne made me love hard games. I beat TLOU2 on the hardest difficulty and loved every second of it, so it’s not like I’m adverse to hard games. I feel like I should be able to just shrug it off. I’m also worried that maybe the stress in my work life that I’m not venting is making it worse, maybe because I can yell curse words at my screen and face no consequences, whereas I have to keep a lid on it when I’m in public. 

I’m really worried about myself and I know I should just stop playing the game and save myself the stress, but I want to be able to enjoy it like the good old days. I want to be able to not take it seriously and just have fun with it. Has anyone else ever had this issue and been able to overcome it? Does anyone have any techniques for how to stay calm in that sort of situation?",07Oct2020,1
380,"So at age 22 my sister had a great job, she was making great money doing what she loved, she kept that job for 6 years, till we were 28, and ever since then she hadn’t done anything with her life.

Now she’s 31 and has no money, and for the last year or so she’s also become really easy on the trigger when it comes to getting mad and loud.

Like we NEVER used to shout at each other and now every time we meet up or talk over the phone and I say something she doesn’t 100% agree with, she’ll snap and yell at me, like dude wtf? We’re twins, it’s us against everyone else, why are you yelling at me?

And when I try to confront her about yelling at me she’ll blame me for acting or saying whatever.

Like two weeks ago she appeared at my apartment uninvited with her messy dog, ate my food, slept with a fancy t shirt I use for dates that she took from my closet without asking, and when I made us coffee she got mad at me for making the kind I like and not the kind she likes, and she threw my coffee in the sink.

 She was really getting out of line, and she knew that, but she’ll never apologise to me about anything, so she actually sent me a message later explaining why I made her yell at me! Lol!

Now she’s really bitter about everything, she fights with everyone about stupid bs, she doesn’t work and it no longer even seems like she even wants to find a job.

She doesn’t have any money left and when she’ll soon ask me for money (has happened in the past) I don’t want to give her anything cause I know she’ll just use it to get weed or whatever.

I really care about her and she is seriously wasting her life, and any hint of advice I’ll try to give her will result in her yelling at me to mind my own fucking business.

We don’t have parents, our dad died from cancer when we were 20, and our mom is a crazy bitch that we both ran away from at different times of our lives.

I know it's best to just move on and let it go, but my body doesn't feel the same way. My fight or flight response rages no matter what I do. It's also difficult to let it go knowing that the people that made fun of me still get together and make jokes about me.

Just to clarify, I have a therapist with whom I'm getting treatment, I don't expect my employer to fill that role. I just don't want him to feel like I'm cheating him out of my paycheck by taking time off to deal with my issues, but I also feel like I'm cheating him by keeping quiet about what I know is impairing my job performance.

Theres this girl at my school that i became friends with at a school frieldtrip. After that we met a few times and went on partys and stuff like that. Recently she has started sending me alot of hearts and weird texts. For example she once told me she was in her bed naked and told me I could come over. Now before you scream at me why tf Im even posting here, how obviouse can she be, Im a shy guy, mainly because Im fucking ugly, and after she tells me stuff like that, she just ignores me or plays it down as a joke or something like that Also I think she was a little drunk that night. So Im really not sure what to do. I think I like here and Id be down for a realationship, but Im really not sure wether or not I should like ask her out or just straight up tell her. I dont want to loose her as a friend because of my paranoid ass. If you got any advice feel free to respond. Thanks in advance!! Have a great day :) !",07Oct2020,1

I (15) recently sent in a self tape to a reputable acting school, auditioning for a scholarship for some of their classes. I got the regular ""thanks for your self tape I'm looking forward to reviewing it"" automated email, but today I got a text from the sender of the email (I applied with my contact details obvs) asking if they could call me about my self tape.

Is this a good sign or could they just be calling me to tell me I didn't get the scholarship? I've never had any acting experience and kind of just filmed it on a whim.

I am presentable, polite, obedient and equally confident. Sometimes it feels like things are simply just bad for me.

399,"So just to give a little back story; I (19F) met my friend.... let call her Charlie ( 20F) back in sophomore year of high school (2014). We were friends with popular kids, but we weren't popular ourselves. So we were very drawn to each other and we become close friends quite fast. Everything was quite well up until 2017, I went on a exchange year to study abroad. She made new friends and she started to party a lot. I didn't hear from her for months ( later I found out here phone had been taken away by her parents and she was in BIG trouble).  I still don't really know what happend because I was literally on the other side of the world.

So fast forward to 2018. I came back from my exchange year and I was so ready to meet Charlie's new friends. They were very different from my old friends and I kind of liked that. We went to party's and had fun. So this may be a red flag but they did use drugs (XTC, Molly) and it was all so new and exciting. I did it a few times just because I was curious, but after those experiences  I didn't feel the need to try again. On the other hand, Charlie loved it and did it all the time with her new close friend Lotus. Lotus (F20) is a girl who doesn't go to school and doesn't work, she is nice to me and I even went on vacation with her and Charlie this summer (2020). She isn't really nice to other people tho and there is nothing more I hate then selfish and gossiping people. But this isn't really relevant to my problem. 

Because of Charlie I met my Boyfriend that I am still dating ( 2 years strong), and I'm so thankful for that because he is really my best friend. We have the same mindset and values. So when I started hanging out with my boyfriend more and more, she started hanging out with Lotus more and more. I talked to her about it a lot, making sure I was still spending time with her as well. Still following it? I will get to my point in a minute don't worry! Fast forward to Last week.

Sadly Charlie lost her job due to Coronavirus ( she worked full time &amp; doesn't go to school anymore). And suddenly she has gone COMPLETELY nuts. So she is still very very close friends with Lotus and all the other friends from 2018. I kind of distanced myself from them bc I didn't like that they did so much drugs and they just weren't my kind of people if that makes sense. BTW I'm in college ( junior year) and currently working as a intern so my life is quite busy. She on the other hand, lost her job. And for the past months I've been getting snapchats from Charlie and Lotus getting absolutely shitfaced every  fucking day. Ketting kicked out of bars and fighting with people. I DO NOT like this at all, and at that point I did not wanna be associated with her. But we have been friends for 6 years and I wanted to talk to her, you know like real adults. So this weekend I decided to meet up with her to get some drinks at a restaurant. I met her at the busstation and noticed immediately something was up. She was talking so quick and walking like she was drunk. So we sat down at the restaurant and started talking, well she started talking. About her wild parties, an her new amazing ""radical"" life. She talked about her self and her new friends for like 15 minutes before asking me anything  (we hadn't seen each other in 1,5 months fyi) . I told her I was happy with my new internship and I was still dating my boyfriend. She asked me weird questions like; don't you miss your single life and do you really see a future with your boyfriend. Knowing damn well that I don't like the single life and that im super happy with my boyfriend. I felt like I was talking to a wall, she was barely listening. She ordered some strong spirits (3) while I was still sipping on my Rose and I got worried. I asked if she was ok and she told me she never felt better. I asked her if she was drunk, because I really got that impression. She told me she drank 3 beers and 2 gin tonics before meeting me with some ex coworkers. So yeah she was pissed. She also told me she likes to see the judgement in people's eyes when they poor her a drink?????? whatever that means.........

When I got home I felt very confused. Do I still wannabe friends with her? Not really, not after what happend the last few weeks. But how do I handle this? Its so obvious something is wrong and she uses drinking an partying as an escape but she doesn't tell me anything. I don't want to abandon her right now but at he same time im so done with this bullshit and it's definitely not helping with my anxiety disorder :(. how do I break up with a friend in need, a friend I've known for so long.

Thing is she hurt me badly in the past several times but I forgave her and compromised.

This time even it was her mistake she blamed me and left me. I begged her so many times as I don't have any friends which are that close. I was so addicted talking to her. I was so alone in my college and at home and she was the only one that called me. Simply put she's the only person I've talked to since an year

But there's no way she's coming back. I'm also angry at her but still want to talk with her. She hurt me so bad but I still wanna be with her. Part of my mind is saying move on but another part is saying to hold on.

I am going through living hell. I can't concentrate on anything. I don't know how to move on. It's just killing me. I can't even express how badly I miss her but I want to move on. Please help me🙏

Hey guys, this is a throwaway account but I am still new to reddit in general. If this is the wrong place to put it let me know and I'll delete 
I just want to preface that I'm sorry if this is a ramble, I suck at words and getting my point across in a precise manner. This will be long.
This is the first time I've really spoken about this, so it's hard

I need help understanding how to make friends essentially and if it's me that's fundamentally wrong, and how I can improve myself.
Backstory, sorta,
I've had a crap life, and in short I never got a childhood, I never learnt the social dynamics between people and what social cues are the norm. I've always been a loner and introvert and I'm happy with that. But sometimes I do feel lonely like I'd love to have long meaningful friendships.
Ive found over the years people come and go so easy. When I think I've made a close friend and we chat heaps it always drops off, too the point where it's 1 week and then nothing for months.
I message people asking how they are going, and how they are. I leave it for days so I'm not bothering people. But I just have found it's always me who has to engage in conversation and start the conversation.
People always mention how they miss me and how we should catch up, it'll be on twitter, twitch etc and I'll respond back saying yea of course message me when with your free time and let's catch up
Or they'll say that we should have a game soon to catch up and again I say message me your free time cause I'm available whenever. And it's nothing, I never hear anything. It makes feel unwanted and maybe to them I am
I'm getting sick of always being the one to engage in conversation to be the one who starts. Or should I be reading between the lines?
Is it all face value and they don't wanna hang out? Are they actually friends or just acquaintances?

I started twitch streaming as I have always wanted to do something in the gaming industry and felt I wasn't smart enough to do YouTube, and Twitch is all live. On the upside I thought it would help me get out and socialise.
I started out small and made some mates, then I used Facerig as I was uncomfortable with showing myself.
Over time I grew bigger and more confident made friends and was so much happier.
I was interacting with people making connections, this whole socialising thing was fun, then I was picked as a Ubisoft Star Player and I was on a high. I learnt how to photoshop and edit YouTube videos, I was so proud of myself, I got more confident showing myself and it was great.
Until one of my ""friends"" started playing mind games. I don't really know what happened tbh she was a streamer to and bigger than me, and was my first close friend when introduced to the real world.
She was the first person I was close to when introduced back to socialising. Which is why I think it's hit me hard.

She started being very manipulative, and controlling. It was all about her. To the point she stopped talking to me one weekend after multiple attempts at trying to say hey and is everything ok, I left it to give her space.
I ended up doing things with some new people I met only to be yelled at, at the end of the weekend for ""moving on"" from her and how I failed the test as she wanted to see what I'd do when she wasnt talking to me.
She would always yell at me saying I was trying to show her up, when I honestly wasn't, I don't care about numbers, I just wanted to socialise and do what I love, I just wanted friends tbh. 
Long story short she drove me to the point of me wanting to end it. I just couldn't take it. I wanted to end my life.

After I finally worked up the courage to block her with the help of some people. Everything just stopped, my stream died, people stopped talking to me, and I fell into a year of depression socially. It messed with my mind. Was it her, has she been spreading rumours.
Was it me? Do I just suck? Am I just whining and should shut up? 
It has made me loose confidence. The confidence I grew in myself. I want to give up and run away back to my hole but I know logically I should just keep pushing. Surely it'll get better and I'm trying, doing little bits here and there, but I don't have the will for it anymore. And that's what's depressing. Streaming for me was my go to. My stress reliever and something I would look forward to after a long day at work. Gaming has always been my escape. But it's made me so jaded. 
I don't think I'm a bad person, I always try to help people where I can and do good, I'm someone who will always put others over myself. Someone who loves to help people as I've been through so much so I have a better understanding of most situations. But sometimes I wonder.
I know it's a negative way of thinking but when people don't respond or I just can't seem to keep friends in general, apart of me wonders logically out of all those cases it has to be me statistically.
I dunno what to do or how to do it.
I be myself, but I feel like it's not enough.

In a tldr way. How to I keep and maintain friendships? How do I know they are genuine?
Am I wrong in this?
I genuinely want to know the bad and good.
I need to know where I am wrong
Thank you for your time
I'm sorry this was long",07Oct2020,1
424,"Technically there are three friends involved; we can call them “A” “B” and “C”.

Person A is self harming. Person B has a little talk with Person A. 

Person B questions if the rest of us care about person A. C insists that they care about A. Person B tells Person C that Person A may be self harming as a cry for help, as Person A likely feels unloved. 
B suggests that they should try being nicer to Person A. 

C storms off and gets mad at Person A, accusing them of doing it for attention.

I have a best friend, but he isn't the best person. I like him, but it makes me uncomfortable because of these reasons

•He isn't a very nice person sometimes, and I don't wanna put up with a different personality thats fake(he does that with people he dates)

•I already dated him and it made us stop talking for awhile when we split up

•He prefers Polyamorous relationships, and I  feel uncomfortable in those and I want to avoid him not feeling comfortable 

•He often does some really stupid shit and hurts people 

•He has 3 crushes?! (Me, my best friend which he never talks to, and a girl i don't know)

•He one time told me he liked me and got a girlfriend the next day

•He gets another girl as soon as he breaks up with one(its like he pulls women out of his ass😤)

•I feel extremely upset everytime he does the reason above and he never seems to think that I do...

•He had a full on crush on a girl while with me


That's the reasons, probably uh.. too many, but you know.

431,"Three months ago, I started working at McDonald’s. It was going okay, I’m pretty clumsy so that’s a bit of an issue but other wise it’s alright. Until one month ago when a new guy started. He learnt super fast and has now started doing OT which is drive thru. OT is a station I still have to learn and seeing him do it before me has bought out so much insecurity and jealousy. I’ve been there two months longer than him but he’s doing OT all the time now and I haven’t been offered to do it once. I can’t but help but tell myself that it’s because I’m slow. 

No ones ever complained to me telling me i need to be faster and they’ve never complained about anything I’m doing. On one hand I don’t think I’m bad at my job, I get the job done and the orders get out within a small amount of time. On the other hand I feel like I’m too clumsy and rude and slow. I can’t tell if this is facts or just insecurity talking. 

So basically work has been making me so sad recently because seeing the new guy doing OT makes me feel like I’m behind and like I’m not good enough. I’m always thrown onto counter, taking orders even though there’s two newer people than me who are supposed to be doing counter. I don’t feel like I’m trusted to do anything else and this feeds into the not good enough insecurity. Work makes me feel undervalued and like I’m nothing. I don’t know what to do or how to improve the situation. I know I won’t quit but honestly all I want to do is quit my job because I’m crying and feeling like shit about myself all the time since I’ve started there. 

Any advice on how to overcome how horrible work is making me feel? Am I slow and is that why I’m never on OT or is it just a fluke that I haven’t been asked?",07Oct2020,1

433,"In November, my brother is getting married and I’ve decided not to go. It seems terribly irresponsible given current events, and as my family thinks COVID is a hoax, they definitely won’t be wearing masks. I have some underlying health conditions that make COVID a huge risk for me, and I’m terrified of getting it. Even so, I have terrible anxiety about telling them and I keep putting it off.

I have severe agoraphobia and I haven’t actually *met* my future SIL, though we play games together a few times a week online. I promised her earlier this year that I would work really hard on myself to get to place where I could attend, and I meant it. But going was always going to be incredibly hard.

I guess where I’m struggling is that I don’t know where my true reason lies–am I truly not going because the pandemic, or is it just a convenient excuse to avoid something I’ve been dreading for a year?

No matter the reason, I feel like an asshole. Everyone is definitely going to think I’m an asshole because they don’t take COVID seriously and will see it as making excuses. That bothers me way more than it should.

435,"Hi Reddit!

I'm a UK student in my third year who was supposed to be studying in Sweden this year but that has turned into only next semester. Sweden haven't handled the crisis very well and I'm concerned that the classes will be online.


In my mind there is no point in putting so much effort into organising it, the stress of getting there etc only to be stuck in my room with online lectures. I know for a fact that the academic load will be heavier than my current university and I won't have any friends there to help me through it.


I was really excited for my year abroad but all the uncertainty has left me really anxious about going and having a really shitty time. In my mind it was going to be my chance to reinvent myself in a way and meet new people but that doesn't look likely.

I'm now 18, around 2 years ago i found out that the way my family treated me was not normal and it was very toxic. Whenever I meet a person that treats me like a human, the mire I try to hold on to them the faster I lose them but also I feel like I don't deserve them. I've tried suicide 3 years ago and ended up in the hospital. One night while I was sleeping there I woke up but acted like I was sleeping because my mom was talking with the people who were with me in that medical room and she was lying and complaining that I'm fucked up but I act like a victim. Even the people who I didn't know in the hospital were looking at me like I'm a spoiled brat. I've read a lot about psychology, not that that makes an expert but I understand people better. My mother has classic narcissistic personality, my dad always tries to get my mom's attention so he doesn't give a shit about my brother and me (he would beat me up to get her attention, he would beat me up HARD). My mom managed to separate my brother and me, no matter how much I tried to keep good contact with my brother. Now my dad and my brother are like little pets for my mom. Also my dad has the worst hygiene, he always picks his nose, even in front of people. So whenever I touch something I get anxious because I know he or other disgusting person touched it.

I am 23, from the Southeast Asia, and fell into a deep depression right before I was able to get my degree due to being humiliated and forced by the place I went to for my internship to not make it to my graduation rites - which was supposed to have happened in May 2019. 


This threw me off-course severely. I know how much of a disappointment that was to my family, especially when I belong to a family full of talented and awarded people. I haven't been able to get a job at all, and my parents urged me to take a break despite my insistence to get any job I can, which I will forever be grateful for.


Now I'm stuck at home in quarantine, broke, directionless. My passion for graphic design - which is the scope of my degree - is gone. When I try to open Illustrator or Photoshop or any other editing software I used to love spending hours on every day, I feel like vomiting and shake so hard I can't think straight at all. 


So I'd like to ask for advice on what kind of job someone completely inexperienced like me can apply for during this pandemic? Preferrably non BPO work, but am open to suggestions.

448,"I'm at a fork in the road and would like to hear some takes on it.

I am renting an apartment alone 2-3 min. from my work that costs ~$1350 total. I can afford this somewhat comfortably but the rest of my family is struggling during this pandemic. This is causing me to feel guilty as it wasn't long ago that I was the one struggling. But it's been really good for me as an individual as I'm getting to learn more about who I am.

So far I've been giving my family anywhere from $300-500 a month for the past few months and there is a chance this amount goes up if the economy enters a recession. I don't feel bad about this at all and imo this part is non-negotiable.

The dilemma is that I'm getting a strong feeling that I should move back home and start pooling my resources with the family to ensure we all stay above water and don't have to suffer needlessly. But, my quality of life will drop dramatically and I think I can easily regress into a sort of codependence with my family that will affect me for a few years, i.e. I should check with family before I do ___. (even if this isn't true).
I have been dating for many years (long-distance for a bit now) and there is a chance this decision will affect the relationship.

Just wanted to get some outside perspective as the lease is up soon and I have to make a decision.

I have no clue if she is interested in knowing me more but I am kinda into her from what we have talked about. I want to ask her to hang out maybe this weekend but is it too soon? Should I keep trying to make conversation with her? My problem is I just suck at this sort of thing. Any advice? (We are both 17)
 
Thanks",07Oct2020,1
450,"I'd like to preface this by saying I genuinely like my boss and think he's great, I'm just really really mad about this one thing still even though it happened a week ago. 


I normally show up to work 15-20 minutes early. I don't ask to be paid for this time. Occasionally I leave 5-10 minutes early (I'm supposed to leave when everyone else does, so I have to leave early). Even so I rarely leave before I have worked a full 8 hours. 


The last couple of weeks pretty much my entire 17 minute commute has been construction, to the point where I'm sometimes help up for 20 full minutes. This week I've been leaving my house a full 50 minutes before my shift starts and I still barely make it. I've been showing up more like 5 minutes early or right at 9 am. If my coworker is at the reception computer this means I don't really have time to log in before 9, but sometimes she dicks around until after 9 even if I'm there at 8:40. 


Last week I was 15 minutes early Monday and Tuesday, and ended up working 5-10 minutes late both those days (my boss was off sick)  but Wednesday I got held up by construction and was in the building at 9:01. My boss told me I had been ""cutting it close recently"" and I ""need to show up earlier.'


I get zero recognition for almost always being early, I am always willing to switch a shift or stay extra time if I'm asked to, and I don't get paid for anything above my 8 hours unless its actually scheduled. I do get a lot of freedom at work, i can make personal calls if I need to and there's a lot of flexibility, but I usually take 14 minutes worth of breaks total and work through my ""lunch."" And we get to leave an hour early usually 2-3 times a month, without losing an hour of pay. Despite all this I am so so so angry that I was talked to about ""cutting it close"" when the rest of the year I'm in 15 minutes early and its just been a rough couple of weeks, 2 days before I got talked to I was early, and I don't get paid to come in early. I understand being talked to about being 1 minute late (even though I think its kinda garbage bc it might be the first time I've been late in 2 years?) But now that I've been told point blank I /have/ to be there early I'm pissed and I don't want to show up early anymore. It's a courtesy on my part to be showing up 15 minutes early, my job pnly requires the amount of time to prep that it takes to log on to a computer, and I don't get paid for my extra time. I think if I added it up I end up working more than I get paid for even with the free hours. 


Am I being absolutely ridiculous? How do I get over this? Am I being petty? I have cried about it like a big baby twice now because I'm just so frustrated.",07Oct2020,1

453,"Hi all,

I currently work for a large healthcare organization in the laboratory. I basically over see the operations side of the phlebotomy team. I do not have a college degree (went for music then changed over to healthcare programs). I have worked in the department my whole professional life (about 9 years) and I'm 30 years old. There are things I like about my job. I like problem solving, and there is no lack of that in my current role. I have new problem coming to me everyday and I have to think through them and use my experience to quickly move forward. On a scale of 1-10 I would probably give myself a 6 or 7 if I was grading myself on the job. I do really well with processes and critical thinking, but man I really don't like managing people. I like all the people here, but I hate being the one who has to get people to work more than they are alotted, or call them to come in when it's needed. I don't like having those tough conversations and I hate corporate culture. I don't like having to put on a face that's not me. I already know that I don't want to move up in this department. All this being said I do like the amount of freedom I have. I get along with my supervisor really well and I feel very needed in this job because I always have people coming to me for help. I like some of the processing work. For an example we get all the COVID specimens sent to us and we have to process those, or process patient body fluid by pour off into containers, collection of blood specimen etc. 

I recently interviewed for a different job in the same organization. It wouldn't be management, I may get to work from home, it works mainly with patient data(which is another aspect of my current job I like alot). It also help further cancer research, which is important to me because I just lost my sister a month ago to cancer. I would make a little less money, move to hourly instead of salary. This isn't so important to me, I came to the conclusion that I am not looking for money. But if I'm honest with myself this isn't really what I want to do either. Ultimately I need to be a creative person in order to be happy. After a long stint(maybe not finished) of depression brought on my the mounting problems that I eventually found was due to ADHD, I have done alot of introspection. I think I'm a better person now than I have ever been, and I'm getting closer and closer to knowing what I want. Working in a corporate atmosphere ain't it. Anything I do now I am hoping to be a step, but ultimately music is the only I care about and something I have decided I will work on along the way. My feeling is that this new job will free up my brain a bit after work and I can have a little better balance. I also want to be very careful that I don't stay in my current role because it's the devil I know. 

I don't exactly know what kind of advise I'm looking for, but I just need to put all this down to help myself here a little. Tried to keep this short. 

Thanks",07Oct2020,1
454,"i’m a 17 year old student. i need to give y’all a little back story first. i sadly had to redo a class in my gymnasium because of my crippling mental health. a few weeks went by and i couldn’t anymore and decided to switch schools. the thing is that i due to me stopping my visit at that school i couldn’t get into the other school immediately. that’s why i had to work and fill in the months until the new school year starts in order to then attend to the other school. the business school i now attend is 5 years long. i am in my third year now and 17. my classmates are mostly 15 years old because i basically lost two years of education. 

i am at a point where i truly despise this school and can’t go on any further. i can’t bring myself to do anything, nothing. i seriously hate it here. accounting, business economics and much more simply doesn’t interest me and it is not what i plan to do in life. i have given up at this point with this school and want to leave.

the thing is if i start an apprenticeship it’s probably going to be 3 years. work life is really scary to me. working all year and all the time having no holidays scares me a lot. i don’t know if i’m mentally able to do that too. 

all of my others friends have graduated (i have no problem with being older than the rest) and it is just so depressing that i am stuck in this little cage. i still have to finish this year then another two years. i don’t know if i can do it anymore.

im writing this in hopes to get any advice because i’m still young and have little to no life experience. i hope there are some adults out there who have felt this way and now have their life somewhat figured out. 

all i do is think about my future with school and work. i really don’t know what to do i need advice please",07Oct2020,1
455,"So I will try to make this short. My friend blocked me over some tumblr posts. The posts were about BLM and how like some of the videos about the cars driving through the protests were edited to make it look like the people were trying to run through the protesters and I think one was about Jussie smollett and how be basically got no punishment for faking a hate crime and stuff. 

She also did not like another post I had which she interpreted as me not thinking people should wear masks, where as I DO think people should, I think we both just took the post in different ways. The thing is...she didn't ask me about any of these posts, like she just went ahead and blocked me and didn't say anything to me. I figured she blocked me, but just in case something else was going on I messaged someone she knows to see if something else happened and if she was okay.  That was when she told me she did not want to be friends anymore and that she blocked me so I told her I respect her decision but i wish she would have come to me about it.  I guess I don't know if I was wrong to post that stuff as I can see that some of them were overly harsh and I deleted them (I think it was only like 3-4 posts that I reblogged as I don't make every post about politics) and I think it is important to acknowledge any wrongs but I feel like her political posts are harsh but I don't mention them to her because even though I do not agree I don't think its worth arguing over or ending a friendship over. 

I just feel like I wouldn't end a friend over something like this....or I at least would have asked my friend about the posts before deciding if I would end a friendship over it (especially since we have been friends for years..) I did see something she posted saying like ""imagine thinking being called racist is worse than racism"" #when you gotta block you gotta block... which I assume refers to me..so she definitely took the posts differently than me...but she that is just so cold...and she did not ask me about it or say something like ""hey whats up with this post?"" cause I would have been more than happy to talk about it but instead she just blocked me...She posted something else that said something like""you can disagree with political opinions and be friends but not fucking human rights"" which I think she also referred to me.

So should I send her an apology saying that Im sorry I posted things that were too harsh and I should have acknowledged more of the peaceful protests even though I dont like a lot of the things BLM protestors have done? (She is very liberal whereas I am probably more in the middle)

What should I do? she's posted like 2 angry things about it on tumblr but did not come to me about it which I just don't get about ""shitting on"" her beliefs when I am not trying to do that at all...like I do post a lot about God and like I think I have some posts on people's testimonies and she is not religious so I think she it taking them really personally...but the posts are for me so I don't understand...I do not take her posts personally because I respect her beliefs but I think she thinks I am shitting on hers. ugh.

 What should I do? I really feel like this is a huge misunderstanding but she already ended the friendship so I dont know what I should do..",07Oct2020,1

466,"My (20f) boyfriend (20m) feels these sudden spurts of doom. 

Tw: mentions of suicidal thoughts 


To explain in clearer words, he feels that there is no point to living life as we all lead a very mechanical life aka born schooling job death. He doesn't understand the meaning behind all of our existances. ( I'm guessing this is a nihilistic way of thinking, I'm not a 100% sure ). He has been feeling this way since 2016.
He does feel suicidal thoughts but thankfully does not act on them. These thoughts of pointlessness in living life does make him very unmotivated, he stays up some nights thinking of why and how but obviously does not have an answer to it. 

Lately he doesn't think of anything negative per se, but these thoughts are just in the back of his head, haunting him and putting him down. 

It puts him in a very very sad state of mind, he does not have the energy to do anything, gets extremely low and the usual joy or happiness in his voice is sucked out, and I feel very helpless. 

I understand I am no medical professional,my way of thinking about life is almost the opposite and for me to view the world through his pov and to give advice is a little challenging. We cannot afford medical counseling or therapy, but once we are earning, he will go to one. 

But for now, if anyone has had these thoughts, or is dealing with them, how did you get through it?

488,"Basically I brought home a puppy around September in 2019 for me and my boyfriend. He's mixed with shih Tzu and Chihuahua. He's a small dog and He's just so energetic that we named him Puppers. I love my little dummy and so does my boyfriend. Well a few months after having him, my boyfriend started rough housing with him. It was fine at first but I noticed Puppers started getting more rough. I asked my boyfriend to stop being so rough because the dog is starting to get pretty aggressive. My boyfriend argued that he's just playing with him and shrugged it off. I was irritated so I started saying something to him every time he starts playing rough. Puppers is starting to try to bite (even though I know he's playing) just from trying to pet him. I have to start punishing Puppers almost on a constant because he's getting too aggressive with everything. I finally got through to my boyfriend to stop being aggressive and now he punishes Puppers almost 24/7. Me and him are constantly going back and forth over it because I said he can't always be angry that Pups is aggressive because he caused him to act like that. Last night I was playing with Puppers and gently patted his tail when he wasn't paying attention, something I always do, and he full blown attacked my arm. Although he didn't really injure me (few scratches) he has never attacked before. I'm at wits end with this. I love Puppers and my boyfriend but I can't even interact with Pups because he justs gets too rough thanks to my boyfriend. I know my boyfriend meant no harm with rough housing with Puppers but it IS his fault. Boyfriend even underminds me when I try to discipline Pups. If I have to yell at Pups, right after I do my boyfriend does. Because of that Puppers doesn't even listen to me anymore, just to him. I thought about taking the dog to obedience school to retrain him. My sister says to just let my boyfriend slowly retrain Pups since Pups listens to him. Any suggestions? And nothing about ""Lose the boyfriend"" because this is not a deal breaker for me.

TL;DR: Bf made my dog aggressive by rough housing too much and dog doesn't listen to me.",07Oct2020,1

i still dont know how i should tell my family or the rest of my class, but this is a start :)

492,"I’ve been drawing for a while and about a year ago I decided to start posting my art online. Before that I often shared my drawings with discord servers I was apart of and I was always told that I definitely needed to get on Twitter and post my art because that was where most people posted and where the most engagement happened.

Fast forward to now, I have an Instagram, tumblr, reddit, and Twitter account I post my art too. But compared to the other sites my Twitter is an absolute ghost town. I had never used Twitter (or instagram) before this so I did read up on each sites posting etiquette. On my Twitter posts I never use more than 2 hashtags (because that’s what was recommended). But the same picture can get 3k upvotes on reddit, 400 likes on Instagram, and then nothing at all on Twitter. 

It’s just bugging me a little because Twitter was pushed so hard to me by other artists and art enthusiasts, but when I bring this up in discussion it’s just a chorus of “that’s not my experience with Twitter” and I can never really get any advice out of anyone. I thought maybe I just don’t “get” Twitter and maybe I’m missing some fundamental part of posting on that site. 

Any advice or information would be very appreciated, thank you.",07Oct2020,1

494,"Professor singles me out

Professor singles me out in class

Hello. So I am a biology student and I am currently taking a class that is a discussion based course where we read scientific articles and talk about it in class. I am the only black student in the class. There are the extroverted students that will talk all the time and then there’s students that talk only a few times throughout the class. I am one of the many students that do not talk a lot as much in the class, however, I’d say I do talk more than most quieter students. I’ve noticed a trend where he will call on me several times in class, and ask me a question for me to answer. He does this very often, and only me will he call on me. My friends in this class also notice it. Today, while we had a 10 min break as I was walking to go use the restroom , in the middle of the class during break, he says “you need to speak up, you’re so shy, you’re going to get negative points for not saying anything” and at first I was in shock just because I did not think I wasn’t not saying anything. I wouldn’t necessary say from shyness is why I don’t talk more often as the extroverts, though it is only because most articles that we tackle are hard and the field in biology of the class is not in my realm. In fact, I did participate in class a couple of times prior to her/him saying that to me. There are a few other students who don’t even say more than me so I felt that it was unfair for her/him to say that to me. After this incidence, it’s making me feel more uncomfortable that she/he will single me and out pick me out in class. I also did not like the fact that she/he had to say I will be getting negative points in front of the class for others to hear. My friends also think she/he has some sort of vendetta against me. I want to address this to the professor about this but I’m not exactly sure what to say. I want to be polite.",07Oct2020,1
495,"The title probably sounds a little ridiculous, but here’s what’s going on:

To keep details at a minimum, I’m a lash tech at a salon in a very small, conservative town. The business owner has multiple booth renters but only 2 employees - I’m one of them. I have a large clientele and typically see each person once every 2-3 weeks for lash maintenance. 

As I began to enter the professional world, my dad has always strictly instilled professionalism - constantly reminding me to never bring up politics or religion. While many of my clients bring these topics up, even if I disagree with them, their opinions are relatively tame and I don’t actively contribute to the conversation. 

2 weeks ago I had a client named Donna, who I’ve seen about 5x total. Last week she brought up her political/pop culture opinions and for me, completely crossed a line. When discussing why she didn’t like rap music, she went on to say, “It’s just hypocritical. Why can they refer to themselves as n****rs and I can’t?” My jaw dropped and before I could say anything, she swiftly moved into the next conversation. 

So here’s my primary issue. I do NOT tolerate racist language, and would’ve absolutely come for her throat had I not been in a professional setting. Many service providers in my industry (hairstylists, nail techs, etc) are self-employed and have the privilege of “firing” clients when they are not compatible. As an employee, “my” clients are technically the clients of my employer, and I do not have that luxury. My first reaction was to discuss it with my employer and see if we could move my client to another lash tech, but my employer is just as/if not more racist than the client and I know she will not understand my POV on the matter. 

Even though I’m an employee, I do feel as though it’s necessary to draw the line *somewhere* as to what I will and will not tolerate in my room. I still feel disappointed and ashamed for not saying something the first time - and because of that, I feel it may be too late now. 

Friends of reddit, should I just ignore this behavior and resort to punching a pillow when I get home? Do I put my foot down to my boss and tell her I refuse to have this woman as a client? I feel so lost.",07Oct2020,1
496,"I love my brother to death, but recently he started dating this girl and her and I became friends. My entire family gossips and talks about each all the time, so I told her that she could always come to me with problems and that I would never talk to anyone else. I don't think posting on Reddit counts. 

Anyway she started telling me some very concerning things about him. He manipulates her and gaslights her and even admits to it after the fact but he won't change. He has gotten to the point where he is very emotionally abusive and he physically abused her once. The way she describes him is nothing like the brother I know, but I've read a lot of books about abusive men so I know how charming and friendly they can be to anyone who isn't their gf/wife. 

She has only told me about this. He essentially ruined all of her friendships so she has no one but him. He has all of his friends on his side and his gf has no one. They live far away from me so she tells me over phone calls and texts and I have told her to leave him repeatedly. At this point she is undergoing serious mental damage and self-harming because of the way he is treating her.

She's convinced they're going to get married one day and she seems to believe she won't find anyone better than him (which is probably something he's told her). 

I am SCARED for her. Our parents wouldn't believe me or care about what my brother is doing so telling them would just make things worse. I know how abusive guys thinks so I know that confronting him myself or having my husband do it would just put his gf in danger. 

I feel stuck, like my only option is to listen to her vent about him. I did give her a book called ""Why Does He Do That?"" and it's about the minds of abusive men and the thought process they go through. My brother doesn't know that I gave it to her because we both knew it would be wiser to keep that a secret. She hasn't read it yet but I occasionally remind her to at least look it over.

497,"I'm from an upper middle class family, and currently a senior in high school. Last year, during the middle of my junior year, I was trying my very best to the point that I was willing to sacrifice my social life but for some reason I was getting all B's for term 2. I swear to god, I was trying my best, I just didn't know what was going wrong. My parents yelled at me and told me that I was slacking, but I was insisting that I was trying my best. I felt very frustrated and angry with them, and I just wanted to run away. I felt underappreciated, and I felt like a loser because they also compared me to their friends' kids who were apparently doing much better than me and yet still have a social life. 

However, I'm also from a financially stable family, so I always feel that I shouldn't be feeling this way because if I do feel this way towards my parents then I'm probably spoiled.

I know now that it would’ve helped if I was more honest and told the truth but it’s too late now. I know I need to tell my mom about this because it’s affecting my school performance. Im failing every class because I’m not showing up since I sleep in because I stay up all night crying and I don’t do the work because I don’t see the point.

499,"I moved out of my parents' house because we are not on good terms. I work at a restaurant and trying to get myself into an university. I'm 19.

 I was on my night shift a few days back. It was 12 am  Me (F) and my co worker (M)  were about to take a break but these two guys came at our restaurant so we kind of cancelled our plan and decided to take the orders. The two guys were just staring at me and they moved a little closer to me and was giving me a creepy smile. I was totally freaked out but didn't make it obvious. I was taking the order and they started giving off creepier vibes. I just got panicked but I was trying to face them and say something but nothing came out of my mouth. At that moment my coworker noticed and I just looked at him with a fearful expression. He asked them what they were up to. They just nodded and but didn't say anything.

Later on that night I went to take some more orders (we don't walk around our restaurant much except for taking and delivering orders because of COVID) and they were just chilling and giving me creepy looks. I was alone at that moment and got really scared.

I heard that the crime rates have increased recently in my area. Most of them are sexual assault cases. I feel troubled and my coworkers are not that supportive. How to build up a strong voice and stand up for yourself at these situations and not make it that obvious at the same time? (because i don't wanna be targeted by people and also i'm an introvert so that's kind of out of my comfort zone but i want build a strong voice and stand up for myself and handle these situations wisely.

And can you guys suggest me some youtube channels to learn some basic fighting/self defense skills ?Can I carry a pepper spray or a knife?

He won't help me and I'm not planning to file a case to the police (in case any unfortunate thing happens)  because i'm afraid of them (i'm black)

502,"I don't know how to handle this situation. And its a long post.. 

Some shit went down between my cousin (let's call her C) and her best friend (let's call het M); M also works for C. I would also consider M is as a close friend. 

About 6 months ago C left her husband and moved in with her parents. During that time it was heavy lockdown and safety regulations so I didn't see her much and other stuff between us happend but thats not important right now.

M had been talking to C's soon to be ex-husband (lets call him J). C knew about it and just bared with it. To hurt C, J sent her the WhatsApp chat of J and M talking about C. These are messages from middle March till end of Sept. 

M said horrible stuff about my cousin and how she is a terrible boss and just judging her about everything. C showed me two instances and eventhough the text style and language were M's. It just didn't seem like her AT ALL. In the past M did vent with me about my cousin and work stuff and asked for advice but she never badmouthed C.

C did confront M about the messages and M quit her job and blamed everyone else and didn't take responsibility for her actions (according to C). I am not sure about M's employment contract so I don't know till when she will be working there.

C and I have supported M through so much shit, heartbreak, mental health stuff etc and vice versa. I am mad at J for sharing a private conversation to C just based on principle.

M have been in my life for about 5 years and I am so conflicted. On the one hand I am so disappointed in what she did and want to write her off. On the other hand if I speak to M to hear her side I am afraid that C might think I am picking sides. Even if I were to pick a side it will always skew towards C because she is family.

I don't know if I am experiencing the start of mourning a friendship (5 stages of grief). M got me a few stuff over the years for my birthday and it's in my room and I can't look at it without feeling betrayed. Both of them are hairdressers and M usually does my mom's hair so they have a good relationship as well. 

I have so many good memories of me and M just talking, making jokes, sharing advice, partying, etc. 

Also, I am having the feeling of 'not my monkey, not my circus' and what is happening between them doesn't have anything to do with me. C is so hurt because she confined in M about issues in C's marriage and her depression. I don't know what to say to C or what to do. I haven't talked to M at all since I found out.

503,"Hi, thank you in advance for reading this because even though I haven’t wrote it yet I have a feeling it’s going to be long, plus I’m on mobile so please excuse weird formatting.

First some quick background on my situation. I am being treated for cancer and require chemo, radiation, and surgery. I am also 30F and am technically capable of having a child (there is an actual medical term for this, “woman of childbearing age (WACBA)”).

Now for the hospital policy in question. Their guidelines state that I **must** be given a pregnancy test before undergoing radiation. Obviously, radiation would kill a fetus, and therefore they don’t want to get sued for accidentally terminating a pregnancy. There is no way around this test. This hospital does not provide a form that I could sign to waive them of liability (other institutions do have this). 

My primary issue with this is that if the test were to show I was pregnant, they would not have started treatment. It would have been delayed until the pregnancy could either be carried to term or terminated. 

EVERY DAY my treatment would have been delayed would compromise my ability to beat this cancer, which is already at a shaky 50/50 odds. 

This means the hospital policy prioritizes the health and safety of an unborn fetus over that of their actual patient, a living breathing woman who needs cancer treatment.

I am “lucky” I wasn’t pregnant so my treatment wasn’t delayed (lucky in quotes because for so many reasons, I am 100% not pregnant). But **I am outraged at this policy that doesn’t give women the right to choose treatment.** I wonder if this has compromised another woman’s treatment plan in the past. 

I am asking for advice to draw attention to this. I am not an influencer with a ton of followers. I obviously don’t even have a voice within this hospital. How do I get the word out?",07Oct2020,1

505,"Hey this is kinda long, please bear with me. Idk who else to talk to and i heard people of reddit are kind/helpful. 
So there's this girl i met when i was 14(T), she was very popular in school, and i was, well something of a loner, used to sit in the back of class sketching and reading. 

She took a liking to me and started hanging out with me regularly. It was a bad year for me so having her company felt like a blessing. 
I had never had a friend like her and vice versa. She was kind, smart and gorgeous.
Very soon we became the best of friends. I noticed (at one point) that she left her old group of girlfriends altogether (they were the mean sort iykwim). 

We were practically inseperable. Around October i started falling for her, it took me some time to realise and accept that I'm bisexual. 
Now i was pretty damn sure she liked me too. Or she's not straight at least. (my gaydar cant be that wrong)

So i confessed my feelings for her. That night she said she liked me back. I was elated. 
Next day she told me that she thought i was kidding.
Mind you there was no trace of humor in what i said. We both knew that. So at that time i said yes i was kidding lets go back to normal. And so we did. 
Everything was cool. Another year passed and i fell (if possible) more deeply in love with her than ever. We got very close. 

We used to hang out in an abandoned classroom in our school when everyone would be outside. We would just sit in silence, with her head on my shoulder. Those were the best days of my life honestly.

Then in grade 10 things got a bit rocky. i started dating a popular guy and she seemed cool about it, but later she said she didn't like him, or always picked a fuss about him. I did messed up stuff back then. 

I broke up with that guy many times, because i was so in love with her and thought breaking up with him might make her come clean to me about her feelings. 

Nothing happened. 
We were very cosy that whole year. She said stuff like im the best person she has ever known, the best person in her life, and that we would be best friends forever, and would move in with each other after graduation. She said i knew her better than anyone ever did. 

Everyone thought she was a little in love with me. 
She used to say things like (to me) she's not sure about her sexuality. 
But in front of everyone she always said she was straight. I never got a straight answer from her saying that she likes me, so she probably did NOT have feelings for me. 

We were fine. Then at the end of class 10 she changed schools. When our 10th exams ended, she sent me a text saying that she doesnt wanna be friends with me, that i was toxic for her and everything. And then she COMPLETELY ghosted me. 
Now that hurt like a bitch because we were close as f*ck and she left without a single thought. without giving me closure. 

I did extreme stuff. I called her many times and even went to her house unsolicitedly. i had never done such things but we were best friends wtf.
So anyway she initially talked to me. And we MADE up. It was a sort of emo day. She hugged me that day and said I'm her best friend and she wants it to stay that way. That was the last i saw of her in one and a half years. 
She stopped calling after that. And i did text a number of times but she always cut it short.

3 years later (im 17 now) o still cant get over her. I cant figure out what the fuck happened. what made her leave. I dont think i need closure. I just need to move on. But im not sure i want to. i cant talk to my friends about this because even though they dont say it i know that i talk about her SO much that they're getting tired of it. 

I terribly miss her. Even now. I hate myself for it. But she was the best person i ever knew :( 
I kept asking myself if i was the toxic person. I honestly don't think i was. 
Every now and then i wanna text her but i remember that she said she has moved on in life and its weird for her to see me popping back into her life. 

This isnt a question. its more of a rant. i need a way out. but most of all i wanna talk to her. I dont because she clearly said she wants me out of her life. its jot even like she's got great friends. Her new school is a shithole btw.

I love R and we trust each other completely. He has a big heart and is emotionally intelligent. Nevertheless, we grew up in a homophobic society (we live in Poland) and our parents never said anything about gay people. If I remember correctly, I first read about homosexuality in an old celebrity magazine. 

Back when we were 9 or 10, he would have friends (boys) come over and they would go in our room and not let me get in. They said they’re doing “man stuff”, which he later told me was in fact watching porn and jacking off (or trying to) together. He said many of his friends found this normal. 

He’s had girlfriends and he really likes women (he always boasts about how hot certain celebrities are) but many a time we were talking about a man (for example, one of our neighbors son) and he always says “he looks good...I mean, if I were a girl I’d..you know!”. He also doesn’t like gay jokes (I’m talking about something playful and innocent like “ur mom gay”) and never talks about homosexuality (he was very uncomfortable and shut me off when I came out to him as bisexual). 

He likes stuff like cars and video games but he also pays a lot of attention to the way he looks and dresses (he’s extremely tall and thin, he’s obsessed with his hair and manicure, he’s getting a full sleeve tattooed)   

Basically what the title says. I strongly believe he’s bisexual or heteroflexible but he won’t even come out to himself. Might that be possible?

This goes beyond that though. No matter what advice myself or our other close friend give her, she starts yelling at us to leave her be. It can be as simple as “you should paint your wall green” because she gave us a list of colors to choose from and she’ll get upset because she actually wanted yellow the whole time.

Some backstory about my mother before I start to give some context. My mother is not a normal person. She is very bi-polar and is heavily medicated for that. Me and my two brothers have had issues with her our entire childhood regarding a large range of things. She was much worse growing up but has gotten a little better as her children all became adults. My parents are divorced and have both been remarried since I was 6. 

Onto the story.... My wife (32F) was at my moms house because my mom was helping her custom make a sign to go above our bed. My wife mentioned how I wasn't at work that day because I had a bad migraine (I get severe migraines to the point I need an injection every month just to function. My boss knows this and understands). My mom mentioned I need to see a neurologist, which I already have, and my wife explained that to her. For reasons only my mom will know, she told my wife the following, ""John (fake name for brother) told me last time he was here that I need to have a talk with him about him missing work because he is embarrassed of OP and how it makes him look at work. I know he is faking his migraines."" I work with my brother in the same position. 

So naturally my wife comes and tells me what my mom said. I confront my brother, and I will admit I was a little hostile. When I brought it up to him, it was very obvious my brother was extremely confused and had no clue what I was talking about. My brother is my best friend and he has honestly never lied to me that I know of. He's a very trust worthy person. 

My wife definitely didn't lie to me and make this whole thing up, so that leaves only one option. My mom made the entire thing up. 

I texted her and said, ""Did John tell you that he is embarrassed of me at work and that I was faking my migraines""

She texted back, ""I'm not getting involved with your two's bullshit""

I texted back, ""Its a simple question. I need you to answer it"" 

This was all about 24 hours ago and she still has not answered me and I doubt she is going to. We have family pictures scheduled next week with my step brother flying in from across the county. I'm honestly pissed but I don't know what to do right now because of the family plans for the next week and the possibility it may ruin them. 

My mom has a long history of lying and doing insane things to the point she almost ruined my wedding by being an absolute nightmare. 

Any advice on how to proceed would be very helpful, because I cannot fathom why she would do this and all I feel is rage right now and people tend to not make the best decisions out of rage. Thank you guys.",07Oct2020,1

A managerial position  opened up and i applied for it. I was not the only one though. A woman in her late 20s that only worked for something about two years in the company did the same and she got the position over me! I felt angry, pissed and humiliated at the thought that a woman that could be my daughter is now my superior and i have to follow her orders. It just felt very wrong. However, after a couple of months i noticed how extremely competent and intelligent she is and that she knows what she is doing. Honestly, she is a far better leader than i could ever be. Yet, there are still those feelings of anger and humiliation when she gives me instructions and it just feels wrong to me. There is this part of me that keeps saying: WOMEN HAVING AUTHORITY OVER MAN IS WRONG. I know that this is bad and evil attitude to have but its still there. I wish i could cope with it somehow. Anyway, my trouble started when i once refused to follow an instruction she gave me out of my false pride and anger that a young woman is my boss. Because of that i had to go to the HR department and explain myself. I said that i had a bad day and apologized to my boss. The HR manager was satisfied with that but not my boss. Since then she treats me coldly and bossy. She orders me around and demands that i do more work than others. She also talks in a derogatory way with me. I tried to fix this situation by showing her that i fully accept and respect her authority. I always volunteer for overtime, i make her coffee etc. Sadly, she is still angry with me. I know that its 100% my fault. She deserves her position. She is rightfully my boss. My old fashioned ways, my jealousy and my false pride are to blame.

524,"I'll provide some details here for context: 

I was roughly 4-5 years old visiting the UK with my dad and brother (2 years older). We stayed with my dad's friend in his house and his son. I think he was somewhere between 14-18, but I can't be sure. 

During this period of time the abuse would happen frequently. It always involved us being prone on the floor or on a bed - being instructed to remove our pants. He'd make these role playing games that always involved him touching us with his hands or genitals. I remember quite vividly at least 1 instance where he had me alone in a room and was on top of me and gyrating into me. I also remember being the focus of his attention - although my brother was definitely present and experienced some of this. For some reason, I've spent most of my life not wanting to address it as a real trauma and fixated on the fact that I wasn't 'penetrated'. Whether that was true or not doesn't seem to matter now. All I know is that from what I can remember, this person is clearly a predator. 

The other part of this is that I've been a wreck my whole life. I'm in my mid 30's, on the surface seemingly successful. I've been married to my best friend for 3 years, in a well paying job. Throughout my life I suffered from crippling anxiety and depression, substance abuse issues, etc. Although I workout every day and have a good therapist, I'm still suffering daily. This last weekend I had a nervous breakdown which included throwing up, uncontrollable crying, etc. 

I brought this up to my dad when I was in my early 20's. He dismissed it and said something along the lines of ""boys play when they're young"". To be fair to him I don't think I shared any details, I was probably stumbling through my explanation and probably in response to how uncomfortable this made him I doubt I did a good job of explaining how significant this was to me. We don't have a great relationship. His 2nd wife beat the shit out of me for years from ages 4-8. In all fairness he did put an end to that but they stayed married for another 7-8 years before the eventually got divorced. His 3rd (current wife) is a toxic person who has said some hateful things to me but I was an adult when they got married. 

Now, I'm more miserable than ever despite meditating, seeking therapy, exercising daily, etc. I had dreams of being a musician coming out of high school but I got derailed. I can't blame everything on my childhood, I deserve the blame for not practicing guitar for years. I'm practicing music daily now but to be honest I find everything difficult. I think it's time I address some of my deeply rooted trauma, hence why I'm posting here. 

More importantly than my own trauma I feel an ethical obligation to track down this predator and warn people around him. Given how old I was when this happens, I'm experiencing some doubt. I also have no idea who this person is and would need to have a 2nd confrontation with my dad. 

Let's say I find out who he is, what next? I know this is a weird situation but I don't know what to do. My wife has been wonderfully understanding and supportive. She always advises me to find a resolution to this and my other issues. How to go about it is where I get stuck.",07Oct2020,1

528,"My feelings definitely aren't gone, but they have faded, especially in the last 2ish months. When we're apart for a few days (and have been now for 2 weeks thanks to another local lockdown), I get the urge to kiss and cuddle him while watching a movie or playing a game. We have something special. Our friends view us as the ideal relationship, my parents assume we're gonna get married. It was electric, we hit it off right away when we met 2 years ago. We sat in the college cafeteria and spoke for 3+ hours several days in a row, without so much as checking our phones. We were each others's first and only time. We started talking marriage in 7/8 years after only a few months of dating. 

However for the last 2 months I've focused a lot on the negatives and had doubts. It's like my brain won't let go of the flaws, when flaws are inherent to all long term relationships. For one, he was probably a porn addict from 13-18. He's admitted to weird stuff he was into that made me seriously lose attraction to him, like his love of fully blooded incest porn between siblings. He also wants to try very ""porn"" things in the bedroom like anal, eating ass, finishing in my face/body. I want traditional, loving oral and p in v sex. I've never orgasmed with him, he has gone down on me for like 30+ mins a few times and it just doesn't happen. I used to enjoy sex but I haven't felt it much for the last 3 months or so, probably since I started thinking about his past porn use/kinks so much. There's also his lack of interest in politics/social issues, he just copies my opinions because ""you know best"". I long for his own thoughts on things. 

My brain keeps feeding me crap like ""uh the right guy  would be sexually compatible with you and would find incest disturbing and would also keep up with the news and would be willing to eat food with onions/peppers/salads"". My brain keeps saying ""what are the odds you met the ideal man the first week of college, you could meet a guy more similar to you in your 20s"". I hate it cos I *know* these are nitpicking and I've probably seen too much How I Met Your Mother etc and have way too high expectations. I only reply to him once an hour or so and we used to message every 20 mins until a few months ago, I just feel like I have little to say and vice versa, and I feel terrible about that.

Hello! Not sure if this the best sub to post this on, but I had an idea that I wanted to share with others who live in and/or near around Chi. 

I know there are massive charity and donation sites and drives that already exist but I was wondering if anyone would be interested in creating our own, in some way? The pandemic had resulted in an increase of the homeless population and winter is on its way - so I would like to, in some very small way, help them. 

I’m open to other ideas and suggestions so please feel free to share! Some that I had in mind are: 
Coming together as a group/meeting up in a certain location and maybe: 

 - Handing out food and warm drinks for a day (fast food, canned items, etc. maybe something sweet like a warm cup of coffee from Starbucks, etc)
- Setting up a drive for donations for food and/or winter clothes (hats, shoes, blankets, gloves, jackets) as well as masks *
- Purchasing gift cards and handing them out 
- Bringing donations to the homeless shelters and other reorganization’s that already work with the city’s homeless population 
- Other ideas welcome

I am not Americanized and I don't think I'll ever date an american (I'm sorry I don't want to sound rude. They are all amazing people but that'll be way to forced for me). 



So here's the thing. I've never talked to a girl besides family/teachers etc. Never skipped class, never dated, never did drugs, never did stuff teenagers do. I can count my friends using one hand and I always feel like an outsider. 


I visit my country like once a year and it is very unlikely for me to find a *genuine* person who's not just looking for hookups or a gold digger (very common) or someone who's just looking for a placeholder bf. I don't want to date a bunch of women or just do temporary stuff because I really believe in first relationships that last forever. I don't want to date in the US either because I'm very *attached* to my country and I feel like I won't be able to find a genuine person here whom I can talk freely to (language, differences in growing up etc.)

I will probably be arranged married to some stranger I don't know and I would've been fine with it but the thing is I spent all of my life (and probably the next 6/7 years too) like a monk and never had the opportunity to find the *one.* Sometimes I feel like I should go back to my country for a year after my college graduation but that'll be a big dent when it comes to my career.

I did have a job at a fast food place for a while, and before that I dropped out of college to marry my spouse and move halfway across the country. I'm beginning to think dropping out of college was a huge mistake, and although I dunno what exactly I want to do (thinking maybe registered nurse because the medical industry has a lot of growth and pays well), I want to go back. 

I want to go back because I know that although I'm helping around the house taking care of my spouse and our animals, beyond that, I'm not contributing.

551,"So this is my first post on Reddit ever and I have nobody else that I can trust to turn too.  So the gist of this post is that I used to work with this girl (we'll call her Sarah) and I really liked her and I believe she liked me to some kind of extent.  Anyway our paths kind of went two different directions but I always kept up with her on social media accounts because she is unbelievably gorgeous and has great taste in great things.  Anyway I finally got her to respond to some of my messages and she told me where she is currently working and that I should come in to see her this Thursday (tomorrow) to see her.

552,"So yesterday when I woke up all my sisters were home and it was still relatively early, like 8 am. So we decided we wanted to go get coffee. We went downstairs and everyone was in a pretty good mood, we told our mom we were getting coffee and asked her if she wanted anything, she told us our drink then informed me we needed special litter for my cat (when cats get declawed they need paper litter so it doesn’t give them infections) I went ballistic. So about a month previously I bought those silicone soft paws claw caps things because he was scratching stuff and I specifically said that declawing him is inhumane and completely unnecessary. (I have pictures of him on my page if you want to see him) she tried to tell me this was the most humane thing I could do for him and I lost my shit. I sent her tons of articles proving her completely wrong, and even ones from vets saying how wrong it is. For reference, when a cat is getting declawed they have to remove the last fucking digit of their claws, meaning they remove the bone as well as the (usually) entire claw. (They fuck up a lot.) which would be the same thing as cutting your last knuckle off of your finger. I genuinely don’t know what to do, she got him neutered and declawed all in the same day and he stayed overnight and I’m getting him in a couple hours. I know he’s going to be in a ton of pain and not going to be happy or social. I just got him calmed down after adopting him as a stray, I’ve had him for a few months. But they already fucking did it. I don’t know what to do. I’m terrified.",07Oct2020,1
553,"I think this title is pretty bad, but I couldn't think of anything better...

Around a year ago, I (m17) was really depressed even thinking about suicide. I've had two friends (f17, f18) helping me through this. They were the only people who knew this. Therefore they felt they were under pressure because they thought it would be there fault if I would have committed suicide. 

In the end they decided to go toy schools rector with it because they could not handle it. This is totally understandable for me. The problem about it, was that we had spoken about precisely this one week before, where I said, that it was fine, as long as I didn't have to speak to a certain teacher. This somehow got lost and I had to speak about it with this teacher, which I didn't do. I met up, but I didn't say a word.

Then, and I don't know why I did this, it was a horrible mistake, I decided to speak with my friends about, that I had spoken with the one teacher I did not want to speak to. I don't know what exactly went wrong there, but they somwhow thought I was threatening them. I'm pretty sure I didn't, but I should probably not have spoken with them about this one hour after speaking with the teacher. I think I might have been a bit too affective...

Three days later (it was weekend, and they had blocked me on every social media) I tried explaining them that I didn't want to harm them etc. In the end, this also somehow went wrong, but we agreed that it most likely would be good to get some distance from each other for some time, both in private and at school and that we won't speak about this. Then Corona happened and we didn't see each other for a half year. 

Now school has been going normally again for 1.5 months. Since the beginning of the school year it seems that we are friends again, we meet after school sometimes etc. 
But still there is something wrong with it for me. I want to tell them that I am sorry for what happened, I didn't want them to have such a pressure etc and I want to thank them for their help, through this difficult time I had. Because they really did, although they were gone from my life towards the last two of my depression.

But on the same time I do not want to bring it up again. I had tried that two times already (before Corona), and they were somehow misunderstanding me completely. I'm afraid it will destroy our friendship again. I don't know what to do, and if I decide to tell them, I don't even know what to tell them. When I tried to tell them before Corona that I was sorry and tried to thank them for their help they misunderstood this, but I don't know what else to tell them",07Oct2020,1

Kind of a long one but please bear with me I really do need a lot of help
So I have been in a long distance relationship for about an year now. I am 21, this is the first ever relationship I have ever had. We had a really smooth run for the first half of the relationship, but then things got extremely toxic. She had been in a relationship months before she started dropping hints on me. Her previous relationship was her first one and lasted 3-4 years. She went into obscene levels of details about her and her ex and their sex life and all. We have only met once, and during our entire time together, we didn't even hold hands, I just wanted her to get everything off her chest. Tell me everything she has to about her past IN PERSON, so we can bury her past already and move on together when I left the country again. That didn't happen. She still kept bringing up stuff about her ex even after we spent the entire day together trying to get the topic just done with. She would go into extreme details whenever his topic came up (and it came up a lot, we have discussed him with her more than we've discussed me with her as of today) and I would sometimes have to stop her. Things got so bad even I started following her ex on socials out of curiosity as to how ""amazing"" was he to have such a tremendous impact on someone he doesn't even know exists. I somehow got over it, took me a lot of time and self conditioning. The only reason I bring it up is just to emphasize on the following point. Its my first relationship, and my first ever partner already has a lot of baggage from her past relationship, but at this point I'm just happy to have someone, even if I have to bear their ex haunting the relationship. Keeping that in mind, consider this; she has been unaccepting of who I am as a person. She hates the fact that I am as open minded about some topics as I can be and often mocks me by calling me a liberal in front of her friends. She is trying to make me into the person she deems is perfect for dating. She doesn't even try to reason most of the times. Just tells me how she feels and makes me force myself to be a person I don't agree with. I watched the Netflix series with a friend who is a female and I told my partner about it. She said she binged the entire first season in secrecy and doesn't remember anything about it except the sex scenes and made me feel like I was cheating on her by watching a show with a friend that doesn't even have nudity or isn't even about any of this topics, rather a look at a mentally unstable person. I am just so lost. Did I cheat? Does she really love me or does she love the person she is forcing me to be? Can we save this relationship?",07Oct2020,1
555,"Let me start by saying I know that kinda sounds cocky. Now, let me explain because that is not the case and it in fact causing me very much pain and stress. I have recently broke up with my last boyfriend of a year. We were a great couple and got together well. We had talked about marriage and a big future together but I recently started questioning everything and had to step back and realize that it just wasn’t quite right. Breaking up with him was very hard, and he could not understand it because we had always talked about our future together. He mentioned at the time that he thinks we are meant to b and that he won’t stop trying. After the breakup, I resorted to my guy best friend who I tell everything. We have always been super close and I secretly knew I had feelings for him. Turns out he felt the same way this whole time and we had been talking a lot recently. I just now slowed down communicating with him because of some events that happened and he’s also at college so a relationship would be hard. He accidentally sent me drunk videos telling me he was super in love with me. I could really see myself in the future with him, but I didn’t know how to take this. Then, on top of all this, my ex-boyfriend from 2 years ago, who has always been a close family friend of mine, starts trying to talk to me a lot and eventually sends me a HUGE text message professing his love to me. I responded by telling him I don’t feel the same way but it has not stopped him from trying. It’s my senior year and I told myself I didn’t want to be in a relationship, but just have fun and enjoy my friends. I feel like a lot of pressure is put on me because of the way that other people feel and I don’t find it fair. I don’t know how to go about any of this and it really stresses me out.

558,"Hello,

I’m a new College graduate and got my BBA in spring 2020. While in school, I worked PT as a leasing agent at a large property management company. After graduating, my fiancée and I mutually decided that I’d continue working in the same position for the same company, while my fiancée worked on getting a job out of state. We had, had this plan since the beginning of 2020. 

However, now that Covid hit its been extremely hard for my fiancée to find work and I now feel trapped in a job that I do not like. I don’t care for sales and the new FT position is at a property that’s a sinking ship. With this, I feel that my work ethic is rapidly deteriorating. I used to pride myself on my work ethic but now I’ve called in more than I ever had just to get away from the place. During my lunches, I take walks to clear my mind and get away. Sometimes I don’t even eat because I feel so anxious and unhappy with my work situation.

My fiancée and I re-discussed and agreed that I should keep working there until things get better. It’s hard to see an end coming but how can I take my situation and make it into a better one? I know that I am lucky just to have a job, but it’s so hard for me to make it day-by-day. Sometimes I have rough thoughts and feel emotionally/mentally too weak to make it. How can I become more prideful in my position/work? I’m already, ready to be promoted but have held off on my career path off because my fiancée is unhappy as well I their own toxic work environment. Also, there’s not a lot of opportunity open within my company right now.",07Oct2020,1

562,"So I've [24m] been seeing someone [25f] for the better part of a year. When I met her, she had one small tattoo that wasn't a big deal to me. Generally, tattoos are a major turn off to me, but I understand why someone would want one. Anyway, the other week, she surprised me by getting two more, both a lot bigger and more noticeable (one takes up her entire side). I would never want to make her feel bad by telling her I don't like them, since they are a part of her now, but historically tattoos have been a deal breaker for me (not to mention that my parents would freak out if I brought home a heavily tatted girl). 

I know that it's her body, her choice, and I don't want to take that away from her, but my dilemma here is that I think she thinks I like them, cuz I've tried to be supportive. If she really wants more, I'll still be supportive of her, but I'm worried I'll stop being attracted to her.

564,"Good morning,

I would like some advise as to if I'm being mean or if I'm within my rights.I am 24 years old dating a 26 year old man.He is the sweetest boyfriend anyone would ever wish for. I live with my awesome parents and my 15 year old autistic brother.Lets just say my brother is going through rough times at the moment with puberty and I decided to step away  and stay with my boyfriend for a while.

My boyfriend and I come from two very different envinronments.I come from a middle  class  relatively educatedfamily and inherited values usually associated with this (eating well..etc).He comes from a very lower, much less educated French Canadian family.I am not saying this to judge, not at all- its just that sometimes, with lower education and social class comes different [values.As](https://values.As) such, eating right doesn't seem to have been valued like it was for me growing up.When I mention eating right I am not talking about eating salad everyday,I just mean u dont have to be at mcdonalds or Harvey's or ""belle province"" every day.

A month ago, we went to visit his sister which had given birth to her 4 kid (24 years old),IN two hours I stayed there, she served her kids grilled cheese, popcorn extra butter,chips, and Pepsi.Its not my place to say anything but I was surprised.She seemed to think it was ok.Even my boyfriend was shocked.

Two days ago, we went out and he stopped at mcdonalds,yesterday he came back to the house with extra large poutine.He seems to think that because he is very skinny that means he is healthy.

I freaked out and yelled at him, asked him if this is the type of life he wants to live, and if we have children is that the example he would want to give? he told me when we have kids he will eat his junk food in the car before he comes home.I know it was a joke but we havent spoken since. I saw him this morning making a healthy lunch.

My boyfriend is very aware of the family circumstances he comes from and I know he wants to break the cycle in terms of education, having a good family etc.He is such a sweet hardworking individual but his eating habits are making me sick.

What can I do to help him ?

I was attending college from 2017-2019, prior to family conflict. (Family didn’t approve of my sexuality and the man that I was seeing, and they cut me off and kicked me out of their house in January 2020.) 

Fast forward to now, I’m no longer seeing my former boyfriend, I work a dead-end, $13/hour job. There’s little to no chance of getting promoted, and I am struggling to afford basic things such as rent and groceries. 

I tried to return to school this past summer by taking out loans, but my work schedule conflicted with my zoom class schedule and I ended up having to drop them. So now, not only am I without a degree, but I also owe my university about 4K before I can even sign up for any classes. 

I’m in a pretty horrible position financially. I have about 55 dollars to my name at this time. Between student loan debt, being behind on bills, and credit card debt, and medical bills I’m about 15k in debt. 

I’m in the process of finding a second job to help bring in income. But I’m concerned about my long term success. I have no degree, I don’t know any trades, and if my life continues to follow the same trajectory, I will be in the same position (or worse) a year from now.

Ever since then I’ve been feeling broken, like some part of me just isn’t functioning normal. Last night we were fooling around a bit and the feeling had went away until it suddenly hit me again. I’m not in love with him, I don’t do the feelings first thing. I’ve had someone lie when you tell them you love them. But it hurts to think that it’s not even possible. I’m scared to bring it up for so many reasons. He’ll get scared and leave me, I value our friendship way more than our sexual tension. He’ll laugh at me. He’ll only confirm that there’s no way something like that’ll happen. The list could go on. Another night he was talking about his ex and I guess the best way I could describe it was jealousy. Again, not because I’m in love with him but because she got to feel some part of him I don’t think he’ll ever feel for me. I know I need to talk to him but I don’t want him to think I’ve fallen in love when I know I haven’t but without the possibility of something more all the sexual stuff and the talk of actually doing something in person just feels like I’m being used.

579,"I’m a 20 year old college student. I went to community college for my first 2 years to save money, and then I transferred this semester to a “go away” college but I didn’t actually leave my parents home because corona made all classes online. 

People said high school would be fun, well it wasn’t. They said college would be amazing, well so far I’ve never been more bored and lonely with my life, probably because I went to cc which isn’t the typical experience. I feel like a robot, I’ve done the same thing every day for the last 7 months. The only thing I do outside of home is go to work. I work in retail, so I’ve seen how ridiculous people have been in this pandemic, so that doesn’t give me much hope for our society. 

I was reading a post about teens not spending money here on Reddit, and someone commented “well there’s gonna be a lot of angry 20 year olds when they realize they won’t be able to buy a house”. I read that and thought well shit what’s there to hope for. If I one day won’t even be able to buy a home because of the economy, what the fuck am I doing. Sure it’s just a Reddit comment, but it doesn’t help. 

Not to mention I’m a virgin male who’s never even kissed a girl, so I was hoping I’d finally be able to change that by going away to college and meeting girls my age, but that got ruined. I’m already kinda behind in that department, at this rate I’m gonna graduate college with no hint of a romance. That kinda sucks as I’ve heard it gets much harder after school. People said to me at 16 it would get better, well it hasn’t. If anything it’s gotten worse since then. 

I also don’t have many friends in my small hometown, so I was hoping to make more friends at college. Ruined. 

I worked so hard last year in community college so I could transfer on time. I took summer classes, I feel like it was all for nothing. I didn’t get a scholarship for my very high gpa, all I got is me sitting in my childhood bedroom doing online school and working for money I just save. I know it’s good to save money, that’s the only positive thing that I have going for me right now.

581,"Hey guys,

**Backstory:** I am a pretty anxious individual, although my reaction to most anxiety-inducing situations is to just shutdown and be silent. I have been 4 months free of weed, and this is the absolute longest I've gone since late 2016 (am 20 years old now, was 16 then). I've always had an amazing time on weed which made it even harder to quit. Now, I feel extremely uncomfortable around people who (in any form) do marijuana unless I know I can do something else in that situation (like play basketball or be on a walk). Not just sit around with people and watch them get fucked up and have a good time.

**Current situation:** Got asked to a get-together, then the GF's friends start talking about making Jungle Juice (hardcore mixed drink for those who don't know) and 'NEED\[ing\] to drink', as well as them doing a lot of edibles. The GF agrees. I know she wants me to go quite a bit because she wants me to meet this friend that her friend group only sees once in a blue moon, but I just don't feel comfortable at all. In social situations, I wanna be social, not extremely reclined like how I am in anxious situations. I also work the next morning starting at 8:00 am so, not one of those types of people to show up hungover as fuck to work.

The GF recognized my anxiety and said she wouldn't do any drinking or edibles (she herself said this, I didn't induce anything) just so that I'd come, but this doesn't make me feel any better to have her miss out and join me in my reclined state. I'm most likely not gonna go, but I thought I should get some opinions here as I'm deciding whether or not to go into the mindset of not turning down any social occasion (unless its super detrimental to me of course) due to our shitty global situation. Any advice?

Rest assured, the get together is less than 8 people, we follow the COVID-19 rules.

596," I failed my first year of university because of various reasons such as : depression, adhd, low self-esteem, death in my family, lockdown, i was also far from my university ect… My year has been horrible, at all levels. Ironically, my university became my safe space. When I was there, I was able to disconnect myself from all my problems. During the short amount of time, I didn't feel anxious anymore, i felt smart, happy. I made news friends and I was still in contact with my high school friends. The fact that no one knew me before played a big role in my well-being. Everything was new. I can finally be far from everything that has a link with my chaotic life.

When I failed, my depression got worse, I’ve never felt that low in my life, even after someone I loved passed away. But I could have been able to begin everything again. Until the girl that I hate the most came. I knew that she was going to pursue the same major as me butnot in the same university. I actually found out that she is going to attend the same university as me. I lost my safe space and I hate it. I feel like i was robbed. And it’s not any girl, it’s the girl who (cyber) bullied me, who pushed me out of the group friends, left me alone and came back in high school like nothing happened. I also saw her many times laughing at how I look with her brother, laughing at my name with her friends, laughing at how I dress. If I didn’t fail, I wouldn’t care because I wouldn’t see her. My campus i really really small, there is no way I won't see her. I know that the university isn’t just for me and I know that this major isn’t just for me, that’s why I’m asking you how to deal with this, please…

598,"Hi Guys. I'm having a bit of a debate and I'm not sure what to do.

My partner and I are supposed to go on vacation to a cabin in the mountains on Nov 1st. We both desperately need a vaca and are excited it will be closer to the wilderness away from people but to get there...we have to fly. Which causes the issue here. I'm not a scaredy cat in general. We both are essential employees and I have not stopped working since day 1. No one in our household has. We are very careful and don't really go places besides to work or outdoors for running or biking. I am an avid runner and very protective of my health. Everyday doesn't scare me. What DOES scare me about Corona is the airport and flying. It's not even scared really. It's just preventative. It's just a matter of fact. I have zero desire to catch a stupid virus in a closed space and be stranded states away from my home or bring it back to my loved ones.

I have zero qualms about wearing a full on tyvex hazmat suit, full face respirator gas mask type face shield type thing used for construction through out our entire 2 flights and layover. I don't care at all what anyone thinks or feels. If I get corona from living day to day life that is unavoidable. Grocery trips and work have to happen. But a closed space with poor ventilation and people from all over? I see nothing wrong with suiting up.  I've  thought about probably wearing clothes over my tyvex suit  so I look semi normal. Putting gloves on my hands. and wearing a full face respiratory mask with shield. Basically a gas mask.   I don't want to embarrass my partner and I know he would feel so embarrassed. But I really need to know, Am I being crazy? Is this wrong? 

I'm just not having it. I couldn't imagine not being able to run and do cardio. I couldn't imagine putting our family or anyone at risk. I just want to suit up and have no one care. And then enjoy my vacation.

Thoughts? Has anyone flown recently? Will I be the only person with a full gas mask basically?",07Oct2020,1
599,"Should we end our friendship?

We’re both females. She’s 21 and I’m 21.
Please read this and help me.

I think she deserves a better friend than me


She said when I asked why we don’t talk or hang out. We talked but not as much as We use. And for a whole year we didn’t meet up. So I asked her.

She said she felt like she was the one making plans and always texting. A friendship is a two way street. Not one way.

I was going college 5 days a week.on top of that I was learning to drive so I can go surprise her. Which I failed my driving tests twice now. I was preparing for uni. This was from august 2018 to June 2019.

She goes college two days, doesn’t work and her mom is away so she’s home alone with her brother.

She is free everyday.

She could’ve easily asked to meet up. Yes so could I. I know I could’ve. 

She was busy hanging out with her new best friend. They were together everyday. And post everything on Snapchat.

I felt replaced. She loved hanging out with this new friend that not once has she asked me to hang out or join.

I have never once in my whole life said no when she asked to meet up. I always said yes, I would leave work, college or anything I’m doing so I can go travel an hour to see her.

She said she wasn’t talking about the past when she said about meeting up.

So she must been talking about around 2016  to 2019.

We see each other once year, and I have to travel an hour to make those plans happen. I never once cancelled on her. I would even stay a month at hers then travel an hour back home. 

I don’t hate it, I would do anything to hang out with her even if I had to travel an 3 hours to see her.

Honestly speaking she makes the plans now that we’re older, when we were young we both did it equally and now that we’re older I don’t do it as often only because not that I don’t want to. 

I’m a home body. It’s not like I was making plans with everyone else but her.

Like I haven’t meet up with anyone, from 2017 to 2020. Even the people I went to college with. They were my college friend and we didn’t meet up outside of college.


When it comes to texting, we both text each other equally. And she agreed 100%. Which was weird because she’s the one who said she is the one who texts more and ask to meet up more. 

Our texts go on and on for days without even ending. So how can she say she’s the only one that texts.

When we were younger, she could go months without texting. And I hate that we only see each other on summer holiday and after that we don’t talk until next summer so I bought it up with her and suggest we text more. From that day we never stop texting.

I just want to know if I should stop being her friend, so she can go and be her self without worrying about me.

She’s doesn’t deserve someone like me. I think she’s better off without me.

Hi all, 

I sit here in a hopeless spiral that I’ve been in the past few years filled with hate, anger and regret. I’m so angry and sad all of the time because it feels like “nothing” is going on in my head. I feel so disconnected from reality that it feels like anything I do doesn’t feel real. I constantly retreat to this fantasy world in my head and I can’t face reality anymore. 

I’ve tried to draw back to the past and remember how I was when I was younger and I can’t. It feels like I drank too much and blacked out and just can’t remember how I was when I was younger at all. My whole life feels like a blur and I just don’t remember it.

603,"1: At what point do I not look up a word and just use context clues to figure it out? For example, I was reading something the other day and it said something along the lines of ""He brayed, 'blah blah blah'"".  I knew brayed meant some sort of said, whispered, or whatever, but I still looked it up to get an exact definition.

&amp;#x200B;

2: I find myself reading incredibly slowly (both for pleasure and academically) because I try to envision everything in my head sentence by sentence. However, I think I can stop this because yesterday I was eating lunch and thought about a scene in a book that I read and I went to go re-read that scene, and since I had a good idea of what was going on, I ended up reading like 12 pages without even noticing. How can I train myself to do this when reading books that I haven't read before?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

3: I used a notecard to cover up sentences so I could read line by line on a huge novel I just read because I feel that the words in my peripheral vision spoil the book for me, even though it's just about to happen. How can I either get over this fear of getting the book spoiled, or if it is possible, focus more on what I'm reading so that my peripheral vision won't process those words (if that makes sense)?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

4: What are you thoughts on reading two+ books at the same time? I'm getting into mythology right now, and I have two books on Norse mythology. One of them is more fun to read than informative, while the other one is much more informative and about as fun to read. I'm afraid to read these two books at the same time because I don't want to get their versions of the myths mixed up.

&amp;#x200B;

5: (feel free to skip this question as it is very broad) How can I learn and retain information? This summer I realized I sucked at geography, so I kept practicing maps over and over again until I could do all the countries. Now, having not practiced in a while, I feel like I've definitely forgot a lot (though I'm not back at square one).

However, he's started passing random comments about random things in life . The comments are not good or bad...they're just random bits of information about his life which i did not ask for.

These random facts and him asking for the same work twice irritates me. The fact that he sometimes doesn't listen to what i am telling him but goes on repeating what he said also irritates me.

He is a nice person and he's trying to be friends with me. I understand that. I don't know if i want to be friends with him. 

But today he sent me a cringey tiktok out of nowhere. These things irritate me and i feel there's an urgent need to establish some boundaries.

However, I don't want him to feel bad and lonely, and i want him to feel supported. But i don't know how to establish boundaries without stopping him from being so open to me. 

I don't want to shut him. I like how he is comfortable with me but i also don't want to establish boundaries that would permanently affect our relationship and we'd never be able to become friends.

616," **My boyfriend died of a drug overdose. It’s been a while since it happened, but I’m still struggling with an overwhelming sense of guilt.** While we had our issues, I loved him with all my heart. I was head over heels for him and cared about his happiness and well-being. We were together for years, sometimes exclusively, sometimes not. Regardless, he was my best friend. Started out as kids, and we went through a shit lot growing up together.

He had his demons, but was such a kind, beautiful, silly soul. I feel that I failed him by not being there as much as I should have during his lulls in addiction, and there were many. I was struggling with my own issues, felt like I was barely keeping head above water myself. I feel like I didn’t tell him or show him how much he meant to me. ***I can’t stop going over what I could’ve done differently to stop him from getting to where he was that night or spiraling down a dark hole again.*** *I* feel that addiction is rooted in a want to obliterate oneself. It's difficult to grapple with the idea that he might have felt unloved by the people closest to him.

**At some point shortly before all this happened, I believed that I was enabling him and gave him an ultimatum. Now I can’t stop ruminating on maybe that being out on his own played at least a part in what happened.**

These icky feelings were **compounded by the death of another close friend to suicide shortly before.** I’ve been able to get through the feelings of guilt with that much more, for some reason. Though, that one is a gut punch on several days too, and I'm only downplaying it because, well, I don't know.

*Sorry, this is half rant/ half question. I’ll try to highlight the question parts.*

***These feelings of guilt manifest throughout my life in very self-destructive ways.*** **T**he biggest problem for me initially was my drinking problem. There was a long period when I was surviving exclusively on crackers and alcohol for all my meals. I eventually started puking up blood. Went to a hospital for detox for several days. Met a woman who was dying, jaundiced, mother of two, with a short painful life due in a few months if she couldn’t stop. I spent those five days with her, and she honestly saved my life. I never take off the bracelet she gave me.

It’s been nearly a year since drinking now but I still have issues with other substances. I slipped up the other day, but I think my I guess ""ex"" boyfriend switched out this tiny bottle of alcohol with something else at some point long ago. I didn’t notice the taste because I was taking other stuff at the time.

***This absolutely destroyed me,*** **when I realized. Brought me here. He was looking out for me more than I was looking out for him, even then,** since I’ve always had a problematic, albeit milder, relationship with drinking (runs in the family).

In terms of relationships, total disaster. *Sometimes I’ll go out of my way to find someone abusive/mean. If I fancy someone, or GOD FORBID, someone shows a genuine interest in me for my personality or something substantive, I find a way to make myself undesirable.* I do it aggressively until they’re put off. I'm not nasty or anything, just a whole lot of other things. I’ve also always had a thing for degrading stuff in the bedroom (in a healthy way), but that has taken a more sinister tone since. I get attention from the opposite sex a lot, but it’s gotten to the point where I just don’t even pursue relationships or any meaningful companionship because I feel it’s unfair someone should have to deal with my issues. My career and physical health is taking a toll too. lol. Just as a quick addendum.

*But I want to share my life with someone. I want someone to sit around and watch movies with, share some joy and laughs with. I want to treat someone with that kindness and attentiveness I might not have gotten right the first time and have it reflected back. I want to be the poised, with her shit together, classy woman I once was. I want to pursue my childish dreams of being a writer. I want to have a stable, sober, happy simple life. Many things.*

And I try so hard to be better everyday, write out things I'm grateful for, take the long way home, write, color, do yoga. But it feels compulsive to just light a match and let it all burn. This behemoth dark hand of justice just sitting in the corner always. Like I need to serve a sentence or something and get my allotment of misery before I can move on, regardless of how aware I am that that's exactly what's happening.

***Anyway my questions is, if you’ve dealt with something similar, how do you break out of that thought process? How do you help yourself when the feeling to do so isn’t always consistent? Maybe some kind of activity? Stories? Any kind of advice? I guess I've been blessed to never truly deal with grief before this. And clearly, I struggle with anything compulsive.*** I'm just so damn sad, every morning.

Gratitude: throughout this, I’m still known for my humor. I love making people laugh, and I know that I repress a lot of this inner dumpster fire with a barrage of jokes. I’ve still got a circle of friends because of it. And I'm here. Posting this. Trying :)

But also saying 'I'm coming over to break up' is horrible. She's a very nice girl and I respect her and only want the best for her.

618,"When I graduated high school I originally went to a college we will call College A. It was the only school I wanted to go to and I was over the moon when I got in. About 2 months before I moved to this college I started dating a girl we will call S. 

At first everything was great. S and I were great together and I was excited to start my year at College A. Unfortunately, several really bad things happened at College A that aren’t important to the story. These things made me rely more on S and I kinda dumped all of my problems on her. Eventually things became strained between S and I and between the issues at College A and the fear of losing S, I stupidly transferred.

I now live at home and commute to a different college we will call College B. About a year ago, after I transferred to College B, S left me. I am feeling a lot less trapped and I am now aware of how toxic our relationship was on both sides. I still go to College B and I am in a great program and am getting amazing grades.

The problem is that other than my grades, my life sucks. I have 1 friend here and Covid is ruining any chances of making more for right now. I always feel trapped and feel like my parents are breathing down my neck even when I know they’re trying to give me space. My college experience has been so bad so far. Even though I’m going so much better at College B, I wish I never left College A. I miss freedom and friends. I think that if I never dated S I might not have transferred to College B. I feel so stupid and I don’t know what to do. I want to make friends here but clubs are shut down because of Covid and it’s hard to make friends when you commute to school every day. I just feel like I’m wasting the years of my life that are supposed to be so fun. Any advice?",07Oct2020,1
619,"I work from home and recently got kicked out of my brothers house. For the last week I’ve been sleeping on the streets or in a motel paid for by friends. My parents know about what’s happening, but they haven’t offered any help until today. They’re divorced and hate each other, but they said they would help only if I check myself into a mental hospital. I have a long history of mental health issues and drug abuse, but for the past few months I’ve been drug free and taking my meds. I have a psychiatrist who absolutely would have told me if I needed to go to a hospital, and I have an appointment with him next week.

I don’t want to go to the hospital because
A) this isn’t a mental health crisis
B) I have no insurance and no money
C) the hospital in my area is underfunded so there is no tv most of the time, they banned the use of computers, group therapy is almost always cancelled, there is nothing to do.
D) Coronavirus, duh?

I don’t have any other options. Should I just take their offer.

P.S. my parents are historically untrustworthy and go back on their words often, Id give it a 50/50 as to whether they’d actually help.",07Oct2020,1
620,"So my co-founder and I are first time startup owners with a brilliant concept but my co-founder blocked me on his social media while he still have some inventories and cash.

I've been reaching out for days but he still hasn't made contact. 

The thing is, we haven't really put anything to paper on legal side since the business is just running for 4 months and all are based on mutual trust. The delay is because of the pandemic and long registration time. Also, all the documents and transactions are digital copies and properly recorded aswell.

We still have clients that need deliverables in the next two-three months and I'm thinking of refunding all their cash they paid for and just close the business.

However, I don't have cash but inventories(we're a service+ goods company) I can liquidate to cover atleast half of the refund. I'm planning to use my personal money to pay the clients for the rest (worse case). 

He's been ghosting me for 2 weeks now. It may have been because of the losses and poor judgement calls on the suppliers but this is just beyond irresponsible by leaving the clients hanging.

621,"My partner has a fairly long history of mental health problems. She has ADHD, anxiety disorder and also had a long period of depression and self harm. Back when I met her last September, things were okay with her. 

Since lockdown began back in March, she and I have both noticed her mental health detoriating again (for lack of better wording). The not being able to leave the house played havoc with her ADHD, and when we were finally allowed to do things, her anxiety got quite in the way. It led to a lot of arguments about my loyalty to her in one way or another which ultimately led to me spending more time with her than I’d have liked, in retrospect, just to ensure she was happy and okay. 

She moved off to Uni 3/4 weeks ago and her mental health has got a lot worse. I feel like she’s depressed again. She’s cried randomly about ‘nothing’ a few times, often makes jokes about killing herself but with a strong air of it not actually being a joke and can get incredibly blunt with me when we’re on phone calls or over texting. Generally when I go and see her she’s okay, but this leads on to my next point. 

The thing is, she KNOWS she’s depressed, she often says ‘i need to find a therapist’ but her lack of motivation is preventing her from doing so. Her anxiety is also stopping her from doing regular, necessary day-to-day tasks. I try and talk to her but she always says she’s okay or it doesn’t matter when I try. 

I’m really starting to feel burnt out from it all. It’s been going on for 6 months and the past couple of weeks are starting to become the worst it’s been. I feel so so so horrible about this but I’m just starting to not be able to take the blunt texting and calls and the half-telling me how she feels but then not. I don’t know if she wants advice, just to vent or anything because she never gives me a definitive answer when I ask what I can do. I have issues of my own with contamination OCD that’s made a lot of things incredibly hard due to the current COVID situation. I want to be here for her but I’m quickly starting to become unsure how. 

She knows she needs to see someone but she just can’t find the motivation to and I can’t help her with that despite how much I love her and want to. I’ve started to notice myself thinking about breaking up and the fact my subconscious is thinking that hurts me so much. 

If anyone can help give me some advice on what to do, it would be so massively appreciated. Thank you.",07Oct2020,1

624,"Hi everyone,

When I was 22 I decided to delete social media and steer away from a lot of old relationships that were built around drugs and partying. I felt too much of a connection to my old self when hanging with some of these people so I had to move on. As a result, I no longer have a strong social friend group and deep relationships that I ever so crave. This paired with working from home has caused me to feel so helpless and alone in this world. Apart of me feels like it was the right thing to do because I now have goals and aspirations and on the other side of the coin I feel like I've lost something so important to the healthy growth of any human being.  

I've researched things like [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) and Eventbrite but just can't really find anything that interests me. I love to read, have deep conversations, fascinated by habit formation and psychology, very interested in starting my own business, and I love nature and going for walks.

625,"Quick recap: my dad was gone for over a year to figure citizenship stuff with my grandma, mom has been wanting a divorce, found out she was cheating a while back while he was gone. My mom is gone a lot and a month ago she said she would start sleeping at grandma's place with my youngest brother. I am getting more painful info from my dad. My grandma on my dad's side had a heart attack and a brain stroke because of my mom and yesterday she fell in feces and couldn't get up. My dad couldn't call an ambulance since my grandma lives in Croatia. So he had to call her neighbors but they didn't pick up and he lost internet suddenly. And my mom is cutting my dad out financially. And my grandpa on my mom's side is dying and got his foot amputated. My dad is losing money thanks to my mom and she's making blatant comments about it. She says she cares about us, but if she really cared about us, she wouldn't be cheating on our dad and she would find a better job instead of making a few dollars as a condo worker. She loathes taking me for check ups and hates buying necessities for us. It took her forever to agree to help me get some new clothes since I'm running low. But whenever she does, she gets the cheapest and ugliest things at a crummy thrift store. I have to use stupid bladder pads as menstrual pads. My dad is doing my best to get necessities for my siblings and I despite his unemployment. If it weren't for him, we would be homeless. Reference: I'm 16F, middle brother is 12, youngest is 4 with Down Syndrome. My dad and I fear that she's sleeping at the other guy's place while taking my poor little brother. I'm concerned for his safety. My mom even admitted prior to my dad coming back that she didn't want him here and that she doesn't need him, she would also make blatant remarks about wanting other men which angered me. I don't care about my mom anymore and I'm only nice to her because I need money, she's not even helping me with driving or college. Even when I was 15 and 10 months, she said I was too young to learn. I do chores ( almost all) because I know for a fact she's too busy with her boy toy to do them. I'm so glad my dad is back. We want to move far away together but my dad can't drive and we don't have much money. About my therapist, I told her all this ( she knows about the cheating ) and I feel as if my mom paid her not to disclose information. She doesn't seem to want to take immediate action. Over text she just said "" sorry to hear. Looking forward to our next session. Stay in school"". Group counseling will not work because my mom is a psycho. I am scared and I don't know where to go.

Okay SO - in September I started studying journalism in university and I don’t like it. I don’t want to be a journalist, never have. I would like to work in the entertainment industry and I suppose a journalism degree would help, but I genuinely just don’t like studying it at all and with every lecture I hate it more and more and can’t even make myself care about what we’re talking about.

So here’s what I need advice on - should I

1) Drop out, get a job, work until I have enough money and until the pandemic allows me to travel somewhere far. Then, with this program in my country, that helps young people go to a variety of countries to work or volunteer there, go somewhere far for a year to travel and work/volunteer and try to *find myself*

OR

2) Play it safe and stay in university, go studying for a semester abroad maybe and just finish these four years studying and working something I don’t exactly want.

629,"Okay so i used to be in this friend group and i got really close with one of the guys in the group, and in said group, we were all really close and affectionate and would hold hands/cuddle, and sometimes (with consent) kiss each other (but only like pecks for truth or dare or whatever). 
one night we were at our friends house and i got high and he was sober and we were holding hands and i was laying on his chest and we were listening to music. this was very normal for us and was completely platonic (so i thought). but then he started making out with me, i didn’t know how to say no and i didn’t want to hurt his feelings so i pulled away and started talking about something but he ignored me and kept making out with me, i kept pulling away and trying to just lay my head on his chest / change the subject because i did NOT want to kiss him and i didn’t have feelings for him. (also i was not in a good, clear mindset and he was.) i went home and he made me kiss him before i left. after i got home he texted me and asked if he had made me uncomfortable. he was my friend and i didn’t want to hurt his feelings so i lied and said he hadn’t, and that i just wasn’t in the best mood and i apologized. we never talked about it again but he started slowly pushing me out of the friend group after that night. he never apologized until, a few months after i had left the friend group, i messaged him and apologized to HIM for leading him on (but i’m not sure if i did because what we did was normal in that friend group and literally everyone else did it too) and he said it was okay and that he felt bad about that night. his apology seemed sincere but it was only a half apology and i basically had to ask him for an apology. i understand there are 2 sides to every story and he may have experienced things differently than me but i have flashbacks to that night almost every day and it really fucked me up and i just need an honest opinion on if that counts as assault and if i have a reason to be upset or if he wasn’t really in the wrong and i’m being melodramatic. i would really appreciate and feedback, thank you for reading this if you did.

633,"So there’s a lot to unpack here. So let’s give a back story. My family and I have a... decent relationship and I love them very much. They’ve helped me whenever I asked for almost anything. So through some fun set of events, I ended up in a different state than them for work which is amazing since I’m able to support myself (though I’m on my parents’ phone bill still) in a nice apartment and still have fun on the side. A few months ago, however, my parents moved into the same state to be closer to me and my lil bro who is going to college in the same state. They are currently living with a relative a few hours away and realize that he is causing them to go a bit crazy. In response, my parents decide to try to move out early which fails due to one of them not getting the job they wanted as well as getting laid off of the job they are currently working in a few months. At the same time of this, I have been in a relationship for a few months that seems to be going on a much better road than any other relationship I’ve ever had and finally introduced to my parents. My parents have then in the few interactions between my family and her that they don’t like her which hit her and me pretty hard. So hard in fact that the relationship almost ended the day we found out. My parents knowing the state of my strained relationship that same week decided that I should take on my bills by myself in order to be independent from their opinions and whatnot. Cool. Yet, they still don’t like her and she very well knows that so she feels uncomfortable around my fam which is understandable based off of her past relationships with other people’s parents. After the destruction of the relationship which is now hanging by a strand, my parents ask me to move in with them despite everything that has happened fairly recently. I know that if I move in with my parents I’ll be able to save a lot of money, but if I don’t I know my relationship is over and I feel the entire argument I had with my family to prove how I’m an adult now and they shouldn’t meddle in my relationships would’ve been for nothing. My habits would have to change and I wouldn’t be able to live the same lifestyle I have now.

643,"I am a 30 year old male. A girlfriend of 10 plus years  as well as a son who is almost at 10 too .I have always had problems with depression but lately feel less depressed and more angry. I tend to put other people's needs ahead of myself, especially those of my girlfriend and my son. Recently though I have been feeling spiteful about the lack of reciprocation or maybe just life in general. I will try my best to explain in the following paragraphs.

My girlfriend and I both graduated from the same High School. I work a typical job from Monday through Friday. She does not work due to a physical disability that she has had since childhood. She can do normal tasks as long as they aren't too strenuous ( if they are too strenuous and I cause her pain). Overall I tend to do most of the work in the household. I do all of the cooking and majority of the cleaning to try to make things easy on her. She is a good person overall but I feel like she just has little to no interest in me.

 My son is a wonderful boy but due to the covid-19 pandemic we have been forced to do online schooling with him. We have always had to help him study in the past because he doesn't tend to quickly grasp new things easily, but with enough studying we have never struggled too hard in the past. With online schooling I have now found myself in the role of teacher as well as the normal things we must do. I find myself having to do almost all of it because his mother claims that she is unable to. I don't make a lot of money with my job and with his mother not working we can't afford any form of tutor or help for him.

I feel completely overwhelmed having to not only work but also do the housework along with almost all of my sons schooling. If I try to to talk to her about our relationship or any of the stresses I feel like I go through on a daily basis she just breaks down crying. She always either accuses me I've trying to change her or begins to talk down about herself. I have never tried to change her ina any way that I am aware of and it makes me feel horrible when I make her cry. I feel guilty for asking her to do more but at the same time I feel spiteful that she only thinks about herself. Then as stupid as it sounds I feel guilty about my own emotions of spite.

I don't want to end our relationship and I want to be able to help both her and my son as much as I can. I just feel like I am wearing thin though. I don't know what to do about feeling overwhelmed with all of the responsibility, or the lack of empathy I feel like I'm getting from my girlfriend.

645,"I'm 16, and have been struggling with my mental health for more than a year now, but never reached out for professional help before. As much as I can name it, I mainly have problems with anxiety and low self-esteem, I always think I'm less, I have no values as a human, or how it would be better if I was just dead - and it scares me, because I know it's not true, and this makes me feel stupid too. I also feel constant guilt for lying to my parents and hiding who I really am, because they were so rejecting towards my interests in the past they barely know anything about me at this point (which they obviously don't know either). It's a miracle they let me go to the psychologist, too, but told me clearly how they think it is a stupid idea. They generally don't believe in mental illnesses and other things, so they don't know about my conditions. 

Long story short, I had a really bad panic attack at school on Monday and had to ask for my head teacher's help because I missed half of a lesson because of it. She was really supportive, let me skip my next one too but also demanded on connecting my school's psychologist, who gave me an appointment for tomorrow morning.

647,"This one is a bit weird for me, so I'm hoping for an outside perspective. 

I have two coworkers that are both very superstitious and it has now gotten to the point where it (mildly) interrupts my day. Not enough to cause a fuss, but enough that it's reaching a point where I feel I need to say/do something and not sure if it's going to make me an asshole for doing it. 

The main problem is that whenever someone says something about a certain situation / status / way things are going, I hear from both cubicles near me: ""Don't say that! You better knock on wood!!""

They literally want me to knock on my desk. Okay. No big deal, I guess. It never really came up too often before. You know the kind of statements that happen day to day in an office. ""Oh man, the weather is so nice today!""

Boom, my two coworkers will interrupt and tell that person to go knock on wood before they jinx the good weather. 

Except it's getting out of hand. I work in accounting. I problem solve. Literally part of my day is discussing problems, projections and resolution factors for certain things. Even making a statement like: ""Looks like this account issue is going to be resolved by the end of this week!"" will result in being told that I better knock on wood. 

I've tried playing along for a bit at first when it wasn't so bad, but it's gotten *a lot* worse lately. Everything becomes a point of concern. Unless it is a 100% positive statement with no hint about the future, it will get remarked on that someone is 'tempting fate' or 'going to jinx things'. 

My coworkers are 20+ years my elders. 

I've tried to brush it off a few times, especially when it gets to be like 5x a day. It's still happening. I'm not superstitious in the least, and actually find the notion of being expected to act in these ways a bit invasive, you know? These aren't my rituals. I don't want to do these rituals.

648,"I’m 25 and my friend is 26, we hang out often and it’s always really fun. The problem is whenever I need support. I’m always there for him when he needs it to offer a should or advice but everytime I need it it’s just... not happening. 

Like for example, my state has mandated masks for employees even in areas where customers aren’t allowed. My job is VERY physical and I’m overweight so I told my friend how it’s gonna suck to wear a mask for 8 hours but that of course I’ll do it. It turned into a thing where he’s complaining because masks make his face sweaty and how it’s awful and he doesn’t know what he’s gonna do-

He’s unemployed. He goes for groceries maybe once a week. That’s it. He’s worrying about when he eventually gets a job even though he doesn’t know what kind of job it will be. 

I had plans to visit my family this year but of course they got canceled and I texted him saying I won’t be seeing my mom. He said something like “oh that sucks” then changed subject. 
His girlfriend is going on a trip for two days and he hasn’t stopped mentioning it everyday for the past two weeks even though it’s happening IN A MONTH. I’m out of encouraging words, I don’t know what else to say. 

I was listening to a song that made me really sad and texted him that I just realized I haven’t seen my family for Christmas in over 4 years due to living in different countries. He didn’t comment anything about it and just started saying how he’s feeling sad because this years thanksgiving is going to be so different because of COVID and how he’s so sad about it. (His family is still doing thanksgiving though, they’re just not inviting extended family which he doesn’t get along with anyway). 

It’s little things like this that makes me feel like he’s just trying to one up me in my inconvenience which is ridiculous as it is. Other than that he’s actually very supportive when it comes to actions, he’s helped me move, helped search for my dog when he got lost, he’s very thoughtful when it comes to gifts, and I think most importantly... he’s my only friend. I don’t want to lose him but I feel like I’m getting annoyed at all the little one ups. 

I just need advice on how to handle this. I’m willing to put up with it to keep him as a friend but i don’t know what else to say.",07Oct2020,1

651,"I had this friend 2 years ago we fell out after lots of things going wrong I still feel guilty to this day but today in lesson our teacher asked about a trip and I couldn't remember what she was talking about (I forget almost everything after a few months) so as my other friend was trying to bring back the memory. I thought about the time I threw away someone's belonging accidentally (I also felt horrible) and asked if that was the same trip, where my exfriend cut in and said it was
That brought a foggy memory where I feel like I just ruined the trip for her and a year of her life because everytime she looks back she might think of how much of a mess I was and I don't want that for her. I want her to have good memories and I'd rather she didn't know who I was at all.",07Oct2020,1
652,"I'm gonna start off by saying this is probably gonna be a rant asking for advice about more than one thing specifically...

Anyway, I [17M] am in a very weird position right now. I live in the UK, I'm in my second and final year of sixth form with my most important and difficult exams at the end of the year. My grades were always good in secondary school and I did very little work but got an average of 7.2 at the end of secondary school (weird new UK grading system for GCSE exams, essentially 7 = A). I've never been very motivated - I've always hated the school environment and am not really a people person. But my motivation this year has taken a massive fucking hit. I have no motivation and no aspirations. My grades are abominable, I cannot for the life of me concentrate in class and my exams arent far away. I have no idea what I want to do after... university maybe? I probably wont get the grades for it. I hate the subjects I'm studying. I hate my school and all their ridiculous policies. I've never enjoyed school, but I used to atleast enjoy going home and getting sucked into video games for the evening. Now I just stare at my phone or youtube or a blank fucking screen with no motiviation to even play a video game. I struggle to get out of bed in the morning. I'm bitter, and have a sarcastic rude attitude towards everything nowadays. Its destroying the few friendships I have. I hate myself and my self esteem is rock bottom.  I self harmed with a razor once, but threw that away. I do hit myself sometimes, I currently have a painful ulcer and a bit of a bruise where I hit myself across across mouth. It's easier than using a blade.


I dont feel like I can tell my parents how I feel. Not because they're not supportive, but because my older brother is severely mentally ill in so many aspects. As I write this I can hear him making himself throw up in the bathroom next door. I wont get into his extreme plethora of mental health issues, but my parents have been stressed to the eyeballs with him for a long time and I cant add to their stress. They've spent thousands on therapy.... They cant have two mentally ill children, so I have to hide how I feel. I can hide it. He can't.


Onto a more trivial and stupid issue that's been weighing on my mind more than it should. I've had feelings for a girl my age for... 2 and half years? 3 years now? We used to talk regularly, but now we havent spoken to each other in person for about a year. We see each other about and might give each other a friendly smile or whatever, but nothing more than that. I tried keeping in contact via instagram and whatnot and we messaged back and forth fairly regularly for a while. We'd arranged to both meet up as we happened to be going on holiday to the same place and I thought... maybe she might've had some interest in me? Anyway then covid hit and obviously that didnt happen, then we fell out of contact. 

I know its fucking stupid and my mental state isnt really in a place to be thinking about a relationship but I cant get her outta my head. I know I'm just a dumbass teenager and whatnot and teenage relationships dont last but that doesnt change the fact that I cant stop thinking about her. For close enough to 3 damn years. I wanna talk to her again but dont know how because I'm socially awkward as fuck.

I'm just lost and burnt out at the moment and my mind is an absolute blur. So... if you read this far.... I know it's a lot of shit but... any advice for a stupid teen on the internet?",07Oct2020,1
653,"I've been at this company for over five years now. I was recently ""promised"" a promotion by my boss, but fast forward a few weeks and it's as if that conversation never took place. He did recently say that he'll look into what he can do for me, but he was pretty clear I wouldn't be getting a promotion, even though my responsibilities have greatly changed in the last few months due to a person leaving.

I was really upset when I was told that the promotion wouldn't happen and started to hate-search for other positions and I came across one that fit me perfectly, except it's in a completely different state. I decided to apply for it anyway, figured I could at least use it as some form of leverage for my current job, but now I've gotten pretty far into the interview process and I'm starting to really wonder if I should actually be taking the position. It's a much bigger company, I'm pretty sure I'd have a lot more opportunity to grow and move upwards there, and I'm getting pretty damn tired of being told one thing at one point and then having it change a few weeks later at my current job (this isn't the first, second, or third time something similar has happened with my boss).

My main issue with taking this position (assuming I'd even get it) is that I've lived in this area for over ten years, I do like it here, I just bought a house that I love, and I'm pretty mentally and physically exhausted from already moving once this year, going through major renovations after the move, and just 2020 being a bitch in general... so I'm not really sure if I could even handle going through a major life change like this right now. Plus I'd probably have to move by myself at first while my SO finds a job/wraps up his business here. But I'm also worried that I would be giving up a really good opportunity by declining the position.

656,"So recently, a friend of mine said something about his parents hitting him. At first I thought he was joking, but then he told me he was serious. When I mentioned getting the police or CPS involved, he got mad and told me if I did, I was never allowed back to his house and that we wouldn’t be friends anymore. Normally, I wouldn’t let that stop me, but this guy in question has been known to be dramatic, and/or exaggerate or just completely to get attention (I assume).

657,"So my boyfriend(20) and I (18) have been in a long distance relationship since I was in my freshman year of Highschool (13). To make things simple we’ll call him A and me Mello. I live in Florida I have been blessed with a family that is well off but not him, we live in an apartment, got food stamps, 2 cars live is great, there has never been a day were I went hungry, my dad gives me gifts every few months life is great while he lives in New Jersey and his “family” his horrible and nasty but also poor I say “family” because his mother ran away from her abusive boyfriend (his father) when she was 18 and met this family and they took her in, in exchange for their safety she would be a live in unpaid maid.

He grew up around these people who didn’t like him because he was an out of wedlock baby so they forced him to clean too and if it wasn’t done right he was locked in his room or the basement. They’d restrict him of food and “luxury items” like clothes, shoes, backpacks etc. He grew up being sort of a loner and not many friends so he comes of as cold. Anyways back to the point these people told him he’s not allowed to get a license because he’d “leave our happy family” then when he was old enough they told him he couldn’t get a job because “he’s straying from the family”.

Then I came along and we started talking and soon started dating his mother said it had been years since she seen a smile on he son’s face. The family did not like this and so game him more responsibilities and chores and feeding him less and letting him sleep less. He eats 3 days out of the week and gets maybe five hours worth of naps through out the day. They call him lazy and worthless for being tired as you can guess he started talking to me less and less and more and more busy with their shenanigans. It put a huge strain on our relationship that wasn’t there before. And I’m so so worried because I feel helpless he doesn’t have any friends and I want to help, and save us.

I would like to know what I could do. I’m trying to find a job so I can get him away from those people but i don’t know what else to do and I’m at my wits end with these people. Any advice would be nice",07Oct2020,1

659,"I’m not really sure where or how to start this and I’m not sure that this will be entirely coherent because my mind is really scrambled and I’m really struggling to figure out exactly what to do now.

I (18m) have a pretty disconnected life from my father (37m), we live under the same roof but there’s never been any real emotional or for that matter any sort of connection between us, we’ve just kind of lived together for around 5-6 years now. Anyways, a few days ago my father decided to rummage through my belongings in my room and found a pipe, grinder and a few other things used for smoking. Now I didn’t think this was going to be a big deal because his girlfriend (24f) smokes literally every single day, and obviously that isn’t an issue with him. Also, this is the the only reason I ever decided to try smoking in the first place. 

Then yesterday came, and we had a “talk” where he said that I’m doing nothing with my life and more importantly that if I continue then I’m not going to be able to live with him. Now I tried to argue and explain that I work 6 days a week, and that just last week I was accepted to university for the fall next year.

I tried to bring up the fact that his girlfriend smokes everyday and he just ignored it and kept trying to say how unproductive my life is. 

I’m really scared and I don’t know what to do or say, moving in with my dad was supposed to be the stability in my life that I was never able to have with my other family.

I was working working  with a telecom, I was more of a maintenance guy, if there is a server outage in the site we are the guys that are called to go check on it and fix it. Things were going well for 5years until this year when the whole COVID 19 thing became an issue, they were talks in the office about a possible layoff but living in a country where the government doesn’t care, the law doesn’t even care for or favor an employee, we prayed the rumors wouldn’t be true and continued working normally. Fast forward to Monday 5th 2020 about 15 of us got laid off just like that, the explanation being the office couldn’t afford to keep some workers due to the whole COVID thing. It came as a shock but we were already a kind of expecting it. Many might say I should sue the office , take it up and all that but sadly my country is full of corruption and any attempt to try to take this up won’t even go anywhere, I live in a country where the minimum wage is barely $47, while the politicians are one of the richest in the world, that’s to explain the level of corruption here..

673,"Please help, I desperately need advice on this situation. 

I landed my first graphic design job around The beginning of 2020. I am a 4.0 student and I take work very seriously. I was excited about this job up until my boss started to target me. My coworker started around the same time as me, holds the same job title, but my boss treats them better than me and I don’t know why. 

When I first started it began with my boss constantly asking me to do things for the both of them. I would run errands, take their designs to get proofed, make phone calls despite not having much information or knowing anything about what I was calling about , and basically do anything they didn’t want to get up and do themselves. In the beginning I brushed it off to petty work but it has progressed to the point where my boss will not do anything the requires them to leave their office sometimes even refusing to answer the phone. I run almost every single errand and never complain. 

The next problem I noticed was the nit picking with my designs. My coworker brings something to my boss and it’s immediately perfect, but whenever I bring something, minuscule things are wrong. To the point where I will be asked to move things around by the centimeter multiple times before anything is approved. To make it worse, everything I have learned in school has been thrown out of the window. They do not design based off industry standard. Everything I create gets approved based off of if she “likes it” or not. It doesn’t matter if I create an effective design if she personally doesn’t like it. Just recently she made me correct things over six times and get it proofed twice by other management (whom found no issues) until it was finished. Once finished and I left for the weekend I came back to be screamed at about things wrong with my design that my boss never pointed out to begin with. I have proof of the original request and nothing she yelled at me about was requested when I was originally tasked with creating the design. It’s almost as if instead of actually correcting issues with my design, or noticing  things to add, my boss picks random things to mess with me.  I know my boss does this intentionally because there have been points where my coworker would bring the same design as me to get approved and hers would be approved and mine would somehow be wrong. Anything she thinks I made is immediately wrong. 

Things have finally progressed to the point where my boss will assign me multiple long term projects then continue to pile things up on me despite knowing I already have a lot on my plate. I cannot finish anything without her giving me more things to do immediately thus pushing my work back even further. Not to mention the fact that she refuses to fairly review my work and that makes the design time take even longer.  She has also started giving me work the day before it’s deadline making it so I have no time to get it done. When I push through and finish it she again picks random things that are wrong with it not allowing me to finish anything in time. I cannot help but feel like she is trying to sabotage me. 

The worst of it came once COVID began. Our office was not allowed to work form home and things got slow. Laziness became a habit and now that things have picked up again, every difficult assignment has been given to me while my boss and coworker have excessive amounts of down time.my boss makes personal phone calls, browses social media, and colors while I work. She will occasionally assigns my coworker projects as well but they are always significantly easier than the things I am given and are approved almost immediately. 

This week is what is finally breaking me. I have been screamed at over things I did wrong that I knew nothing about, constantly asked to run errands, make phone calls, and have been targeted by her nonstop. I have broke down and cried in the bathroom twice. I don’t understand what I’m doing wrong. I show up every day on time. I say yes to everything she asks, and do everything I can to just stay afloat. I excel in school and have made president list every semester. My degree is specifically in graphic design while my coworkers isn’t. I don’t want to brag about myself but this is a field I am confident in and I know what I’m doing.  Does anyone else see the problem here? Should I just throw in the towel? Job opportunities in my field here are scarce but I’m willing to work any job at this point as long as I get treated like a human being.",07Oct2020,1

679,"This is a throwaway and I didn’t know who else to ask. 

This morning, we were talking about ~kinks~ and somehow the topic of rape came up. He expressed that there were some people that have sexual fantasies about rape. Immediately, I shot back. As a survivor myself, I don’t do too well on topics of sexual abuse and I get really uncomfortable. I tried to explain something to him that I don’t think I can quite explain to myself. But what I did manage to express was that it was wrong to have such a kink. Now, I understand I should have no judgement, and I usually don’t— what you’re into is your business— but this felt different. Then I asked him if he had this fantasy and he dodged the question— trying to explain that if “both partners consent to it, then it’s okay”. But I think I may have been a little hardheaded. I was uncomfortable. I asked him again and he kept dodging until I finally put my foot down and said “it’s a yes or no question”. He expressed yes and I got upset. 

Eventually I shut down and told him that I was uncomfortable and that I couldn’t quite explain what I was trying to say but that there was a “fine line”. Keep in mind we weren’t yelling at each other, we usually don’t, but we were quite stern with one another. You could definitely feel the tension. He kept pressing me to have the conversation because he was trying to “understand” and make me “understand”. But I wasn’t getting it. And, truthfully, I still don’t. Then he started saying that I was “judging” him for his kinks, and I thought, yes, if it were something like “I like when people call me daddy and smack me” then I’d understand a bit more. But the idea of having a fantasy of taking advantage of someone (he laid out the scenario as the partner being asleep) while they can’t consent is not right. 

I am well aware of our age difference but have always considered myself (and by others) to be “mature” for my age. This is the first relationship in which I feel heard and like we are growing together. With this, however, I also understand that there might be some conversations that I am not ready for or topics that I don’t quite understand. 

My partner has dated his fair share of people — given the fact that he is seven years older than me. Like I said, this is the first relationship I have been in that feels mature and secure. We have officially been together for 3 months, dating foe 5 but we have known each other for two years— so it feels like forever, now. He’s expressed that he has had the opportunity to explore different pleasures. 

I guess what I’m wondering is, how can I have this conversation? I am not okay with it, but I would like to understand. Or am I missing or misunderstanding something? 

Note: I have not talked to my partner about my experiences with sexual assault as it is something that 1) I do not feel ready for and 2) something that I have (unhealthily suppressed). I have alluded to it in passing but have never delved straight into it.",07Oct2020,1
680,"So in the past week I’ve gotten to having labored breathing, lost sense of smell and body aches, however there is no fever. My parents think that if I don’t have a fever that I don’t have COVID. On the other hand I cannot smell anything, even those nasty new strong smelling hand sanitizers from Kroger and target. Anyway, I went to the school nurse today ( she is a qualified nurse at my private school) and she sent me home after I told her my symptoms, went on with this talk about not having each symptom per patient, then called my parents and told them that I would be home soon. Anyway, I get home and my dad says, “She told me she doesn’t think you have COVID” for whatever reason, and it was a blatant lie, as I stood next to her the whole time she was on a phone call with him, and she actually ASKED him to have me get a COVID test. And aside from my parents being conspiracists about COVID and thinking it’s impossible for anyone close to them to catch it, they also initially refused the idea that I have depression. With that, I had to literally beg them for months to let me go to a doctor, and they were so confident that I wasn’t depressed that they did it just to amuse me. Surprise surprise, the doctor says I am depressed and gives me antidepressants. Anyway how am I supposed to convince them to let me get tested?",07Oct2020,1
681,"my boyfriend and i have a great relationship, lots of laugh, trust, honesty, fun and pure comfort. Yesterday we were fine, dinner, laughs, bed, cuddles, a normal everyday night.. every morning when before he leaves for work, he leaves me a little note and he kisses me goodbye.

this morning i wake up, dont remember a kiss, no note on the table, and his bathroom bag is gone, i dont really think much of it. so i send him a text, ""forget to kiss me ;) ? hope you have a good day , i love you so much :) "" no response, which i dont much get a response anyway cause hes busy at work. so i go to work, send him another text. hours later... nothing, weird. hes ignoring me, cause hes been online.. okay also weird. 

he texts me a few hours later says ""hey. when will you be home "" i say soon as soon as im done what im doing"" ""ok, im going out with my mom to my aunts tonight"" i respond ""okay, is everything okay?"" he says ""i think i need some time to myself, im gonna have thanksgiving with them this weekend too"" i say okay, can we talk cause this seems like its not a text converstation. he says ""i wont have time to see you today cause my mom is getting me as soon as im done work, i think i need to spend the rest of this week alone"" i ask ""did i do something wrong"" and he says ""you didnt do anything wrong, i just need some time to myself"" i said okay , i love you. no response. 

he has his own place, but for our entire relationship always always wanted to be here everyday and everynight. i know he sometimes get bad anxiety and needs time to himself, but its only ever a couple hours, not a few days..

so, now im sitting here completely confused, and upset, im gonna let him have his time, but im scared this is gonna go bad. hes always talking about what me and him are doing in the future and how he wants to buy a house soon together and how much he loves me.. but i don't know what to think of this situation..",07Oct2020,1

687,"This sounds like a generic problem at first, but it's embarrassing to go into the full extent of detail.

I'm a senior in high school and still am having trouble securing a close friend group; for some time, I've tried to associate myself with various groups of people but felt like I never fully fit in with any of them. I feel lonely very often and have struggled with depression/ suicidal thoughts for around two years; thankfully I have recently gotten counseling and things are slowly improving. 

I had also been done some cringey and attention seeking things that haunt me, like spamming my grade's emails list with random stuff and being weird towards a few people ...for example, I used to constantly email someone I crushed on at the time and it got so annoying that I got reported for harassment. Something similar happened a few months later, when I slid into depression and reached out to a person I then vaguely knew; he listened to my venting until my complaining got annoying/repetitive and the person cut me off. I then spent nearly the next YEAR messaging and spamming this person to apologize, and then my intention shifted to being more malicious- I wanted to annoy this person into interacting with me. After I got hit with a wave of immense guilt, I went back to trying to regain their friendship. 

The saga of cringe continues.. literally yesterday I sent the poor bastard a 700+ word apology and after being done I felt disgusted with the level of commitment I have to someone who doesn't want to be my friend anyway (and for good reasons.) I was basically a crazy ex but to someone I never dated or really was friends with.

I made a lot of mistakes during the past several years and have long struggled with regret, to the point where those feelings would prevent me from falling asleep, and cause me to cry multiple times a week (sometimes multiple times a day.) 

I've told myself I'd change several times but I never stuck with it and I feel trapped in a state of loneliness, fear that I'll never make genuine friends, and the weird desire to continue spamming people. Please help.",07Oct2020,1

690,"I met a girl my age (I’m also a girl) when I went into university. At that time we were around 17. I only broke the ice with her when we were supposed to form a group for a course. From there, I didn’t plan to stick together for other things, but she was the one who invited me to lunch. So we became more than just acquaintances and got really close. We had common interests and sense of humour, so the friendship went really smooth. 

Unfortunately, at that time I was also battling with depression. I told her about it casually because I didn’t want her to think I’m a creep. She was neutral about it and nothing much happened after that. As months went by, we were like an inseparable pair. We did everything together and went through rough times together (well sorta). She was kinda supportive of my depression but I wasn’t sure if it was my head fooling me but I had a feeling that I was burdening her and that she didn’t want to have a friendship with a person with problems. Sometimes, I also felt that she hides things from me (like things that she benefits from), but other times I feel like she’s such a nice person to me and care for me. But usually I’m the one who texts her first like a real loner because I didn’t have any other friends. She is an extrovert, so I understand that she wants to make more friends than just me, and I felt stupid for holding her back. I feel really stupid of myself. 

Now it really sounds like I’m the culprit. But that’s not the end. Most of the time in our “friendship”, I felt and I bet it’s just not me over-reacting but she likes getting the attention to herself. Like If I was with her, and there were a group of other friends or officials, she became the spokesperson and I just listen (me being an introverted person). Bcus she “knows” how to make people like her and she feels proud of it. Ooh I bet she was really proud of herself. But sometimes when in class and I voice my opinion, it seemed like she’s not comfortable when I’m having the spotlight. It was weird. I felt like she was a narcissist and once when she just learned the term ‘narcissist’, she said so herself that she’s kinda is a narcissist. But I don’t really know how to judge good or bad so I don’t want to think bad of her.

As far as I can remember, one day I just woke up and thought to myself “I should have my life another way.” and bam starting that day I just ghosted her. Having zero social skills, I didn’t really realise the consequences of my actions to others. I literally didn’t know that someone would be upset from that kind of treatment. Weeks go on, until finally we talk again and that is only because she was the one who wanted me back. Our “friendship” wasn’t as strong as it was before. Once I planned to go and grab dinner together with her, she said that she was saving money, so we didn’t go out. Later that night, a little bird told me that she was out with some guy friends having dinner together. I was so upset I never ask for anything anymore from her.

Months after that, we rarely talk, generally because we did different things in uni, so we had no time for hangouts. but also because we both knew we got weary of each other.

Now, I think I am a better version of myself without her. I’m a president of a club and I have good social skills talking to people and surprisingly have many guys crushing on me. I don’t feel invisible anymore. I think she’s also in a good state too, she went on a student exchange &amp; won a competition, I’m quietly happy for her.

Even though we’re both in many common groups in WhatsApp, I have a feeling that she’s not going to say anything if I was involved in the conversation. I do the same too if she was in any conversation. It’s like we don’t want to remember each other. And it hurts my soul if her name pops up on notifications. She be making unfunny jokes with some people and it just bothers me to have that in my phone. It’s just both annoying and hurtful. I just don’t know why.  Since she knows how to make people like her with her charming approach, I’d feel like a rock if compared talking to me and talking to her. It really do feel like I’m a supporting character. I feel like the reconciliation wasn’t perfect and that there is no ending. and yet I don’t want to talk to her ever again, I just want to move on. But this feeling of ‘unfinished’ keeps lingering in my mind. 

I don’t even know if I’m guilty. I think I am, since I ghosted her. But I had no social skills back then that if I were given a second chance to turn back time, I wouldn’t repeat the thing I did. I know that no matter how much assurance I get from the internet, it still wouldn’t shut my insecurities. Just what should I do to move on and leave the emotional baggage?

I’m sorry for making this too long.

TL;DR I ghosted a friend who’s proud of herself because I had zero social skills but I feel guilty for doing that. How can I ever move on?",07Oct2020,1

698,"Alright could get long here..  but context is always good. 

My brother has been the bully of my life in the past, and all through childhood our relationship was rather rocky. But as we've grown up our relationship has developed and I care about this person.

I visited home (im out of province) just a few months ago, in between work contracts, and while I was home I realized how mean everyone is to each other at home. Both my brothers and their significant others are so rude to one another its insane. Quick to snap, quick to blame, quick to criticize. 

This past time I went home.. Him and his pregnant wife got in a huge fight that resulted in my brother screaming at the top of his lungs with me and his kids in the other room that , ""he hates his wife, he hates his kids, he hates his life,"" and he, ""just wants to drive himself in front of a semi."" I had to see the look in my nieces eyes when she heard that her dad hates her.

I sat with them on the couch. Calming them (her little brother might be still to young to understand) and letting them know that dad didn't mean it. I had some serious thoughts of taking my niece out of this situation and raising her myself. I however did not. 

My mom messaged me last night about them fighting again. Resulting in him storming off and telling his wife, and my niece that they can go fuck themselves. And if they try calling... he's gonna drive head on into another vehicle. 

My brother isn't a bad guy.
Hes always been quick with his temper.

699,"My girlfriend (who is turning 18 in a few months) and her younger sister (12F) is being verbally and psychologically abused by both of her parents. They are threatening to send her to a suicide facility even though she most definitely does not have suicidal thoughts. Yesterday they called the cops on her for a lost credit card and claimed that she ""stole"" it. All the police did was make matters worse. The cops just yelled at both sisters because they were ""disrespectful"" and should be grateful that they have a nice house, car, etc. They traumatized the younger one all because her dad thought my girlfriend stole something. After the cops left the dad just ended up cancelling the card. What should've been the first choice was actually the last choice. He only called the police to ""settle"" a petty argument with his daughter. 

Today, my girlfriend is woken up by her mother. Her mom wakes her up, is video recording, and is going through her room and messing everything up. Even when my girlfriend's room is ""messy"" it is usually not that bad at all. Her mom says her room is too messy and that it smells. So her mother threatens to call the health department (which is clearly a bluff), but instead calls one of her business associates to the house. They are forcing her to move her room from upstairs to downstairs. As of right now I have no idea what is going on in that house, but I know it is nothing good. 

I'm a broke college student (18M) who still lives with his mother. While I do have a car, I have no means of financially helping her. She likely can't stay with me for long, if at all. They are taking away her car, her food money, and are not letting her leave the house. Also, I am not allowed in that house even though I have done a single thing to wrong them. My girlfriend is thinking of telling one of her teachers her situation. I think that is not a bad idea. I told her she may even want to call CPS, but I want to hear someone else's take on this. 

My girlfriend is still in high school (senior) with no means of income at this time. She has no relatives that can help and no close friends. I am all she has besides her sister and I am unable to do anything. What can I do? What can she do? Please help, any words at all would help.

700,"I recently started working as a caregiver. I have four kids and I've never worked outside of the house before but since April my freelance work has been much slower and less reliable so I have been looking for other ways to supplement my income. This line of work is good for me because it's flexible and allows me time to help my two oldest kids (kinder and first grade) with virtual school and  stay with my six month old baby who is nursing- my clients even let me bring the baby to work. I have a friend who was working as a caregiver and she offered to pay me to assist her with two elderly clients who needed more help than one person could easily handle alone. On top of that, my friend had been looking for someone to babysit her daughter every Saturday for 12 hours so she offered me the job. It's been really helpful to have some money coming in, but I'm starting to get really anxious about my healthy and safety working with this friend. She's not awful about all Covid-19 precautions, she mostly wears her mask everywhere they're required (sometimes she starts stressing out and pulling it down below her nose though) and washes her hands and things but she doesn't stay home, she has eaten out at restaurants, she hangs out with small groups of friends and sometimes smokes joints that her neighbors are passing around on their porches. The two elderly clients are mostly fine, they're bed ridden so they can't go anywhere, but the problem with them is that they both don't agree with things like wearing masks so they won't let me wear one while working at their house and I am really worried about them getting sick. My county (lane county) is having a sudden spike in cases and I am starting to feel very anxious and worried about working with or hanging out with my friend, but I'm worried about how negatively she would take it if I start trying to be more restrictive and I can't really afford to lose the income, either.

704,"I (28F) took my first “adult” job approximately one year ago at a law firm. I was originally a receptionist/assistant to the office manager (located in Northern CA).  In February 2020 they announced we were merging with a larger firm, I interviewed with them but they inevitably only took one staff member and less than ten attorneys. Everyone was let go or moved on by beginning of May and I was asked to stay to help close things down and do administrative things. Please note that I am extremely grateful to have had a job through the COVID mess. 

Things were fine for several months, I had a lot more freedom to wear what I want and a lot of my responsibilities changed. I basically have become the person that just does whatever needs to be done. I don’t mind the job, in fact I enjoy a lot of the work I do. The problem is my boss. She is extremely particular and always has been but for some reason the last 3 months she has become unbearable. Here is a little background on her toxic behavior. 

She had an extremely bad reputation amongst all my old coworkers and I have met several attorneys from before my time who had nothing nice to say about her. At one point someone who works in the shared building our office is in, told me I was the first receptionist they hadn’t seen crying in the halls or bathroom. The receptionist immediately before me was treated 100% worse than me, something almost every person at my job had told me privately. That receptionist actually found a job posting for her job while she was still employed. Apparently she printed the ad, left her key card with it, went on lunch and never returned. 

Anyways, about 3 months ago I apparently became incapable of doing anything correctly. I am constantly getting talked to for being “too nice”. Every email I send is knit picked to the extreme (I shouldn’t have used that specific word, I’m being too nice, my wording makes me seem too young, etc). We started a garage sale to try and clear out the office, i got in trouble for responding to emails (from Craigslist) telling people we no longer have the item they are inquiring about, because we literally already sold the item. I got in trouble this week for not specifying the dimensions I sent my boss were L x W x H despite the original dimensions she sent me being in that order. The list goes on: talking to clients on the phone for too long, helping the IT guy restart the internet over the phone with extremely clear instructions, not remembering what SHE needed to tell the IT guy, adding too much information on lists shes asked me to create, not knowing information from BEFORE I was hired, other people’s mistakes, etc. I have an ongoing list on my phone for every time I get yelled at or in trouble for something incredibly dumb. (I am more than willing to share said list)

I am miserable here now. Coming into work gives me extreme anxiety, waiting to be yelled at for whatever I have done wrong that day. Anytime I send an email I am waiting to be told I did something wrong and it is exhausting. I’ve been searching for new jobs and have even had interviews for a few but none of them have worked out. COVID has made it very hard for me to even get a call back right now and I can’t just quit due to the high living costs of Northern CA. I also have a slight suspicion my male boss has intercepted a few of the jobs I have applied for at other law firms. I have no proof just weirdly timed comments around phone interviews and times I have sent in my resume.  

I guess I just need advice on what in the world to do in order to survive this job. I never question anything I’m told. I never talk back when getting yelled at I always just say “okay” and walk away as soon as I possibly can. My job searching hasn’t ended, but for the time being I’ve accepted I may potentially be at this job until the firm officially closes down (latest would be early 2021) and need advice on how to deal with this crap I’ve been taking day in and day out for months. Do I stand up for myself? Do I become maliciously compliant? I also don’t want to burn any bridges because this is my first job outside of retail and while I have references from other people who have already left, I don’t want to accidentally screw myself. 

Sorry this was so long, any advice or ideas would be so incredible. My friends and family are so sick of hearing me complain and I need solutions on how to get through.

Also, this is my backup account as my main account is too similar to my real name and don’t want this tied back to me.",07Oct2020,1
705,"Bit of a long story. I met my gf a little over a year and a half ago. At first everything seemed perfect. She had a good job and her own place. I had a good job, and my career was heading in a great direction. Then I found out about her problems with substance abuse. She's been working a pretty good program with only some minor slips along the way. Currently she is 9 months sober. 
Fast forward one year from when we met and my career hit a snag. I was passed over for my dream job and reassigned to a different department. I now spend my days shadowing people at my new job to learn as much as possible. Our relationship has deteriorated. I feel kind of claustrophobic, like we always have to be together and I don't have any time for myself. I start losing a lot of weight and feel like I'm stuck in a rut. Months go by and things just get worse. I'm depressed about my career but I feel like I can't deal with it because I'm preoccupied with my partner's needs. Her mood swings are really wearing me down and she can be very controlling/manipulative.
One day at work I get told that we are going on a work trip and I'll likely be going too. I tell my partner. Next week I learn that I will not be going. We have a big fight and she says she is looking forward to me going away. So I book a flight to visit my brother and father. Tell her I'm going away with work. 
Long story short, she found out about my lie and now doesn't trust me. I hurt her badly and I realize what I did was wrong. I'm trying not to blame her and own my faults, but truth be told part of me has resentments towards her for the way she treats me sometimes. I have signed up for therapy and we are booked to go to couples counselling. Life feels like it's getting away from me. I want our relationship to work but not if we can't do better for each other.

707,"Hello guys, 

I don't know if this is the right sub for it. But any tips or advice would be highly appreciated. 

As a short back story, I graduated February of last year. Since then I have been taking project based jobs. I mainly work on events, so if the government asks us to plan a public event to boost the tourism of my country, then that's what we're going to build and deliver. The pay is good I have my own visa so I work for this agency as a freelance and only work on a project basis. 

However, since COVID started, a lot of restrictions has been implemented, it included no public events to be held indefinitely. Which of course, affected my income. So, I tried to apply for a full-time job. I landed two interviews in companies that are both in Education industry. University A which I graduated from and University B, a very known and reputable university. (For obvious reasons I won't be stating any university names, sorry.) Company A contacted me first. I started 2 days ago and I haven't signed any of their contracts. I'm basically under probation for 6 months. However, Company B contacted me recently, the employer insisting that he wants me for the position even though I have told them that I am currently going into training with another company and that it might be better for them to find another suitable candidate. 

**University A:**  
Or the university I graduated from, their pay is okay. Commission basis is ok, but I wasn't told that it was gonna be a part of my job. Marketing the university and generating sales. Pros are, I know most people and they're really nice and friendly. Cons however, my former teacher who still works for them told me that if I have a better offer, take it because there is no growth within that university. He also told me that I get the lowest salary even if I have the same position as the other staff working in our department. 

**University B:** 

Very reputable university. However, if I accept the job I won't be under the company but under their managing director. I'd basically be his own personal secretary that would help coordinate for all the other businesses he handles. Pay is pretty much double the amount of what was being offered to me from University A. Pros probably is the timing. 8 am to 5 pm. As compared to the other which is 10 am to 7 pm. And of course also the payment. Cons though is the managing director is very dodgy. He would message me on my phone to ask questions that are non-related to the job offer. And would still be insistent I get the job offer from them. 

As of now, university B gave me the week to asses my experience with University A, and said he'd hold the position until next week, until I have decided if I am taking it but he's really insisting that I take it. And told me I shouldn't have to settle for a lower payment because of my dedication and skills. And my personality is a plus point for him as he said he'd sometimes need me to travel to attend meetings in behalf of him and told me not only would I learn how the business works, but I'd learn how international business works. 

I'm still stuck choosing between the two. If you were in a shoes of someone who's just starting to build her career, which option would you choose?",07Oct2020,1

710,"So to start this off, my roommate is a friend of mine for years before she moved in with me. I've always had minor disagreements with her about how she treats the dog, but it's not my dog. For example, in the past she's requested I leave the dog locked in the bedroom in a (my opinion) small crate with the lights off while she was out because she didn't know a friend of mine that was visiting, and didn't want the dog around them. I told her I refused to allow the dog to sit in the dark in the room barking and crying because she didn't feel comfortable with a stranger (to her) in the house. 

&amp;#x200B;

For the first two weeks the dog was in the house, she said the same about me being around the dog until I told her I wouldn't allow that anymore. She wanted to see how the dog would act around me before he was 'free to roam the house' with just me home. These timeframes would sometimes extend 8+ hours while she was out working, but I could easily take the dog out so he could relieve himself. I considered this a pretty terrible way to treat anyone, dog or otherwise.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to this past week...  


I told her a couple months ago my dad was coming to visit, as he's done for the past 3 years, early in October. Both her and the dog had met my dad 2 years ago, and she seemed 'fine' with him around the dog both then and last year. This year was different.

I picked my dad up on Friday, and when we got home, the dogs food/water were moved from the kitchen into her room. She was grabbing food and hurried back to her room. My dad said hello, tried to be friendly asking how are you and the response was, paraphrasing, ""well I could be dead tomorrow, that would be better"" and went in her room. She's been pissed/depressed about the state of the world. BLM issues, COVID, and Trump being the major sources of her life's woes. I don't disagree with her about these issues, but I don't let them completely destroy my life.

From that point until today when I brought my dad to the airport, he saw her twice, both times were to walk to the front door to pick up her food delivery, before going right back to her bedroom. She also would wait until we were out of the house to take the dog to the backyard to do his business, before going back right to her room.  


Now for my question/advice - Am I overreacting thinking she was being completely rude? I haven't talked with her about it yet but my assumption is she hid away because my dad flew on a plane and was worried about covid. ""If"" this is true though, shouldn't she have expressed her concern before the travel? At least to say, ""Hey, this makes me uncomfortable, I'm going to hide out for a bit"" and I would have understood. Instead I feel she was just rude and acted in a completely awful way. I also find it odd she let the dog out of the room once I got back from the airport - surely if he was 'sick' he passed it to me and they should be quarantining further, which again, I would have understood.   


Thoughts? Should I even bring it up? I asked a friend who I needed to vent to and they agreed with me and said she's just in a tough spot and sometimes you just don't act in the best way when you're dealing with other stuff... I still think it was rude though. She moves out in 2 weeks. I'm really hurt by her actions, but questioning why it's even worth discussing it at this point.",07Oct2020,1
711,"I'm a junior in college. I never really knew what I wanted to do as a career until it was too late. I figured last year that I wanted to do Aerospace or something relative, and then I also figured I wanted to work in bionics or something related (I saw the use of bionic limbs in Spider-man ps4, it peaked my interest, and I looked into it and found out it was an actual real thing in modern technology through companies like Open Bionics). Only issue is I was too far into college to switch from undecided into Mechanical Engineering, so I utilized the next best thing and entered into Energy engineering (which was technically not in the engineering college but was still an engineering major). I recently took calculus based physics and differential equations courses for the second time and had to drop both, as I was too stressed and was not passing exams. So my advisor suggested switching into biology or neuroscience and taking an extra semester. I feel this could be an interesting subject, but I fear I could never use this to work at Nasa, or work on bionics, like I had my heart set. And now I feel I have no true direction anymore. I don't want to do a job just for money, or just because of status, and I don't want to be stuck in a generic 9-5 career I have only some interest in. 

I also have a cousin who is my own age pursuing neuroscience already who has been in the program since the beginning of college and I don't want people thinking I'm copying him. 

I just want to know if anyone here has been in a similar situation. And how did you handle not meeting your goals, and realizing you aren't fit for the line of work you were passionate about? How did you handle the unsettling sense of no direction or misdirection? 


What can I possibly do to meet my dream career given it is too late to switch majors in college, without having to take 7 years to graduate with a bachelors?

This is going to be kinda long so don't mind that. Also, just a heads up, there will be talk about suicide and other triggering topics. 

So at about 13 I started being really toxic to people online when I first got my first device. And honestly, I wish that my parents had just waited until high school. I knew I was fucked up when I would send hate comments to my on and off friend, even went as far as dragging her deceased sister, and then defending her. Mind you, I was defending her, against myself.... It stopped but continued when I got my first phone, most of me leaving anonymous hate comments online like the coward I was, was from insecurity. It's not an excuse, but that's what it was from. I'm not gonna go to into detail but I haven't had the best life, I'm not the best looking person, and overall I'm a shit person. I'm also a minority, so I've bullied someone in my community just for being lighter than me. I've bullied a group of people online just for having a better life than me, having friends, having more money than me and so on. 

The last time I was toxic online was when I was 16. There was this girl and to be completely fair, she kind of was racist. I know that Reddit has their own opinion on what racism is and I completely respect that, but maybe not so much racist, but she just had a flawed way of thinking and had said a few stuff that were micro aggressions. That would go against what she tried to preach. So I started leaving anonymous hate online through a thing called curious cat. This all took place on Twitter. And at the time she was 24, it started to escalate with me calling her rude and disrespectful. If you had been on her Twitter you know that she's pretty blunt, she'd get mad at people who would ask Where she worked, or just other stuff about her that she had already explained before. She really did seem like that kind of person that was a bitch to people she didn't know, but a sweet person to her friends.

Now I know that a lot of people agree that if you act like an adult, especially online, be prepared to get treated like one. And that's exactly what she did to me. A lot of the times she would ignore my comments, but when she responded to them, she'll usually responded in long paragraphs, rightfully so telling me how bored and obsessed I must be to leave hate every day. And she was 100% right. I would always say stuff like ""I'm 15 and you're calling a minor a bitch"" or ""I'm 16 and you're really coming for me as an adult?"" and bring up how she was arguing with minors, rightfully so there were other people defending her. It even got to the point where I talked about her dead father, who had lost his life due to suicide. I've fucked up so many people's mental health online, But it was never like hers before. I mean she was in her mid-20s, and she wasn't afraid to tell me off. Now again if you were on her page, you knew that she wasn't the most forgiving person. She probably would not want me to apologize, but for me to leave her the fuck alone. it's been a couple years now, shes around 26, and I'm 18, my question is, should I apologize to her? Honestly I'm not sure if she'll remember me, or should I just leave her alone and just take the lesson I've learned. Honestly if I can go back from the very beginning, I would not do any of that stuff. I often think to myself what would my current friends, or even people that I've been relationships would think about certain things that I've done in life. But there's nothing I can do now, and I guess I just wanted to know what any of y'all would do.",07Oct2020,1

He's been doing this since around preschool, now he's in 5th grade. He has these 5 specific pictures that he carries around almost everywhere hence why they are nearly falling apart, and he'll freak out if one gets ruined or lost so they are like actual friends to him. they are not pictures of friends or family members in real life, it's things like movie cases or packages with characters looking at the camera. If they're looking at the camera they can see and hear him. These pictures will rotate over the years based on his interests. He will set them up to watch him when he plays outside or does anything around the house, even if his friends or family members or over and playing/watching videos with him, the pictures are set up watching them.I do not like him take a pictures in public but he started smuggling them to school and the teachers are kind of understanding/set boundaries but they've had to take the pictures away a few times. Throughout the day he will talk to them and sometimes he could be alone for hours just having conversations, some of it is real life stuff but some of it is made up to match the world of the people or what he wants them to think. He knows those parts of his stories are not real because he can determine reality over fiction, it's just about the pictures.

It's not practicing skills or anything, they are his friends and he thinks the characters of interest can hear him and had me talk to them once. They do not talk back to him as far as I know, he does not wait for a response or ask non rhetorical questions, it's just a monologue like another dimension or something where he wants these characters to see him and believes they can. He is 11 now and he knows that they are just pictures, they are just pieces of paper and he has no interest in pictures of characters beyond his interests, but he still goes into this little world and those pictures don't apply to that reality. Though he has an illusion that pictures can see him because he feels uncomfortable going to the bathroom or doing things when posters or photos are looking at the camera.

He was screened for autism very young and they said Asperger's is a possibility. He does not have any trauma or abuse in his history besides for being adopted by my sister when I could not raise him. Used to be pretty shy but he can function in social situations, beyond the difficulties caused by these pictures.",07Oct2020,1

I sent a message and she moved it to the other corner, (and now I cant see the other side). I was panicking but later that day, this girl in my class sends me the notes that she took on her cell phone. I thanked her and she responded:   


Girl: I'll send you french notes every time she writes something on the board  
Me: Oh tysm! The quality from the meetings are so poor it hurts my eyes.

It makes sense. It might explain a strange fetish that I have, it might explain why I had sexual fantasies at extremely young ages before even age 8, it might explain why my brother and I both had drug addictions which we escaped while my sister remained a good normal girl.

I knew my uncle always loved to play and was really nice but this just turned my entire view of him around. I think it also explains a lot in my life. But for some reason it doesn’t bother me it’s just surprising. Maybe I’m just in denial or disbelief subconsciously, or maybe it just was so long ago and I’ve lived 20+ years without knowing it and basically have made my life so it doesn’t have hold of me anymore.

I could delete reddit and discord for say a month but then ill come back with a new account or something because I was feeling lonely or some shit.

727,"TL;DR and questions at the end.

I recently moved back in with my mom and I am appalled by the house and my family's habits.

The house is like a huge dumping pit. No one has any respect for anyone or anything and everyone is lazy. The kitchen table is constantly covered in everyone's stuff and everyone just pushes it out of their spot to eat so it doesn't get removed.

Everyone leaves their wrappers and garbage on the counter and no one wipes the counter so when my mom makes food, she just pushes the garbage over and then sits the open food on the gross countertop. 

I have an issue with germs and it makes everything worse bc I either don't eat and I'm hungry and can't make other food or I get yelled at or I suck it up and eat the counter food and feel nauseous all day bc the thought of it is so awful to me.

I tried to give them a head start by cleaning up a lot of the downstairs but already two hours later a lot of it looked the same as it had before.

I also tried changing how my sisters' laundry is done.

The laundry used to be washed and folded by my mom and then put in a basket that just sat downstairs and spilled over and the whole floor would be covered in laundry.

I told them to bring their laundry up with them when they go up if they see any in their piles that has been folded and so far one sister does it almost everytime, another one is very influenced by my mom and they both just leave their heaped piles downstairs to spill over and my last sister takes everything as an attack.

I asked her yesterday if she'd bring it up and she started yelling at me and then told me that I shouldn't bug her bc she's in a bad mood when I asked nicely and even said that she didn't have to do it now and to just try to remember the next time she went up.

Everytime my mom asks them to do anything, they think it's abuse and everyone tells at everyone else about how it's not their fault and it's someone else's fault and the cycle just continues.

My mom doesn't do anything either so they have a reason to be upset when she tells them how bad the house is. My mom leaves all her dishes on the table and in the living room. She throws and leaves garbage all over the table. She is constantly bringing new things home when there is no room and she still says how the mess is everyone else's fault.

I've tried to nicely remind my sisters when they forget their garbage somewhere. Some of them fight me on it and some apologize and put it in the bin only to do it again later that day. I've tried to do my thing by cleaning and tidying in front of them without complaining and sometimes commenting on how much better it feels to have a clean space but I don't think any of it is working.

My mom has no chores set and there is no schedule to cleaning. I want to have a family meeting or something similar to set something up but I have no idea where to start as my mom is part of the problem and everything is an attack to her.

I just want to not have to walk through the house on a one foot wide path and I want to not feel sick everytime my mom cooks.

TL;DR: My family is a bunch of slobs and has no responsibility when it comes to cleaning. I tried to give them a head start and cleaned a bunch and it all went back to how it was before I cleaned. If I remind them to pick up something, they get upset at me and nothing has changed.

Does anyone have tips to encourage a family to clean up when they have never had to before? What is a good schedule/rules so no one is avoiding their work? How can I make it stick and not fall off when they get sick of it? My sisters are 10, 14, and 19 and my mom is in her 40s.",07Oct2020,1

So I am in need of some advice regarding what I can do for my IT dissertation. In theory, I need to also be able to test what I make in the end.

735,"So a bit of background: I'm a first time mom on maternity leave (Canada) - my daughter was born at the beginning of the lockdown and I'm still fairly isolated now with cases rising again. 

My husband had the first 5 weeks of her life off from work but now he is back to work full time. 

I did all of the night time care until quite recently as well as most of the chores during the day. When she moved to her own room I started asking my husband for help at night. 

It is a battle every night.

He doesn't hear her so I have to wake him up. He has said ""no"" in his sleep, he groans, has kicked me, etc. It's like I'm trying to wake up a child. 

He swears he doesn't remember and that he is willing to help but it is so upsetting having to fight with my grumpy husband, I'm better off just doing all the night time work again. 

Last night, he got up to change/soothe her and I realized he never talks to her at night. She really calms down if you whisper to her or sing but he just silently deals with her and she usually won't calm down. And then I have to go in and help get her back to sleep anyways.

When I asked him about it, he says if he talks he will have a harder time getting back to sleep. 

I'm just... frustrated. I don't know if I'm asking too much of him but I'm with our daughter all day, ALONE because of the pandemic. No mom groups, no family visits (except outside), nothing to do except take care of our daughter and clean. I feel like more than 3 hours in a row of sleep isnt too much to ask.

He is so amazing with her during the weekends/evenings, I don't want to sour that, but I feel like his excuses are weak. I just want him to help at night and give me some rest. 

What should I do?",07Oct2020,1

737,"Just to give a bit of backstory: I (20NB) have been on this subreddit a few times at this point talking about coming out to my homophobic/abusive parents, throwing all my shit into a bag, and moving in with my partner (26NB) across the country. That still hasn't happened, but I am no longer living with my parents, which is a big plus! I moved into an apartment by my school, and am also in therapy, which is nice, if maybe a little more slow-going than I'd hope.

I'm working with my therapist to try and come out to my parents. I'm still miserable whenever I have to interact with them. I spent the weekend housesitting for them, and sleeping in that house that so many awful things happened in, even when I knew I was alone, was almost too much for me to handle. I'm still in the closet, I still can't be open about the things I'm doing. I'm taking a trip to go and be with my partner in a couple of weeks, and I can't just go on a trip to be with them--I have to have all these lies and stories in place just so that I can go be with my partner for a week. I might even have to spend a couple hundred dollars on an airbnb just so that I don't have to make up an entire person that I'm staying with. 

I don't feel safe when I'm around them. I don't enjoy spending time with them. I have to go to a church to worship a god I haven't believed in for years, just so that they don't cut me off entirely. I'm tired of it! I'm an adult, with my own apartment, paying my own bills, living my own life!

At the same time, the concept of cutting off my family makes me feel sick to my stomach. Even the thought of it makes me shake like a leaf. It's getting to the point that it's seriously weighing on my partner, too--we haven't seen each other, I was technically supposed to move in with them, like, half a year ago? It's a lot. I'm applying to a grad school where they live that I'm almost certain to get into, so I'm going to be living with them long-term after I graduate, but I don't want them to have to hide themselves, now or later. It's exhausting.

I'd so much rather stop talking to my family and just get this all over with than have to lose my partner. If I were able to get over the panic I feel whenever I think about coming out, I'd have come out back in March, and be living with my partner already. My hope is to come out as soon as possible, go and see my partner in a couple of weeks, come back to my apartment, get at least some of my things packed, and spend the months after Thanksgiving break living with them.

But obviously, that's not going to happen unless I come out. So, to circle back: How do i move past that mental barrier and be okay with the fact that my family probably isn't ever going to want to see or talk to me again? Or worse, that they'll be okay with seeing me, but that I'm never going to be able to talk to them again without them trying to convert me back to heterosexuality?",07Oct2020,1
738,"for a very large portion of my life i wanted to be a mechanical engineer but then started making rap beats as a hobby and now want to be a music producer. mechanical engineering doesnt sound as exciting to me anymore and all the work id have to go through in uni sounds incredibly tedious. i also have ocd which makes me obsessively check math problems and thus stresses me out so im not sure if i want to keep up with tasks like these in the future.

not going to college is definitely not an option as it would be incredibly risky, probably an awful financial decision and my dad would kill me

745,"I’m a young male in my early 20s and I’ve been seeing a psychiatrist for a few months now. I really like her and she’s helped me normalize my sleep, but that’s it. The appointments are fairly expensive, but I don’t really want to see anyone else(her prices are about equal to other providers even though she doesn’t take insurance). I brought up my issues in the first appointment, anxiety, depression, adhd, and sleep. She seems to only focus on my sleeping problems when I’m in appointments with her. I’ve been sleeping much better since the medication(controlled), but I still feel my depression, anxiety and adhd. My anxiety is based socially and I’m really bad with trying to communicate my issues. I feel like she’d be annoyed if I brought up more issues for her to deal with. I’m not trying to be labeled as a drug seeker or someone who’s looking for pills. I just want to feel normal.

This has resulted in several appointments that end up not addressing my other issues. I’ve spent a fair bit of money and it’s gonna be a while before I see her again. Its really disheartening leaving the appointment feeling like nothing else was solved. I don’t know what to do, I don’t want to lose her but I always feel rushed during the appointments. Everything gets pushed back into my mind. I become a yes man during our appointments telling her I’m sleeping better and that the meds are working. I don’t know how to break out of that and bring up my other issues. I feel like I’m complaining when I’m just trying to normalize myself. 

I’ve tried therapy and the same thing happens I zone out and just want the time to be up so I can leave. I hate talking about myself and talking for long periods of time. I usually just nod and give quick answers. I end up not liking a lot of the therapists I’ve been to, and spent countless appointments going through the same thing. I’ve thought to write my feelings down in a journal or something but it always feels like a dreadful task. I’d appreciate it if anyone has some experience dealing with the same issues and could give me advice on how to approach these things in the appointments",07Oct2020,1
746,"So  I dated this guy almost 2 years ago, and throughout the relationship he lied to me.

747," So I (16M) have been in a new very respected high school for a month or so and I am not doing very well at all.

 I made the wrong choice by taking the science-based branch of study because usually, the field is divided into two different parts (Science loving students (Like me) can take the Physics, Chemistry based courses and the others take Mathematics and Programming.) This year, however, it was not. I have 2-s in at least 5 subjects. I will get kicked out if I do not get all of the things done in exactly 11 days. That would mean at least 3 tests from different teachers a day and along with my extra psychology, physics and chemistry lessons, I do not think I could handle it.

 It has been too stressful for me. Stressful to the point where I pull all-nighters or sleep only 1-4 hours a night. I do not fall asleep during lessons but I do have memory problems and can not focus very well. I suspect I may have depression and OCD and I know I have ADHD. I have no time for hobbies I have. I only have one day a week where I can go horse riding and the rest of the week is full of homework and school. Usually, I just crash after homework and that makes it so I have no time for anything else. I know I have a lot of mental health problems. I would like to figure them all out before going into 10th grade. 

 I asked my teacher about gap years since it is not very common in our country and I remembered they were possible. Turns out, that I cannot take a gap year since I am already a month into school. I told her that I have some mental health problems and that the stress is making it worse. Turns out that I have three options:

1. **School psychologist -** I think that she might help me, but I would not feel very comfortable with her as a psychologist. I have a psychology lesson with her and I would not want to meet a psychologist that often outside of sessions. I have also had bad experiences with school psychologists before and none have really helped me with anything. I do not trust her to keep her psychology lesson and appointment separate.
2. **Asking for a different daily lesson plan with a doctors note -** It would definitely take the pressure off of some things but the days would be the same length. I would still not have time for my hobbies or a city psychologist since the only psychologist times available are during the week when I have school.
3. **Take out my documents, get off the school list, take a year off and then come back next year -**  I won't even have to do entrance exams. The negatives would be that I would finish school a year later than others my age and I think it may be a bit harder to come to school next year. Also, money could be a problem since I am still dependent on my parents. I could get a job though. It would be a good teaching moment since others my age usually do not have much job experience during school. I could start exercising more and spend more time with my family. I would be able to help my mother out at home since she has difficulties with her health. It would give me time to think about what I really want to do with my life.

 I myself see a lot more positives in taking out my documents and continuing 10th grade next year but my homeroom teacher told me to make that the last resort. If I get kicked out, I can't go back to that school. If I take out my documents, I could still try next year and pick a field more suitable for me. I think I have quite good reasons for wanting to take out my documents and taking a year for me and my mental health.

 I will answer any questions in the comments and am open to suggestions about what I could do. 

 **TLDR:** I want to take a gap year, I cant. I have mental health problems and they keep getting worse because of school. I could go to the school psychologist, ask for a different schedule with a doctors note or take out my documents and go back next year. Open to suggestions and positive points about psychologist and schedule options.",07Oct2020,1

Honestly when they said that it hurt because I felt like I was the most mature and responsible out of all my siblings when they were my age. When my oldest sister was my age they allowed her to drive alone when she had her permit. They even allowed it for my second oldest sister.

756,"Warning: paragraph. TLDR below

&amp;#x200B;

This person is the first ever person that have ever shown signs of attractions to me, i've always had a little crush on them but that crush grew so large that i can no longer stop thinking about them after they started to show signs of attractions back. But i never asked her out because i have never had any close friends or someone i can talk to or share my feelings to. After around 6 months of this, i decided to take a week break from school, unfortunately right after that week lockdown started. 

At first i was excited because i had a week or so to prepare myself and maybe finally talk to her, but it turned into months until the school year ended. I was thinking about her every single day of those 7 months and it was awful. I know i fucked up hard by being a pussy, she was showing major signs of attractions (glances, smiling at me after eavesdropping on my conversation). It even progressed to the point where she would kind of pose a bit by placing her hands on her chin whenever i look at her direction. But she and i are 2 completely different types of people, she was the type that everyone in the school knows and adores her while i on the other hand was someone who was invisible. To put it into perspective, she was so popular that facebook prevents her from adding more people to her friends list (5k) while i literally don't even have 25 people on my list. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know i seem like an attention whore, but the quicker i get over her the better and i think reddit is the best place for that as i have no one to speak to. I've been so depressed that i would never get to see her again that i haven't been doing any school works in over 2 weeks. My mental health is deteriorating fast, i know i seem desperate but that's because i am desperate to get my life back together.

757,"Hi, I F(16) Haven’t felt apathy in roughly 2 months. I feel no motivation to do anything at all and everything that has ever meant something to me i’ve completely lost interest in- Giving my pets attention feels like a chore, My pet bird died 4 days ago and I felt nothing, When someone vents to me I don’t feel bad for them at all anymore. (I’ll still give them advice, not because I care but simply because I should probably do so to stay friends with them.)

I know it’s bad, I used to be described as the ‘mum’ friend because I was the one who looked out for everyone and gave the best advice but now I don’t feel for anyone or anything anymore. I used to be very very emotional, I have diagnosed anxiety, depression and body dysmorphia and I would constantly cry myself to sleep, feel worthless, not be able to look in the mirror etc, now that’s completely stopped. I went from crying everyday to having not cried in 2 months. 

This isn’t the first I’ve felt like this, It’s happened multiple times in the past but for a couple days at most. I’ve done it since I was young and I think it may have started due to my mums profession. She is a foster career, so growing up I would always get new ‘brothers and sisters’, get attached, then never see them again. I’d also watch as my mum ignore me for other children. Its literally impossible for me to feel attached to children now, I don’t know how to fully describe it but you can kinda guess what I mean. I think this had led to my newfound disinterest in relationships. 

I don’t know if i’m concerned about what’s happening to me- I just know I probably should be, and so i’m just here to ask, is this normal? If not, what do I do? I actually like having no emotions now, my ego keeps getting bigger but for the sake of not becoming completely emotionless and ending up in a jail cell when i’m older I think the best idea is for me to try put a stop to it, no matter if I like it or not. 

I would seek help elsewhere but my mum didn’t even believe I had anxiety after being diagnosed right in front of her, she’ll tell me it’s all in my head. 

I hope someone can take me seriously, I understand I’m young and I promise this isn’t just for attention or to sound ‘edgy’. Also, if there is any typos it’s because my hands are cold so it’s hard to type- apologies.",07Oct2020,1

759,"Maybe I'm a bit of a baby but I think my sister is really toxic and she affects my mental health a lot.

She can never be in the wrong or she threatens suicide/says how she doesn't want to live anymore and tells you that you're being awful to her and attacking her. If you remind her to do something, she takes it as an attack and either says that you shouldn't have said anything bc she was in a bad mood or says how you ruined her good mood and now she ""wants to die"".

If you happen to act a certain way she doesn't like, she'll tell how much like our abusive mom you are. It can be something as simple as making too much noise.

You can be laughing and joking and you still have to be on edge about saying the wrong thing because she could fly off at any moment and make you feel like a bad person.

One time my other sister said ""Oh hey there's (toxic sister's friend)"" and my toxic sister shunned her for the day bc she happened to be in a fight with that friend and no one knew about it.

She also does this thing where she'll get in a fight with someone and then send me the screenshots where they're both clearly in the wrong and she'll expect you to message this person and defend her and when you don't do that, she'll get mad at you too and say how the whole world is against her and how she wants to die.

I don't know if this is coincidence but she recently became friends with a Christian boy and my mom said that she better not fuck him up and all of a sudden, my sister is dating him and they're hanging out all the time and I'm really afraid that she's going to mess him up because she hates my mom.

Her relationships are awful and whenever they end, the other person is always in the wrong according to her and she has said before that once you break up with your boyfriend, you have to sleep with their brother/best friend. I don't remember if there was a reason for her saying it but I figured it's worth mentioning since she has a level of pettiness to her that I thought only existed in movies with mean girls.

She is also somehow convinced that she is an empath and frequently tries to fit it into conversation. I don't know a lot about empaths but she doesn't seem to care about anyone else's feelings. I may be wrong but I feel like someone who is very empathetic would not go out of their way to make everyone feel like shit for hurting her feeling by accident.

She has lost most of her friends bc either they leave her or she finds fault with something they've done and she still sees nothing wrong with her actions.

I live with her and I'm getting sick of having to tiptoe around her to spare her feelings. Is there any way I can get through to her that she is unbearable to be around.

We haven't really talked about it other than me saying that she can't be mad at me for something someone else did and then I stopped talking to her and she cooled down and apologized.

Could talking about it help or does it seem like she's too bad? Should I bother trying and how could I word it so it doesn't come off as an attack but as help instead?",07Oct2020,1

Hi, I F(16) Have apathetic for roughly 2 months. I feel no motivation to do anything at all and everything that has ever meant something to me i’ve completely lost interest in- Giving my pets attention feels like a chore, My pet bird died 4 days ago and I felt nothing, When someone vents to me I don’t feel bad for them at all anymore. (I’ll still give them advice, not because I care but simply because I should probably do so to stay friends with them.)

I know it’s bad, I used to be described as the ‘mum’ friend because I was the one who looked out for everyone and gave the best advice but now I don’t feel for anyone or anything anymore. I used to be very very emotional, I have diagnosed anxiety, depression and body dysmorphia and I would constantly cry myself to sleep, feel worthless, not be able to look in the mirror etc, now that’s completely stopped. I went from crying everyday to having not cried in 2 months. 

This isn’t the first I’ve felt like this, It’s happened multiple times in the past but for a couple days at most. I’ve done it since I was young and I think it may have started due to my mums profession. She is a foster career, so growing up I would always get new ‘brothers and sisters’, get attached, then never see them again. I’d also watch as my mum ignore me for other children. Its literally impossible for me to feel attached to children now, I don’t know how to fully describe it but you can kinda guess what I mean. I think this had led to my newfound disinterest in relationships. 

I don’t know if i’m concerned about what’s happening to me- I just know I probably should be, and so i’m just here to ask, is this normal? If not, what do I do? I actually like having no emotions now, my ego keeps getting bigger but for the sake of not becoming completely emotionless and ending up in a jail cell when i’m older I think the best idea is for me to try put a stop to it, no matter if I like it or not. 

I would seek help elsewhere but my mum didn’t even believe I had anxiety after being diagnosed right in front of her, she’ll tell me it’s all in my head. 

I hope someone can take me seriously, I understand I’m young and I promise this isn’t just for attention or to sound ‘edgy’. Also, if there is any typos it’s because my hands are cold so it’s hard to type- apologies.",07Oct2020,1
765,"Me and my gf have been going out since March and things were going great until last month. I’ve always had mental health issues and I’ve never been any good with people or coping with stress. 

Note my old coping mechanism was to block out any emotional attachment I had to the stress. 

So over the past couple years I’ve really been trying to be better with people but ruining mental health even more as it meant from time to time people would call me up a two in the morning to walk for a couple hours just to meet up with them. Over the past half year loads of friends just stopped talking to me and I had been trying to chase them up. This created a lot of stress but I continued. 

I had then accidentally done what I used to do and because I’ve always had a massive fear of hurting my gf my brain considered her one of my stresses. So for the past month I felt nothing towards her. Obviously I didn’t like that so I spent the month trying to fix it without her knowing it had happened. Now bearing in mind I didn’t mean to block everything out. At the time I didn’t even know I had done it. So I spoke to a few people and they said to tell her and get her help. 

I spoke to her about it and she said that she needed time. And the next day. LITERALLY THE NEXT DAY. I figured out what I had done and started solving it. My friend said to message her so I did reluctantly as I new this would cause problems. 

A couple days ago me and her met up again and after a while of talking she said she’d give me one more chance but it was evident she was scared that stress would overcome me again. So I said I’d speak to a therapist (still looking into it). And the main problem that she had was the fact that I lied to her for a month about how I was (completely fair and I did wrong) 

But now I’m finding the relationship awkward and I still love her from the bottom of my heart but I don’t know how to make things right. She seems to be ok with how things are now so I’m thinking it might be a more one sided problem. 

I am happy being with her but I feel that I’ve done something I can’t repent for and maybe she could do better

766,"Hello there.

So im male, mid 20s and have been living with my parents and family since ever. This year I finished my degree (had 3 trainee years before that), so now Im working full time and also have a side hustle. Thing is, I share my room with my brother and dont have a desk. For work I actually need a desk because I do online consulting.  


If I move out, I will have 1/3 to 2/5 less money available. That means I also can save less. Im saving to buy real estate in future. But I will have my work space at home where I can improve my side income, which is kind of uncomfortable to work in the situation im in right now.  


There is also the option to buy a bigger house with my fam, so that everyone has his own room. That would also mean that I could save less - at least on short term.

Since then, I moved in with my boyfriend, totaled my car, lost my job.. and I circulated through a lot of different music. Now I miss that feeling of being happy and alive and enjoying the music, but when I listen to some of my old favorite songs I just keep skipping them and skipping. 

None of my old favorite songs seem to lift my spirits anymore. I have the house to myself for the day and I was thinking I could blast music and get some household chores done.

This guy comes in my office, tells me he got a better job offer and was sorry to waste my time and that it was nothing to do with company or people etc.  I said yea no hard feelings have to do what's best for you, and I did mean that.  

Watching the company scramble and bend over backwards after that to try to keep him was almost embarrassing to me.  I was put in a position where I had to basically on board myself and learn everything myself, deal with my boss and his boss who never respond timely, proactively get involved with stuff on the east coast to help out wherever I can.  Learn everything I can about the company and the industry.

776,"I work as an author for a science/biology magazine that has been going on for a while. (French and Russian). And since I work freelance, we get paid in levels. There are 5 levels, and I’m on level 4. Which is 1 step before having nobody checking what I write. My superiors said that if I continue doing so well, I don’t need to be checked.

Ever since they told that to my supervisor, he started being very difficult. (I believe it’s because he gets paid to “check” my stuff). 

I noticed that whatever I do he’ll bring me down but very subtly, (not enough to raise an issue with the HR). 

Two days ago, I sent an article about whales to be checked. He came back with “nice article, but some of your sentences didn’t make sense, so I had to change them.” When I copied and pasted the document he “corrected” and the one I submitted there was 100% identical. No changes, not even a coma. This was done 10-12 times, but it didn’t occur to me to check until now.

Then, I went further back to see what’s going on with other articles. The following was said to me another 3 times:

“It’s an ok job Lucile, but I found 20% plagiarism in this one, and I often find this with your work and I had to change it a bit.“ I compared the two texts again 100% identical, and the plagiarism from 7 websites I checked was actually 1% - (“According to the latest data from Cornell University”) - this was what was “plagiarized”. 

Every time I come back with “I don’t see any changes”, he doesn’t reply. 
I believe he claims my work isn’t good enough to prevent me from moving up in the company because all my ideas are approved. What do I do? 

And if you’re wondering it might all be in my head, one of the other editors told me that he was going to move me up a level and increase my wage but my supervisor stopped him because he said I’m not good enough and “I plagiarize”.

780,"Hey everyone, I've (27M) been having a rough couple of years. It started out with my dream  job in cybersecurity, not earning badly and learning a lot. During this time, I ignored my allergies to the air conditioning which lead me to developing chronic rhino-sinusitis with nasal polyps. Basically means I'll be taking medication my whole life, be in pain for a lot of it, and need surgery every few years, which lead me to leave my career there.

After surgery and about a month off, my dad (60M) asked if I wanted to join in the family business. Because of reasons which are beyond the scope of this post, I never got close to it before, both because (I felt) my dad pushed me away and because external circumstances just made it plain difficult for me to be there. So I knew almost nothing at the time about it.

I stayed there for 18 months, in which I was dissatisfied, because I was dealing with my symptoms, I was trying to go about things my way (mostly trying to program myself out of problems which didn't require programming), and because no one, even my dad, called me on my shit. So basically I could go where I pleased, arrive and leave when I pleased and had no accountability, basically the opposite of where I was, where I practically had someone breathing down my neck 90% of the time. Which lead to a combination of laziness and guilt and me just feeling shitty 90% of the time, because I didn't become closer with my dad as I'd hoped, I didn't learn what I thought I'd learn, and I wasn't getting shit done.

So I left three months ago, I got a job in tech which I liked: I get to work from home with a lot of friends from university, set my own hours, I'm more responsable, and overall it's good! Except I took a pay cut, and they're having trouble paying me on time because of the COVID recession, which hit Mexico especially hard, and because they're hiring more people even though they have trouble paying their existing employees, which makes me think they're hemorrhaging money and will eventually tank. This wouldn't be such a big problem if I didn't have to worry about my medical expenses, since easily 60-70% of my income goes to that and insurance doesn't cover this type of conditions. I could go get public healthcare, but a lot of the time it means sacrificing 3-4 hours of your day, which isn't tenable when I need to go multiple times a month and hold down a job on top of that.

Now, I know I can go back to working with my dad, I'll be earning a little more money, not have to worry about gas or medical expenses as much or being payed on time. I'll be part of the family business and maybe learn to run my own if I get my shit together and actually learn, which I'm not sure I can do. And I won't be mentored much by my dad, because those circumstances that I mentioned earlier also forced him to step away from a lot of things and he doesn't know how a lot of it works. I'll also be working (part time) on Saturdays, in a field which I don't know much about, with people older than me who I don't relate to.

The other option is to find another job, which I can do, but means I'd be leaving a part of my heritage on the table and missing a learning opportunity.

TLDR: I don't know if I should go back to my dad's business in an environment I don't like very much or try and stick it out with an environment I like more but which doesn't pay on time and might tank.",07Oct2020,1

785," Hi.

I'm a 15F, moving onto a college next year. Before I go, I really want to become happy with myself.

I'm very on-and-off when it comes to who I am as a person. I have two sides of my personality that I know can't co-exist due to my bipolar nature, yet am reluctant to let either go and grow as a person. It's unfair to one day come in as 'Side A' and the next come in as 'Side B'. It's ruined all my friendships up to this point. If I let this go on much longer I'm afraid it'll develop into a serious disorder and I have no money to afford any kind of help.

'Side A', I'm calm and outspoken yet loner-prone. When I'm like this, I know not to bother with wanting friends or a future because I know that I'll just end up hurt.

'Side B', I am serious, polite and appreciative of the arts, if not a little shy and uptight, attempting to make friends and obtain a hopeful future yet, deep-down, knowing I won't be able to obtain anything due to how I am.

'Side C', Same as A for the most part yet a lot angrier with a tougher exterior, although I play it up around my friends so it's comedic.

My personalities switch whenever they're 'triggered'; something will give me hope for life, and I'll switch to B, vowing to make things better. Something upsets me and I'll either go A or C. Alternatively, I'll see something that reminds me of X personality and revert back to it. It's not just a change of moods, it's that my entire personality changes with it.

I can't just 'let go' of my personalities and settle on one which I feel is the best option for myself, because as soon as my mood switches to one that corresponds with one of the three personalities, I'll revert back to it. Even if I make a conscious effort to stop, I feel like I'm betraying myself.

This whole thing started last year, and I'm trying to make sense of why.

I'm thinking it stemmed from something that happened last year; everyone I knew was putting so much emphasis on 'finding themselves' that I tried it too, acting differently and seeing what felt the most 'me'. Ever since then, this has happened.

I know how crazy I sound, I just want to put an end to this.",07Oct2020,1

Yesterday, I never planned on going to college. I was just gonna focus on practicing drawing so I could start doing commission work.

Yesterday at eight pm, I just then looked into an art college I’ve never researched before and within an hour of googling it, I found myself looking at dorms, restaurants near the campus, and writing down application information. 

Today, we had people at school come in showing us how to apply and sign up for student aid. I thought they were just gonna lecture us about different colleges and how to potentially apply. I didn’t know we were gonna do it right then and there.
I got online and applied to enroll in KC Art Institute next fall.
The application requested a personal statement and portfolio be sent in. 

I don’t have a portfolio to send in. 

I haven’t even drawn or finished any past projects. Just a huge portrait of Sinead O’Connor I did junior year and I don’t even like doing realism. 

I can’t draw...
(Correction: I can draw, just not on the fly without references and it takes me forever.) 
...or drive.

My college is 4 hours away, across the state line.

There are other students in my class who have already visited and had tours of the colleges they want to go to.

I have to learn how to drive, study the test, and get my drivers license by the end of May (That’s the deadline I’m giving myself). 
I have to get the car fixed.
If move there, I’m gonna have to drive 4 hours back every month to get my braces tightened.
I have to learn anatomy and how to draw by next fall.
I have to mass draw a whole portfolio, I’m guessing within the next few weeks.
I have to learn finances.
I have to set up a bank account.
I have to get my phone turned on and get a phone number.
I have to figure out my living situation.
I have to find a job to support my living situation.
And I have to talk to my mom who doesn’t know.

(Update: I’m typing the rest of this now. I talked to my mom and she just let out a long sigh and said we’re gonna have to call my older brother and uncle about this.)

Or I could just cancel everything and not go to college and reverse the immense responsibilities and stress I have impulsively cast upon myself as of yesterday.

But even so, as reckless a decision this is, I admit I can’t help but be a little excited. 
For once, I’m gonna learn some life skills and live on my own. I can’t afford to procrastinate living anymore.

792,"Can you practice psychology in Ontario with an American license? I want to move to Toronto.

All other subs won’t let me post because my account is too new. 

So I currently live in the US and am a US citizen and have always wanted to live in Toronto. I visited my aunt and cousins nearly every weekend and every holiday growing up and I swear I fall in love with the city more and more each time I visit. 

I’m trying to apply to masters programs for psychology for next fall semester, however, after reaching out to two of the programs I was interested in (Ryerson and York), I was told that they rarely accept international applicants due to lack of funding and that I shouldn’t bother to apply. 

I’m really, really bummed about this. I don’t want to wait another year and will have to attend grad school in Michigan, however I’m wondering if I obtain a license, if I could move to Ontario to practice (especially with just a masters). Any advice is greatly appreciated!!",07Oct2020,1
793,"Girl I've been chatting with for four months is moving back to my town this week. One week ago today I messaged her when she was going to be coming down here because I wanted to see her. She told me she was probably going to be in a town about 25 minutes away from me on Monday or Tuesday. She then said that the plan was for her and her family to be in my town on the weekend, and that she would have to let me know the following week. 

Now it's been a full week and I have not heard back from her. I’m so confused since it appears she likes me, but I haven’t heard anything. I’m stuck between two decisions. If I don’t text her, I’m going to be constantly worrying and thinking what happened and if she still likes me. If I do text her, I’m essentially going against what we agreed on and acting kind of weak and desperate.

She posts on Instagram daily and still does not message me. I’m so depressed because I don’t want to lose this girl. I just don’t understand why she hasn’t texted me. It just doesn’t make sense.

(16F) i’ve been struggling with my mental health for quite a long ass time. it’s been hard these past few days trying to hide the pain and emotions, but it’s spiraling out of control. i’m a victim of sexual abuse, mental abuse, and physical abuse. i’ve been used and betrayed by the ones i love. even though people tell me that they care about me, my trust is so fucked up that i can’t even believe it. i have strict nigerian parents who always question why i act the way i do, such as not eating or having an “attitude”. my mother who seems to be more concerned asks me what’s eating me up.

i seriously wish i could tell her because i just don’t know how she’ll take it. i remember when my school counselor told her that i had a suicidal plan and she was extremely upset about it. from that day i just continued to keep everything to myself. i even tried hiding my cuts. i have anxiety and depression (and maybe some other diagnoses i’m not sure yet). i push myself so hard in life and seriously feel like giving up. i sound like a hypocrite to my own self because i constantly tell others that suicide is not the answer and that there are people who actually care.

i use to be extremely encouraged to do things such as getting a job or getting my drivers license at 16 (which caused me to get a mental breakdown, but i got my shit (license). i got my first job at 15, but after leaving the first job the second and current job has really shown me another side to my mental health. i constantly would cry on the jobs or have mental breakdowns and anxiety attacks. my anxiety caused me not to be able to call out sometimes because i didn’t really wanna talk, so i’d just stay home. i never really felt appreciated at all the jobs i worked at no matter how hard working i was. i was supposed to go to work today but i just ended up telling my mom i “called out”. it even caused me to cry to my mom because i hate that i can’t tell her what’s wrong with me. 
 
i perform very well in school, but it wasn’t till my sophomore year where i would constantly skip school to avoid the people and work. i use to always come to class late or i would be somewhere crying because of what happened at home or some shit. i was like a target to people (including the ones who i didn’t even know existed), for no reason. when i turned 16 i was extremely blessed to get a car that my mother and i were sharing. well i ended up getting into a car accident on my mother’s birthday which was on sept. 17, 2020. but a few days before it happened i went to my see my ex who kept harassing me and he took advantage and raped me again on sept 10., 2020 before my sisters birthday (yea it was hard trying to celebrate their birthdays). 

i had not spoken to him in a long time because all he wanted from me was sex and to harass me (which i was doing a good ass job by avoiding his bitch ass), but i don’t know what told me to go over there that night. i just wanted to settle things with him and ask him why did he keep doing this to me, but he hasn’t changed. now that you got a little back story, my mom just wants me to tell her what’s wrong but i just don’t want to hurt her or seem like a disgrace (which i am already).",07Oct2020,1

801,"This is a long post so bare with me. I am 25 years old and about to graduate college but I’m fearing that it’s in something that I don’t want to do for a living.

When I first started college I was a music Ed major. Music is my life and I live and breathe music. I play multiple instruments and I’ve always wanted to make a living with music. Somewhere around 3 years ago I started having doubts about becoming a music teacher (mostly because my school had messed up some of my classes and I wasn’t particularly fond of their edu program) I very quickly made a change to become an Info sys major without really looking into because I thought it would pay well and be easy. After spending the last 3 years going through that program I’m about to finish my degree and I’m feeling like I really don’t want to go into information systems because I don’t like it. It’s much more challenging than I thought and I don’t want to sit behind a desk my whole life.

I’ve also been with my girlfriend for 7 years and she has been living with me and my mom in a small double wide for the past 3 years and she is ready to move out but I’m scared to move out mostly because if we get a house and I am forced to get a job in info sys, I’m going to feel trapped and I’ll have to work a job I hate for the rest of my life. or worse I get let go of a job because I am not good at it.

803,"I recently started uni out of state, and I’ve been here for a month, and I’ve reached a low point with my mental health. I wouldn’t say I’ve ever been a super happy person, but I’ve never felt as depressed as I do now. I’ve gone from a comfortable situation at home where I had a lot of super close friends, to knowing no more than 4 people at my massive college, all of whom are extremely introverted and hardly hangout or have any drive to socialize with people outside of this circle. 
I obviously have gotten fucked over by covid, but it doesn’t feel like it’s gonna get better. Right now, I sit in my room all day, and I have lost the motivation to get any work done. I have dropped two classes and I’m hardly passing the rest. My parents are paying for me to be here, and I’ve worked my whole life to get here. Im fairly smart, and I’m in a stem major, so I know if I weather out the storm, I’ll be set, but I just don’t know if I can last three years after this in this mental state. I know therapy might help, but I’m not willing to do anything like that over zoom. I think my depression is fueled by my boredom here stuck on this campus with nothing to do and nobody to talk to, but I also think maybe it’s the other way around. 
I don’t think I have a choice but to stay in school, because it would break my parents hearts if I even mentioned dropping out, and, as I said, I worked hard to get here. 
But, I feel no pleasure right now. I don’t like spending time with the people I’ve met here, I am bored and not doing work in any of my classes, and I have talked to zero girls since getting here. 
I think I know what to do with my life, but I don’t know why. It feels like im setting myself up for “success” by staying in college, but I don’t even know what success is.

Me: me (duh)
F: best friend
C: person who is manipulating F.

Me and F have known each other for nearly 9 years. We havent had any big arguments and theyre my best friend. Recently, I saw C. I noticed that she had really nice hair so I went up to her and said hello and we became friends. Then I developed a crush on them. One day, F and I went shopping and we saw C. We decided to go to the skatepark together and sat down. Then C started like cuddling F. I was confused because, 1, F has a boyfriend and 2, she knew I liked C. Anywayss I was kinda upset but I got over it soon enough. Then, C randomly asked if she could kiss me. I was confused, but said yes. She did and nothing else really happened that day. The next couple of days, I noticed that F and C had gotten quite close and were constantly flirting with each other in front of me. One night over text I asked F if she had a crush on C. She said yes and that C liked her back. I was upset and confused because, still, F had a boyfriend. A couple of days later, me and F talked it out. She said that shes happy with her boyfriend and she doesnt really like her as much anymore. Then, C asked me out on a date. I said yes, and we went on the date. Whenever she went into a shop she would mention that she didnt have a lot of money so me, being the simp i am, bought the dinner and other stuff for her. But besides that, the day was pretty good.

That night she texted me. It said something along the lines of: ""I went out on the date to see if I liked you, but i dont. I like F and i really want to date her. And if you have a problem with that, then sorry."" I was upset but just replied with ""No, its okay, I understand :)"" and she said sorry again and that was that. Then on her story she posted a convo with her friend. Her friend said this: ""If she wants you to be miserable to get her own, way then shes just manipulative"" I was hurt because I didnt mean to be manipulative at all. I told F what happened and she said not to be upset and that she would talk to me tomorrow. I rang my other friend and told her what had happened (while crying lol) and she tried to calm me down and told me to talk to F about it in person the next day.

The next day F and I talked about it. I told her that I thought C was being manipulative and she agreed and told me that she had talked about me behind my back. She showed me texts between her and she told F to stop being friends with me because i was a bitch and i was annoying. She also said that she blocked me but I didnt realise until then. She also told F to break up with her boyfriend for her. I was shocked and later that day I sent a voice recording from F's phone and told her that she was my best friend and shes not gonna ditch me, and shes not gonna break up with her bf for her either. I told her to stop being manipulative, too. My other friend said something like ""If you cant respect my friends relationships, then I cant respect you"". C got mad and told her that i was the one being manipulative and F should ditch me.

And thats it so far. C responded to F when I sent the voice message but she said she is going to show me tomorrow soo yea.

813,"I (21f) want to move out of my childhood home. I have the opportunity to move in with my friend, rent the room at her apartment. Probably at the beginning of the next year if I can save enough money for few months of rent just to be safe if anything happens to my new job. 

Basically, I haven't told my family yet. And honestly I don't know how to even start the conversation. I intented to tell my dad and older brother (I live with both of them) right before moving out, as in next day moving out, but then someone told me it might be a very bad idea (my dad had heart attack couple of years ago) so I started to think and decided that yeah, they're right. And I've been thinking of the way I can tell you he truth, but I have some problems. 

I love my father and my older brother, I do, and we're not arguing so much like we used to years ago, but there are some issues that bother me to no end. 

Here's the thing. 

My father is kind of a hoarder. Not the biggest one I've seen, not like the people they show in TV Shows, but our house is filled with unnecessary stuff. Of course he swears we need them, that they will come in hand later in our life. And that turns out to be true veeeeery rarely.

Other than that are the neighbors that can see the state of our house and surrounding. Whenever I clean it or my brother... It doesn't last. One day it's clean and nicely empty and the other there is even more stuff that before. I'm ashamed, I try to avoid our neighbors as much as possible because  I don't want them looking at me when I know they see the mess.

I also can't even bring anyone over. Sure, I could clean and scrub and basically make the place spotless, but the house is old, the furniture, the walls. I basically don't want people to see the state that I live in. 

Oh and there's also the constant fear that someone will come and throw us out because of my father's debts. He says no one will throw us out, that they can't, but nope, I'm pretty sure they can if you haven't paid the bills in such a long time, dad. 

Almost no one knows about all of this. Whenever someone will tell me to change my mind and to stay living where I currently am because I could save the money to buy myself a house/apartment later on, I always feel guilty and think they're right. But then I come back home and remember WHY I want to move out... Yeah.

So basically what I am asking is, how can I tell my father and brother that I am moving out? I don't want them to make me feel guilty because of leaving, I'm afraid my father will try that and also be offended or something. I don't want to make  make them sad or angry. What arguments can I use?

Also, sorry if my English is in any way bad, it's not my first language.

I have been in a committed relationship with my boyfriend for a year now and we have taken the next step in moving in together. He’s 27, I’m 24(F). The issue is that he has admitted to intentionally checking other girls out and having sexual fantasies with these women because of a porn addiction and impulse. It bothers me yes, but it has become too big of a problem to ignore further. Most recently, we attended a football game where he noticed a girl from his past that he shared classes with. This girl was openly checking him out and my boyfriend noticed and returned the gesture. What hurt me the most, is that this other girl saw me next to him and didn’t feel the need to think twice about giving my boyfriend flirtatious looks. When I noticed, I waited for her to look away and addressed the matter with him. He denied it and said that he just recognized a familiar face and there was nothing more to it. I hate to say that I didn’t believe him and when I pretended to be distracted, I yet again saw him staring and ogling at the girl and even followed her out of the stadium with his eyes when she left. It hurts my feelings because of the lack of respect and the willingness to hurt me despite me being open and vulnerable about such a touchy subject. We talked it over afterwards and he admitted that he hadn’t had the best day and was just mad that I called him out on it. It just hurts that another girl was so open to disrespecting me, but the betrayal from my boyfriend in actively engaging and connecting with another woman hurts more. I just don’t understand this behavior at all, and I’m too close to the situation to see reason. I understand that’s it’s natural to find others attractive and that this is inevitable, but I also don’t agree that openly checking out other women in front of your SO is acceptable behavior.

hi. i have had a history with suicidal thoughts and have tried to commit once. i signed up for all ib classes (against my wishes) and am doing very poorly especially with online school. my mother is disgusted with my zeros and is furious with me. i am very stressed out from college search and my future. my mother says that i will be all alone and i will have a much harder life when i finally move out, but i dont think i can make it until then. i need to get out of this house. i dont know what ill do if i stay here any longer. i dont want to commit suicide. i dont want to die. but i dont want to be here either. i need to get out of here. ive never been allowed to have a job, so i have no money.

im not sure how my mother and father will react to me asking to get institutionalized. after my attempt i was not institutionalized after meeting with the doctors therapist. my dad thinks i am crazy and has told that to my face. my mother thinks i am lazy. im not sure if i should do a big show to convince them i need to leave, because i think theyll just laugh in my face if i ask. we are very rich, so my parents are of the opinion that i should not complain, but we can afford it. right now i am in a dreamstate. im scared of whats going to happen when i come back down to earth. this is how i felt right before my attempt. i have no where to let my emotions out because my locks have been taken and the last time i cried in my bathroom my dad took the door off.

827,"It all started when my sister(21) went to pick up some food for my brother and I. Now, we don't usually use my dad's car because it's filled with garbage, but today my mom's car was malfunctioning so my mom took my sister's car to work instead and dad took mom's car to get it fixed.

So my sis started moving a bunch of trash off the passenger's seat because she was too embarrassed to pull up at the drive thru in a garbage car and that's when she found the blue phone at the very bottom of the pile.

This is NOT my dad's usual phone. No one else in the immediate family recognizes it either, so you can imagine how suspicious this looks.

Here are the things I can tell you about the phone: it is pretty much brand new and was very clearly bought in Mexico. We speculate it was bought this past weekend, when my dad went on a solo trip to visit my grandparents (there are other opportunities he had when he could have bought it, because we live in a border town). The phone was unlocked, and there was no call history, no message history, nothing but a few downloaded games.

My dad has been known to be secretive. What I find really suspicious is that this phone was found kind of hidden in the car, it wasn't in a box, and there's no one I can think of that he might have bought it for.

I'm not sure what to do from here. Do we just come out and ask him why he has this random phone hidden in his car? Or is there something we should check on the device that we missed? Any advice or theories are welcome.",07Oct2020,1

840,"I seriously have no idea how i'm supposed to approach this nor do i understand it. Would like to hear your thoughts.

I (17F) need professional help for mental health issues immediately -advised by a doctor- but free healthcare in my area could take up to 10 weeks to get, with my symptoms worsening rapidly I'd like to get help quickly. Don't misunderstand, I completely get that private help can be really expensive and I feel TERRIBLE for even thinking about it in the first place, but please take everything into consideration before forming an opinion.

I've told my parents how bad I am mentally a little over a month ago. Since then, here's just a short list of the more pricey things they've spent money on: 

- My mother's botox (approx £200)
- A new T.V which we didn't need (Probably up to £1k)
- Remodelling the kitchen (Again, probably up to £1k+)
- A drone for my dad (approx £50)
- A branded coat (approx £200)

As you can see, my parents have no qualms about spending money on things we don't necessarily need. What's even better is that for my entire life I've grown up watching my parents struggle with money, so seeing them spend so much is foreign to me - I don't even ask them for things like clothing because I still worry.

Regular talking therapies go from £40 per weekly session and can start as soon as the next week. Based on what my parents have already spent money on, you'd think they'd be able to get their only child help but thats not the case. They've put no effort in so I've had to reach out on my own and they've even attempted to convince me I have no mental health issues. My father actually gave me a rock and said ""It's supposed to suck up depression"".  When I last brought up therapy to my mother, she complained about how expensive and unnecessary it is.

Despite all this, I do still believe my parents love me dearly and all of this is just a result of how they were raised. They do worry so I think I'd be able to convince them to focus on me, it's just a shame that I have to convince them in the first place.

TLDR : Parents spend thousands on things like botox and televisions but are reluctant to spend a little extra for their only kid's well being. Any possible advice?",07Oct2020,1
841,"So my problem is that I missed out on a mentor-matching program that started a month ago that my entire cohort signed up for. The mentors are grad students in years ahead of us, as I'm a first-year. My field is not very competitive, and the culture on campus is kind and helpful, but by being the only one who didn't sign up for this mentorship program, I feel like I sent the message that I don't care about how well I'm doing or that I'm closed off to advice. In reality, signing up slipped my mind, and I would have wanted to be part of the program

I've struggled with the paper for as long as I could remember and a friend of mine from the same class offered to help me with it. But instead of planning the ideas and working it through together, he went ahead and wrote the entire thing.... I was speechless and was very grateful for what he had done. I didn't expect him to have went above and beyond like that since nobody ever has. I felt really bad about it and told him that he didn't have to do that but he said he wanted to because he saw how much i was struggling and didn't want that. I want to give him something back in return and offered to give him money at this point because he deserves it for what he has done. But being the nice person that he is, he kindly denied it out of politeness, but deep down knowing that he would have liked it considering i know he was saving up for something expensive. At the same time, i dont want to make it feel as if the friendship is a mere transaction.. idk if he would think that?

Should I just force money down his pockets? How do you think i should repay him? He's also not somebody i see or talk to regularly either so i can't pay for things if we ever go out and hang or do any nice gestures for.

The problem has been plaquing me for a lifetime. As you can surmise from the title, I can be a proper dickhead when just waking up. This happens regardless of how much sleep I get. It's like, I need to cope with my own existence every morning. I have improved over the years. For example, I would previously be snippy, or be argumentative in the morning. But now, I'm more standoffish and try my best to avoid my SO. In general I'm just not fun to be around - which really negatively effects my partner.

This morning, as usual, I tried my best to avoid my SO and got ready for work. When I got home, my partner told me that I was mean to them, which kind of ruined their day. I really don't even remember this morning at all - I wasn't in a particularly bad mood, I was just trying to get on with it. I asked them if I said anything and they said no. I guess my general groggy cranky self just rubs off on them.

847," 

I move from NY to Utah for school. When I got to Utah, I registered my car in Utah, got Utah plates, and a new Insurance policy for Utah. I did all of this around Dec, 2019.

Fast forward to today, my NYS drivers license is about to expire so I go to the Utah DMV for a new license. I'm told that there is a hold on my license and to call NY DMV to work it out.

NY DMV tells me that because I never turned the plates in their records showed that I had no liability insurance on a car registered in NY. (I never saw one letter about this, somehow everything got forwarded to my new address except the DMV letters).

I just put the plates in the mail to Albany, but it's already been 10+ months since NYS has had me marked as not insuring my vehicle. Is NYS going to prohibit me from getting my Utah drivers license for 10 months?! This seems ludicrous to me, the car has been insured the whole time, there was never a lapse!

854,"Well, this question is quite common, and the answer is too. ""Just stop procrastinating and that's it."" But tbh, my situation got really complicated. And obviously I know it's my fault, but I don't know why I let it all end like this. I'm gonna give y'all some context. This ended up being longer than I expected, so get comfy...
I'm a university student, I'm in my first year, which started in February. Everything was going great, I assisted to all of my classes, I came home and I started studying as fast as I could to precisely, avoid procrastinating, I read what was necessary, I passed the exams I had... Basically I felt very good about myself for achieving all that. (That's because when I was in high school, I was terrified that I would fail in university, since it was very common for me to procrastinate, simply because I wasn't interested in what my teachers taught me. I mean, I just wanted to get into university to study something that I really like.) Anyway, the thing is that in March (which was when the quarantine started in my country) my optimism went through the pipes, I began to postpone my homework, I didn't read any of the texts they sent me, I didn't attend any of my zoom meetings because they weren't mandatory, and so the months went by and now I have a huge pile of texts accumulated since damn March that I still haven't read. Do I feel bad? Hell yeah, I feel horrible, ashamed, and guilty for letting this happen. At some point I began to wonder if I really liked my career, because, otherwise, why would it take me so much effort to read some simple PDFs? But no, the few texts that I did read, I enjoyed them. And then I realized that the personal problems that I have been having since December 2019 are affecting me more than I thought. In December I came out as bisexual, confessing to my former best friend that I was in love with her. Eventually things got awkward and my group of friends treated me differently, they all became very cold towards me, so I decided to break up the friendship. Then my family... At first they seemed fine with my sexuality, but after a few weeks I realized that they had very homophobic attitudes towards me and that affected me (still does) a lot. I miss my friends (we've been friends for four years, it's not that easy to forget. It's like I have mixed love-hate feelings towards them because what they did to me was awful and I never thought they were capable of such thing. Specially the girl i have [yes, I'm not over her yet] feelings for), I feel totally alone, I tried to talk about this with my family but they just downplay my problems. And this is how I lost motivation to do anything at the university. Plus, I can't go out, I can't take a walk or hang out with some of my other friends, I'm literally trapped in my own house with my own thoughts. And at this point I don't know what to do anymore. I have pending texts since March and final exams to take and I don't know where to start. I can't, I feel horrible. I want to go to the psychologist but I don't have enough money. I've tried multiple times to just sit down, try to calm down and start studying, but I just can't keep focused and I end up really frustrated, and I give up. Then I start to watch some show on Netflix to avoid crying. I already tried twice to call a help hotline because I felt so so overwhelmed, but no one picked up. I'm scared of starting second year of university and not know or understand a single thing because I haven't studied in the whole fucking year. I don't know who else to ask for help.",07Oct2020,1

It bothers me so much because growing up my dad used to get angry a lot and he would take his anger out on my mom and he would hit my mom a lot and sometimes he would take his anger out on us too and there was nothing I could really do about it and my mom always told me to not tell anyone about it and my brother was really young so he doesn't remember much of that but my dad has changed a lot since then and he doesn't do those things anymore. I made a promise to myself that I would never be like my dad and that I would never take my anger out on anyone besides myself and today I broke that promise. I don't know what to do I feel like I'm just like my dad and what if I lose control over my anger again. I don't know how to make it up to my brother.",07Oct2020,1
861,"I'm 25 turning 26 soon. Asian male, on unemployment. Feeling hopeless and down about life. Tried learning web dev only to find out I'm not smart enough to learn coding. Not sure what to do. Can't find a remote job since the start of the pandemic. Most of the replies I've gotten from these job listings are scammers trying to take advantage of me. I have a useless degree in biology. Maybe I should just become a security guard, or work as a barista or a truck driver and just settle and try to enjoy life as much as I can. I just feel tired everyday now. I think I have depression and anxiety. I don't like my life. I had such big dreams and goals when I was a kid. Now I just feel jaded and defeated. Everyday, I hear myself cry out to God for help. Please God, give me some semblance of meaning and hope in my lonely, pathetic life. Been watching Jordan Peterson videos to try to get some answers to life's difficult questions. I feel like I'm trying to grab at my life, trying to make it better, but there's nothing there. Just a bunch of sand, falling through my fingers. I've become so pessimistic. I feel so broken and unmotivated. I used to be so motivated and full of hope... My ideals were pretty high, so failing to reach those ideals then in turn judges me in my present state of brokenness.

862,"So one of my best friends basically admitted to me that this guy she's now engaged to is basically just a lifeline she *uses* to support her family. A goddamn sugar daddy. This actually happened years ago but ever since, I've never been able to look at her the same way. Every time we've hung out since then, there's just been this looming sense of disappointment and bitterness. Almost a regret that I even met or got close to her in the first place.

Let me explain why this bothers me so:

By immediately getting into a relationship with someone she met online, who's also halfway across the world, over twice her age and almost as immediately getting engaged, she's become a stereotype I **vehemently** advocate against. Where we're from, women are often fetishized and there's something of a gold digger and colorism culture in some women as a result of colonial influences. I myself, my girlfriend and one of my other best friends were born as a result of similar unions and are fully aware of the lack of sincerity these relationships sometimes spawn, hence why it's a personally triggering topic for me.

In spite of how I feel, I don't believe this to be reason enough to cut her off entirely. I have also seen/heard of some relationships develop into something genuine over time and she did express her ""love"" of him to me so I'll trust and hold her to that. How do I get rid of that feeling of disappointment? I don't want this to get in the way of the great times we've had and all the other times she's been there for me.",07Oct2020,1

I´m 23 years old, currently studying communication science as my masters degree. I find it really interesting, but there are more and more doubts that are rising, that I don’t want to really do it as a job some day. I also don’t actually find a job, and as I don’t find a job now, my CV looks rather empty which will make it even more difficult in the future.

&amp;#x200B;

The second thing is, that I don’t have a partner / girlfriend. I had two in the past, both left me. Right now, I am actually so afraid I won’t find one. I tried different dating apps, nothing works. I am too shy to go out or so. 

I also knew a girl, I was in contact with her for years, after my Bachelors degree I drove to her, 1000 kilometers. I stayed at her place, after two days, she stopped speaking with me, I still don’t know why. I left. This was one year ago, and I still think about her. I hurts every day, the only thing I can do about it, is drinking. 

These are the two thing which are keeping me up at night. Every day, I have something which I would describe as hysterical crying. I just can’t stop it, and I don’t see how it could get better.

i got many symptoms of anxiety, major depression and psychosis. i went to a therapist before to open up about how i feel and she told me to see a psychiatrist to get diagnosed. but i didn't go and i stopped seeing her because i thought i can handle it on my own. but now everything got worse, i can't deal with my mental health anymore, it affects my daily life. i need professional help. but i realized therapy isn't really helpful for me, i can't process my emotions and i'm bad at communication, especially when it comes to how i feel. on the other hand i don't want to take psychiatric medications because most people say they are bad for health and they make you just numb. + if you decide to stop taking them, withdrawals can be worse.

i don't know what to do at this point. i need to do something to get better. but how? professional help isn't helpful. meantime i find it hard to carry on when these symptoms get worse. i don't have strength to shake it off with hobbies or daily activities like how most people do. i don't have many interests, except for fitness but it doesn't help at all to cure my depression. i got distraction as a last option but i don't want to do it, it's exhausting and i don't have energy or strength already. plus what's the point? i don't enjoy it when i distract myself and at the end of the day i still feel bad, it doesn't go away no matter what i do. i wonder if there's an alternative to make myself feel better in the long term? or will i suffer all of my life lmao",07Oct2020,1

873,"TL; DR : I'm 21F, and I've been obsessed with romance since I'm a young teen. The idea of being attractive to a man and being in a relationship take so much space in my mind and I want it to stop.


Without even knowing, I've modelled my character iver the years upon the idea of being percieved as charming / interesting to men. My brain is always buzzing with daydreams about being seen by a guy, or about romance in general. When a guy flirts with a friend of mine instead of me, it puts me down. When a guy compliments me, it makes me very happy. When a friend is more attractive than me, I get jealous. When a guy looks at me, I get all those ideas that he has a crush on me. I get infatuated very quickly. When a guy is around, I act differently. And if it's not a real situation happening, then I'll have daydreams instead. All freaking day long. It never bothered me, but I've been realizing lately just how much space it's taking. It's just everywhere, all the time, and I just want it to stop. I'm tired of it. I want to stop it all, forget about men and love, and I want to build my career, work for my dream life and stay single for like 5 years.


On a deeper level, I know where it comes from. Basically growing up I didn't get much positive attention from any man in my family, so I guess it's a whole mechanism for getting that lack of affection back. I could get therapy but it's honestly not something I want to get into unless I absolutely have to, and I think just the one right advice from someone who's been like me is all I need.

Can anyone relate ? I want to try my hardest to stop this, it's a plague in my life.",07Oct2020,1

875,"So this might be a wall of text but I need to get it off my chest since all the people I'm talking with about this, are using a facade and are like whatever. 

To make a long story short. And My uncle has always been very close. It's always the two of us who used to play many different MMORPG Games together every day, just having a blast. I was a child back then. 15 years old or so. 

My uncle has been on benefits for the bigger part of his life, no education, just sits at home and plays videogames ""developing"" what I call the ""unhealthy bubble"" 

I was on Benefits from 18 to 22, I thought to myself and after many years of an uncle telling me, don't end up like me, get an education. Fast forward to this year 2020. I finish my education as a social care worker for children. Manage to land a job and paid very well. In between that my uncle's brother also manages to land a job which is paying well. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now the 2 people he talked to the most grows distant because of social life and work life. 

But not so much that we can still talk ""every day"" or every other day on discord. 

My uncle has had a discord channel where there are a few dozen people in and a family of ours who play a lot of pc. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've always been a very easy person to go with and always been a very ""follow the pack"" dude who never had his own opinion, fast forward to finished education, and a lot older, I'm now independent and have a meaning of everything. I'm no longer the one that can be wrinkled around anyone's pinky 

My other uncle, who landed a job? Yeah, he got a little money between his hands. He shows off everything he buys. Understandably, I also love getting feedback on my bought items 

Now both I and my uncle are making decent money while my other uncle he's living a very unhealthy life, he is on benefits, no work, makes excuses a lot and just overall are very lazy to find any job.

After I finish my education I feel a very big change is behavior from my uncle towards me. First off I put it away for maybe him having a bad day. 

Many more days later we talk and he's still having this angry ish tone towards me, and I tell my other uncle, what is up with him? and my uncle tells me that he 2 recognized that his behavior changed towards me. 

I start by telling him what's up, and he says oh its nothing, nothing is wrong. But i can still feel something is very wrong. 

A couple of months pass by with the same attitude till the day hell breaks loose. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm sitting with my brother (F) and my Uncle (S) And my other uncle (D) 

(We start having this conversation about Covid-19 and I say, that if COVID goes wilder and we are by country obligated to wear mouth cover then I hope that the state will pay for them. 

My Uncle (S) the good one (says - Luckily i don't have to worry about that as i get them from work)

(My brother (F) mishear things and he tells my Uncle (S) not to be an asshole and laugh that he gets them from work in a harmful way towards the other people in discord

&amp;#x200B;

I help out my uncle (S) Saying to my brother - He didn't even mean it that way

and then suddenly out of nowhere appears my uncle who has this hate to me (D) And says 

Just shut up blah blah blah and 

you remind me of (another family member in our family) (Not a guy you wanna be compared 2)

you always have to expel over other people 

and you're always so smart in your mouth 

&amp;#x200B;

And on it goes and he keeps spewing shit to me.

Then at some point, I'm like, now I don't take any more shit 

so i throw back at him saying I've lived half his life and made more progress than he has in his 50

so I would suggest him to shut up and I'm no way comparable to the other guy for that matter.

\-------------

We calm down a bit later and I'm all good, not mad in the slightest, but man he is still very upset about me. I start talking to him normally and he put on his friendly facade again till the next day - I'm kicked from discord. I hear from my other uncle he doesn't wanna talk to me anymore for some time, he wants a break. 

It's now been 2 and a half months and I've sent 3 texts to him and called him twice. Being very generous and not degrading at all. Just overall ""hey, let me know what's up since you won't talk to me, you can't just keep ignoring me all life"" etc. 

just a heads up to all readers. I' have always been the one in this family to pick up the phone and be the grown-up and make friendships happen again instead of having people being mad at each other. 

&amp;#x200B;

After 3 texts and 2 phone calls and no text back other than (I'm not mad)

I'm sitting here. 

He doesn't wanna talk, I keep hearing him talk shit behind my back from other family members and I'm at a point now where I'm about to cut all contact with the guy 

give him the last message telling him what's up and how I feel and how much of a dick his been to me the last very long time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm tired of being the good guy. It's always me that has to be the grown-up. I'm 25, my uncle is 50. 

It's always me that has to give myself to let other people have their way of life. And I'm honestly sick and tired of it. 

I'm saying to myself that I'm gonna give him until the 1st of January to answer me back or give me just something or else I'm cutting him from my life. 

&amp;#x200B;

Because no matter how much I've talked to the guy in the past of our toxic relationship the past few years he doesn't understand it and keeps returning to the bad things constantly. 

&amp;#x200B;

There's so much more to the story. I've managed to conclude that he is a narcissist and you can't work with such a person. All descriptions fit him perfectly in terms of that diagnosis. 

Now it's up to him to make the final decision whether or not he want me to stay on good terms with him or he just wants me to fuck off. 

I'm tired of giving my back to him, now it's him I need some commitment from.",07Oct2020,1
876,"So I (24M) have a kitten named Charlie and he’s about 4/5 months old. We’re really close and he doesn’t like anyone else for good reason. 

My roommate (32F) couldn’t care any less about Charlie and makes fun of me for caring so much for him. Her son, (4) is a constant terror to Charlie as he is chasing him around the house and throwing stuff at him, just making it a scary environment for a kitten all around. This has led him to be attached at my hip and to hiss at/run away from anyone he deems a threat, children specifically. 

My step-dad just called me and asked if I’d be interested in surprising my mom for Thanksgiving on their trip to the Georgia (U.S.) mountains; I look into the flights, he buys my ticket and I fly out for a week to spend time with the fam and then come back home to Hawai’i. 

I told him I was super interested and now it’s pretty much a plan in the making. Except, oh no I forgot about Charlie. I’m reluctant to leave him at home because I feel as though I can’t trust my roommate to take care of him, as she doesn’t really care about him to begin with. 

When we first brought Charlie home, the plan was that my roomie’s son would also take care of him but by the second time he had to clean the litter box, he threw an explosive tantrum and said he didn’t even want the cat. I hope you can imagine why I wouldn’t want to leave Charlie home with these people. Between having to feed him daily, cleaning his litter, keeping up with his medical needs, and grooming him, I highly doubt my roommate or her son would willingly suffice. 

The other option is taking him with me to Georgia but we would have to go by plane. I had imagined eventually bringing him with me when I move back home to Florida next spring, as a carry-on. I have heard horror stories about animals dying of heat and exhaustion while in the underneath area of planes. Charlie is potentially asthmatic (undergoing different treatments to be sure) and has a hard enough time getting used to riding in the car, even while in the carrier. 

On top of that, I could be judged by my family for bringing my cat along on the thanksgiving trip as my step-dad is super conservative and my mom is very practical. As I understand it, we’ll be staying in a cabin for a week in the middle of the woods in Georgia. This might not be an ideal environment for a kitten, but if he’s with me, I’m convinced he’ll be fine. The only other problem that remains is that we will have to fly back to Hawai’i once our trip has ended. 

So I have measured both scenarios and looked at the pros and cons and the biggest pro for taking Charlie to Georgia that I’ve come up with, is that when it’s finally time to go home to Florida, he’ll have experienced a plane already. The biggest con I came up with for leaving him at home (Charlie being malnourished and possibly dying) highly outweighs the biggest pro of leaving him home, i.e. the convenience of flying to Georgia by myself. 

Honestly, I don’t think covid will affect us much, but I could be wrong. If it is going to jeopardize Charlie’s health by taking him on a flight across the country and risk exposing either of us to covid, I might be more inclined to leave him home after all. 

Idk what to think. Hopefully one of you guys can help out with this decision...

TL; DR - I really wanna fly to go see my mom &amp; my step-dad is paying for my travel expenses, but my kitty cat has become super important to me as of late and I don’t want to leave him with the wrong people and I’m also hesitant to bring him on a plane. What do I do??",07Oct2020,1

We said no and that was that until last Thursday. At about 11:30 pm they came downstairs and pounded on the door and they asked us to stop smoking inside. Again we said we weren’t and we go outside to vape but they didn’t believe us. I thought that might be the end since were really not vaping inside but last night I was making some noodles and the husband knocked AGAIN accusing me of vaping inside.

883,"29f (kids are 8 and 12, boyfriend is 30).

So my boyfriend of 8 years has all of the sudden developed a habit of working insane amounts of overtime. This has been going on for quite a while. We both work at the same company and we have 2 kids together. Because of Covid, I now do a lot of my work from home because I need to homeschool the kids. I received a promotion and a pay raise, as well as an added 6 hours a week. So him picking up more hours is not due to our financial state. I'm not sure what it is.

Well, I've been really struggling. Like insane amounts of anxiety, super overwhelmed due to working AND homeschooling the kids at the same time and to be honest, all I want to do come 6pm is snuggle up on the couch next to my BF. BUT I cant. Because he doesnt even come home until well after 8pm now. Mind you, he goes in for work at 6am every morning. So when he does get home he eats, showers and immediately goes to bed. Theres barely any interaction. I have tried to talk to him about this several times but he always falls asleep mid conversation or barely pays attention to what I'm saying. He just zones out. I dont know if hes tired or if he just doesnt want to hear me.

Today has by far been the worst on me yet. I've been sick for going on two days and so fatigued that it's super hard to pull myself out of bed, let alone do anything productive. And my kids... Lord knows I love them but boy do they turn into little assholes the second momma is sick. Like full blown psychos. Literally running through my home like a fucking tornado, screaming at eachother, not listening to me AT ALL, breaking shit, complaining about literally every single tiny thing they can possibly find an issue with and the tattling? Oh yeah, tattle tits to the fucking fullest. He knows this because he called me on his break and I vented, while the kids were screaming in the background as I hid in a closet to get away. One of those days.

So, I called the boyfriend at 3. He was supposed to be out at 2pm. He didnt pick up, of course. He calls me at 330 and says ""Hey, sorry. Staying extra to help train the new guy."" So I said ""What happened to John? Hes trainer and he should be doing it."" His response was ""Oh, he's here but you know me. I dont want him to be stuck here by himself."" I went silent. I could say it was because of the day I've had but honestly I think it was just the built up resentment threatening to spew over the rim of the shit pot.

So he asks what's wrong. The only thing I could muster up was ""I need you to come home. John can handle it."" He said he couldnt. He already committed himself to the job of helping him out. So I lost my fucking mind and said ""Kind of like you committed to me when you asked me to date you? Or how about the fact that you committed yourself to knocking me the fuck up because you wanted children so bad? Either come home now or I'm packing my fucking bags. I have tried talking to you time and time again and nothing has changed! I feel like death but oh, that's right, taking on more fucking work is definitely more important."" I then  hung up. 

I called my mom to cry it out. I didnt tell her about my BF because I dont want that drama but I did tell her how the kids have been behaving today and how I feel like death and just want a hot meal cooked for me for once and to go to sleep. She came to my rescue. Well, bf walks through the door at 430 and immediately said ""Bedroom. We need to talk."" He proceeded to tell me that I hadn't brought this up with him (which is a bold faced lie) and that if I expect shit to change than I need to be better at communicating. I told him if he kept dismissing me I would leave.

And not to mention they text time to time.I’m not allowed in that little group anymore since I’m not friends with that kid, but she still goes and hangs out with them time to time, and it makes me feel weird, jealous, and left out and sad.

885,"For the last month or so, no food ever sounds good to me. Absolutely nothing. I’m definitely a chunk and I honestly love food. I love trying new things, experimenting when I cook, etc, etc. 

My body obviously gets hungry and needs nourishment, but I just haven’t had it in me to eat very much. I’ve been eating maybe once or twice a day, normally later in the evening or night due to my work/school schedule (Bad, I know. Trust me. I’m not happy about it either !!) I’ve also been mostly ordering takeout which I can’t fucking stand. My home is just not a safe environment to cook in. My mom’s boyfriend harasses me the second I step foot in the kitchen (or anywhere, really). I rarely leave my room unless it’s to use the bathroom or to talk to my grandma. 

I’m not sure what’s wrong. I feel fine health-wise. I definitely want to start working out again. The only thing I can think that may be the culprit of my eating is that I’m in a pretty bad depressive episode right now. So on top of not eating, I feel shitty mentally, and I’m *exhausted*, which is also being worsened by the fact that I haven’t been eating much. 

Has anyone else struggled with this? I’m not sure what to do. I’ll feel super hungry and then it goes away just from taking a few bites of something. Then because I don’t have an appetite, I’ll just stop eating altogether.",07Oct2020,1
886,"Hi, I'm a Christian, was raised in a Christian household, and when I was a small child - I wasn't afraid or had any doubts. However I didn't regularly attend church by any means and we never really talked about God or the Bible at home, we rarely ever prayed. And as I grew up, I would go to church for the activities or friends or food, but not to study. And when I stopped going at all, I was already so afraid of God and religion. I didn't want to talk about it or think about it. So I didn't as best I could for years until very recently. I witnessed something awful and ever since I have reverted back to being terrified and lost all over again. And with the world the way it is, it's not safe for me to attend church since I have an elderly grandma relying on me. And, I've tried asking multiple people these questions but I just.. don't know whose perspective is the right one. It seems like everyone who reads the Bible has a completely different perspective than someone else. I tried to read it myself but it's very difficult and it only gave me more questions and fears. So, I would like to list some questions I have, and if you could take the time to answer any of them, I would greatly appreciate it.   


1. Are women not allowed to shave at all? Are we supposed to have our hair covered? Are we not supposed to speak in church?   

2. It says not to breed two different animals together? Like a horse and a donkey to make a mule? What about different dog breeds? Like a chihuahua and a dachshund? What happens to the babies? Do they go to Heaven? What about the parents? Do they go to Heaven? What about the breeders? Do they go to Heaven? What if they don't ask for forgiveness because they don't know its wrong?   

3. Do all animals and living creatures go to Heaven?   

4. Do we remember our loved ones in Heaven? Will we be reunited with the people we love if we go to Heaven?   

5. If you have a tattoo, is repenting enough? Should you get the tattoo removed?   

6. Are piercings against the Bible? What if your piercing holes don't close?   

7. Is killing insects considered murder? Since they are living things as well?   

8. Are we supposed to be vegans/vegetarians?   

9. What about wearing polyester? Is that a sin? And wearing different materials? What about that?   

10. Is eating shellfish really a sin? What about pork?   

11. Are gays really frowned upon in the Bible? As well as people who support them? If God doesn't want someone to be gay or trans then why would He make them that way? The Bible also talks about not judging others and loving everyone the same, so how could we possibly reject someone who is gay or trans or anything like that?   

12. If the Bible has been edited so much, how do we know what God really wants us to know? Is there no original copy of the Bible?   

13. Can you pray for others forgiveness? Will they be forgiven and accepted into Heaven?   

14. How are you not afraid or confused or doubtful or lost? I feel like I'm the only person who is so afraid, I feel like everyone else is so confident that they're right.   

15. What about idols? What does that mean?   

16. Since Jesus died for ALL of our sins, does that mean that every sin we commit is already forgiven?   

17. When you ask for forgiveness can you just say ""Please forgive me for all of my sins"" or do you have to be specific like ""Please forgive me for cussing""? And what if you don't remember all of the sins you've committed? Or if you've committed a sin and didn't know it was a sin?   


I have accepted God as my Savior and Jesus Christ died on the cross for all of our sins. I stopped reading the Bible shortly after entering into second Corinthians because I just had so many questions building up (even more than this I'm sure). Is God going to reject me or punish me for not reading? Or for not attending church? I pray every night to Him before I go to bed, asking for forgiveness for anything I have done - but how can I know if I am truly forgiven? I'm sorry this is so lengthy. I hope you'll take a moment to answer even just one question. Thank you so very much for your time, and have a great, blessed day.",07Oct2020,1

889,"I (22f) recently had a baby (7 weeks old). My ppd has been pretty tame although I do have rare bursts of crazy thinking sometimes. 

Anyways I have a local Starbucks that I go to that is usually very nice to me (ie. knowing my name and order). As I was walking there today I unfortunately got my period and realized since I haven’t had my period in nine months I didn’t have any products with me. No I was halfway there and was thinking if I should go back or continue to go and just ask one of the ladies if they could spare a tampon for me. I decided since everyone’s usually nice to me that they would be able to spare me one and so I went. When I got there it was a new girl at the tail and told her I was having a bathroom emergency and asked her if anyone had a tampon that I could borrow. She went straight to her boss and asked her and I could overhear them talking and the boss says “ no just tell her to go buy some” so the girl comes back and tells me to walk another block to buy some. Normally I would but I have been trying to save money and so I only bring with me the amount that I’m going to need on my walk. I got a cheap drink so even if I got my money back I wouldn’t be able to buy any. I was so mortified and had to walk home drenched in my own blood with my child while I bawled The whole way home. Now I’m asking what I could do to make that boss realize how mortifying it was not only to ask but to be denied with little remorse.. I want her to realize that she went against girl code and really made me feel like nothing and disgusting for absolutely no reason.  She could’ve asked anyone of the five other women working there but instead decided to just straight up tell me no. How do I make her see what she did was wrong?",07Oct2020,1

I'm really just needing input on why all the sudden I've gotten bored of my life. I went on a vacation in early September and ever since I got back I just lost interest in my job, my friends, spending time with my family, and literally everything else. My routine has overall stayed the same. I still go to work and make the best of it (because I should feel lucky for being able to work right now), I still make plans with friends, and I still see my BF and family on a regular basis. I go to the gym a few times a week, I'm in online college courses, and I'm involved with a Saturday farmers market through the fall, and am overall pretty busy.

I'm not sure if I'm just tired of the way the world is right now, or if I need to change something to feel better. I see all my friends thriving, doing new things, taking risks that workout perfectly for them, but I'm honestly too scared to make a big jump like that, but if it's something I need to do to be happy, I might consider it.

896,"This person has known me since we were around 5 (I’m 15 now), and we used to be decent friends. However, I’ve been through a lot of stuff in the past few years, and this person reminds me of a lot of that awfulness. I really, really hate this person and especially their parents. I know they have good intentions, but I cannot look them in the eye without having horrible memories flood back to me. I was hoping that we would “grow apart” and I could casually disassociate myself from them, especially with this whole quarantine thing. 

However, last week was my birthday, and they mailed me a homemade card that they clearly put a lot of effort into along with a cliché overly-peppy message (this was in addition to the emoji-ridden happy birthday text I ignored earlier). If we were still close, I’d send them a text thanking them. But, I can’t bring myself to do it, which makes me feel even more sick. My gut says to keep ignoring their texts, but I know that that’s such a shitty thing to do. It really is a cool card, but I don’t want to have them think that I still want to be associated with them.

898,"Ok - this is my first Reddit post, but I figured this community was the best one to post in (this site has me feeling like a kid whose lost their Mum in a store). 

&amp;#x200B;

Warning - I'm providing you with your classic 'I'm in my twenties and I don't know who I am' spiel. But what better way to introduce myself to all the Redditors (?) out there.

&amp;#x200B;

To get to the point, I'm at a stage where I feel like I am constantly a different person. One moment, I'll be wanting to live by the coast, have kids, become a teacher, live a wholesome ass life. Then other days, I'll crave mystery, excitement, scandal. I'll indulge in sex, drinking - not too long ago, I was in central London, sharing a bottle of red wine and smoking a cigarette by the Thames in the middle of the night. It might be the most content I've felt in a long time. I'll obsess over music, books and art that seem to get at the heart of living - though these all seem centred around heartbreak, loss and pain.

&amp;#x200B;

So I guess I'm here because I feel conflicted. The first person I described seems like it's what I should pursue. Theoretically, that's what will make me happy. And we should aim towards happiness, right? But the second person - she's addictive. She's not happier, but she feels more real.

&amp;#x200B;

These two people don't seem to marry up. It would be really helpful to know if other people have experienced something similar. Recognising your potential for a successful/happy life but being unsure about whether you'd really be happy - or if, in fact, you'd be living a lie, knowing you're depriving yourself of your real pleasures simply to live a life you're supposed to live.

903,"So I just had my first therapy appointment after putting it off forever, and I don’t know I kind of have mixed feelings. He did a good job of getting things out of me but he did it in a way where it was kind of brash and he was a little bit too direct and pushy. Like I was kind of being subliminal and general and he very sternly told me that I have to be more specific, and in my head I was like we barely met dude chill. And also weed came up and he said it’s probably one of the worst things I can do with my life, and Idk he just seems like just another old guy. I asked him if he ever tried it and he didn’t address that and just spit out some stereotypical mumbo jumbo, and he was suprised when I told them that I actually didn’t feel lazy at all when high but rather worked out. And I don’t even smoke weed anymore but I just didn’t really like that. 

He seemed kind of dominating and he just reminds me of like a cocky uncle and I didn’t like that he wasn’t sensitive about anything, and we kind of just jumped into the deep end. 

The only reason I would even consider continuing with him is bc I’m a dude and I kind of have problems with authority, and he kind of seems like my dad but with better communication skills (and I don’t have a good relationship with my dad), so maybe that could be beneficial. 

As I said before the brashness was just kind of unsettling and I don’t know how to explain it but I just feel like he’s more old school and he’s like a mans man. I honestly don’t like these type of people but I envy them bc it seems like they just do they don’t really think. Like I was talking about speaking Spanish and he’s like well lets see it, and I did it, and he basically said in Mexican slang that it was white washed or “pocho.” 

I told him that I have low self esteem/self image, and bc it’s virtual I think he’s just going the like domineering route, and Im a tall and big dude, so I think if it was in person he’d see like the whole picture more.

I don’t know this was not how I imagined it at all. I’m also a little bit worried that it’s just gonna reinforce my feelings of anxiousness, bc I felt myself just being placed in this role where I didn’t feel like I wanted to talk to him and he more so forced things out rather than talked it though.

905,"I have what I think are anxiety attacks. Not fun. People I dislike are also not fun.

(I know I shouldn't be self diagnosing, but I have done a fair few risk assesments with my counsellor and she's said that I have symptoms of high anxiety, done my research and asked friends who have gotten diagnosed with anxiety about them.)

My anxiety attacks causes a range of things to happen, and as of recently it starts to become more frequent that these symptoms occur: headaches, inconsistent dizziness (fine one second, head's spinning wildly the next), mild shaking to tremors in the upper body, numbness in my legs, an inability to scream, lungs tightening/inability to breathe, averting eyes(my eyes can't focus on one spot) and chest pain. 

I am not getting professional help with these yet, as they've only started getting more frequent recently. 

About a week ago I joined an among us discord server full of kids who were friends of my friends, and friends of said friends, etc. - you get the idea. There were around 50 people, half of which I did not enjoy being around. In the beginning, it was more quiet, say 10 or 11 people, but it just kept getting bigger and bigger and I knew the inevitable truth was that there were going to be some really - excuse my language - fcking annoying  brats. My friend, who was the owner of the server ended up passing ownership down to me, having seen someone she didn't like. I thought I could handle the 20 or so people who were there. Then it became 30, 40, 50-

At that point I could tell there were going to be kids that really pissed me off. These kids:
- were really inconsiderate and rude
- had the belief that using words like f*ggot and r*tard as insults were okay (which are not but apparently they're not mature enough to understand that mental illnesses/disabilities and sexualities shouldn't be used as insults)
- would continue to spam pings and messages outside of the spam channel
- would put p o r n in the chat, after I sPECIFICALLY TOLD THEM TO NOT PUT ANYTHING EXPLICIT IN THE CHANNELS.
- would continue to ""tease"" (it wasn't even teasing at this point, I found it was straight up bullying) a friend(?? acquaintance??? not sure yet, I've really only known him for a week) for being nice to girls (he wasn't even simping, he was literally just being a decent human being.)  One of his friends literally spammed threats at him in DMs after he banned him for being a prick and trying to nuke the server.
- would make threats? wtf? and talked behind other kids' backs??? 
- some unprecedented kicks happened and I didn't know why, so I got blamed for that
- CANNOT WRAP THE IDEA OF ""BE RESPECTFUL AND KIND TO OTHERS"". 
- literally cannot listen to a single thing i ask them to do


honestly fck them all that's all I wanted to say

But because this got so overwhelming for me I ended up panicking and leaving the server. I feel really guilty about it because the server was left in a different friend's hands with an admin he barely knew, and another admin he'd known for a while but from what I KNOW either makes too quick of a judgement or is too hesitant to speak up. 

After that entire thing I ended up having a series of mental breakdowns and an anxiety attack that just crept up on me. 

So now, if you've read this entire way (and thank you):

We love and respect each other and are a great couple. Except:
Basically our libidos are so different that I don't know what to do anymore. He wants sex every 10 days, I would prefer every 2-3 days.
Its just not in his mind and when I try to kiss or seduce him he pushes me away.
He is not seeing somebody else, just gaming and watches TV. Also not jerking off to porn. Just does not feel the itch. 
I'm a very attractive and successful woman.
Him pushing me away is ruining my self esteem, my sense of being young and sensual. Also after 2 years of this stuff it's ruining my sex skills.

When the pandemic started she had to go to a different country as she is not a citizen in our country and has started to act more angry/get offended by little stuff more. I could understand that because she was stressful as her mom didn't go with her and she was having hard time there with the quarantine. But like 3 months ago she came back to here as unlike in our country the pandemic has started to get out of hand in the country she is citizen in. But she just went on with an unstable act. With that I mean, like she textes to a group chat about this thing she refused to give information about to the other two that were chatting when she texted. And when they didn't really care and went on talking about what they were already speaking besides just greeting her, she got angry and left the group. Blocked the others. And then she joined the group chat again after a week like nothing happend and continued to talk with them. And this is just an example, those stuff always keep happening. She just gor mad at me ans this other boy in the group chat because we didn't respond her in way she wants. We were talking about this animes opening and she just wrote ""fucking sleep"" despite it being only 11 pm ? Like she sleeps at a late time as well. So I'm not sleepy yet and the other person I was speaking said with you can sleep if you want, which I showed that I agreed. She got angry over this, left the group chat and when I asked her why she started giving responses such as I wonder why ? So I asked if it was seriously about that which she said yes you must be shitting brains to be that intelligent which I replied she was not making any sense and I qas not gonna apologize to her and that we could speak again when she calmed down. Lol didn't even reply. At this point honestly I just get annoyed by the way she is acting. I had asked her if there was a problem dozens of times but she says no.

924,"Hi not sure if this is the right area to post?

I'm thinking of buying a house - I have a help to buy ISA (savings account not taxed) with a few £000 in and want to make best use of the house market atm. I've always worked a lot 2-3 jobs and have enough to put a good chunk of deposit down on a house. With a deposit I could afford a low-mid range house w monthly mortgage payments.

ATM stamp duty tax is quite good. Houses can be bought for up to £500k (but I could never really afford a house for that much). My older sister (33f) owns her own home with her partner and I know it causes her lots of stress. She is in a very well paying but stressful job on top of stress of owning her house.

I'm currently sharing a rented 2 bed with my twin sister (31f) who is currently throwing a tantrum in her room). I've been discussing with her about me buying a house and she said she wouldn't be able to afford to live on her own. She could move back in with our parents but she really doesn't want that.  

Long story short the problem is I feel like I'm rushing to try to find a house to buy while stamp duty is essentially £0. After March 2021 I would pay between £4k to £7k extra if I decide to wait to buy a house. I'm not sure what to do. I've seen a few houses I would be interested in looking at but my older sis who gives me lots of advice is very critical and shoots almost all of the houses I show her down. 

I listen to her opinion as I trust she has my best interest at heart. But I know if I bought a house she didn't agree with and if I had any issues she would just say 'she told me so' and not help. 

Any advice on what to look out for when buying? I've ready online you can haggle 5%-10% lower than asking price. Is this true? Can I ask the house be clear of previous furniture? Help me plz and thanks in advance.",07Oct2020,1
925,"So recently I went to a small house party with some close friends and I got extremely drunk for the first time. I only remember snippets of the night but the parts I remember really confuse me. I ended up cuddled in bed with a girl I've been close friends with for years, holding hands, whispering good things I've wanted to say to her for ages and stuff like that. She said that we were really solid and comfortable with each other. We ended up kissing briefly but she pulled away saying something about how she can't; she has to be single for a bit (cos she's had some struggles when dating, but that's a different story). When I woke up in the morning she was far from me in the bed and we barely spoke in the morning. She seemed embarrassed, especially with friends teasing us. I messaged her saying I was sorry if I made her feel weird at the party and she sent something similar back to me but I let her off the hook saying 'nah it was good but just unexpected.' Basically what I need help with is if I follow up and ask her out. I know she's expressed a wish to be single but I know that both of us felt so comfortable with each other that night and in general, and maybe it was the alcohol for her, but I know that for me I've felt this way for a while. Thinking about her with someone else makes me feel sick because I know that I can actually help her with her insecurities, I KNOW that I actually care about her for what's inside. Do I risk ruining our friendship by asking her out? Or should I just go back to trying to let her go? I can't imagine not having her in my life but I can't stop thinking about her now.",07Oct2020,1

She said she was concerned about my Mental health. 

Reasons why:

I don't get much sleep, my room is always a mess, I don't have a great relationship with any male authority figure in my life, because of my experiences with self harm and the fact that I can't stay on top of my grades.

I understand her concerns partly. But some of those are bc of all the things she expects me to be able to do (she's really not asking for *that* much, I just can't seem to meet all the standards)

But besides that I just can't do therapy. The thought of going and talking to someone about how I feel genuinely makes me  nauseous and panicky. I really don't like it. Half the time I don't even understand how I feel or why so Thearpy is just not something I want to do. I hate having to express my Emotions I hate it. I don't want to go please.

Hes currently on meds and goes to counseling and there's other things that I plan on having him do to work on his  anger issues. My boyfriend broke up with me because of that bc he's worried about the safety of his kids so I understand where hes coming from.  My son would never hurt anyone.

931,"Long post ahead.. thanks for taking the time to read :)

My wife and I had a lot of trouble conceiving about 5 years ago. We tried for almost a year before we went to the fertility doctors and figured out that it was due to low sperm count on my end (like 1/10,000th the amount of sperm that I've had). My wife and I were 32 at the time. We were aiming for 2-5 (her more 2, me more 5 hehe). She was okay with adopting, but I really wanted bio kids, so we decided to go with IVF.

My wife really didn't like the idea much (since she didn't like needles), but disliked IUI more. At the time, she was also concerned that there are people who are judgemental of surrogacy, so insisted that we don't tell anyone except her mother (whose help we needed) and tell the kid(s) when they were older. I didn't think it mattered much and all was okay. So we wanted to maximize the odds that it would succeed. We were well off financially, so I figured we can just go with surrogacy (compensated), since when you transfer the embryos fresh (without it being frozen), the odds are better, and there would be less needles for her. Plus if she is not pregnant, we would still be able to try naturally (albeit the chance would be very low) depending on how the IVF turned out. So we got two surrogates to transfer at the same time (since it's better for both the baby and the mother if it was a single transfer each, but failure rate was high). It went really well overall. We got a lot of embryos and one of the transfers was successful, and we got a wonderful baby who is now a really smart 4 year old. :-) Our relationship with our surrogate(s) were great too. 

Fast forward two years later and we were ready to transfer for baby #2. Our surrogate was younger than my wife, so we figured that it was better to transfer into the surrogate that 1) had already succeeded and 2) had a higher chance of success due to age.  Our previous surrogate was excited to help us add to our family, but unfortunately, her medical screening failed and she wasn't able to help us. We thought about it and it seemed like #2 is still true and we wanted to maximize our odds, plus my wife didn't want more needles and hormones, so we figured it's best to just get another surrogate to help. While we were procuring breast milk, we had found another helpful lady who was an experienced surrogate and was available, so we tried again with her. But unfortunately, we went through 6 meds cycles and were able to get to transfer just once, which we were really excited about but then resulted in a miscarriage :-/ We felt really bad and gave the surrogate some money and everyone went their separate ways.

I had really wanted the kids close together in age, so by this time, even if we succeeded, they would already be almost 4 years apart, plus not really sure how long embryos are good for when they are frozen, so I felt really desperate to transfer the other embryos. We discussed my wife carrying, but by this time, she is over 35 and has additional risks and lowered chance of success, so we figured it would still be better to have a younger surrogate carry if that option is available. She had always wanted to transfer one baby at a time (after the initial two), but because the age gap was getting so wide (and if we went through another surrogate, the kids would be 5+ years apart), we decided to just try to get the surrogates and transfer whenever. Luckily, we were able to find two surrogates who were willing to help us. It took the better part of a year but they were both finally able to get to transfer and both embryos resulted in pregnancies. They're actually about 1.5 months apart and we're at around 24 and 30 weeks now, so they'll soon be due, and I'm ecstatic to be getting the bio family I wanted.

The problem started when I started sharing the good news with my friends that we are getting two more babies. So naturally, they ask about the due dates. I figured that since she agreed to transfer them on separate dates, they were going to be born on different dates and people were obviously going to know that the kids were either adopted or went through surrogacy. But she said that we had agreed to not tell people, so I shouldn't be telling people until both babies are born, and just tell people that they are twins.

I tried going along with that and it was okay in some situations, but when close friends ask about the due date, I feel like I'm being evasive or outright lying. One close friend asked me when she was expecting specifically, and I told her I had to answer him honestly, but she said that if I told anyone, we would have to get a divorce since there would be trust issues. So I just told him that my wife wasn't comfortable discussing the babies until they were born (which was technically true, but still felt like a lie since he would get the impression that my wife was carrying the baby and I'm essentially confirming that).

My wife showed me some posts about people criticizing surrogacy, and it is true that some of them are pretty judgemental, and as a husband, I certainly don't want her to get criticized and have some sort of stigma attached to her. But I also can't go around having anxiety about talking to people that if I introduced my kids and their ages (since that's really normal when you talk to people), I would have to have make up some sort of awkward semi-lie. Especially in front of the kids, where I want to teach them that in situations like this, you just put yourself out there and be proud of who you are and just associate with the people who are okay with who you are.

I discussed with my wife and she felt really uncomfortable but would be okay to tell the people who actually associate with the kids, but not other people (like my friends or extended family) and only share the births on social media after both kids are born. This resolves it some, but it's not like the two groups of people will never mix and I would get no support from my friends essentially and every new person I meet, I would still have the same problem. And I feel weird about having to hide the birth of the younger child for 1.5 months.

The funny thing is, basically nothing has happened. We got the family we were aiming for, and things should be really happy now. I'm getting what I wanted, she got what she wanted, and the surrogates got what they wanted (they were well compensated and in the US and we did everything legally and we have a good relationship with them and I kind of feel like they're part of my extended family). I feel like since the kids will know eventually (probably within 5 years max, if not already) and they are free to tell other people, basically people will know, so it's just something she'll have to get used to sooner or later, so why not let it be sooner, so that we can get some support from the people who care about us.

So my question is, what do people think of the situation? If you heard this story from your friend or someone you've just met, what would be your judgement of my wife?

Would be helpful if you are responding  to let me know if you are male/female and age and whether you are a parent.

Is this something you feel strongly about, or have an opinion but it's not really that important of a thing?

If there's any advice on what might be a workable solution, would be happy to hear as well.",07Oct2020,1

Mom even made dad Kick out my older brother and sister when I was 1 because she didn’t get along with them and threatened to leave and take me if he didn’t. 

But this time it got really bad. I remember holding my little sister in our room and hugging her because they couldn’t stop arguing and she was crying so much. Eventually mom up and left for a few weeks after telling dad She wants a divorce but will give us to dad, so he said he wanted child support then in a desperate attempt for her to stay, which is what originally starts this whole mess. 

During that time dad was a complete mess and a depressive wreck. Growing up I was always called his buddy since I looked up to him when I was younger, so as I Grew up I would cling to him a lot since I didn’t get along well with mom and never felt like she really loved me and cause dad wasn’t home often. So I eventually became his dumpster for his emotions and thoughts. When he was mad at mom he would tell me how much he wanted to choke her, he’d say it in front of my little sister too. But I didn’t understand I was just his scapegoat to blame all the time and emotional dumpster until last year, nor did anything click what was actually happening. 

Eventually mom did come back, and things were back to “normal” for a bit. We even went to a Christmas party as a family. But She still made it clear to dad she was still wanting to leave and Every desperate attempt dad made was shut down. So New Years he let her take me and my little sister to a party where there was drinking and Inappropriate pictures and drunk guys around. Dad was planning that night while we were gone to get drunk and try to kill himself, he told me about it the next day after we got back. Early January I was home alone with my little sister cause mom had left again and dad was out, An officer came by and served me some papers that was apparently accusing dad of physical abuse and was requesting to put in a restraining order for me, mom, and my little sister against dad. 

So mom came back for a bit and dad was out for the house for a bit until the request was thrown out of court. I remember how mad he was at mom that he convinced me to go against her and refuse to go to my counseling appointment (which I was going to because the year before I almost attempted suicide) to the point of me shaking because Mom was yelling at me when I told her no.  Both parents are very emotionally and mentally abusive. They’ve both always put me and my little sister down, disregarded our feelings, yelled at us if either of us cried, Both have shamed me after I got older for not going into sports when i was younger even though they said I couldn’t because we didn’t have the money for it, Dad even Shamed me because I got sick during a pageant when I got my first period and was too sick to stay up on stage, dads also told me I’d be living in a box and be  a failure when I said I wanted to be an artist, they used to make fun of me later on when someone was singing up on a stage and poked at my insecurities saying if only I wasn’t so shy I could be like that because I’ve said too when I was younger that I wanted to sing, and I’ve even had to raise my little sister since I was 8. Honestly I don’t think either of them are fit parents and my older brother I don’t see very often agrees too and said it himself, which had really pissed off dad and my older sister who sided with dad and can be very hypocritical herself. He’s on very low contact with a lot of our family and is usually working a lot. 

But anyways they started going through the divorce. We all had to live together for a bit with mom and dad both avoiding each other and me and my little sister stuck in the middle. Mom was accusing dad in courts Over false allegations of sexual assault, physical and verbal abuse, and just whatever she could. Behind her back when we were with dad he would say the worst things about her, Complain, rant, how he wanted to kill her and say whatever he wanted in front of me, 15 at the time, and my little sister who was 8. 

About summer mom and dad were ordered to start having to move in and out. Mom there with us for one week, dad there for the next week and so on to see how they both parented during their times. Well, dad told his lawyer that I wanted to stay with him full time. Dad told me about it in a way that was pushing me to agree and persuading me to say I agreed with it even when I didn’t, but he put it in a way that said “if you don’t do this, we’re going to fail and it’s your fault.” And his lawyer asked me in private if that was true that I said I wanted to stay with dad full time even if it meant I had to move out with him, and I regret saying yes because I never said anything of the sort and I dislike lying, but I was still in that mindset of believing dad was still right and Had his kids best interest in mind so I said it was true.

So that’s what happened. Me and dad ended up having to live with my older sister and her husband with their 2 kids who had just bought their house a few months prior. We’re there for one week, then me and him move back into the house the next week with my little sister and mom moves out on her own. Well things happened and the judge never found out about that I was being moved out too. Dad has the judges switched about two more times until were with the one we have now, and he’s changed lawyers about 3 times.

Even now we’re still moving in and out under that arrangement. And just to clarify some things that have happened on both ends, Mom had once filed an order again that me, her, and my little sister would be under her care and Away from dad permanently. It was thrown out but before anyone knew it was thrown out I got called in at school the next day and had to meet with a cps lady who forced me to leave with my grandparents, who side with my mom cause my step grandma hates her husbands family and he enables her. And my mom with my little sister. I cried down the hallway when I went to get my stuff because I couldn’t believe what was happening and I was being forced to go somewhere I really didn’t want to go. 

So I ended up at my grandparents for about 5 hours, completely depressed, couldn’t stop crying, and my little sister kept trying to cheer me up. Mom didn’t say a word to me or even acknowledge my existence despite crying in front of me to the cps woman about how much she loves me and cares about me and just all the bullshit she could pull off. 

I’m aware she’s very narcissistic and I think my dad might be too. Eventually dad told me he contacted cps and informed them the order was dropped so i was cleared to leave. My brother showed up just then after my grandpa called him and told him I was trying to leave ( he didn’t know what was going on), so he tried to keep me there. Eventually I finally stood my ground and decided to walk if I had to, so my brother offered to give me a ride up there. Police were called by dad and It was just a mess. Dad admitted later that he had even cried after he found out I was taken and Had asked classmates of mine who were leaving if they had seen me. 

My dad isn’t good either though. Once when I was crying and upset, I didn’t want to go to youth group (which dad was forcing me to go to because it looked good for him to brag about) yet because I didn’t want anyone to see me crying. Dad got mad and Ended up moving the car we were in just to park it up front so everyone who walked past could see me crying. Even my little sister kept telling him to stop being so mean Whos he kept making snarky and insulting remarks to me because I was upset But he refused because he said it was my fault for being so over sensitive, which yes I am a very sensitive and emotional individual but I can’t help it. I was then grounded that night from everything, including my phone, which my dad knows I have a long distance boyfriend I’ve been talking to for 2+ years that I love dearly and who supports me and is really there for me when I need someone to turn to. He doesn’t care only because he doesn’t consider it an actual relationship. 

Today though, I came home from school, which is practically my safe haven by this point. Me and my little sister were talking on the couch when he decided to butt in and change the topic to court again. My little sister just started humming instead to ignore it since she doesn’t like listening to it either because that’s just what he always talks about. Either court, how terrible mom is, complaining, or how much better he is than her or other people. He brought up that the reason the female lawyer he has currently didn’t ask me very many questions was because she felt like I didn’t feel like talking at the time she asked me, which I didn’t because just before that I was informed nothing was going to change and We’re still going to have to continue our stressful situation for longer, so of course I was upset at the time. So he started blaming me for having an “attitude” because she said I can’t be in that kind of state if I talk to the judge, which my dad is really forcing to push me into having to do, because the child lawyer isn’t on his side, and Mom’s lawyer is really shady and has been lying Over documents and Shes been lying herself over many allegations. 

But by this point I’ve developed the habit of just walking away when I was uncomfortable, so I did and dad got pissed off. He asked why was I walking away and why I wouldn’t talk about important things. I just ignored him and started cleaning around the house to ease my stressed mind, and he followed me, starting to make remarks that I kept ignoring until he started claiming I’m just like mom. Which he’s said to me before when complaining when I’m not doing what he wants, or don’t agree with him. A couple times he’s called me a bitch and the most ungrateful kid he’s ever met because I argue with him over the inappropriate ways him and mom treats my little sister or other topics we don’t have the same view on. Both parents are very argumentative anyways, and I’m very avoidant of conflict. I hate getting mad at people, snapping or arguing with anyone and just usually start crying when I do because usually it’s mom or sad who push me into an argument then blame me for it. 

So he finally started remarking how I’m just like mom, I’m selfish, It’s going to be my fault my little sister gets stuck with her abusive mother, and that I don’t care about her. Which as soon as he said that I was ready to snap. I’ve never been more protective over anyone else than my little sister who I’ve argued with both parents over the ways they deal with her and have tried to do my best to take care of her. I threw the blanket I was mid folding at him just to keep myself from full out smacking him and walked off to mine and my little sister’s room, where I buried myself under the blanket and started sobbing and shaking really badly to the point I could barely breath because I was so upset and mad. At this point I hate both him and mom and most of my family because nearly all of them are either narcissists or very egotistical, or toxic enablers.

Our next court date is October 30th when hopefully this all will be settled but I don’t know if I can hold out much longer. Dads talking about possibly pushing it out to November and I’m going to be 18 in December, but I have no where to go and I don’t want to leave my little sister with my dad at all. Especially when once she’s actually tried jumping out of the car when dad once threw her phone out the window because she couldn’t spell a word right and he often calls her stupid, tells her she’ll never get anywhere in life, and Compares her to other kids. He also often compares her to me, because I make close to straight A’s and He looks at me more as his most potentially bright child, which I’ve gotten mad at him for before and told him it wasn’t right to say things like that. But no matter what I say it doesn’t change his opinion because he’s “always right”. 

He wants me to talk to the judge and basically boast about how much better he is and talk as much shit as I can on my mom, he even lists off things he tells me he wants me to remember to tell the judge. He wants me to talk to the judge because he says I’m the most believable one in all this and the lawyers have said I’m the most viable witness to be able for us to get my little sister. I’m only with dad because he’s the lesser of evils, but both parents are very irresponsible, manipulative, and Selfish. Dads a hypocrite, verbally and emotionally abusive, and very charismatic, so everyone he meets often thinks of him very highly and it sickens Me, mom meanwhile is likely to move away, is a heavy partier and alcoholic and often leaves my little sister alone and unsupervised, and very neglectful.

I’m terrified of the idea of me and my little sister getting taken away because I haven’t heard very good things over the child service systems or anything and I don’t want her to go through anything worse than she already is now and I don’t want either of us to get stuck with any of our other family, because most of them are just as bad as our parents, are too busy, or it would be way too inconvenient for them. 

Is there even anything I can do but just suck it up? I don’t want to keep lying that everything’s fine, and I especially don’t want to lie to a judge or lawyer again just to please dad when I know neither are fit to take care of kids properly. But he’s been dating this long distance Jamaican woman we’ve met before, and shes very bluntly honest and strong in her morals,beliefs and is hard working. She doesn’t enable dad and dad was actually much better during the time she was here in America, so I am hoping if they do stay together and she comes here if maybe there is hope he could be better and I won’t need to worry about my little sister as much, but it’s no guarantee she won’t just get fed up with him and leave him too. I mean, he also lies too about some of his statements or exaggerated just to make something mom does worse or make himself more believable, which usually means I have to lie to people too just to cover his ass and I absolutely hate it. 

I’m also planning to go to community college for 2 years and go to a university after. I’ll likely have to stay at home for the next year at least since mom had taken all of my savings, and dad Still owes me about 700 dollars he’s borrowed off me that I had saved. But he’s also pushing for me to let him pay for my college. Which I think he’s just wanting to do so it makes him look like a great father because he brags about it to people like many other things he does for us because he “loves” us so much. 

But it wouldn’t feel morally right to me to just use him if I hate him this much, but if I’m going to be living here for another year at least I’ll probably have to accept since I don’t have any savings and still am not allowed to work since I can’t drive myself anywhere and can’t rely on dad or anyone else. So I can’t save any money for myself for the future at all anyways. But at least I’d be able to keep an eye on my little sister and help her if I’m home for longer. I have a car my great aunt gave me, but dad won’t let me drive it until it gets checked out, But keeps making excuses to not get it checked out, and even then He said I’m not allowed to drive anywhere by myself, like to school or a friends, for awhile until he rides around with me enough. But if I finally get to that point I really want to start working and saving up again as soon as I can do I can get out, but I’m just getting really sick of the situation and seriously don’t like to keep lying to cover dad’s ass just so we don’t end up with mom and having to hold in all the stress and try to at least maintain a barely functional social life and my education without completely falling apart. Even though it’s still not even the end of the quarter Im struggling to not just up and give up on school and trying to maintain my current straight A’s, but I know my little sister is really struggling with all this and has some problems with school that usually escalated to dad having a rage fit about how he thinks she can’t even do the simplest things and argues with her, to which she usually just comes to me for help if I can. I’m just really mentally and physically tired, stressed, and worn out from all this chaos and I just want it all to end already, and no, I do get suicidal thoughts a lot, but I swear I’m not going to go that far. 

So is there anything I can do? What could be the safest action I can take for both me and my little sister if any? Or should I really just keep sucking it up and try to make the best out of it like I’ve been trying to for the past almost 2 years already?",07Oct2020,1

948,"Hello reddit I could really use some advice right now. Ive been racking my brain about my recent car purchase and I would like to know your opinions on if I should keep it or not. This is an absolute hot rod of a car and its my dream car. Ok here it goes. Im a 22 year old male if that matters. I put $12,500 down payment on it and bought it new and drove it straight off the lot. After warranties I still owe $25,433 on the car. I know that if I chose to sell it, id take a 6-8k loss (including sales tax and all). So here come the details.

Monthly income (after tax) - $4500

All regular monthly Expenses excluding car payment- $2,268

Car payment - $445/6yrs

I currently have about $60k in student debt, which if I keep the car I can then give about $1700 a month with no wiggle room. To be on the safe side I can reasonably give $1500 a month. This would make it to where i pay off my loans in about 3.5 years. One option is to move to a cheaper place and effectively eliminate my car payment. Or I could sell back the car and pay $2000 a month in student loans and be done with it in 2.5 years. Any advice would be appreciated. plz help i really am stressin out about this because on one hand i love this awesome new car and on the other hand I know its not the most frugal choice i can make. I have another car by the way so i wouldnt have to get a new one. Thanks in advance",07Oct2020,1

950,"backstory here: this girl, we’ll call her A, is 29, and i’m 21.. we work together with children who have autism and in the time that i’ve known her, it’s been very strange 

her family owns this small business so she knows she will never get fired.. she has the same position title as me but she can get away with a lot more than anyone at the company.. there was a period of time where she was abusive to this guy at the company, J, and they had a kid together.. she would physically hurt him and manipulate him

my best friend E, who works at the company as well, was talking to J after him and A broke up.. long story short, A told everyone he cheated on her during the relationship with E and got everyone in the company to hate E, and tried to get her fired.. didn’t work out but she has threatened E many times legally if she talks to her, and just has been extremely mean to her 

A is looking for a best friend at the company.. she had 2 best friends before at this company but both fell apart.. we have hung out 3 times before because she has dyed my hair once, and she asked me to give her weed many many times but eventually i stopped because i’m not a dealer 

now, A keeps on asking me to hang out.. i tell her i’m busy all the time, but last week she got me and i had to say yes to hanging out this friday.. not only is she extremely scary when you’re on her bad side, but it’s just straight up mean to reject someone, and somehow she’s not getting the hint that i don’t want to hang out with her 

every chance she gets, she tries to be around me.. she puts her lunch next to mine all the time during breaks, etc etc.. i feel bad for her, she just wants a friend, but not only do i not like how she’s treated people, but she’s just not the type of person i’d hang out with again 

what i need advice for is this: should i hang out with her despite how mean she is to people, and despite the fact that once i hang out with her she’s just going to keep asking me to hang, or should i cancel and hope she understands after a while? i don’t want to be mean, and i know she’ll make drama if i told her the truth",07Oct2020,1

I have an employee that is really upset about this move - currently they walk 20 min to work but the move will mean a 20 min drive. Everyone else is fine with it because their commutes will be about the same and it means more space and less hectic work environment. 
The role that they do doesn’t exist in the section on the company that’s staying put. I have said to them if they are that unhappy about the move they can have their old job back, but they view this as a back step even though the role had the same pay it has a different title. I also don’t want to elevate this persons position to stay put as I don’t believe they deserve it or would be good at it.

955,"To start off, I had a shitty childhood. My dad was a drunk, and an abusive father. I won’t get into it much but it ended with him killing himself in front of me. I was messed up after, my mind was torn apart, I went crazy, I saw things, heard things. I went to every kind of therapy you can imagine, took the hardest drugs you can get your hands on, worked myself the fucking core to get where I’m at today, but my mom doesn’t see it. It started back around 3-4 years ago at the end of 10th grade. I was doing great, had a large group of friends, went out almost every day, had great grades, a girlfriend, I was involved in so many things. Then summer hit, my friends faded and my mind crept up on me. I got depressed, very depressed. I got night terrors and my seizures started to act up again. My mind kept going downhill until I ended up trying to end my life, I somehow lived, and was taken to the hospital where I spent 3 weeks, making sure I wasn’t going to hurt myself. Looking back at it, I think this is where my mom broke too. I got back, first few nights were okay, but then the fights started. Your wrong, no your wrong. This is your fault, no it’s yours. Yelling turned to screaming, my mom would throw things and break glass, going as so far to destroy my Xbox (she replaced it). Everything that I started to do was wrong, I had the wrong friends, I was taking the wrong classes, my grades weren’t good enough, I didn’t do enough to help my mom, I was responsible for her happiness. The list goes on and on. But what started as fights turned into manipulation, she started to lie to me, she took me to therapists telling them I was crazy, she told me that we didn’t have enough money to send me to my dream college that I got accepted too, but later would spend 3 times the amount of money to send me away to mental health program. My seizures came back, and were back with a vengeance. I started having them daily, at one point she recorded me having one and then showed me the video and told me I was lying. She would yell at me to stop moving, to shut up, I couldn’t control myself, but she saw it as manipulative. As I’ve grown older I can see of how much she blames me for her happiness, for her well being. She controls so many things in my life that so many people take for granted, and keep in mind I’m almost 19. She controls when I go to sleep and wake up, she controls what I eat, she controls what I can and can’t do with my free time, and she controls where I live. Bringing it to today, I’m completely stuck. She spent the rest of my college fund to send me away yet again, telling me that she can’t handle me anymore. If I leave this program she told me I’m homeless, she said she won’t care about me anymore. I’ve put so much work into bettering myself, but it’s never enough for her. I’m trapped, I can’t drive because of my seizures, and I can’t go anywhere else because she spent all the money we saved up. She fights with me over the phone everyday, yelling at me, telling me I’m ungrateful, threatening to take away the place I’m at and send me on the streets, telling me that she will tell the cops I’m crazy and that I need to go to an asylum. I don’t know what to do, I’m so scared, so broken, and so done. Every ounce of work I’ve done for myself is crumbling away because I am trapped in a web. If anybody has had a similar experience or know of any way I could get myself out of this control, I would love to hear it.

Job specification and CV review plus a CV editing to Professional standard. This I would also use as a tool to find out whether I honestly thought whether or not I could help.

A series of 30-45 minute Skype sessions specifically focusing on building confidence and running through how to tackle competency based interview questions, as well as various other tips and tricks.

Finally, ongoing support via Skype or telephone leading up to the interview for any last minute reminders/questions.

I of course welcome any further suggestions to what my services could include, but I’m merely brainstorming at this moment in time. 

Cost wise I am thinking between £30-£50 for the entire course but I have no prior business knowledge and could use any advice. 

This entire programme I would aim my market at those perhaps working in Retail or Hospitality and perhaps wish to make the transition to an admin or sales role. I also think people with less confidence/interview experience, or maybe social anxiety could benefit from something like this. 

I appreciate any constructive critiques/advice you all can offer. I’m a 23m living in the UK if it makes any difference.

Thanks in advance!",07Oct2020,1
958,"I'm a current community college student. Recently, I'm starting to doubt choosing my major. I'm currently an art major. I choose this major because I wanted to try it  out. I'm a decent artist. I'm not picasso, but I'm not terrible either. I wanted to take classes this semester that would help me improve my art skills. However, the classes I'm taking don't even teach about anything K want to learn. It's more of ""do this assignment and turn it in by Sunday"". One of my classes, my teacher focuses more of learning about cameras amd and photography rather than digital art, which is what I wanted to learn how to do(Is this want we actuallylearn first before learning about digital art? Can someone let me know). I have no money to afford a drawing tablet to teach myself. Meanwhile, I'm also very intrested in music. I originally wanted to be a music major, but nobody approved of that either. I was thinking of switching makors to see if I'll be happier as a music major. Also, people always say or joke about art majors not finding a real job or not being paid. I keep hearing that art majors are useless and that makes me regret my decision even more. I can change it, bit I don't know if I'll regret that also.",07Oct2020,1

It’s weird, its like there is something constricting me and I can almost feel air in the back of my throat every time I breathe. There are a few things that changed in my life, but I don’t think they could have caused it. I recently went back on some adhd meds, so I’m have very little appetite and maybe this is a symptom of eating very little. I have also been really anxious lately and maybe this is a physical symptom of anxiety, but I’ve never experienced this before. I don’t have any breathing problems, I’m mostly healthy and I’m only 15, so I don’t think Its some major health issue. Should I be worried?",07Oct2020,1

I get a full 8 hours of sleep and I can’t quit my job because it is counting as internship credits.
I feel so stuck and hopeless and I’m so afraid that the baby coming won’t fix this and that I will continue to be broken and that I won’t be able to be the mother she deserves.

962,"Sorry in advance, on mobile. Like the title says my roommate and I took in a cat that walked in to our house from the street. He seemed dirty and very hungry. Assuming he was a stray or someone left him behind when they moved we decided to take care of him. We kept an eye out for posters in the neighborhood and checked online regularly. We even posted on a couple sites about him.
He got comfortable quickly and became a part of the family very fast. We named him and got him food and toys. After three months we assumed he was our cat and relaxed on trying to find his owner till one day his owner came rollerblading by and saw him on our lawn while my roommate was out smoking. She said he was her cat and asked if we had been feeding him. My roommate said yes and tried to explain to her that we had been taking care of him. She thanked him and scooped him up and rollerbladed home (we learned later she only lives a couple blocks away). Four days later he showed back up and refused to leave. Scratching  and meowing at the door all morning and refused to leave till we let him in. We didn’t feed him for a couple days but he wouldn’t leave us alone. We finally caved and gave him a little food and water because we were worried about him. His owner hadn’t left a number or an address so we didn’t know what to do. After a couple weeks of this she showed back up and left us a note asking if he had been around because she hadn’t seen him in almost a week. We called and she picked him up that night.
Since then he won’t stop coming over and demanding food. We keep texting his owner to come get him but it’s not helping. We live in Portland and once the smoke started we let him inside because we were worried he would get a lung infection from meowing at our door all day.  It breaks our heart to shun him from our house after he was with us for so long and his owner isn’t trying very hard to get him back. We have no idea what to do. We love him and want him around but also sympathize with his owner. How do we get him to go back home?",07Oct2020,1

I'm at a loss as to what to do.

What makes it even harder is the fact that I live in a little country town in Australia. I don’t have auditions on every doorstep like American actresses do. To be honest, I don’t think that young actors, like Milly Bobby Brown for example, would even be in their professions if they lived in Australia.

Just sucks because I’d like to teach more guitar because it’s what I’m passionate about. Also we have the workers at my other job to cover the days I would be gone. There are other employees who come in even less days and have had no problem. Like I said, I’m willing to work 5 of those other days a week.

984,"So my fiancé and I are about to receive money from our insurance company regarding a fire we had in our apartment. My fiancé has already gotten 2 grand for a place to stay, but we are staying with family instead. The insurance policy is under his name so he is going to be getting the checks for the claim. 
So idk if I’m over thinking this or not but my fiancé has been a huge stickler about the money. He has sent me about 200 bucks of it and has bought me a carton of cigarettes, and he has agreed to send me 100 more because I need a nebulizer for my asthma (lost the cord to my old one) and I wanted to take our daughter to a trampoline park tomorrow. 
My fiancé is currently a teacher and I am a part time waitress. I just got this job after not having a job for two months due to covid and I am only part time so I can be here for our daughter. 
We had talked about the 2 grand he was being sent before and I told him I think it should be split between us so I can replace things I lost in the fire and things our daughter has lost. He agreed to this, but now isn’t doing it.
Our daughter has lost everything because she is a one year old and everything of hers has soot and smoke damage. 
I want to be able to replace things for her and my things that were damaged. I’m mostly concerned about replacing her things than mine though. 
My fiance says the 300 he has sent me is enough because he had to help me pay my bills when I didn’t have a job, so he is “paying himself back.”
The thing is though he didn’t even help with my actual car note. His mom helped us pay for that so if he really wanted to pay back then he should be giving her money. 
I don’t have enough money to replace things for my daughter and pay my car note, gas, car insurance, internet bill, my part of the rent, ect. I can probably barely get by with paying my bills, but not the things we lost. 
I honestly feel like my fiance should at least split the claim check with me when we get it, but I don’t think he wants to. Am I wrong for wanting something to help replace belongings for our daughter and I?? 
My fiancé already makes so much more money than I do. He should be willing to give me some of the insurance money at least.",07Oct2020,1

990,"This might sound like a weird question, but how much fighting is normal in a relationship?

I ask this because I’ve been in a relationship for almost three years. I was proposed to about six months into our relationship, I accepted. 

Now a year into our relationship we moved in together, and we took care of my grandmother. For a whole year. That was the second year of our relationship. 

Now we’re in our third year, and while I love him very much, we bicker all the time.

Like just a word or a small comment can turn into world war 3 where I’m threatening to leave because I can’t deal with it anymore.

And I really, really can’t... I don’t want to be in a relationship where we bicker constantly.

I have had relationships in the past and year we’d argue once in a while, but I’ve never been in a relationship where arguing is a normal thing.

I’m actually really scared of planning our wedding because, sometimes I think about the way we argue and it just screams divorce to me.

We are not violent toward each other and we don’t physically engage in anything, but the arguments are so stupid.

Like the most minute things can evolve into the worst of the worst and I just I’m tired of it. I’ve tried biting my tongue and just letting shit go, but I realized that by me biting my tongue im just accepting behaviors that aren’t good and I can’t do that.

So I tell him what I think and it leads to even worse all out war.

We could be walking down the street holding hands and I tug him in a certain direction and he’ll ask me angrily “what are you doing!?” And pull away and I’ll be like “wdym there is a person right there?” And then it’ll start the biggest argument where I can’t even or don’t even want to be near him.

We just had an argument because he’s huffing and puffing about making tuna for dinner when all I asked of him is to cut up some onions and put lemon on it. And then put Mayo in the tuna. Both separate tasks. I explained it three times and when my grandma called and I had to go upstairs to finish work he starts getting aggravated so I explained it to him again and he’s like why are you talking to me like that, we have been together THREE years and he still doesn’t know like that simple of a recipe? So I said that and he started yelling at me and cursing so I just went up stairs and was like “Do you REALLY want to fight tonight?”


I just don’t get it. I understand that I’m a difficult person to deal with you know I have some chronic illnesses going on and I also have adhd and anxiety. I’m a messy person I’m pretty disorganized, but I never go out of my way to be like a negative person.

I loved sex, and I love having sex with him, it just never happens. Ever. Our relationship consists of having sex MAYBE once every two weeks. But I’ve accepted that because I love him and I understand that not everyone has the greatest sex drive.

I get it I do. And I’ve tried I’ve tried accepting. But I just don’t understand why why the fighting?

I spoke to my fiancé’s best friend from college who told me that my fiancé and his ex used to curse at each other and fight all the damn time. To the point where they just stopped talking to each other and just broke up.

I asked him like why was it like that? And he said well it could be anything. And so I said to him I just don’t understand I just don’t. I can’t let that become my life forever.

What should I do? We did like couples therapy for eight months but it was with a guy I didn’t like. 

Should we do that again but with a different counselor?

I love him I do, but I can’t live my life always fighting always feeling angry at the person I love. I just can’t.",07Oct2020,1

And his parents arrived at the scene and they said they would pay for the damage. I even asked his mum about it twice and she said they would defiantly pay. It turns out the repairs will cost about £2k minimum. Insurance are offering me £500 for the car and are calling it a write off. but it is worth about £2000. And now he’s saying they won’t pay anything towards the cost of the repairs. Ideally I’d like to keep the car due to its low mileage. Should I call his parents and demand them to pay?

I don't want to go into detail about what I did for him prior to us getting into the apartment but I did a lot for him and he is completely ungrateful. I risked my own safety driving him to different places to live before we got the apartment during the start of the pandemic There have been several problems with this living arrangement. we moved into the apartment in early June. he had a job and and was everything was fine. the problems started when he sexually harassed my girlfriends cousin. he's been late on rent 3 times now and has also verbally threatened me.. He is not on the lease, has smoked in his room and complains about things like dishes being in the sink and the living room coffee table having my girlfriends art supplies on it. he has been extremely rude when it comes to my girlfriend and even invited a specific person into the house who we did not want any contact with. he said he is going to move out soon but I'm want him gone as soon as possible, as of this moment my girlfriend and I have left a hand written eviction notice by the door to his room. the next time he threatens to ""beat my ass"" I will introduce him to the cold, damp pavement outside. I need advice. if there is anything i can do to get him out sooner like the smoking in the room thing is against the lease and I know he has weed on him so if there is absolutely anything I can do I would rather do it lawfully rather than physically removing him. he is 5'4 and I am about 6 '.

With this swing in emotions she has become quite unpleasant and hostile towards me. I find myself trying to comfort her but constantly being made feel shitty or her gaslighting me making me feel like I'm somehow responsible for her sadness.

1001,"This is long, so I'm sorry in advance! I have a fellow widow friend that has told me there's not really a ""too soon"" with things like this, but I don't know. I don't really feel like I'm in it to have someone distract me or to just fill in for him. Nothing really fixes it or brings my partner back, and I'm going to be sad when I start dating regardless of how long it has been. 

I've already fallen into a kind of ""situationship"" with a fellow who tbh was horrible, and I cut him off before anything got serious once he started showing some abusive tendencies. It did show me I am capable of partnership without expecting them to just step in for my husband, and also that I *would* really like another person in my life again that isn't a toxic asshat. I go to therapy, I have friends, and I'm finally starting to feel more comfortable getting back into my hobbies. I do miss my late husband like crazy and I do still cry for him, but I don't really think that will ever change.

I'm just worried about hurting my in-laws even though they haven't treated me particularly well, even when he was alive. His friends are wonderful and I know they want me to be happy, and my friends are obviously 100% behind whatever I want as long as it's not hurting me. I know I shouldn't be living my life carefully maneuvering around the wants of others while ignoring my own, but maybe this is wrong? 

I don't really expect to find anyone fast that wouldn't think this was a lot of baggage, but I know that anything could happen. My friend met her chapter 2 person within the first 6 months after loss. I'm not sure what to do or if my feelings are even valid. I am so worried about protecting his mother and sister, but I also wouldn't want the new person to feel like I'm hiding them. Is this even worth doing? 

I will always love my husband, and I know he would want more than anything for me to be happy. I'm still in my 20s and I've always wanted a family, I know there's no way he would want me to just never love again. He'd also probably tell me ""it's always going to be too soon for my mom so fuck it"" 😂

(This is a bit Long so if you don’t want to read... I have past experience with saying the wrong thing and getting negative consequences in return. Scared to have that again).

I’m paranoid that my former groomer who I cut all ties with back in April is still stalking my social media accounts. I changed the URL to one of my accounts and deleted my main social media.  I do believe he still has pictures of me and can trace all info back to the account I changed my URL on. 

I really don’t want to tell any adult this because I feel like it’s my fault for replying to my groomer in the first place. It’s only been very recently where I now understand just how fucked up my relationship was with him and my anxiety keeps on reminding me of the promise he made. “I’m going to check up on your ___.” (social media platform) 

I told my doctor my anxiety comes from being backstabbed and he asked if this comes from any particular situation. I stupidly replied with a yes and he wanted to discuss this event with me the next time I meet him. Should I tell him everything? I don’t want anything to happen, I just simply wanna talk things out and try to rationalize everything to make my anxiety go away. 

Because my relationship formed with my abuser so recently, I don’t want to alarm my doctor and make him think he has to take any action. I’m 17 and I already have enough stuff on my plate, I don’t wanna add any more issues to an issue that is already haunting me day and night.",07Oct2020,1
1004,"So here's the dealio:

I work in a bar as a server and cook. I'm the only employee. My boss is half a dick. Like he's really good to me. He gives me infinite freedom in menu design, spending, hours, things like that. Any problem with appliances or items he solves immediately. It would be any cook's dream. Similarly, the patrons are great, are super lovely, tip well and are just decent people all around and great to serve and hang out with. 

However,

He's a total douche. He frequently talks politics with patrons and actively argues with them in the bar with everyone around. He spends half the time drinking and eating his product and gets drunk more nights than not. As  a republican he goes against a lot of my personal views (which is mostly fine) but refuses to abide by many covid restrictions and has yelled at our public health officer. He often makes me incredibly uncomfortable with his rants, the language he uses and how he treats the bar as a whole. He's not incredibly passionate about it (he's under 30y.o.) and sees it just as a means to make money and doesn't care much about professionalism. 

Being in this environment with him makes me feel like shit.  Alongside this, I'm diagnosed with bipolar 2, meaning I get the big sad and it keeps for a while and I've been in it just before I waseven working here and it ain't getting better. 

My issue is that I have no other job lined up, in fact I've been looking for about half a year and can't seem to nab anything in my field (Working with kids). A couple of close interviews, but a large majority is just radio silence. I live at home currently so there's no real bills to pay, but I'm not one to sit around if I don't need to. Plus, I rather not take money from the government when I'm still fine to work myself. 

Any insight is appreciated!

1009," First off, I'd like to say that any and all help is appreciated. This situation is stressing me out and I desperately need advice from someone/anyone.

   
  So here's a bit of a backstory to all this (I'll try and keep it brief). My friend, a minor, started making jokes a few months ago about how she wanted to sell pictures of her feet in order to make some extra money for herself. I brushed off these jokes the first few times she made them but she kept mentioning it more and more frequently. This caused me to feel concerned for her because I started to see through these “jokes” and realized she was serious about selling these kinds of photos.   


 Now before you say anything, yes I know that feet pictures are quite tame from other forms of pornography. However, if a minor sells it to you. you are now in possession of illegal material. Whether the image is blatantly sexual or not, it's still illegal to own. I'm still very concerned that my friend is willing to sell these kinds of images while still underage. This could very well land someone in a lot of legal trouble if they weren't aware that she was under 18. As a victim of online grooming and sexual abuse, it scares me to think that someone out there could take advantage of my best friend. And what hurts more is that my friend is willingly putting herself in this dangerous situation. I've cried a fair bit over this. 

 I've wanted to come forward with my concerns to her parents but this feels like a very complicated situation to talk about and with lack of proof I feel like they would brush me off. So, I decided that I needed some evidence. I made a fake snapchat account and added my friend under the guise that I wanted to purchase a few feet pictures. I offered her $5 dollar for each photo. To my dismay. she responded and immediately took up the offer. She asked what kinds of photos I'd like to see from her, so I made 4 different requests. She said she would get right on it and have the photos taken either that day or the next day. She responded a few hours later with the 4 photos I requested. I came up with an excuse that I needed to make a deposit the next day since I currently didn't have any money to venmo her. This was a big lie on my behalf as I'm also a minor and I don't even have a bank account. I never had any intention of paying her.   
  

 Unbeknownst to her, I had been secretly taking screenshots of our conversations and I have the 4 images she sent me saved to my phone. I also have screen recordings of me scrolling through our conversation and clicking on her snapchat account to prove that everything is legitimate. I plan on approaching her parents with all this evidence but I don't know how I should go about it. I've thought about anonymously contacting her parents via Facebook but I'm not sure this is this best option. A big part of me wants to stay anonymous with this situation because I don't want to sabotage my friendship. She's like an older sister to me and it would really hurt to lose her.     
  

Am I in the wrong in all this? Should I just let her continue with this behavior? What is this best way to bring this up with her parents? 

Please help me. I'm desperately searching for answers at this point.",07Oct2020,1
1010,"F 22, 46kg(ish) 5ft 4

MRI, blood, urine, nerves, ears, eyes, heart, lungs and all the other organs were all checked and are perfectly normal. Basically whatever is causing this is in my brain.

I also suffer from retinal (not ocular), hemipelagic, and 'classical' food triggered migranes. I do not drink, smoke, nor take recreational drugs. I am on some low-dose painkillers that are not entirely effective - I still feel a background hangover type headache and stabbing pain in my head/body. The painkillers are not the cause of this.

For a few months now my brain has been giving me the sensation of being picked up and dropped like I am on a gentle rollercoaster - not vertigo, I am not dizzy, just always feel lurched about. All the time. This has made it very tiring to do anything at all really and to walk I need to use a cane. My thoughts have also become more foggy - my memory has worsened, I am scatty and less quick with responses, muddling words (I have infrequent aphasia due to migraines and this is NOT the same issue. I used to debate in international competitions to give an estimation of the level that I should be at) and struggling to process basic information such as how to make a cup of tea (although it does come back after a short while). I am also pretty shaky and often dropping things. I have recently also had a seizure (was fine afterwards).

So far the doctors do not know what is wrong with me and while I am on the waiting list to be seen by (more) neurologists I am concerned about how long this will take. I think I am worsening and I have no leads on what is wrong.",07Oct2020,1

Now I'm finally in a position in my life where I can achieve this. 

My question is, HOW?? I've done a little bit of research, and it seems like a lot of the guides and resources out there are structured in a way to address immanent or acute mental distress (understandably so). I'm not really looking for that. Not to say that I am flawless or without fault, I would be the first to admit that there are plenty of things I would like to address about myself. It's just that I do not feel like I am at the end of my rope or out of options and am therefore seeking therapy. I'm just an average joe who would like to improve his life through professionally guided conversation and perspective.

1017,"So over the past year or so I have made a bunch of friends in a server centered around nothing in particular. The list of at least 10 friends includes people ranging from 13 to people in their early to mid 20s, though most are just in high school and college. 

Now I have quite a bit of trust in these people, not the same as my irl friends, but enough to talk to them and share my inner feelings and emotions with them, as well as my ethnicity. I have only shared my face with a very close few of them and never given out anything regarding my name, city, or any other personal information that (correct me if I'm wrong) can be traced back to me, other than my voice and general location (e.g. Southeast Quebec just as an example). Now I have not revealed any of this to my parents, as they would likely separate me from my friends of almost a year at this point. I am hesitant to tell to them about this naturally. I understand their concerns about pedophiles and stalkers on the internet. However, none of their interactions have indicated any illicit behavior or anything predatory. They have shared stories about their losses, accomplishments, frustrations, and mental health issues. They have also shared their voices, faces, and whatnot throughout these months (admittedly, I can't really explain how that helps my case but that might be cause I'm bad at explaining these things). My questions are 1. Whether I should be worried about pedophilia in a server with approximately 20 people all of whom are relatively active and who I've known for a long time and trust (although my judgement could very much be wrong), and 2. If I have enough, let's say, proof to show that I can trust these people, how would I go about approaching and explaining to my parents that these people can be trusted, judging by how my parents always tell me to talk to my irl friends despite me having spent far more hours on this server than with them, as guilty as that may make me feel, and their valid, if imo false worries about pedophilia?

Huge apologies if my wording has been vague here. I don't want this post to be traceable for the sake of my friends and myself. And I'm also sorry that I left the questions to the very end of the message, I just felt like enough backstory was needed to clarify any questions ahead of time.
