0,"So- a little weird but im concerned over the drastic breast size change in my left breast. And yes, i know that a breast can be slightly smaller then then other and it’s perfectly normal. Most of the time you don’t really notice. But mine is very noticeable. Like its a whole different cup size noticeable. 
To give some back story, i got covid in January and i was very very sick for half the month. I nearly went blind and i had a long trip to the hospital. (Doctors didn’t know what it was at the time considering covid had just started) but now they’ve confirmed that it was in fact covid.
Everything is better now! But after i got sick is when it happened. I didnt think much of it at first, thinking that oh it might go back to normal. It hasn’t. So idk what to do? Should i consult my doctor on this or just keep quiet about it",16Nov2020,1

3,"I’ve been seeing this girl for about 1 and a half weeks now, we’re basically dating (kisses and cuddles) but we haven’t given each other the bf and gf title yet. 

Basically what’s going on is that I ’m making it painfully obvious that I want to spend time, that I appreciate her, and I want to hear her talk, all the good stuff. She’s been great in the sense that she doesn’t ignore my texts, she calls me cute, appreciates me, listens to all the dumb things I say. Again, all the good stuff. But the problem is that she doesn’t hang out as often as id like. 

We’ve hung out literally once where it was just us. I’ve asked her “hey Wana go study?” “Wana paint with me?” “Wana hang out with my friends and I” “Wana come over and watch tv with me”. Each time was either a solid reason why she couldn’t hang out or, a solid reason why she had to cancel the plans. Like, her reasoning made sense. For example “sorry my friends and I already made plans, I’m not feeling up for it anymore because of (pretty traumatic experience) happened, “I really have to study for this”. 

I don’t suspect that she disinterested in me and leading me on but I can’t help but wonder if this is going to be a common occurrence and that I should back out before I get my feelings hurt. I also wonder if I am becoming a little possessive? I feel bad for constantly getting shut down on hanging out and I feel bad to keep on trying to and on top of that, I feel like if I keep on asking, I’m going to seem possessive. I get that she has a life outside of me but it just doesn’t feel like I have a connection with her in the first place. Idk, how often do you guys hang out with your bf/gf/SO? 

I think no matter what, I’m going to give it some time to think about and hopefully give her time to figure things out like resolving her own issues and finding a balance of how often she hangs out with her friends vs me. But all in all I just want to hear your guy’s take on this. 

——————————————————————


Edit: I should probably go into the “traumatic experience part”. Without showing to much info, basically, mom calls, fights with daughter (let’s just cal her gf). Gf texts me telling me what happened in like 2 sentences. I call her to check in on her. Doesn’t pick up, I text her that I’m here for you etc etc. could I come over and console you with a candy bar or something. She says that she doesn’t want to talk rn and I say that’s alright, just call me when you want to. She calls me an hour later telling me everything that happened through call and we talk it out and then after like 20-30 mins she says that she’s going to bed and going to leave me alone so I could enjoy the rest of the night at one of my friends birthday. We where supposed to hang out today but she wasn’t up for it because of what happened and that she was just going to study with her friends.",16Nov2020,2
4,"I have a friend that has been going on for a few weeks about how depressed they are. I have reached out multiple times, giving words of encouragement, asking if I could do anything to help ease stress, etc. I haven’t pushed them to talk about it with me cause I understand that not everyone wants to talk.

But during pretty normal conversations, they will joke about killing themselves or being depressed. Not just once, plenty enough that it is disturbing and worrisome. I have tried my best to cheer them up cause it has become very apparent how much of a bad mood they are in. Sometimes it seems it works but then we get back to where we were before.

I am worried because they seem to be asking for help without asking for it. They have now told me multiple times, “there is nothing you can do”. I have accepted it on multiple occasions but then they get upset and say, “see? No one cares, I always push people away.” 

I’m just not sure how I can handle this situation without being too pushy on my friend",16Nov2020,1

I just want a life where I have a good social circle and it’s frustrating watching everybody else effortlessly make friends and hang out with people.  For me, it seems impossible to get to a point where I have some close friends who hang out all the time.

11,"I’m going to try to keep this as short as possible. I have a friend that I met in 2015 and we were practically inseparable for quite a while around that time. We have considered ourselves best friends since, but I haven’t seen him nearly as much over the past few years because I had to move away for school. Our political beliefs have evolved and changed a lot over this time, and I am not at all a person that believes a difference in opinion means we can’t be friends. But, with that said, I don’t want to argue over the differences and I don’t want them to be shoved down my throat constantly. Also, I forgot to mention, I also introduced him to blended group of some of my other best friends and we have all become pretty close through that. His political beliefs don’t line up with mine or any of the other friends in that group, and it often leads to disputes and even charged arguments on occasion. From his perspective, I can see why it might be frustrating. Since the rest of us all share the same beliefs for the most part, politics do occasionally come up and we will discuss them. He never agrees with us (which is fine, I respect his right to his opinions) but he will try to talk over us all and educate us? That’s the best way that I know to describe it. He will deny a fact and if you insist it is correct and you can prove it, he will say “idk about that, I’ll have to look more into it”. That’s fair enough, I don’t ever feel someone has to take my word for it and I think it is good to do your own research. But he will just deny a valid source if it doesn’t line up with his belief. He will also spend a week after an argument sending a ton of random links to prove how he was right and we were all wrong, even though 99.9% of the time, they aren’t from a valid or credible source. It’s annoying and frustrating, so it has gotten to the point that when he begins to interject while we are all talking, we all say that we should just drop it and move on. He has gotten mad at us and says that we are all writing him off. In some ways, I can see his point. We do shut down the talk when he starts to interject, but it is only because he gets so angry and condescending about his incorrect facts that he throws around. It is like he thinks we are all uneducated and stupid, but he always sounds like he is looped into some major conspiracy. Also, all of his social media posts now consist of political memes, rants, and copied tik toks bashing people that have the same beliefs as myself and my other friends. It doesn’t hurt my feelings or anything but it’s just like, if you feel that way about people like us, is there a reason for us to still be friends? It’s his social media, he can say what he wants to, but if I unfollow him it will hurt his feelings and maybe even piss him off. At the same time, I never post stuff like that and neither do any of my other friends. It’s like that is all he consumes himself with nowadays, and it’s all so negative and extreme. So many of his posts are also targeting and bashing oppressed groups of people saying that they aren’t actually oppressed at all. It’s like he wants so badly to be considered the victim. He doesn’t have a lot of other friends outside of our group, and I don’t want to leave him with no one because I really do love and care for him. But I just don’t know what caused him to become so extreme and seemingly hateful. We also clearly don’t share many similarities anymore, and I get disgusted and annoyed over his posts constantly showing up on my timeline bc most of them are purely opinion based with no facts to back them up. I don’t bother to bring that up though because that would be like welcoming an argument with him. I feel like he is going to bring up how distant we have been soon and I don’t know how to address these things without it causing some horrible blow-up, and I don’t know how to do it delicately because I don’t want to hurt him. It is probably hard to believe after some of the ways I have described him, but outside of the politics, he is one of the best friends I’ve ever had. He is caring and considerate, and he will do anything to be there for you. He is a great friend that you can always count on. It makes it super confusing and I don’t see how he can be such a good person to me and my other friends (outside of politics) and then have such hateful beliefs and feelings  towards other people. I realize this is super long and I’m sorry for that, but has anyone dealt with anything like this? How would you recommend I go about handing this situation?",16Nov2020,1

13,"Hey there, a bit of background first:
Last year I (23,M) broke up with my girlfriend of 6 years. Around that time my best friend also broke up with his girlfriend. He is a tall , good looking dude and after a little while he started hooking up with women and started enjoying his single life and I felt very envious because I wished I could do the same but I lack the looks and confidence to draw anyone’s attention. 
This really messed with my self esteem and many failed attempts to meet someone new made things even worse. I also noticed that I started being envious of other people , of things they have/do that I wish I had/did and I don’t know how to cope with it.
Envy is a very negative emotion and I don’t know how to stop it. Consciously thinking about how it’s okay to feel this way and accepting that one can’t have everything in life helps in the short term but I still feel inferior and sick to my stomach. I AM grateful for everything I have and I KNOW that I have traits other people may desire but I am stuck in a constant loop of negative thoughts and it makes me feel quite depressed. 

I don’t want to feel this way. Does anyone have some advice on how to accept and deal with these emotions?",16Nov2020,1
14,"My best friend are both 16 and males and both are straight. Or well i havnt came out yet, i dont even know if im gay or bi or what but all i know is ive had crushes on girls and boys before and am sexually attracted to both. I dont know if its a phase or if im jus bi. Ive had a crush on my best friend since 7th grade and we were cool wit each other but in 9th grade was when we actually became close. I really like him and think about him all the time and want to shoot my shot but like i said hes straight, or at least thats what he says he is. As normal teenage boys do we make gay jokes and stuff (not making fun of gays just saying things that are gay to eachother). But with him, things have gone above normal “sus” behavior.

 Ive seen all of his body and hes seen all of mine including naked. We have compared sizes and stuff like that. He also makes many more “sus” jokes with me than with any of my other friends. We have done things that normal straight guys dont do too. We have legit cuddled in bed many times, he lets me scratch his back and head all the time, hes let me lay on his lap multiple times. Whenever we hug he often grabs my butt (as a joke) but still almost everytime. And most of all one time when we were in the hot tub he grabbed my foot and rubbed his dick with it. I was in shock, it wasnt any kind of sexual assault or anything because i enjoyed it but it was very surprising. He didnt even laugh about it or anything so to this day i dont know if it was a joke or not. Ive brought it up to him since and he swears that it never happened and that if it did then he doesn’t remember.

He has a girlfriend which i have seen him get genuinely sad over whenever they would have a break up or something. He also leaves me on delivered and ignores me a lot while i always respond to his text as soon as i get it. So i genuinely dont know if he likes me or not. If he liked me like how i liked him i feel like he wouldnt ignore me the way he does some times.

He always says hes gay (as a joke) and often says hes gay for me (as a joke) but its so often and out of no where and almost always towards me only. He of course has made other gay jokes towards my other freinds in the group but he targets me wayy more often then anyone else. I dont know if he actually likes me and if i should make a move or stay pretending im straight and continue just being friends with him. Any advice?",16Nov2020,1

My husband has started a business and needed some money and promised we would be making a lot of money soon. He begged (we had been married 15 years best friends etc). I begrudgingly put him on the deed and took out a bunch of money out for his business. Have not seen any money two years later and all credit cards are maxed out. 
Now, my husband and I have major differences in parenting (15 year old girl she gets what ever she wants with him, I get undermined every step of the way). Needless to say, I am pushed out of the house and living away from them. I’m a nurse and my husband keeps pressuring me to quit because it’s so stressful (I’m a Covid nurse) and do what?

24,"So all my life I had crushes on girls, I jerked off to girls since I can remember. My favorite category on sites was lesbian. I had girlfriends and it was awesome. But last year something clicked in me. It was awful. The thought that I might be gay. It consumed me. I had panic attacks and anxiety. Possibly psychosis. Then I had anxiety because I didn't have anxiety. I was reading about HOCD. But as time progressed my affection for girls gradually stopped. I can't even watch straight porn anymore. My penis won't react. I started jerking off to gay porn recently. And the worst part is that now with 28 years of age I notice guys more. It created all kinds of problems for me. I was afraid what if I fall for my guy friends. I broke up with a beautiful girl. I am not living life anymore like I used to. Being around guys makes me nervous and being around girls makes me depressed. Earlier in my life I could joke around and act girly with my guy friends now I have problems when they touch me. I literally could demonstrate on truth and dare the 69 pose with my friend and not think of it much besides that it's funny.  Now standing behind a guy in close proximity makes me nervous and kinda horny. Nothing helps. I tried running away from it as much as I could since it started but it only gets worse the more I fight it. Damn I was the kind of guy who read books on how to get girls. Now I am gay. I don't know how it happened but it happened. It made me question my sanity, my past, my relationships, my everything, I am lost. I feel gay. I feel like I want to cry because I never wanted this. When it started I literally tried to hurt myself. I felt like if I am gay my whole life was a lie. All my relationships and crushes. And the more time passes I am more unsure about my past. It's like I am now a completely different person. Everything that filled me with joy and excitement doesn't anymore. I remember how I was earlier. But it's like I remember things from another person. I don't know what happened to me but I accepted it. I am gay. I don't want to deny it. But it makes me depressed as hell. Cause I lived 27 years of my life as one thing than in the span of a year I changed for 180°. I didn't talk to anyone about it except my parents. They were not acceptable but I could do as I please because I am a grown up. My father was really disappointed. It made me sad. I don't know what else to do cause being with a guy, I don't know how to do it. Nor have the inclination to do it.  I wish there was something tangible to do to make me the way I was. I wish there was an easy solution. I wanted to have a kids and wife. That was my dream. I had wet dreams about girls. What the hell happened to me?",16Nov2020,1
25,"So bare with me here.

I'm 32  years old; 33 next month. I currently live in Scotland. The country itself isn't bad but at the same time I'm rather unhapyp with it. The population is so divied and people just hate on each other all the time. But this isn't my main reason for wanting to run away to another country. All my life I've never really felt apart of anything. I don't have many friends, and the ones I do have I never actually see. They never leave their houses, so despite living 10 minutes walking from my house the feel like online friends. I have tried going to their house to see them but I stopped doing it after realizing I was the only one putting in effort. In terms of family, while I love my family, we never really speak often. That's partly down to myself. I feel my lack of social interactions in life has made me horrible at talking to people so it's always awkward when I see them, which is rare in itself. I've been single my whole life minus around 3 months  split over 3 relationships, so I never get into relationships and when I do they never last long at all. For all things considered, I'm essentially alone. I feel alone. I don't really have people to talk to. I sit home every day by myself and just stare at walls. That's not even an expression. That's genuinely what I do because I'm so bored. My self esteem is rock bottom because I can't make friends or get into a relationship.At the same time, if I moved away no doubt some family members may worry about me, and while I don't care what happens to me, I still don't want to be the cause of anyone elses pain. If I was away I probably wouldn't even contact them just because I'm not used to talking to them anyway. When ever we do talk its 20% talk 80% awkward silence.

So I feel I want to move to another country and leave my life behind. Maybe I can start a new life. Maybe it will feel just as bad no matter where I go. I don't know. All I know is that I'm super unhappy where I am and there's nothing that seems to make me feel better. I'm worried that I might end up more lonely than I am here.",16Nov2020,2
28,"Hey everyone,

I really want to be radical extremist Sunni Muslim theologian, philosopher, debater and scholar of Islam. And I was thinking of making Al-Azhar University, Ilm al-kalam, Islamc University of Madinah, Avicenna and Bu Ali Sina University, because I want to strive to fix the situation in Middle East so I can establish peace, love, justice and tranquility in Muslim World.

What bothers me is that I don't know how much I'm going to live and when I'm Angel of Death will take me away from this life, and I strongly doubt that I will live 100 years.

What troubles me is that I do not have time for me to do 7 Universities so I can promote Freedom of Religion, Freedom of Speech, Anti-terrorism, Anti-Violence and Anti-Antisemite, and Anti-Racism, and I want to be the first Sunni Muslim to promote such things with the strong desire and intention of bringing excellent good image to Islam. And I want to prove that Sunni Islam is against Anti-Semite and Racism through actions, and I want to show the excellency of Islam and to prove superiority over all religions by acting as a model Muslim.

And I would love for me to have time to do all those things while I'm still young so I can enjoy my success and so I can also be proud of my great results which I strove for it whole my life. 

So how can I live up to age of 400? 

And how can I increase my young age?

P.S. I dreamt also to have enough time for me to also enjoy the life while I live and to have enough time to prepare for the Day of Judgment, because the time I have is not enough for me to reach The Highest Garden of Paradise.

29,"So here's my dilemma, someone I'm kinda interested in has offered to start a fling with me. My biggest concern (aside from STDS and STIS) is getting COVID-19. When the person first suggested we take our friendship further, I was expecting it to be a monogamous relationship, but he is only looking for casual sexual relationships.

30,"Obligatory disclaimer that this is a throwaway account. 

I (19F) live with my roommate (20F) who we'll call G. G is a good roommate. We're not close friends and the only reason I'm rooming with her is my last roommate pulled out of the lease last minute and I found G through a couple friends. She's quiet, keeps to herself, cleans her space, and doesn't touch my stuff (which makes her amazing compared to my last roommate). Sometime about a week and a half ago, G mentioned that she was having a girl come over to hang out. I thought nothing of it but was glad she gave me a head's up because of COVID concerns. The girl comes over and says nothing to me, just goes with G to hang out in her room, which is where they spend all of their time. The girl has now stayed here for almost two weeks. Normally, I wouldn't bat an eye, but the girl is incredibly messy and incredibly loud. My biggest complaint is that I work the graveyard shift and getting eight hours of sleep can be hard when I get home. The girl is so loud that even with three walls between use, a fan going, and headphones, her talking and laughing has woken me up multiple times. Every time she uses our kitchen, she leaves it a mess, same with our bathroom. And honestly, the thing that worries me the most is that G is willing to let this girl stay home alone in our apartment when we're at work. I wouldn't mind it, except I know nothing about this girl -- I don't know her name, her age, what she does, who she is, anything at all. So I am wary to just have her be left alone in the apartment with all of my stuff. 

I want to ask my roommate if or when the girl is going to leave, or at least ask for more information about her, but I don't know how to ask. I talked to a couple friends about this and they don't know either, with one of them pointing out that the girl could be homeless or have an insecure home situation, so I don't want to come off as an asshole since I don't know this girl's home life.

32,"My friend just told me that a mutual friend of ours admitted to keeping sex tapes of his ex girlfriends. He’s 21 and his mom found out and wasn’t told off or made to delete them. One of the ex girlfriends reached out and asked my friend to grab his hard drive and delete the copies of the video because she had heard from her friends that this guy had been passing the video around to his friends. I don’t think this guy understands the weight and gravity of his actions especially since if the video does spread he’s not the one who’ll be dealing with the consequences but the girls in the videos. 

This guy never had a good male role model growing up, which might be the reason behind why he doesn’t understand how grave his actions are. I’m not sure what i can do to make him understand what he’s doing is wrong and make him stop spreading these videos.

37," 

so I'm trying to decide on a title for my stuff.   
the premise is that a god of order and a god of entropy make a bet to decide who has more influence over human nature. They find a human who has had no big influences in her life that have pushed her one way or the other. She also has two possible love interests. One who is decidedly orderly, and one who is completely chaotic.  
Also, one god cheats so one of her possible romances is fated to end badly, so the story is also a bit about taking emotional risks and the decision of doing a good thing that will end in hurt, or not take the leap.

Initially I was going to go with Glass Hearts, as a nod to the theme of the fragility of a person's emotions; but turns out that that name is taken by a not so great work in my same genre. So kind of worried about that.  
Other options are Path of Broken Stars, Gods shouldn't play with love, Our Tangled Threads of Fate, Our fate and the Stars, The Theory of Love, The Theory of Life, How We Live, Cheating at Life, Fate Weaver, Love and Pain.

He was out on the dance floor ignoring his wife and kids and their needs. We waited and waited for chairs for our kids and food that never came. When my sister and I kept asking for either a different table or new chairs he got angry and said “no wonder no one wants to talk to y’all.” 
I got upset I looked at my sister and she looked at me and shrugged her shoulders and kept on doing what she was doing. I said I am leaving I didn’t come here to get insulted by your husband she said nothing I got my son and left. I had to call my bf for a ride home. My son and I walked a little while though. My sister never called me to see if we were ok or to apologize. It wasn’t til I got home that she called me non stop when I answered she asked if I got home. This was an hour or so later. When I just said ya she began crying about how mean he was to her cause I of what I did. They left as soon as I did and he blamed her and I for ruining his night. She called me for 30 min to sob about what he did to her. 

I don’t know what to make of this. I am hurt I feel belittled and neither one of them cared about my well being. I would never let my bf insult my family and my sister didn’t defend me. Do I have a right to be upset? Am I overreacting ? I have been in a deep emotional state lately which has sent me to reach out to a therapist and psychiatrist I am not in a good place. My bf already insults me and tears me down as it is I don’t need this now from my brother-in-law and not have my sister defend me whatsoever. 

Can anyone share any thoughts on this? I am angry but do I have a right to be ? And to want to cut him off from my life? Please be kind. This has really hurt me.

Update: I am not asking questions about my kid or whether it was kid friendly or if I would have been better at home. I am asking about the mean comment that’s it. No other advice is needed",16Nov2020,1
42,"I feel sick to my stomach right now. Last night I went to a party with my friends, I knew everyone there and there was around 45 people at the party. The start of the night was fine, but then I drank a lot of spirits and I got blackout drunk. I woke up on the couch in the morning having no memory of how I got there - I wasn't sure if I had passed out on the couch or if people had carried me over there. Anyway, it's the next morning and people are telling me that I tried to make out with everyone and I had made one guy pretty uncomfortable. I apologized to him and told him that I had got blackout drunk and that I couldn't remember anything but I was still really sorry that I had made him feel that way. I got home and proceeded to pass out again. I wake up again and my friend who was at the party sat me down and said we needed to talk. She then told me that not only had I made that one guy uncomfortable but I had also made one of my other guy friends and one of my other friends (who is a girl) extremely uncomfortable as well. I feel so ashamed and I'm so mad at myself because I can't even remember making out with anyone. I explained to my friend that I was completely black out drunk and she said she understood but I really needed to work on my behavior. This is the first time I've been black out drunk and I seriously never want to drink again. I just texted a mutual friend who was there at the party so I can get all the names of the people who I've made uncomfortable so I can individually send them apologies explaining that I was black out drunk but that doesn't give me any excuses and that I'm so sorry. Any advise? Because I feel like shit, I feel so ashamed, and I wish I had never gone to that party. 

TLDR; I got blackout drunk, tried to make-out with multiple people making them all uncomfortable, and I can't remember a thing or to what extent I like make them uncomfortable. Please help.",16Nov2020,1
43,"I met him on reddit and was trying to be friendly, but now he is harassing me in my DMs. I don't want to block him because I feel bad for him, what should I do to tell him I don't want to be friends?",16Nov2020,1
44,"How and where can I met new people? How can I start talking to them?

That’s my situation:

I’m (18m) a very shy and introvert person. My almost non existing self confidence isn’t a help. Due to some family issues I started to isolate myself since a few years. Until last year I had almost none contact to anyone except for my family. Since last year I go back to school and I’ve managed it to talk to one person. The person is not my friend and talking to him can be a bit struggling. So how and where can I met new people? How can I start talking to them?",16Nov2020,1

52,"I (18F) am dealing with a lot at the moment. My (19M) boyfriend has just found out this week that his mum is dying. I've been at his house nearly every night for the past few weeks after she took not well.

 I work a Monday, Thursday, Friday. I've been finishing work on a Monday night, going straight to his house and staying until Wednesday night then go home to work for the Thursday and Friday and then on the Friday night I go back up and stay until Sunday night.


Also at his house lives his 9 year old, hormonal and upset niece. His mum is her legal guardian and so with her not being there, my boyfriend has to look after her. His sister (his nieces mum) and her boyfriend are staying at the moment too to support my boyfriend and each other. I have to help with his niece who has tantrums everyday and I feel like they don't deal with her tantrums properly sometimes. I know I'm only 18 and it's not like they do anything bad, I just feel like they give in to her or they sound to stern when dealing with her - which in my opinion makes her worse. 

I do love going up and helping and being there, and I know the answer to my problem is not to be going home and being alone, because I struggle with mental health issues a lot too and taking time to myself (especially during a time when him his family need me) will just set my anxiety off and I can't stop worrying.

I struggle with Anxiety, Stress, OCD and suspected depression and I also talk to a psychological therapist every week or two. I used to struggle with self harm from the age of 11 up until a few years ago. I'm ashamed to say that the only reason I don't do it anymore is the fear of being caught.

As someone with OCD and anxiety, routine and structure is something that is a necessity for me. Obviously I can work in being at his house into my routine, I have my routine for work day mornings for my house. On a work day, I wake up 2 hours before my shift,make myself tea, I lay in bed for about an hour or so with my tea and some youtube to get myself awake and then I have something to eat and start work. That is about it as my routine goes.

I just feel like at his house I physically do nothing. Obviously I'm giving opinions and advice, support and love but physically, I'm sitting in his living all day until its time to go to bed.

Even at that, my boyfriend has started to get a bit antsy which is making it more difficult. I know it's a temporary thing and I let bits of it slide because he doesn't know what he wants, he's upset and his mum is dying. 

For example, when I stay at his house, in the morning I give him a kiss and we cuddle, or more recently, just a hug. 2 mornings in a row, I got up a little earlier and came down stairs myself. I went back up for the time his alarm was supposed to go off and I wake him and check he's okay. I went to the bathroom and came back to give him a cuddle and he says ""you left me. You didn't stay in bed you don't get a cuddle."" which hurt, because I am the most physically affectionate person you'd ever meet and he knows this. Fast forward to the other night. I was sitting with him while he played video games in his living room and after about an hour I went into his kitchen and sat talking to his sister for a while. He comes into the kitchen and asks me if I'm coming back in to sit with him while he plays. His sister brought up the fact that only he is playing and how I probably don't want to sit and watch for hours and he says ""yeah well you've come in here and sat gabbing away for ages to my sister."" so I go into the living room and his dog starts getting tired and grouchy, my boyfriend said how he would only be up for another half an hour to leave him. I told him that I'd go upstairs to put on my pyjamas and sit in bed with his dog but he said I should just stay, so I said again ""I'm only gonna go put my pyjamas on and sit upstairs. You mentioned before how you wanted your own space because there have been so many people in your house."" his response was ""yeah, but you don't have to leave me and sit upstairs to give me my space.""

I feel like he's just worried about being left himself and he hasn't said anything in a harsh way, none of this has been him saying things angrily or anything. It's just a bit unpredictable and he has been getting a little snappy with everyone recently. I completely understand why and he's not been horrible or anything so I'm just giving him time to be like this, I just don't know what to do myself.

How do i cope without having a routine? how can i make one? How can I help support my boyfriend and his family over the fact that his mum is dying? How can I stop my mental health going out of control? All I thought about on the way home tonight while driving was excuses and cover-ups for self harm and haven't even done it and I don't plan to! Hoe can I stop myself from thinking every single time I'm driving that I could just flip my wheel and that would be it? I do want to add, that last bit about suicidal thoughts and thoughts of self harming aren't new or because of this situation. I've had them for years, it's just that I've been thinking of it more recently and I don't know how to help myself",16Nov2020,1
53,"Like the title says I'm 30 and he's 49. We've known each other for 7 years. He's the first person I came out too. We joke around sending sexual, dirty memes. He usually dates younger and I'm into older. He's in good shape and I'm closer to average. He has sent me nudes and stuff before and I hinted at hooking up or giving dating a try and he would say no he doesn't do that with friends and that is what we were. Friends. So for the past month we have been chatting more than usual and have met up to hangout a couple times and of those times he had mentioned he wasn't seeing anyone or hooking up with anyone. Then I suddenly I wasn't hearing from him. So I contacted him through text where usually we chat through other social media apps. I said hey what's up? (This was after a week of not hearing back From him) he said ""hey not much relaxing in bed with my boyfriend"" it took me off guard and all I replied was ok right on. He then said to me, ""I deleted all my apps, I don't know if I told you?"" I just said no you didn't I was wondering why I wasn't hearing from you. He responded with ""I'm sorry man, most of my friends are messaging me through text now so just text me. You didn't message me either"".. So I don't know what to think. Where did this sudden boyfriend come from? Is this friendship one sided? Should I just leave it alone and move on. If or when things don't last and I hear from him what should I do? Even if he is fully sure he is not into me in that way, why didn't he share that he was seeing someone and dropped the news that way until I messaged him. Any help or advice from an outside view sure could help. I'm also faulty new to being comfortable with my sexuality. Thanks.",16Nov2020,1

I sold a car today for $700. Back in feb it ran out of gas and my wife tried starting it up and I’m assuming the fuel pump ate debris in the tank because after adding fuel and priming the lines, it wouldn’t continue to run. 

The person I sold the vehicle to today (my mail man) was aware of the issue and towed it to his home. 

I got a call several hours later that he had replaced the pump and got the vehicle running but it started pouring black smoke. Upon investigation he found coolant mixed in with the oil.

I am in a conflicting situation and don't know the best thing to do. I make very little money and I am trying to improve that by going to school.

I really want to upgrade to a two BR because I am tired of not having enough space/privacy. In order to get a 2 BR I would have to make more money. I have applied to several jobs online with no replies. The only thing I have been able to do is get a second job and I know that I can't work two jobs **and** go to school. I resent my mom so much because I have to make decisions based on her. I don't want what my best option is: 1) work two jobs and place school on hold until I am able to get one good job 2) give up my car so I can afford to have a 2 BR and work 1 job ( the only thing with that is I **hate** not having a car. I would be **confined** to my home) 3) keep the 1 BR and go crazy 4) say fuxK it and make someone else take care of her or put her in a shelter and live my life the way I want Any advice?

I fail in everything I do. I failed to find love.

not to mention on chirstmas of 2019, we were at a party with em and she did the same thing. one red flag is they both went into an empty room (i think it was a pantry?) and closed the door. idk they might've been getting food but they were there for a while.",16Nov2020,1
70,"The title is vague but I don’t know how to properly write one for this column. This is my first Reddit post, also on a phone. 

Ok so basically my question is, should I breakup with my BF or continue the relationship and see how it goes? So background info, im a college sophomore. We are both the same age, we both graduated high school the same time and everything. He’s had a crush on me basically throughout high school, and I did have feelings for him during senior year, but I pushed my feelings away because I didn’t want to ruin our friendship. I cherish friendships over relationships. (Extra info to understand my point: all my crushes on friends, I wouldn’t admit to them because I cherish the friendship more and if I did admit it to them, I’d tell them that I don’t want anything in return but take the compliment) anyways. Ok so my feelings for him faded when I left for college last September. I still spoke with him to catch up, as I did with my other friends but that’s about it. Come summer time, it’s corona time. In October I messages asking him if the store he works at has an item. He said yes then asked to get coffee to catch up. I said sure. So we spent the day talking and catching up. As we head home I ask him why he never told he me liked me and he confessed saying he still did. And I say ok..I admitted that I did have feelings for him and pushed them away, and he asked if we should kiss. I was hesitant at first because I didn’t want to change anything originally, but then we did kiss. Days later I processed that moment and if I did want to continue seeing him or end it there. I chose to continue and we made it official some time in October. (I’m leaving some details out in terms of length) now, I’m getting second thoughts if I want to continue it. (I will say I got a covid test after I kissed him and it came negative, that’s what I thought about as well) I haven’t seen him recently cuz I have a lot of school work and he understands that, but I know I’m not telling him everything with how I feel. From this point, it makes sense to break up especially if I’m not reciprocating, but could it also be that since this is my first relationship I’m just getting a lot of nerves especially with stress and everything? 

Please don’t be too harsh, I’m already stressed as is with everything else in my life, but genuine comments and for you redditors to think back on your own past relationships and if you were in this type of situation. What would you advice me to do?",16Nov2020,1
73,"So, I met this Guy in a school where I work, He is a graduating student but he is about ten years older than me (I'm in my early 20s). I already know that he has a crush on me or something and I felt really uncomfortable 'cause it's against the company's policy. There's really no issue with my employers regarding that since he's technically a graduate if covid did not happen. This guy is kind, funny and nice but I just don't like him more than a friend (relationship isn't one of my interests as I'm still building a career for me). We had a conversation online but it is far from romantic, the topic is very random and most of the time school-related, then he started to constantly message me and it irritates me. I have been very honest with him and said that I can't reply because I honestly have nothing to say and not in the mood to talk but instead of refraining from messaging me he would send me funny messages or would ask me questions that he thought would provoke my interest. I ignored him completely though my conscience was really bothering me because he's a really nice person and I feel like I'm being rude to him. So fast forward he still sometimes visits the school because he has a really good bond with my employers and we would always acknowledge each other's presence. 

One day, he began to constantly message me again which made me feel frustrated because I don't like the feeling of being obligated to respond every time and it frustrates me that he doesn't seem to get how I feel when I clearly told him that I can't always talk to him on a daily basis if it's not important because I like to spend my free time with my family and I also have a lot of things to do. A few nights ago we had a conversation and I told him that I know that he likes me and I can't keep on talking to him because I don't want him to misinterpret and have any false hope, 'cause clearly I can only be friends with him and no more than that (I also explained to him my standpoint when it comes to any relationship that I don't see it as relevant at the moment since my family and career is my priority). 

I thought we had a good chat and that everything was settled and cleared between us, he also agreed that we become ONLY FRIENDS and said that he's only attracted to me but won't go beyond that. I felt relieved hearing that from him, but then the next day he messaged me again with a random meme and I just reacted and did not reply, I thought he would understand that I would need some space but then he messaged me again and shared what he's doing at the moment and again I just reacted and did not let the conversation go any further but he did it again, he messaged me thinking he could provoke me to engage into a conversation. 

I'm really feeling frustrated and feel like I'm about to burst into anger and insult him just to send him away. I feel suffocated with what he's doing, I want him to understand that we can be friends but it doesn't mean we have something special or that we have to message each other daily, I don't want to feel obligated and besides I really don't like him romantically or more than friends and I also feel like he's consuming the time I should've spend relaxing or doing my hobby. What should I do? How should I make him understand without hurting his feeling or bruising his pride?",16Nov2020,3

75,"Hello Reddit.  I am freshly 21 years old, and am in a very tight spot.  Over the last several years, I have noticed that my mother has made it increasingly difficult for me to function as an adult outside of her care.  I truly do love her, but it feels as though she is purposefully shrinking my choices and options of moving out into the world.  I know I need a car to function (as much as I hate this fact), yet I am unable to travel back to my homestate to take the test needed.  Ive been up there twice since moving to my current state (not here as a resident, only as a student and for medical), and each time ive come close to taking the test, but I feel like she manipulates me into changing my mind last second.  Due to the pandemic, im unable to travel, and wont be able to for the foreseeable (possibly definite) future.  I know my time is coming to an end at our home, but I cant even get a job due to health issues (being unable to wear a mask, diabetes, Aspergers, etc.), so I cant save money to even get a car, let alone get insurance or take the in person test (back in my home state).  My ex step dad ruined my credit score, and got it down to 350, and she took out cards and put me as a co-signer, so it shows my credit score as 660, and nearly 5k in debt, despite me not even knowing about this until 8 months ago.  I understand she is trying to help me on that front, but it makes it to where nowhere would rent to me, even if I COULD find a job, hold it down (im not the best at holding down a job when I am able to find one, due to miscommunication issues), and have a car/license/insurance.  Speaking of insurance, it shows it would cost me 500-800 per month at the lowest cost.  I truly dont know what to do, and I feel stuck.  Help?",16Nov2020,2
77,"I am going to try and keep this as brief as possible. Also, for reference, I am very ocd about certain things, and I like to keep track of things that I have eaten, drank, and done, because that is how ocd I am.

At the beginning of October, I moved into a new place with 2 other people. One of the people I moved in with is a friend of mine, and the other guy is someone who has stayed there for almost a year now. My friend has a job that has him going out of town for work and being gone for weeks at a time, and the roommate has been unemployed for almost a year now, and just sits on his ass all day, playing video games and smoking pot.

When I first moved in there, I had everything set up in a way that I could keep track of it. For example, I bought a 12 pack box of ramen, and I eat my ramen 2 at a time. One day, I went to make myself 2 things of ramen, and I had noticed that I was down to 5 packs instead of 6, and I let my friend know, and he had a guess, and confronted the other roommate, and he denied it. For the longest time, I had completely forgotten about it, and just chalked it up to maybe I miscounted, or I had just one package of ramen noodles with some food, and I had forgotten about it. At least, until recently.

The second time this occurred was last week. My friend was out of town on work, and I had woke up one day to see that one of my dishes had been used, and a pitcher of kool aid that I had planned on taking with me to work that morning was almost gone. It was super early in the morning, and I wasn't going to confront my roommate with that bit of info that early. We ended up talking about it later that evening, and he apologized for it, as well as admitted that he took the pack of ramen noodles that one day. I thought everything was good, and we had come to an understanding. I thought wrong.

This most recent occurrence happened within the last couple of days. On Friday, I had ordered 2 pizzas, cinnamon twists, breadstick bites, and a 2 liter of pop for dominos. I ate the 2 pizzas, and drank half the 2 liter over the course of 2 days. Today, I went to go and grab some of the breadstick bites, and noticed that I was missing some. I got curious, so I opened up the cinnamon twists box, and I was missing cinnamon twists out of there as well. I know I didn't eat them, and my friend is still out of town for work. So that left the roommate. I tried to talk to him, but he is unfortunately passed out on the couch and is dead to the world.

How do I go about handling this issue? It is honestly irritating to me, because I am using my hard earned money to pay for my things, and he just eats what he wants, regardless of who it might belong to. I have never dealt with someone like this before.",16Nov2020,1

79,"I have struggled with trying to get my sister off of her iPad for YEARS. She is 9 years old and has had it since she was 4. I think that is NOT okay at ALL. I myself have suffered from technology addiction, but that started when I was 10. Imagine from 4 years old! My parents don’t give a flying fuck, no matter how much I tell them this is a problem! She’s on it for around 10-12 hours a day.

At 9 years old, I was biking around outside with my friends and lived a childhood. I’m 17 now, but I feel so fucking bad for my sister. I have tried everything!! What do I do? Do I just let it go and let it happen? I have had so many arguments with my parents, but nothing has worked. I’m on the verge of giving up. It’s not my life anyway. Not my problem, right?

Onto the advice, I'm 17f, and from the ages of 11-16 I was molested, mentally, physically and emotionally abused, by my brother, having come from an already extremely abusive home life, I'm a literal train wreck and I don't know how to fix myself.

I wanted to know if the things I'm going through right now are normal. I often blame myself for what happened to me. I make excuses for why my parents never warned me about him (repeat offender) I hate myself for speaking up at all, my entire life got uprooted, I got placed with my dad, who is for lack of better words not a very nice person.

No one in my life has tried to help me get counselling as they don't believe me, I don't even know, I'm at the end of my tether, I have constant flashbacks, sometimes I swear I can feel him touching me all over again, I'm at such a loss, what can I do? I have done counselling and trauma groups, through my school.

I've seriously considered saying fuck it and giving up. I feel so pathetic all the time, I cry a lot over the situation, even when I tell myself I'm a fucking idiot and other people have it so much worse, I know my emotions aren't valid, so how do I stop myself feeling them? I'm sick of everything and everyone, I'm so tired of the drain this is having on my life, I cant have an s/o, I hate being touched, I refuse to be in a room alone with a man I don't know, the dark is absolutely terrifying, some music genres even make me remember my experiences, I hate my body and constantly feel dirty.

83,"I'm sure this isn't the first time someone is seeking for advice for this. 
I don't know if the ones residing upstairs are people. They certainly do not behave like people do. 

I live in an apartment. Everything is literally amazing. It's quiet, elderly people live in the building, not near a college so it's not crazy. Every thing ....besides the ones in the unit above me? 

It stomps around like with the force of a thousand tons during the majority of hours of the earth's rotation. 
And in addition, it makes this, pounding sound with every couple of steps. It causes the walls, windows and doors to vibrate and shake, like an earthquake. 

I've recorded sounds of this and sent to management, but nothing seems to have been done. I have anxiety disorder and I constantly wake up at night when the pounding occurs, and I am terrified and don't know what to do. Last night, this pounding occurred at 4am and I woke up screaming. 

It makes literally no sense for anyone to be doing this much movement for 20 hours of the day, but here they are, smashing the floor, like dunking it every 10 minutes and stomping around constantly. Like do you ever sit down and relax????? 

The apartment is also a ""Smoke Free Environment,"" but I've found cigarette butts and packaging all over my patio.

So aside from being scared and angry, telling management, what else are my options? I've never had to deal with something like this before.

It’s kind of deep. Also my ditziness. I’ve always been a ditz. When I’m embarrassed, I smile in embarrassment. I’m embarrassed a lot. People like to make fun of me and take advantage. I’m too scared to stand up for myself. I think I’m physically unattractive. I’m very unnoticed.

If he didn’t see me trying to get in, I wouldn’t have asked him and I wouldn’t have cleaned the fridge doors and nobody would have cared. But I was embarrassed that he saw me. He said “why?” i mumble in my deep soft voice “i need to clean the fridge. He still doesn’t hear me. But he eventually lets me in.

95,"I (M43) live in a house with a family of four. My wife (F39), my older daughter (F15) and my younger daughter (F11). My wife is an angel, and my younger daughter isn’t the problem here. Recently, the problem has been with the older daughter.

My daughter recently turned 15, and being in this age of social media and in high school, she’s begun getting into politics. Now, I encouraged that, as I think voting and politics is important. And 15 is old enough I think. I’d call myself more on the right conservative side than left, but I’m not an alt right radicalist. My daughter on the other hand has developed a pretty radical view. She’s a ‘libsoc’ which I still don’t understand.

Her views are another thing I don’t understand. She wants to introduce anarchism (?isnt anarchy bad?) and replace capitalism with a brand new system ‘without corruption or a hierarchy’. Now, I don’t agree with that. But I try not to debate or argue with her: she can have her own opinions and I respect that. 

However, since I am not very interested on the topic (and I hardly know anything about it) I refuse to debate with her. Now, my daughter loves debating. She is on the school debate team (which I encouraged). Meanwhile I’ve never been good at it, and I refuse to debate on something I have little information on.

My daughter does not like this. Every time at dinner she tries to bring politics into the topic. Now, my youngest daughter has no political opinion yet, or as far as I know. And I don’t want to talk with people about it near her. We raised her without religion as well: we want her to be unbiased and to have all the facts. Then she can make a choice.

But then when I banned politics at the dinner table, my oldest blew up at me. She called me a biased conservative who refuses to change the system and is holding back her freedom of speech. Then she left the table. Me and my wife are both very confused, and my youngest started crying (she is very bad when dealing with conflicts, we are working on it).

I tried to talk to her but she just kicked me out of the room. I’m not sure what to do. I don’t want to talk about politics with her because she hates nearly everything I believe in (capitalism, America, Gun ownership etc) and will fiercely debate me. But she seems to be demanding on a debate even when I don’t want it. What should I do?",16Nov2020,3

109,"I spent my developmental years in an abusive, and neglectful Russian orphanage. When I was adopted, and brought to America it was around 7 when I started showing signs of depression, and suicidal ideation. In my adolescence, I had an easy time forming friendships, but I could not maintain them. My time in therapy told me that I had an avoidant attachment style. When I was a legal adult, I was diagnosed with borderline, bipolar depressive, and ptsd. I understand that I have a lot of struggles with my mental illness, however no one I know would describe me as a bad person, and I definitely know I am not undeserving of love. I think the big disconnect is between the fact I want to be loved so much and the fact that I choose to believe someone is being genuine unless they prove otherwise. I’ve spent a lot of time in treatment, and I know all about red flags, but up until recently I haven’t been able to  actually read them as red flags. As of right now, I’m talking to someone who seems very genuine, kind, and best of all he seems to really like me for me.

112,"I put NSFW cause the this story is not exactly something I was expecting to hear today and I really need advice on what to do. I haven't stopped thinking about it since my friend told me and it's bothering me like hell. 







So it starts out my friend C(20M) gets invited to this party from a girl (20F, let's call her J). He's liked her for a long time now but has never been able to get anywhere with her because she doesn't really want him, she wants to stay as friends and he's still been talking with her since this came about cause he's still in love with her. So as C gets invited to this party one of our other friends gives him some heavy liquor and told C to use it with the J so he could finally get somewhere. (Her mind hasn't exactly changed, she still wants to keep it as friends) So they head to this party, my buddy uses the liquor with the girl and nobody hears from him for a while. Apparently they eventually got in the shower together, she was drunk at this point but my friend wasn't. C says he didn't do anything with J in the shower other then helping her with her hair and clothes(apparently). But after that basically, she gets out the shower, still drunk, gets on the bed half naked and falls asleep. 






Now this is where the story bothers me and why I'm even posting here. 






My friend C, apparently fingered J while she was completely knocked out on the bed. She's got no recollection of anything happening from the night at all whatsoever, this is really bothering me because I don't think it's right to get someone drunk as hell just to ""finally get somewhere"", hell she was asleep when he even decided to do anything with her. Although I honestly don't believe he didn't at least try anything in the shower cause you don't get in the shower with a drunk girl without any bad intentions considering his intentions in the first place. 







I'm honestly not okay with any of this at all and I need to know should I rat him out or convince C to tell her what he did and face the consequences????? I've known this guy since we were kids but I never expected this. I truthfully don't believe it's right to get someone drunk and do anything you want to them if you do anything at all, and not expect any drawbacks at all.

I've always had a special connection with my grandma. I chose to move in with her over my own parents because I don't have the best parental relationships. I used to spend all of my summers at my grandma's house, and we shared a really close bond. She often tells my I'm her favourite grandchild. I enjoy chatting with her, and we went through similar emotionally abusive childhoods. 

Anyways, I decided I wanted to move out as it would make it easier for me to live the lifestyle I want, and may also help with my depression and learned helplessness.

My grandma was really sad that I decided to move out. I was only living with her since March (so about 8 months), but I think maybe she didn't expect it. I feel really guilty for her sadness. I miss her too, and plan on calling frequently, probably every other night for the first week, and then once/twice a week for each after. 

My parents keep bringing up how she is going to be so sad, and it's making me feel even more guilty. It's gotten me spiralling and has made me wonder if I've made the right choice. 

Anyways, what do you think? The pandemic is still going on, so I feel like that made it hurt even more since she can't really see any of the other grandchildren much. I don't know, I just feel extremely guilty for it. I don't want to be the cause of another person's pain",16Nov2020,1
116,"So this is going to be a long, and complex one.  But I desperately need advice.  First time posting, please forgive any errors, grammar, etc. 

I (37F) have been working at XYZ company for 10 years now.  It is a service based company and I when started I was the only admin person in an office of 3 other people.  Since then the company has grown substantially (from $1mil per year to $20mil per year, and over 25 people in the office) and my role within it has as well.  My “official” title is Executive Assistant to the President, but I wear many, many hats including A/P, A/R, Sales, some Operations, some IT responsibilities, among other duties.  I even took classes and obtained my Residential Builders License because the company needed a licensed individual to perform a certain type of services we are now offering.  I am personally responsible for over $2million in sales (that I’ve never earned commission on).  I’ve always felt that I was under paid.  I don’t do terrible, don’t get me wrong, but I’ve always felt that I don’t quite earn what I deserve.  And when I’ve brought it up to my boss, the owner/President, we’ll call him John, he always brushes it off and says it “because of my position”.   I’ve always just let it go. 

To add a twist to the situation, I’ve been having an affair with John (61M) for the last 9 years.  I am divorced but John is married, and his wife also now works at the office, she did not when I first started (she worked part time from home).  John and I have great chemistry and I love the freedom of being single and independent while also having consistent intimacy with one person.   He helps me a little bit financially in cash, so I guess you can call him my SD also, haha.  

Let’s rewind to a couple of years ago.  John hires a manager, let’s call him Bob.  Bob instantly takes a dislike to me and it has felt like he has been trying to force me out of the company.  I grin and bear it because John really likes him.  

Fast forward to now and I feel like I am massive overworked, over stressed and that I am doing too many duties that should be Bob’s responsibility, as he is the manager and I am just the Exec Asst.  (Operations type duties, sales, etc).   My affair withJohn is winding down, for me at least, John isn’t exactly aware that I’m feeling this way.   And I make a shocking discovery, quite by accident.  Bob’s salary is DOUBLE what mine is.  DOUBLE.  I’m livid.  I’m insulted.  I’m incredibly hurt.  I’m so many emotions at one time that I cannot possibly list them all.   

I need advise, please!   What do I do?   Do I request a raise?  Do I run far, far away from the entire situation?  I’ve been looking for a  new job for a few months now, but with the state of the current pandemic they are hard to come by.   I’m sure I could find a new Sugar Daddy too with no problem.  I’m not looking to blackmail him with our affair so that is out of the question.  But what do I do?  I need some genius advise please!

Edit: Bobs salary is double mine, not John’s.  That was a typo that has since been corrected",16Nov2020,0
119,"around july of this year i made a channel with a friend and made music edits and mashups. this went well and we quickly got to 100 subs. as we grew we kept getting requests to make one hour versions of songs, even though we thought this was dumb we eventually caved in. due  to the long nature of these videos are channel started to skyrocket and went up to nearly 2k in weeks. we got monitized (after the third request) and are making some money but i hate how spammy and shitty the content im making is. what do i do? also sorry for bad grammer i kinda suck at typing",16Nov2020,1
121,"I [17M] work at a bike shop and I really love biking. I have been saving up for a certain type of bike that is very expensive for me. Today at work I was gifted a bike from a customer that I could sell for $600 or $700 after some work is done to it. I also have a younger brother [13] who has no way to obtain a bike like the one I have received and would like to ride it with me. I could also use the new bike to lend to friends if they want to ride with me (which happens occasionally). Should I sell the bike and use the money to buy myself the new bike I have been dreaming about or should I give the bike to my brother and save for a few more months?

My parents always try and get me to hang out with a friend but I never feel like it. Aside from socializing I don’t have motivation to do anything really.

130,"So lads, I’m a 20 year old fella from Chicago..but moved to a small suburb in Indiana. I’ve graduated high school with pretty decent grades, maybe like 2 to 3 c’s in total. I’m currently in community college studying in law and criminal justice. 

I thought it’s what I wanted to do, ya know become a police officer and whatever. However I’m taking the classes and I’m just not invested in it anymore...I don’t have the motivation; the drive, to do it anymore. I know people sometimes change career paths, but I just don’t think college is for me. I’m more interested in “pop culture” so to speak. Such as acting, storytelling, singing, and music. 

My parents constantly nag at me, and I know it’s because they care, however I don’t feel it. They have that cliche mentality that college will magically make you successful and going to school would guarantee you a successful career. It’s the boomer mentality in a way. Boomers were actually the ones that sort of messed that up for us in some ways.
 
What do you guys think? Is college really as important as some people say? Any thoughts?",16Nov2020,1

I want to drop out before accumulating anymore debt, but I’m lost as to what I should do next.

Obviously I would pick up a job or internship to replace my schooling. I’m just lost as to where I’d go after that. I don’t want to live at home forever, but from everything I’ve heard college is the only way to living a comfortable life (by that I mean a nice stable income, house, etc.) I have no interests so far and feel lost.

135,"So just recently me and my friend have planned a road trip where were gonna stay with her boyfriend along with her friend who I've been wanting to get to know better. I have had previous contact with her friend after asking for her number recently and getting to know her better, we're both pretty excited for this trip. One thing about this trip is that me and her will be sharing a room which I have no problem with and she doesn't either, I feel as though this could possibly get in the way in making an attempt to get to know her but at the same time she was fine with sharing a room.

My question is how can I get this trip to have an impact on getting to know each other since we haven't met up yet besides a few times. She has a very busy personal life just like mine but was able to allocate time for the trip along with take time off work, which shows me she's interested.",16Nov2020,1
137,"i’m going to give a little backstory first so you can understand, so close to five months ago I met my boyfriend through a mutual friend, overtime there is a lot of problems between the friend and my parents. and me and my man met through her. My boyfriend was given a bad name. This caused my parents to think poorly of him without ever even meeting him. So around 3 months ago I was told to stop seeing him, i didn’t fight it and figured i could still see him just secretly. Keep in mind i am fairly young so is he (15). I have snuck him over PLENTY of times and I have discovered that I truly do love him and want to be with him no matter what. I know it takes months to fall in love and I can say i do really love him and want to be with him, and we both feel this way. But my mother means a lot to me, her disapproval has left me not talking to her about it, so she’s uninformed that we are still even together. This is where I need the advice, I don’t know whether to tell my mother or leave it for her to find out overtime. I don’t want her to hate me or think that I’m a liar buttt I want him in my life. This is difficult for me to figure out because I’m under aged so I need to respect my parents opinion but I’m stuck. what if me telling her ruins it all, That’s not what I want. this might be difficult to give advice on but please let me know what you would you do in this situation?",16Nov2020,0
138,"Please help me make this decision. Okay so first off I’m 24 y/o F. I have been living home in my dads place for about 6 months now. I love some parts of it but others not so much. I love spending time with my siblings and bonding with them as well as my dad. A little info on my dad: very strict immigrant father who worked very hard to establish our family as a upper middle class family. He is very supportive and caring but can also be VERY controlling. Now prior to living with my father I had my own apartment which I shared with my now ex-bf. After we broke up I moved home for emotional support and to save money. 

(Side note: I have always had my own apt since i moved out at 18 and this is my first time moving back home) So about a month after I moved home I got a DWI 😭 which was really embarrassing and hard to deal with. My dad didn’t kick me out like I thought he would. He was pissed (rightfully so) and we were having disagreements quite often. Now we are in a much better space after many long conversations. Another thing you should know is I am still in school. I should be done in about 1 year. While living at my dads I acquired about 30k. I got a new car and a few other things but no other major purchases. So I am somewhat financially stable even though I don’t have money coming in BUT I recently got a job offer and I start tomorrow.  

Another thing you should know about my living situation at home:  I HAVE NO SOCIAL LIFE. No dating, no going out and having fun, no nothing really, I have a curfew and we live in a suburb (about 40 mins) outside of a huge city in which all my friends still live. I feel isolated and sometimes a bit depressed. I applied for an apt that I really like that is also in my budget (i would need $2100/month to live comfortably and pay ALL my bills) I got approved for the apt and have to make a decision on if I should move out SOON. I already signed a lease at the new place BUT i used a fake name and social security number to apply (no judgement please). I already paid 1200 move in fees and bought furniture. None of these things are permanent though and can be reversed. 

 I miss dating, having a social life, and feeling like an adult but my dad doesn’t think I am ready to be on my own again. He wants me to stay but I am so torn I don’t know what to do. I want to be independent but I also like the safety net of staying home. 

What would y’all do? i am leaning towards moving out but I don’t want to hurt my dad or make the wrong choice and drain my savings if this job doesn’t go well. Can someone please give me a little advice or tell me what they would do?(side note: i don’t pay any bills at my dads I am only responsible for my own bills phone, car, insurance, and credit card)",16Nov2020,0
141,"Tw// I will be referencing past trauma and has a serious topic mentioned.

I’m on mobile so I apologize for any errors. Also due to this bringing me distress I will also seek out the advice from my therapist on this matter.

So to start off, let me pre-face this with my history. I apologize if my wording is blunt but it’s my only understanding of the situation. I was violated as a child. As far as I can remember it was a one off and I only remember how it started. It has brought me a great deal of trauma. I’d also like to say, I don’t give myself credit, I feel very socially inept and dumb as confused. 

So recently I made new friends through mutual interest of a game, a lot of them are younger, around 13 to 14. As the title stated, I am 18. At first I was like okay, fine, it’s someone to play this co-op game with. But I’ve found myself playing more games with them and kind have joined their friend group? At first I was unsure if it was fine but I ignored that thought. But now I’ve gotten to a place where I think it may in appropriate. Firstly, they are in puberty and sexual jokes are made here and there. I discourage them and ignore them but I still feel uncomfortable. Second off, I don’t know what this feeling is but I think I’ve grown to have a favorite? I don’t know if I just relate to this one kid more but part of me is scared that it’s not that. It’s a new feeling that I’m figuring out and it scares me due to my history. My greatest fear to be like the person who violated me. I think it’s just a fear though. I just want to be upfront with what brought this to my mind and why I’m questioning myself. I’m sorry if I’m not making much sense. I’m just confused and I need advice. I’m happy to answer any comments with questions I come across. Thank you for reading this and for any advice you may have.",16Nov2020,1

146,"I’m 15 and not from the US so I’m sorry if I’m not being clear at most times, especially with my weirdly excessive uses of commas and parenthesis.

Okay, so my mom is in the middle of her midlife crisis and she is trying to mimic the stereotype of the youth, thinking that by doing that, the inevitable (growing old) would happen later, so she started to dance to cumbia and reggaeton (common music genres in my country), and even twerks constantly. She also wants to seem like the progressive (not politically speaking) parent who thinks that the traditional raising methods suck and says things like “you’re stuck in the 20th century!”, but not in a political way. She also constantly embarrasses me, to add something more.

There’s nothings wrong with that, but she subconsciously wants to pass on her new unfulfilled dream of being the popular girl to my infant sister — oh, there’s something else I didn’t tell you, my mom is basically stuck in high school now, because when she finished it, she married my dad who turned up to be pretty successful, and then she adapted to our “rich life” (rich people in our country are middle-high people in the US) so she didn’t grow up as a person, she doesn’t do anything for our household since we have several nannies and whenever she’s at home, she basically locks herself in her bedroom and uses her phone.

Now, going back to the other point. What does she do? She first of all is constantly speaking to my sister about a classmate of hers, telling her stuff like “behave or I’m telling [the name of the boy] what you did! (something that would embarrass her)”. Now, my sister never said that she liked that boy, my mom is pushing that thing all the time and made her think that. I constantly speak about that with people working in my house that I get along with and they all agree with me 100%. 

She also taught her to twerk, and recorded and published videos of her doing so to TikTok, as if it were something cool. When I found out I was really pissed off and complained to her, and she said stuff like “twerking is natural! You’re the one sexualizing it! You’re stuck in the 20th century”. Now, just to clarify, I’m not that much into politics besides for the memes, but I have a culturally-progressive stance and I’m not religious, but there’s a big difference between sexualizing kids and being progressive.

Worst of all? She allows her to enter her bathroom when she’s showering and my nanny told me that my sister said that my mom told her that my mom showed her a used tampon. SHE’S FUCKING FIVE and already knows this stuff... this is just wrong.

My dad opposes it, but my mom ‘brainwashed’ him into thinking that he’s a traditionalist outdated guy (he’s not even that old, he’s in his mid-late 40s, and my mom is only four years younger than him if you want to know). So again, my mom made him think that, so he’s at this point (they are fragilely married for more than 20 years so I get him) like “fuck it, do what you want, you fuck up everything but I won’t control you because I’m not that type of husband”. Summing this part of the post up, my dad does everything work-related, and my mom theoretically is supposed to take care of the household (she does not do anything, again, nannies/cooks do all of her work, she only hangs out with friends in a similar situation and locks herself up in her room, she never bathed my sister as far as I know), therefore my dad thinks he can’t complain about what she does. I don’t have anything to complain about my dad anyways, he’s a hard-working guy and always at least tried to treat me fine.

I don’t know much of psychology, I might study though, I find it interesting, but it’s psychologically obvious that she doesn’t do it with malicious intent, it’s because she probably realized that she’s too old to be a model/actress or stuff like that (she always likes being the center of attention and would have loved to be a singer), so she passes it to my sister, also add to that the fact that me and my brother aren’t popular at school, and she thinks I have no friends (because I don’t take them with her), so she wants to raise her differently, as a popular kid (I know, it’s probably the stupidest thing you’ve read today). I won’t call social services because she does not do it on purpose and if she gets it she will probably stop although that not usually effective with her.

What should I do? Complaining to her won’t work because she doesn’t want to hear the truth and locks herself again as usual — by the way, I’m respectful while saying it, it’s not that I shout at her, even though I have all the right to do so.
So what should I do and how should I do it without fucking my/her life up.

TL;DR: Honestly it’s worth reading the whole thing to understand it better. But in summary my mom is in her midlife crisis so she is sexualizing my sister and showing her inappropriate stuff like used tampons. Please read the whole thing if you can, thank you anyway!",16Nov2020,2

I am, for all intents and purposes, a Twitter feen. I use it for everything - reviews, news, following my close inner circle. IG, I had it but rarely posted after turning 25.
I recently deactivated my IG, and deleted my Twitter app. Part of me feels a sigh of relief. It’s a weird feeling to know that no one is keeping tabs on me, or check to see what I’m doing. (I like to think someone at least considered doing that, not that I’m popular) The other part of me feels like I am absolutely disconnected from the entire planet. Which was partially my point, but I never realized how much I relied on it. My phone tells me my screen time weekly, so it’s not a secret how much time I spend on social media, but I’m talking about missing out on content.

161,"Me and my girlfriend have been dating for over 9 months now. We met at work and became good friends and things went from there. Tonight we were hanging out and I discovered something about her that hurt me. When we first started dating, we agreed that we would save our sexual relationship until marriage.  And we have. And I knew she wasn’t a virgin. She told me about how her ex boyfriend and her slept together once, but it was a mistake and he treated her badly, so she ended that.  But I discovered tonight that she has had  4 sexual partners before me. I understand she can’t change her past choices, but I feel like she should have told me about them. Now here I am, feeling heart broken and stupid and vulnerable. What should I do??",16Nov2020,0
162,"I (18M) am participating in a 24 hour hackathon soon, and it starts in the late afternoon, but I have things to do (like work and class) beforehand so I have to try to be awake for \~32 hours. The event is on a Friday flowing into a Saturday. The way I see it, I have two options:

1. Stay up as late as I possibly can on Thursday night (likely around 4-5 am if I'm not being productive), knowing that the latest I can possibly get up and not suffer consequences at my part time job is 10:30 am
2. Go to sleep earlier than usual (likely \~11pm instead of \~2 am) and try to get as much good sleep as possible, but then it seems like I'd want to go to sleep earlier the following night

Which option is better for staying awake as long as possible and why?

Also, when I inevitably do crash around 8-10 am Saturday (I don't drink coffee or energy drinks or I might be able to go longer), what's the best length for a powernap so I minimize unconscious time but maximize refreshment and make it until around 6 pm?

I could just be a bad leader but if not I dont really know what to do about this. They do everything I would naturally do, just jumping on it faster.

165,"My parents have high expectations of me. These expectations are due to the fact that academics comes naturally to me. Unfortunately, that means there is  a lot of pressure for me to always perform at perfection. 94-96 is below average, and 97-100 is average for them. Basically, any grade I get below 93 means gaming, (my only outlet due to COVID), automatically get blamed, any grade below a 90 means I get lectured and yelled at for being irresponsible, lazy and distracted.  I get grounded as well, and all of this has led me to absolutely abhor telling them anything. I hate talking about my interests with them for fear of being judged, and try to cover up any bad grades I get for fear of losing my entertainment.

&amp;#x200B;

Now to my bad grade. I had something to do online that counts as two daily grades, and I had an entire week to do it. It completely slipped my mind, and here I am, just remembering it, and feeling my stomach drop. At this point, the grade I will receive will be a zero for both daily grades, and I will almost definitely be yelled at and be grounded just in time for thanksgiving break because of my ""disorganization."" I know that at least one, maybe both of those grades can be dropped because of a grade improvement assignment my teacher allows us students to do. 

&amp;#x200B;

I always bring up that assignment, but my mom doesn't want to hear it. Any type of argument or attempt to tell them how my grade is still a high A is seen as disrespect, and I'm just landed in more trouble. I have no idea how to tell her without her getting mad, so I would like reddit's help.

Also, sorry for the long story. If you guys would be so kind as to also give me tips on how to stay calm while being lectured at. I find it extremely hard to stay cool during this tirade because of her tendency to push my buttons.  I always end up in more trouble because I can't stay quiet while she won't listen to my explanations or the fact that I will still make a high A at the end of the semester, and I would greatly appreciate some tips on how to stay cool.

For example, I was working with my coworker today and they asked if I minded that they take an extra 15 minute break. I was fine with this so I allowed it. But then they came back after an hour break and acted like everything was fine. I really wanted to say something about that not being cool but I just couldn’t do it.

169,"So I grew up in an Asian family and...we aren't lacking in love per se. I know that my parents love me and they know I love them (hopefully?). Similarly, I know that my brothers are always there for me and I will always be willing to help them out in any capacity.

However, as a child I was very independent. Like, I would shut myself in a room and just read all day and I disliked hugs and kisses and all that. Right now, I want them more and want to hug my parents more too, but like I'm afraid to? I'm sorry I don't get what's with me either lmao. Like, when I sometimes just hug my mom spontaneously, she asks ""What's wrong?"" or ""What did you do?""

I also want to grow closer with my brothers. I don't know anything about them (best friends, favorite colors, what they like to do most when outside). I want to actually be like a sister, not a stranger, to them.

In dating, my family has a phenomenon where all the women are either unhappy in their relationships, don't have a relationship, or can't find a relationship. I've watched my mother over and over be disappointed by men. She raised me and my brother pretty much alone to the point where if I were to ever have a child I don't see a father figure. But even then I don't want to have children, I want to spare them due to the fear of ending up single like my mother. It wasn't traumatic, she did the best she could. I never have been without food water or shelter, and I live upper middle class; my mom even pays for my college, but it's the other issues... the internal ones. My dad was a child support check and nothing more. I was bullied in childhood. 

 My best friend has started dating and successfully got a boyfriend and she found him to be boring, a pushover, and not for her entirely- so she cheated on him with a guy she knew was undesirable and now she's in a dilemma. I've tried dating, it's never me however, its them. Trauma, damage, broke, etc. It's exhausting. I had a boyfriend for 4 years who shaped my view of dating: That eventually they don't even care anyway. Years later I'm in love with someone else right now... but I already know it's not going to work, his issues are not mine and I have my own life to live. The only person I depend on is my mother, but she's not gonna be here forever, and my brother is 7 years younger than me. I know eventually I'm gonna be the only thing my brother has. Our family is pretty toxic so we're isolated from them for our sanity. 

I just focus on my schooling because I want to be a lawyer, but I'm about to graduate with my economics degree next December and currently studying for the LSAT right now. I think about other things like bills and houses, but love and social interaction I shy away. I don't want to focus on it... I just want to ignore it and act like people don't exist. My mom gets upset and says I shouldn't feel like this, one of my friends says get therapy, and another just says grow up. I don't talk to people about these issues anymore so I came here. I don't want to be like this but I don't know how not to feel like this either. Everyone thinks I am overdramatic, but what can I do when all I've seen over and over is disappointment.

183,"Hello,

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier this year I was wrongfully charged with a drug related felony. Wrong place wrong time and association with the parties involved got me charged. I don't feel right saying I am completely innocent because sometimes you can be 'involved' with something even if you didn't realize that you were. This is especially true when you hang out with friends who are involved in things that can get you into trouble. Terrible mistake on my part putting myself around that lifestyle, especially when I am already on probation for dui. 

&amp;#x200B;

After getting arrested on the new charges, I was let go from my software programming job(CS degree) which had been going pretty good(working remote, good pay, good co-workers, etc). Due to the stop in income, I had to move back to my moms house to avoid spending any more money. The lawyer and bond took pretty much everything I had in savings. For the past few months, I have spent my time applying to jobs, studying my discipline(programming), spending time with siblings, and just trying to stay positive in general. I have received 4 offers with great software companies, and all 4 companies have rescinded the offers once they saw the pending case on my background. They were all significantly higher paying than the entry programming role I had before getting arrested. They all had the same reasoning of its just too much risk to train/onboard you then you might have to go to jail once sentenced if convicted. I understand that. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another nagging issue is that I have had 3 court dates since the arrest, and every time the court date rolls around, my lawyer ends up telling me last minute that it has been continued and it gets set for another couple months down the line. Now it has been 8 months since arrest with no traction on the case, I havent even been formally charged or indicted yet. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am seeking advice from anyone on how I can continue to move forward in this situation. How should I be spending my time? Is there anything I am overlooking that I should be doing? The goal is to get back to work as soon as possible and get the case over with. However pleaing out is complicated in itself as why plea out when innocent and it would violate my probation. But I sure can't afford to stay at my parents for years while the court system works this out. Leaving the legal side of advice to my lawyer on how to play it out. I had to sell my car to go to lawyer, so I have no transportation. All 4 offers I got were remote programming jobs, but I am not sure what type of work I can do remotely that won't background check and decline me on the pending case. I have burnt out my references having already asked them a ton of times, and every time is a dead end. I am not sure if continuing to spend time interviewing with companies and going through the process is worth it, knowing they will most likely decline the background check, as well as the issue with burning out references. I do have a little left to pay the lawyer, so I am considering just taking out a credit card to pay him off. Have been spending my time each day helping out my parents where I can, doing a little programming work to stay sharp, playing xbox, browsing the web, going for walks, and sleeping more than truly needed.

As I've grown into an adult and experienced more relationships, I find that I am uncomfortable with sex. I like sex, I have sexual fantasies,however, I struggle to act on my feelings. I also masturbate from time to time. I used to watch porn often (not so much anymore)  Anxiety often gets in the way of how I feel. The anxiety of being used and/or trust issues. I really don't want to give my body to just any guy who eventually may treat me bad. 

It seems that every relationship I get into sex is hard for me to allow myself to enjoy. Also the initial step of doing it for the first time is really hard to get myself to do.

I am a 20f, I need advice on whether or not I should get a puppy, I was thinking in getting a corgi since it will be small enough to go to the dorms with me. Since I am under the DSS (student disability) under my college. I have been struggling with the idea of getting a dog due to the fact that my mom plants these seeds in my head to say that I don't need one or it would be too much stress on me. Which I still want to take in the advice but over the years of my life, I feel like having a dog and training it to do tasks as an emotional support animal will be beneficial for my life.   


Ever since middle school, I was depressed, anxious and had suicidal tendencies, which now I have over come the suicidal tendencies. Though I have gotten more anxious and depressed over the years, in 2018 I was in a really bad car accident with my friend and her mom. I broke pretty much the main parts of your lower half, my right femur, both pelvic bones, left knee, left acl and pcl, and have nerve damage on the peroneal nerve. It has been two years of finally being able to recover from the trauma that has impacted me, the nights of being in pain badly from nerve pain to even walking around in walmart and having tons of knee pain by the end of the day. the anxiety I feel just being in a car has left me with severe anxiety on the highway, and I think we will crash even though I know we wont.   


I'm giving a little back story to why I feel I need a dog by my side, my therapist told me petting a dog will help with my anxiety to calm me down. Along with help me do tasks to feel like I can do something throughout the day despite it just being around my cat who pretty much is self sufficient. I had been looking into training and how much it would cost, knowing it would be covered under the situation dealing with an attorney.   


this is when my mom thinks that I do not need a dog, that she doesn't understand how I let depression and anxiety get to me. That a dog will not fix me (which I know will not, never said it would.) Pretty much saying that I just need to go outside instead of be in my room and that I need to make more friends (since I don't have many.) Along with that I am holding myself back and that I just need to gain independence instead of getting an animal, and I would be happier that way.

193,"
He was in a relationship for two years with his ex who was manipulative, controlling and apparently would check his phone every waking moment of his day. He was going to get married to her when she cheated on him with her ex boyfriend while they were on a break. I met him through a dating app and we seemingly hit it off. he told me how if his ex found out she would “trick” him into having him add her on snap because they had raised a puppy together which he later gave to her when they broke up. And that she would try to “lure him” back in by sending nudes-keep in mind she’s a 29 year old teacher who would basically do anything to pull him back. And she would harass me if she knew that I was his girlfriend.And he would “probably not respond to her nudes” according to his own words. When he told me all this I stayed quiet and nodded that I understood the situation but in reality it makes me wonder if all this happened already during the time we’ve been together. I haven’t met his parents which he insists he keeps his life private from them because they would nag him to get married and that they think I would leave him-which I wouldn’t because I love him so much. But I don’t think he will introduce me until we’ve been together for a year.. He’s trying to tell me to wait to tell my own parents until there is ‘stability” in our relationship. He also says that he doesn’t have any social media other then snap because his ex made him delete it all back when they were together. Which is also suspicious as he claims to not have any social media. I can’t be in love with someone who is still in love with their ex. Keep in mind they broke up a year before he started dating me.

Present:

We met up for Halloween and on the way back he casually mentioned how his ex was still single. I asked him how he knew since they didn’t talk at all he told me she hit him up two months ago and said that he told me. I immediately confronted him that he didn’t tell me which he said that she just sent him a message (which she would send whenever she wasn’t dating anyone) and he didn’t respond-that there was no “conversation” at all.  He immediately assured me that he wouldn’t ever get back with her during this lifetime at all. About two weeks earlier we were talking about his ex and he then told me how he didn’t know if she was single or not. I feel like he’s lying about when she hit him up. I don’t wanna check his phone as I’ve never done that and I trust him but this has me thinking. I love him so much-gave him everything but if he’s cheating on me..I have no words. 


TLDR; is he still not over her?",16Nov2020,1

198,"This has been going on for 6+ years, so I’ll try to explain how this happened. I (24F) met this person (23M) my junior year of high school in art class. He was a year younger than me and I’m not too sure how we became friends, but I became somewhat of a mentor to him and sometimes payed him to tie dye shirts for me. I thought he was a cool dude and often talked with him through his problems  until my senior year when he started writing strange poems about me and saying really uncomfortable things. I had to end our friendship but he wouldn’t let up and would try to confront me in the hallways at school or bombard my social media with inappropriate messages. 

Once I went to college, I stopped worrying about his advances until he started coming into my place of work and leaving weird gifts. Luckily, I was never working when he came in but once he gave my coworker a picture of a statue called “The Mother” with disturbing notes on the back  to pass on to me. At this point my friends and I had all blocked him on social media several times, but he was still able to find out my roommates workplace and tried looking for me there as well. One he was banned from both of our workplaces, he made a new Facebook account to send me half threatening/half nonsense messages calling me “mama” several times. I looked at his Instagram page and he had posted disturbing images like close ups of my eye from pictures I had never seen of myself before. I told him to leave me the fuck alone and delete any content of me from his social media before blocking him again. 

A few months later I accidentally ran into him outside my ceramics class (now I’m thinking he was waiting for me) and he proceeded to chase me across campus while I yelled at him to stop following me. He mentioned planning 
“something big” for my birthday, which was in exactly one week. I ran into my next class and sat there in shock for the next hour and a half. I was worried that something bad might happen and I didn’t want to put anyone else at risk, so I told my professor what had happened after class. He was obligated to file a report about the incident and I received an email later that day notifying me that the other person was aware of the report filed on them as well. I was too afraid and embarrassed to go back to that class afterwards and tried to forget the whole incident. 

4 years later and besides blocking the occasional friend request, I haven’t worried much about this person. I rarely use social media but I recently checked my message requests on IG and saw that he has been trying to contact me since September. My heart sank seeing messages like “I can’t live without you, I will die with you on my mind” and after looking at his profile I see his username and multiple posts from the past year are directed towards me. His bio describes spying on someone through a window and taking pictures of them. I don’t want to ignore this anymore. We have several mutual friends and I’ve been thinking about reaching out to them to offer him help. I am fairly confident that he doesn’t know where I currently live, work, or attend graduate school but I feel sick to my stomach thinking of how persistent he has been after so many years. I don’t know where to go from here. I genuinely think he is very ill. Any advice on what to do would be gladly appreciated.",16Nov2020,2

204,"Edit: M20, the others are around the same age.

It’s a hell of a situation.

I live with 3 roommates. 2 of em are pretty good dudes, never had an issue. But the third is a nightmare on earth. We’ll call him V.

He had a lease with the complex previously and he moved in ahead of us. When the rest of us moved in, it was like a scene out of hoarders. Shopping bags, random clothes, empty fast food bags, dirty dishes, empty bottles etc. you get the picture. Just trashed the entire apartment before the rest of us moved in. I have to share a bathroom with him and we have 2 sinks. Mine is clean, and his is constantly stuffed with beard hair, pubes (No I’m not joking, he shaves his pubes into his sink and leaves it there) toothpaste, and random shit. The toilet was blackened when I moved in and flushing it wouldn’t clean it. 

The one roommate and I, Let’s call him R, have to clean the kitchen frequently cause he’ll make food on the stove, and leave the used pots, pans, packages of food and ingredients on the stove and around it for weeks until someone decides to suck it up and clean it. I’m thankful I brought my own air fryer up because he hasn’t cleaned his since the summer. I’m also thankful for my mini fridge from my dorm days cause he’ll eat my fucking food too. I keep everything in my room except frozen cause I don’t have a freezer in my fridge. 

He’s also a drug dealer, and you’re probably asking “why not get him kicked out on that?” Well the others smoke weed and it’s still illegal in my state so trying to get the cops to raid him or getting the management to kick him out would fuck the other roommates. 

Can it get worse? Oh yes it can!

Tonight was the straw that broke the camels back. We were playing video games when we got a knock at the door. I had my door locked so I only heard this from R. V answered the door and a bunch of burglars stormed in and held him and R at knifepoint. Took their Xbox’s, their money, threatened to kill R and one said “I’m taking you home with me” to R. Like I said, I had my door locked so I didn’t know what happened until minutes afterward, but we all could’ve been killed because the shit kicker is V KNEW THE GUYS WHO ROBBED US!

So myself and the rest of the roommates are done with his shit. We have till August on the lease, and V won’t leave peacefully cause he (shocker) is insane. Myself, R and the third guy and trying to come up with a plan to get him out. I decided to take this to reddit to see if anyone else had a solution

Please respond ASAP. I’m begging you guys. We can’t stand this fucker anymore",16Nov2020,1

206,"Recently, my dad got diagnosed with a mild form of skin cancer that needs to get operated on. The surgery is scheduled for December 7th, and with Covid cases skyrocketing he can't risk getting covid and getting his surgery rescheduled. Meanwhile, I'm scheduled to work at my retail job where we seem to be attracting the no-mask demographic quite a lot. With the holidays coming up it's definitely a given that it's going to get busier where I'm at, which means I'm going to run into more of those wonderful no-maskers. 

I'm considering talking to my manager and getting the days off up until after the surgery. I'm only scheduled on weekends because of college and my internship (which is paid), so it's not like I'd be taking a bunch of time off anyway. I also have a bunch of sick days saved up so there technically wouldn't be a problem there.

The only problem is that it's the holidays, which means that it's getting super busy for everyone and me calling in wouldn't help with that. I like my job for the most part and I would feel bad abandoning my co-workers. I've also had to quarantine since last Saturday (don't worry I've been attending class and my internship remotely), so I feel that if I mention missing work again my manager is going to think that I'm intentionally skipping out on work. 

Am I overthinking this? Should I just suck it up and go to work? Should I call in?

I am a 17 year old male, who is turning 18 in January. I am 5’6” and ~115 pounds. I’ve never really had any reason to not have any self-confidence in myself, i like to think i’m a good person with a warm heart, a killer sense of humor, and contagious laugh. And i know the people who know me can agree with me. The one thing that has kept me from having total confidence in myself, has been my weight. I haven’t really worried about it until i reached high school, and saw all the upperclassman who weren’t as small as myself. I have no shame in the fact that i am below average height, in fact i prefer it that way. But my weight, i know, is not my preference. I have struggled with gaining weight for years and i eat like a horse, with maybe not quite the best diet or appetite at most times. I am planning on buying a gym membership but i know that diet is 90% of the work. What i need is advice on how i can change my diet for the better. I only ask for a vague idea on what i should be eating on a regular basis, but the more specific the better. On a side note, i am not allergic to any food that I know of and my accessibility to food is not an issue. All i need is to find the best way for me to healthfully and steadily gain mass.

I haven't touched studies for the past 6 months.. I know.. We do have online classes but I just waste my time on games or YT and I have tried to motivate myself.. But it is short lived... After 2-3 days I'm back to the same stuff

I play game for like 3-4 hours a day.. And I won't quit that game because I have couple of friends(online) and I feel bad leaving them... Besides I don't have any friends(irl) ..

I blame myself for my fate.. But I was so lost at that time that now i feel it's impossible for me to be motivated 

My parents are wasting say 500 bucks on me every month for my studies and all but even that can't motivate me from studying...

This is the first time that I have noticed another guy after my last relationship and it’s rare for me to be instantly attracted to someone. 

Coincidentally my friend mentioned to me today a guy that she was seeing, had recently just introduced her to his friend, that also happened to work at the same place.  So I asked more about him and it turns out it’s the same guy that I originally saw working the cashier that day. From what she told me, we actually have a lot in common. 

I would like to get to know him more and eventually ask him out on a date. Would it be uncomfortable for him if I asked him out while he is working? Should I just move on with my life?

214,"Im sorry if the barely was offensive but it will be explained below 
I (18f) have been in a relationship with my bf(18m) for about 2 years now. 
Weve been long distance for some of it but other than that I am really in love with this dude. He is funny, sweet, super attractive, loves me back, respectful of me and my boundaries and is an overall sweetheart to no extent. Aka he literally fits myself and my parents criteria for a perfect bf/ husband except for one thing. He is muslim by birth, however he doesn’t practice islam or believe in its teachings. 
Now i come from a very veryyy traditional culture and although its okay to have friends from another religion and stuff like that marrying someone across the religious divide is a huge no no. Since I told my mom about my relationship shes been against it completely and passively pressuring me into breaking up with him or looking for other people or idk basically just like telling me that we should stay friends, granted she has met him and told me if it wasnt for his religion she would have approved completely ( hes very very charming). My dad doesn’t know and when i presented to him this situation as a hypothetical hes said he would disown us basically. I understand why they feel like this, our society basically ostracizes people who marry outside of their religion (im still very involved with our society) and since religious holidays are a big part of our upbringing their scared for our kids and how they would be confused. I know im very young and marriage isn’t something i will be thinking about for at least 7-8 years but im happy and our relationship is really nice and romantic and just basically its easy i feel like im hanging with my bff who i get to kiss yk?

217,"I have a current co-worker who finds it beneficial to throw everyone else under the bus instead of having a team work mentality.

It seems to be paying off for him, he got hired on full-time before people who have been there for about 1 year to 2 years.

If he finds anything wrong with the work that has been performed he automatically turns it into the boss, or makes the situation seem like he’s done something right by making it better even if it’s just something simple. Even though the majority of the work is done by the nightshift guys.

I’ve said that’s not the way to do it, that there should be more communication between him and the other employee. At least notify them personally and if it doesn’t change offer training, and if that doesn’t resolve it then start asking questions.

Ex: “hey I noticed you did this wrong, here’s what you could do to fix it” versus “hey I noticed you did this wrong (there’s a chance I did it wrong but to the bosses I’ll make it seem like you did it) so I’m going to tell our bosses.” He also seems to be making mistakes but won’t tell anyone and will just put a bad view on anyone else he can.

From what I’ve heard hes been making mistakes and blaming it on our 3rd shift guys who do the majority of the work, and have been doing it for years, but somehow it’s still making him look good?

Also our day shift guys are knowledgeable, they really are when it comes to solving problems.
However they have no idea the amount of work the 3rd shift guys face, or what they really do.

Is this just natural workplace politics? A “favorite” per say?

219,"This is an issue I find myself having semi-regularly. I end up in a conversation where my expertise is relevant, but I don’t mention it at the right time. I don’t want to brag, or make the conversation about me, but then later I feel I’ve annoyed them because they’ve been talking to me assuming I’m ignorant and they feel like an idiot when they realize I’m not.

For example
Person: I read this interesting thing about research on X.

Me: Oh, that’s super cool. What did they find?

Person: [very long explanation]

Me: [Follow up question]?

Person: [Another explanation]

Me: I actually teach X at Y university. You might be interested to know [fact I think is interesting].

Person: (awkwardly). Oh. You teach X?

This happens most frequently with men (I am 30F and perhaps don’t “look” like I have a PhD). Sometimes I think that their awkwardness is not my fault because they made assumptions about me. But other times I think that I set them up to look foolish by not mentioning my expertise sooner. When should I mention it? It seems weird to mention it straight away, but if I don’t they normally launch into a long explanation, where they try to teach me my own subject.

It does happen with women too. Yesterday I was introduced to a friend of my boyfriend who is just starting her PhD. I asked her lots of questions about her career and research aspirations, but I didn’t know how or when to mention my own experience. The conversation ended without me mentioning it at all.

Most of my friends say I'm not at fault but I haven't exactly said everything in full detail to just one person so its extremely difficult to tell, which is obviously why I'm posting everything here. I have FAITH that no one I know will find it, but even still if you see this and think you know who it is, please be respectful is all I'm asking. 

First, some context. I (M17) been dating my girlfriend (17) for around 6 months now and I'm really happy. We know each other well and we're just happy to be in a good place with someone now, not looking for anything serious or reading too far into the future. The problem is that my really close friend Jasmine (F18) is kind of in a trio with us, which got awkward pretty fast. I've always felt something towards Jasmine on and off but never wanted to pursue anything with her, at least  while we were still in school. I could see into the future with her and before I started dating my current girlfriend we often joked about having a relationship when we were older. I got the feeling she liked me and I never did shut her down because it just felt nice to be that close and comfortable with someone. When I got into my current relationship I finally really  realized I liked Jasmine like that and tried to shut down my feelings because I truly want to be with Grace (my girlfriend) right now. I only spoke to one friend (Alex) about  it and he said it was fine as long as I didn't act on it. I agreed but it still didn't sit right with me. 

  
I've been having a really rough time at home right now with a lot  of things and just in a very bad place in general. Grace's family is also rough so she often stays at my house or others for days at a time. Also, Jasmine just had to move out of one house and is so stressed and unhappy. I am at my limit really for what I can take since I'm trying to support so many people at once while still trying to take care of myself and have honestly been dealing with it in incredibly unhealthy ways. Again, the only person I speak to that stuff about is Alex. But my story really begins when I shared some of what I had been doing with Jasmine. We have a very physical relationship, so as I was being vulnerable with her she grabbed my face and wiped away my tears. I felt quite weak and knew I shouldn't say anything but I told her, and I quote ""It would be so easy to kiss you right now."", to which she replied, ""I mean, you could if you wanted too."" I felt sick to my stomach and pulled away, telling her I couldn't, but that she knew how I felt about her. She told me she felt the same and I said we were just bound to break each others hearts. We didn't talk about it any more but she seemed kind of? Smug? Almost? I know she wouldn't have meant that but it didn't sit right. 

About two days later I told Grace about it (the two days wait was so she could deal with family stuff, I didn't want to 'hide' it). I told her only that I knew Jasmine liked me, and that it was my fault because I told her she needed to back  away from me, bringing up the whole feelings thing, but nothing else. Grace told me that it was okay and she always felt like I might have feelings for Jasmine even if I didn't know that myself. She asked if I wanted to break up and I said no, ensuring to her that I had no feelings for Jasmine at all, at least anymore. I also found out that Grace KNEW Jasmine liked me because Jasmine used to ask her and another friend advice on the subject. When I asked Grace out, Jasmine even originally told Grace to back off, before realizing she was wrong and giving Grace the 'all clear'. That made me very uncomfortable.

I finally decided to speak to Jasmine more and told her that I told her that Grace knew. She told me I was a d\*ck for playing down my feelings for her because she knew how much I loved her and that I shouldn't have said anything (which I agree with but hey I can't take it back, if I could, I would). She then told me she wanted to spend the rest of her life with me and she would marry me right now if I asked her to. This made me feel pressured and claustrophobic. Every person I've spoken to agreeds that I have every right to feel suffocated by that. I really didn't respond to this and we kept going like nothing had happened. But it did and I feel weird. Turns out, she spoke to Alex and he told her everything that  I had said to him, which was why she said most of that, but it  still felt too real. We're only 17 and I have no idea what I want. When I told Alex anything it was often really overdramatic just to get it off my chest. Now I even feel suffocated just sitting next to her, I get this sick feeling in my stomach and it's hard to talk to her so I told her I needed space. She freaked out at this and apologized and said she really needs me just as a friend but I can barely be in the same room as her anymore. She got very dramaticized and I told Grace about it and she reckons maybe Jasmine has some attachment issues with our friendship, which I agree with and so does Alex and just other friends who have noticed that she does ANYTHING for our friendship.

But then I learned from Alex that the reason Jasmine is having it really rough is that she's been kicked out of not  one, but both of her houses and is failing out of school and now has to stay with her grandma. I'm not sure she'd do anything really stupid but I'm still worried for her and she needs someone to be there for her, yet for our friendship I think I need to break her heart and take MONTHS of space. I know she's gonna react poorly but I just feel like I can't even help her because I have so much on. My house is her only safe space but I just don't think I can deal with her or her issues right now as horrible as that sounds and I'm not sure what the right thing to do is. I feel like an a\*s, especially since it's my fault this happened in the first place. I shouldn't have done that to Grace or Jasmine and I can't even complain about the situation because I'm the one who created it. Alex said he'd take care of Jasmine if I had to walk away and I think a break would be so good for both of us but maybe there's a better option? Is space best? Should I suck it up and try and be a better friend? We spend all our time together so this is a huge deal. I'll take any advice you can give, even if its just you telling me I'm a d\*uche or I'm in the wrong. Thanks for reading and I'll update if I get any comments.",16Nov2020,1
234,"Hi! This is my first post ever so I’m sorry if my formatting is weird for the platform. 

I (F18) have been dating my girlfriend (F18) for a few months. We met in college and she has recently gone home for Thanksgiving. 

Since, being home she’s expressed to me how she “feels over it.” She feels trapped at home because her sister, who has a severe drug problem, isn’t allowed to be left alone. Apparently, her sister was recently given more freedom but had another “incident” about a week ago hence my girlfriend stays with her. 

I might be looking to much into it, but she’s said some troubling things. Nothing crazy, just things like “I never find joy in anything” and “I don’t want to do anything ever.” She’s always been a pretty introverted person, the type that prefers to stay in instead of go out, had a smaller group of friends, etc. However, even when she has the opportunity to do things she likes, she opts out to stay in bed. 

I’ve struggled with depression, so this seems like a red flag of lower mental health. I’ve expressed concern and suggested talking to online therapists, but she just brushes off my suggestions. 

Basically: 1. Is my girlfriend actually okay and I’m just being crazy? 2. If she is struggling, how can I help her?",16Nov2020,1

At the same time, when I showed my roommate my $6,800 credit card statement he was utterly shocked. ""I've never made that much money"". I just don't understand how I spend so much money without having any flashy tastes.

All with the help of my bf ofc.

HOWEVER my room contains my dog [dog bed, and my bed also smells like dog when unclean], 2fish tanks [5g and 15g], and a hamster of which is in a pretty big space of my room [he stinks like a mf when it's time to change bedding].

245,"TDLR: middle school staff was racist, turned a blind eye towards intense bullying, refused to give earned credits. 

This starts back in eight grade. I was a straight A student in advanced classes. I was being bullied to a rather extreme extent. I had my ID (can’t enter campus without it) and supply bag stolen, laptop stolen (they looked up guns and porn on it to get me in trouble), and water thrown on top of me while using the restroom. I also had a full tube of glitter poured in my ear while sleeping in a class I was ahead in. Someone poured milk over my lunch and mixed it all up while I was in the restroom (I was on free lunch, only one serving, so no extras).  

My counselor left me in her office for 3 hours to get lunch and change clothes when I was talking to her about the bullying. My mother tried to contact the administrators for 2 months and they avoided her. My mom eventually texted one on my bullies telling her to back off. My counselor proceeded to tell my mom to stay out of it and that it wasn’t any of her business. 

An administrator eventually said they would put me on a no contact agreement, but never actually did, only switched my schedule around. The students who were bullying me were favorited because they came from wealthy families/were related to staff. They received no punishment despite having most bullying on camera. 

I was eventually sent to in school suspension for having a vape on campus (I was fixing it for someone and dropped it, no one knew it was mine, I confessed and the teacher offered to forget about it and throw it away. I could not afford to replace it so I took punishment). While in suspension, the teacher refused to let me, the only white student in the room, speak. Every other student could talk and walk around class, and take multiple bathroom breaks. I was not allowed to do so. 

Considering the administration department was avoiding my mother, and refusing to handle the bullying, I was withdrawn 14 days before the end on the semester. The school refused to give me credits even though I had no missing work and straight A’s. 

How would you have dealt with this?",16Nov2020,1
246,"I'm currently at college, in-state, so the travel to see my family or my friends wouldn't be too far. I also will be getting tested for covid weekly from now until the week after Thanksgiving and have no issue self-isolating before/after gatherings with others.

The main problem with my family is that my dad is mentally unwell and both his politics and pandemic denial has made him difficult to talk to. He had been actively trying to intimidate and harm others leading up to the election, and I feel unsafe around him for other reasons. I don't know if I should be there to support him, as I'll be ""going home"" for an extended winter break and I expect that to be difficult, too.

My best friends have invited me over, yet I'm entirely dependent on them for a ride to/from their house.

I can't bring my cat with me, either, as they have pets of their own and my cat isn't well socialized.

251,"On mobile so excuse the shit that comes with it.

I finally got a job. After weeks of BS I finally got one at a factory where I would be working as an assistant.

I sensed a red flag before I began work. On Wednesday my interviewer (who was Asian) asked 0 questions, only if I could start immediately. I answered yes. Then I began work on  Thursday, the day after. Is that normal?
She had told me I was going into a workplace that was very multicultural and that they were mostly Asian and didn't speak English well. I thought that was ok, but odd. I was also told I would be moved around until I found a suitable spot for me to work.

Every last one of the other employees were ALL Asian, not a single white person was there except ya boy. No, I'm not exaggerating or being racist. I was even told I was the only Australian working in the factory... Located in Australia. Literally everyone I spoke to, I had to ask them to repeat themselves because I just couldn't understand. Everyone had migrated from all different locations in Asia.

My first day I was tasked with essentially helping one of the team leaders, who was actually a decent person and one of the few who spoke English fluently. First day I did everything as asked, and made no mistakes except for minor things. I asked for feedback at the end of the shift and he said I was ok, and that I'll get the hang of it, but I should be a little faster. The day consisted of bagging large rolls of the product, cutting, filling large bins with raw material and moving products to where it needed to be.

The second day I was moved and was tasked with packing pallets. I was introduced to some old guy with God awful breath, and we would spend the day together as he taught me. Everything he taught, I took on board and learned quickly. Whenever he told me to do something, I did it immediately. It was simple. enough stuff. I kept up with his pace and was waiting for new instructions and asking questions pretty much the whole day. He told me tomorrow that he would just watch me, and not do anything.

Third and final day and I had to ask my team leader from the first day where he was. He called the person who attended the interviewer and I when I was supplying my info, akd she informed me that he was working on something else, and that I would have to work the machine by myself. She asked if I was ok with that. I said something like ""I know the basics,  but..."" she interjected and got the person who taught me yesterday over for a total of 10 minutes. He looked a bit annoyed by me. Basically he just told me ""This is what you do for the day. Any questions, come see me.""

I did what was asked of me for 1.5 hours, and finished 10 minutes before first break, so I had nothing else to do. I wanted more stuff to do. The last 2 minutes I was called on to do some more bagging, at a different station, with new people. Alrighty, here we go again.

For my last 2 hours, I was stuck bagging and delivering again. I worked (from my pov) at the rate of the other workers. And did what was needed by me again. Boring and monotonous but whatevs. Last 2 minutes before break, I was told I'd be working with another person yet again. He was basically going to be a replacement for the guy who never showed up, but he spoke horrendous English. 

Anywho doesnt matter because after break, I was told to come in for a talk. Apparantly I hadn't been up to pace, and was told not continue work. The ""only"" reason was that my pace wasnt fast enough. I can tell you what happened,  but thats the gist of it.

All 3 days I was moved around, never given the chance to get settled in. I worked with non-native English speakers, no one wanted to really help me, nor was I EVER told any feedback. Oh and it's my 3rd day. The thing about not being fast enough? Oh fuck you. I was working as fast as I was being taught under the conditions. I did everything asked immediately, and oft times was waiting for new things to do.

Idk. I thought I was getting good. Apparently I was slow. I thought you were supposed to be lenient on your first damn week. 

Am I insane to think that this is BS, or was it literally just a case of me being slow... on my first fucking week",16Nov2020,1
252,"I actively try and mitigate my depression with exercise, eating right, and therapy... but sometimes I still fall into these deep depressive episodes where I just want to be alone and get incredibly negative (which I'm fully aware of). I never want to subject anyone I love to that side of me and find myself dropping off the face of the earth (not replying to phone calls or texts).

I've talked to my friends and family about these periods before, am fully transparent with when it's happening, and how they should navigate it (i.e., my emptiness has nothing to do with them, I appreciate them caring but I will reach out if I need anything, they can still contact me if something's wrong and I'll be sure to respond).

However, I still find 2 friends of mine who have sent me texts in the last two days with something to the effect of them acknowledging I'm having an episode, don't want me to change a thing but expressing that they miss me as a friend and find these periods difficult because they fear I'll ghost them if they reach out to me for help. They also acknowledge they can find other places for support but wanted to share these feelings with me because they want to make sure I'm ok. These kinds of texts make me feel fucking terrible and selfish which I think to a degree I am being. I think it's fair that they feel this way, but in my eyes, they'd feel even worse if I took out any of my negativity on them while I was going through it if that makes sense. And that's exactly what i'm trying to avoid.

I'd 100% be there and hold space for them if I knew they were having a hard time... but if they're just sending me memes and short ""Hey how are you"" texts, I find it difficult to respond.

I used to cut people out but I'm trying to be better. More accountable. At the same time though, I really thought openly communicating my mental state + discussing what my expectations are and the expectations of the other person prior to these episodes would've helped.

253,"I’ve been dating this guy for two n a half years, we’re both college students now and we hardly have any time for each other. I probably see him once every 2-3 months on average, occasionally sooner. I’m always willing to put my job and school work aside to see him, talk to him, or call him. But when I ask for him to call he’ll just tell me he’s too busy with homework; when I can work on my homework on the phone just fine. And since this is really our only form of seeing each other is video calling(it doesn’t help that we both lack licenses, regardless I have a group of friends that’s always willing to take us out, but he’s still too busy). But he also lives in a very strict household where his mom is overbearing and controls everything he does. He’s a nineteen year old man and his mom takes his phone away or turns off the internet if her “kids” stay up too late. So sometimes asking to do something in a household like that is toxic and stressful, which I understand. But it makes me feel like I’m not worth it, you know? Like I’m not worth arguing over your mom for. Like I’m not worth the effort that it takes to come see me.
I’m willing to give up anything or do anything for him, but I feel like he wouldn’t do the same. Because of this, do I lack self respect for my own goals? Like, I’ve never loved anyone I do like this guy, he’s my everything. We have similar beliefs, we love video games and anime, he’s also so attentive and kind when he isn’t making excuses, and when I do speak my mind he always listens and apologizes that he doesn’t have time for me, and tells me he’ll do better. I know that I’m young, and it’s probably childish to be like “oh well I don’t think I’ll love anyone like I do this guy” or feel like I’ll never love again—I’m also afraid that’s toxic. I’m so afraid for being wrong??
Like, is it wrong that I would do anything for this guy? Does that mean I lack self respect or character? Does that makes me “obsessive”? I know I could live without him but I don’t want to. I feel like no matter what he does, I’ll still love him. I guess I just want validation in my own feelings, and that I’m not wrong for feeling like this.",16Nov2020,2

TW // depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts 

Every night my mom wakes up around 12am-ish, picks a fight (usually ends up with screaming which wakes my dad up which makes it 10x worse) with my younger sister (we are both late night people) to insult her, tell her she’s not trying hard enough at school, trying to punish her/take her phone away and ends up making her cry.

I get up every-time this happens, i talk to her calmly and tries to reason with her. It usually works, but that doesn’t stop the stress of it all. She will say things like:
“oh i’m such a bad mother”
“i’m a horrible person”
“fine i’ll just kms”
“i’ll just leave you here with your father, since he’s a better parent”
i know these are manipulative tactics. I’ve called her out on it. she just plays the victim card.

After i intervene, she gets in my face/grabs my arm harshly/holds a fist up to me and tells me to mind my business. She has slapped my sister across the face once but it’s rare to get physical with her.

I tell her afterwards every single time that what she’s doing is wrong, she apologizes to me (not my sister), and she says she’s gonna stop. 

But then the cycle repeats the next day or the day after. I feel like i’m in a constant circle of hell. I’ve been diagnosed with anxiety and mild depression, as a 17 year old. The constant arguing works me up and makes me really sick/cause panic attacks, and my mother knows this. She’s been diagnosed with both as well.

Even though I may be hurting from this, I worry immensely about my sister (15). Don’t get me wrong, she isn’t perfect. She’s mouthy and backtalks like most teenagers do. I think she may also be depressed (she shows a lot of symptoms) as well.

Anyway, the day after these fights she will pretend like nothing happened and wonders why we are mad at her. My dad is aware of what she does, he gets woken up by it a lot. He doesn’t care. As much as I still love them both, i can’t bare this any longer.

Is there literally anything i can do?

I have molded my life plan around this. Im going to attend a community college for two years (to allow my sister to age to 18) so I won’t have to leave her here by herself. I’ll probably have to find an apartment near the college i’ll transfer to when she’s 18 and bring her with me &amp; support us both.

257,"I'm a junior in high school (female) and I struggle with both depression and anxiety on a pretty regular basis. My appetite has been really off lately and my sleep schedule is an absolute mess. I had kept the anxiety pretty secret until I had an anxiety attack during quarantine and they found out. About a week after they found out, my heart rate shot through the roof out of the blue and I went to the emergency room. They didn't find anything out during that time. Not even after I had gone to the doctor and gotten a 30 monitor for it. So I'm really good at worrying my parents and disappointing them at this point. 

I haven't gotten the results from the monitor and it's been almost 3 months. I'm getting tired of having these freak spikes in my heart rate with no explanation. And on top of that, I have body aches and random pain that comes and goes. It makes no sense and it's obviously not serious if the pain doesn't stay. My family is usually struggling financially, so I don't ask to go to the doctor. Not to mention the fact that he doesn't even take me seriously. So I'm beyond frustrated. 

I've been finding myself contemplating hurting myself, just so that I have an actual legitimate reason for being miserable and in pain. Then I wouldn't feel crazy or like I was overreacting if I went to get a knife cut or a broken bone checked by a medical professional. And then I wouldn't have to freak out over something that may or may not be real. 

The only thing is, I know I shouldn't be having these thoughts. I know they aren't healthy and that I should get help... But I don't want to put anymore strain on my family. I don't want them to have to pay for anything else because I can't handle it and I don't want them to have to worry about me or be disappointed in me anymore. I haven't hurt myself yet, but I honestly don't know how long that will last because I think about it more and more often.

265,"For a little background my friend (F16), I’ll call her Emily, has germaphobia and contamination OCD which has only been made worse by Covid. 

Her parents, her mom in particular has never been the best at helping with Emily’s anxiety but with everythings that happened its so much worse.

Emily’s grandma is currently getting tested for Covid, and while they wait for the test results, Emily doesn’t want anybody in the family to be around other people. Her mom thinks she is overreacting and telling Emily how selfish she is. Meanwhile, Emily’s mom hasn’t been taking proper Covid precautions, by not wearing a mask or social distancing around a recovering cancer patient or her friend that is a nurse and works in the ER. This really upsets Emily who now feels its her responsibility to keep her family safe.

Emily and her mom get into giant arguments. Emily’s mom screams, cries, stomps, and bangs things, and never listens to what Emily has to say. Instead, she guilt trips Emily, ranting about how she has done everything for the family and how ungrateful she is. This forces Emily to blame herself for everything in order to get her mom to calm down. She feels she can never voice her thoughts without her mom screaming at her. She is even starting to convince herself that she’s the problem. Basically, Emily’s mom is emotionally abusive and constantly gaslighting her. Her Dad always takes her mom’s side.

All this has caused Emily to start self harming. She is not suicidal and already sees a therapist. She feels she cannot completely confide in her therapist because the therapist will tell her mom. There are no other adults in her life she can turn to. 

I try to support her the best I can but I just feel helpless and I don’t know what to do.",16Nov2020,2

Bought myself a nice truck and have just been saving money since. I have a girlfriend of almost 3 years who’s in school for education. We’re both what you’d consider country people and both have agreed we’d like to live on an acreage one day. 

About a month ago I was casually looking on a buy and sell page and found 80 acres of land for sale for $170k CAD. At this point I had thought I wouldn’t seriously considered buying anything for at least the next year to save up some money but this one stood out to me. I sat on it for a couple of weeks and decided to message the seller. I went to look at it with my girlfriend and her parents as we all liked it.  It’s pretty much everything I’d ever want for land, utilities are close and just need hookups, and there’s a perfect spot to build a house. 

So here’s where I need advice. It’s everything I’d ever want but I don’t feel ready to buy it. I feel like if I found it in a year I’d have no problem buying it. It’s not really that I can’t afford it, I have the 10% down payment required if I go through an agricultural loaner. I just don’t feel ready but I’m also scarred of passing up on it and not finding something as good. I’m not really sure what to do next. Should I get it even though I’m not sure I’m ready to make such a big decision or wait and hope I find something as good later? Any advice is appreciated.

I (36F) have been in pain for about three years, and despite following doctors advice, physio, massage, chiropractor, the pain has only gotten worse. The only way to keep the pain under control is to either be in bed, or in an anti-gravity lawn chair. I’ve now been on short term disability for 3 1/2 months, and I’m facing the prospect of having to go on long term disability. I love my job and I miss it.  I also miss exercising, hiking, rock climbing, running, cycling, playing on the floor with my nephews, gardening, and living my active life. My SO has had to do all of the laundry, cooking, cleaning, yard work, and I’m so thankful for this but I can tell it’s wearing on him. I have a consult with a neurosurgeon, but it won’t be for a year due to wait times, however the sports medicine doctor I’ve been seeing says I likely won’t be a candidate for surgery. I’ve had 6 cortisone injections and ablation, and tried almost every NSAID with no relief. Opiates help, but due to how long term this injury has been, I’m terrified of getting addicted.  We recently made the difficult decision of putting having a family on hold. I’ve had 5 previous miscarriages and my pain medications will affect fertility. We want to adopt an older child or a sibling group, but due to the likely special needs, I will need to be healthy.

Small things can throw me off, and I don't really like being touched at times. I could provide a lot more information but I will try to keep it short.

I have taken classes up to Calc II and Classical Physics I (plus some other pre-engineering courses) and I have recently been wondering whether or not I want to keep pursuing Engineering. Looking at how much they get paid is not very significantly higher than other jobs in my area and also how much time and effort I am putting into my classes (Super late nights, having homework 24/7, less social life) may not be worth it.

A bit of background, I have been at my job for a bit over 2 years now. Many horizontal movement but nothing upwards. I'm paid hourly, schedule is 9 hour work days 7-5 (1 hour lunch break). I got assigned to a team that used to consist of 1 boss and 7 employees, now it's down to 5 and the boss has no plans on staffing. I do really good at my job, I like to be efficient with my work. Thus a lot more has been put on my plate.

Now the issue is I feel extremely burnt out. The workload has increased, I'm not getting paid more. We're also expected to have weekly on call rotation which was not written as an expectation in my contract. I'm not paid for the time I'm on call except for when I'm responding. I have brought up how it's unreasonable for non-salary employees to have to be on call from 5pm-10pm and weekends. My boss said you have to learn to accommodate and adapt. When I said was was feeling stressed and burnt out, their response was ""I can recommend you a therapist"". 

I technically have enough saved up so I could live for a year without a job (I've calculated my monthly expenses). My family is really against me quitting without another job lined up because they don't want me digging into my savings and the gap in employment would hurt my resume. They say if I can wait until I've been with them for 3 years, I would have an easier time getting another job. I'm just not sure what I should do.

Ok, so I’m willing to spend a little over $3k. However the most I’d want to do is maybe $3400, I’m also considering the $300 for FCPX. Black Friday and Cyber Monday are coming so I know I’ll save a little. I work 30+ hour weeks and I live at home, but I’m still concerned about spending so much. All this is in Australian Dollars

Which Mac?

The MacBook Pro 2019 16"" Core i9 1TB with Touch Bar is currently $4200. Then I’d need another $300 for FCPX. 

Or: The MacBook Pro 13.3"" 2.0GHz 1TB 4 x Thunderbolt 3 $3200

306,"I dont know where my life goes to. Im 21yo male engineering student.

Lets start with education. I was in one of the best highschool in my country but i ended up not so great university. Its still good but not where people expect from me. People expected me to be in first 20k, i was in first 80k. Not problem for me tho i didnt study that much but there was a university i wanted to go, i missed it to close. I felt bad. Anyway engineering was where i wanted to be. First semester was pretty good actualy i was so excited all those tools and stuff, cables. Then i lost my excitement and ended up failing one year on under 1,8 GPA, so i lost 1 year. I dont feel any excitement about my classes even tho theyre interesting. I cant even study for exams. I actually like creating lab. reports but thats all.  I wanna go outside work in Germany/France but it seems my gpa will hold me. I wanna be an ocean enginner. I was taking diving lessons on my university with student community. I took all the lessons, passed the theoratical exam. Only thing left was practice exam but i ended up not showing up anymore. I had friends there but i dont even know why i didnt go.

Friends, i only have 1 friend in university. Im not actually socially broken. I have too much friends on my hometown. With pandemic we see themselves a lot. I actually consider myself friendly but i cant make any friends with my class, i dont know theyre all like childs. I cant hangout with them, not having fun with them. Quite cringing while with them. I have only one friend in university and we only see each other on classes. Its fine tho we re helping each other hes older than us but i would like to friends with hangout you know maybe  go a bar together. I might have friends in student community where i take diving lessons, they were too nice to me but when i stopped showing up theyre all gone. I dont have a girlfriend like for 6years, i dont consider myself ugly or socially broken, but the last 3 girls i date didnt end well. I felt like theyre contradict themselves a lot. They were showing too much anger to stuff i do, but when they did same thing it was okey. I was asking them a lot ""youre acting like that but when i do that its not okey?"" and when they said yes, okey we re done.

Main problem, i dont feel excitement for anything. Its not something new its like continues like a year or two. Not for my classes. Not for diving. I was a handball player in highschool it ends too. I was painting with acrylic not doing it anymore. I actually like learning new launguages i was learning french but not anymore. I wanna play violin or electro guitar but im not feeling starting. I was learning HTML/PHP and making projects (this is how i like to learn, i make myself a goal and i learn through it), not anymore. Im even thinking freezing school and going for military service maybe that will get my brain up.

What should i do to feel excited again?

310, So 1 month ago i lost my virginity to older woman who is very nice. I was very nervous because i am a introvert (really bad one). i have had sex with her now 18 times and i did use every time a blue bill to get ready for the act because i would always stress. I did read that the pill might cause longer stamina during sex but last night i did not need the pill (which was a nice confidence boost) and we did start having sex. After 3 hours i was no where near getting the feeling (im going to cum) so i had to force my self to get that feeling and finish because it was starting to annoy me.I am happy that im not a (minute man) but i dont think being able to last 3 hours is normal either.Any reddit users with same problem or know someone with this problem ?,16Nov2020,3

314,"So my best friend struggles with mental illness that has gotten him into a bit of bad situations. By this, I mean he has sexually gotten (or attempted to get) with every single close friend of his who is under his realm of sexuality. I can think of 4 of his best friends now that, within 1.5 years, he’s been with beyond just being friends. This is usually under his initiation, and I know this because I have been equally close friends with the other person in every situation. I know he just views these things as casual, meaningless sex, but this trend of behavior has rubbed many of the people at the other end the wrong way. And rightfully so. He gets angry and upset when anyone points out this behavior and personally I think it’s fucked with two of our friends (that hes fucked) emotions heavily. I don’t understand how he can’t recognize that this behavior pattern may seem concerning and abnormal, especially to our friends that have been at the other end (all of whom know eachother well). I don’t understand why this happens and I don’t know what to say to him about any of it because I’m in an uncomfortable position, as i know and recognize that this is happening and is hurting people, but do not want to only further worsen his negative emotions when it’s addressed.",16Nov2020,1

316,"For some background, I'm a student in my twenties so my budget is very tight. I had been driving my a car owned by my ex-partner, but a couple months ago I had to exit that relationship quite quickly and was scrambling to find a replacement vehicle during under a lot of pressure and high emotions. I ended up buying a 2003 Honda Civic from Craigslist, and it has already caused me a host of problems. It was not the right decision but c'est la vie.

I had to make some repairs on the car quite soon after buying it, and I had found this mechanic who works from his garage at home, and charges a cheaper rate. I was decently happy with the work he did and was able to save a bit of money by purchasing the parts myself at an auto parts store, and having him do the work.

Recently, my car had a \*major\* issue, completely breaking down on the highway (it had a blown headgasket). I brought the car to this guy, and he quoted me $700 in labour. He then sent me out for  $724 worth of parts. After he installed those parts, he realized the issue still wasn't fixed and sent me for another $269 worth of parts. After that, there was still an issue, so I bought another $200 of parts. After spending $1193 in parts, he tells me that the car still won't start, and he doesn't think it's wise to keep experimenting and getting further down the hole, because the car is starting to look like a write off. The parts are NON-REFUNDABLE now that they've been put in. 

My initial plan was to have the car towed to a legitimate shop that I trust, and have them assess the situation and tell me how much more I would need to put in to get the car back running. Worst case scenario, I'll take the car and try to sell it for parts, since these parts are all brand new.

Here's the problem: this guy is still trying to charge me for the labour. He dropped it from the original $700 to $500, but still expects me to pay this. I'm beside myself, because had I gone to a regular shop, if they couldn't fix the car they wouldn't expect me to pay for anything other than a bit of labour for their time! I'm already out so much money for just the parts, I don't want to pay labour on top of that. I feel like the situation was handled completely badly on his part, and he should have let me know a lot sooner that he was having a hard time determining the root of the issue.

Obviously it goes without saying that I made mistakes on several levels, including using this mechanic in the first place. I guess I'm just looking for any input or advice on how this might be handled. Is it one of those situations where the right thing to do is suck it up and pay him? Or does this sound like a situation where I'm being totally taken advantage of?

Thank you so much for any help, I appreciate it so much!",16Nov2020,1
320,"Hi there. Basically the title, but I'll add a lot of backstory.

So I (17f) used to be really close to this girl I'll call A. From the ages of like 6-12 we were best friends, and then she moved away and we slowly grew apart. However, we still kept in touch from time to time, and follow each other on Instagram. I've also seen her mom a few times in the last couple years, and we semi keep in touch.


There was also a time when I let her and a friend of hers stay at my house for a weekend, and she really used me and disrespected my family's boundaries that weekend. However, I didn't tell her that I felt that it was rude, cuz I'm not confrontational. I do think my mom spoke to her mom about what happened, so she probably knew that we were pissed at her and her friend anyway. Basically she hasn't been a great friend to me for a while. 


A little over a year ago, my mom passed away. I'm Jewish, and so we kept to the laws of Shiva. If you're unfamiliar with it, it's basically a week of mourning in which the immediate family of the deceased person sit on low stools, and don't really leave the house. Their friends and family come to their aid for food and help around the house. It's customary for friend of the mourners to visit during this time. 


I had posted about my mom's passing on instagram, so that I could share my grief, and write about my mom a bit.


A number of people commented, expressing their condolences - even people I hardly knew at any time in my life. A number of them also privately messaged me. But A didn't say anything. And she had known my mother, has spent many nights and days at my house when we were kids. I also was visited by many people. Including A's mother. A's mom and my mom had actually kept in touch, as they were friends. I had thought A might go with her mother to visit me, but she didn't. 


I know that she had no obligation to message me or visit, and I feel bad for even expecting her to, but this is how I feel. I'm still hurt by it. She still hasn't spoken to me at all since then.


Anyway, she always posts that thing on her story that's like ""ask me a question"". Sometimes I send a stupid one in to kind of reach out, and she used to post ones I sent in sometimes, but then stopped. That's probably just coincidental though. I want to know: would it be weird and dramatic of me to message into this question thing asking why she didn't visit or message? Is that immature? Should I just message her in DMs, and not just passive-aggresively respond? Should I not say anything cuz this is stupid?? If I should message her directly, what should I say?? Idk. I just need some advice (hence me posting this here lol).",16Nov2020,2
321,"I literally feel like a void. I have no want to do anything. I have no use for myself. I feel so so fucking useless. I give people everything. I give the ones I love all of me. I never get the same back tho, literally everyone I love and prioritize puts someone or something before me. I  struggle with accepting the fact that someone can’t always be there for me 24/7. I have no mental image. I don’t even see myself as a person unless I’m contributing to someone else. I’m so sad all the fucking time. I’m an alcoholic, I hate myself for it but nothing else calms my fucking anxiety and it doesn’t even work all the time. I don’t have a job. My parents have been trying to get me hired on where they work but their supervisor literally does not care, and I’ve pointed that out. They refuse the idea of me moving on and working somewhere else so I’m literally stuck at home making no money and my mom pays for everything including my addiction. I’m too much of a pussy to kill myself but I just genuinely do not see a future. I never have and I don’t even know how I made it this far because I’m so fucking pathetic and can’t even take care of myself. I’m not looking to cause a pity party I just genuinely have no one to talk to and no one to give me advice on what the fuck to do with myself or my life.

323,"In 2017, I had shared a class with the most beautiful girl I had ever seen and met. I got to know her and we became pretty good friends, and since I first saw her in the beginning of that school year, I had a huge crush on her. It was amazing how we had a lot in common, as we chatted about stuff like movies, Star Wars, the MCU, and how Paul Rudd never ages.

She was almost like my soulmate, I gratefully even got her number and had her Snapchat, but it ended after I regretfully bothered her on the app having her block me. We even spent Grad Nite at Disneyland together and gratefully graduated together, we spoke a bit that Summer. I had moved away and decided to call her and we reconnected a bit and chatted for half an hour, she told me that she missed me which caused me to tell her all of the feelings I had for her in the time I’ve gotten to know her.

She even said she felt like we had a connection, which had touched my heart as I thought she saw me as some nobody nerd who was obsessed with Chris Evans. It then ended in me telling her I loved her, which had her hesitantly reply that she loved me, but I know that I had scared her off. All of 2019 and 2020 I’ve had nothing but regret over telling her how I felt about her and learned she has a boyfriend who is so much better than me and lives as a sign that I’ll never have her as he’s a perfectly working car where as I’m an identical car that’s missing the steering wheel, tires, and the battery.

But she won’t get out of my head as I miss her as much as I miss David Bowie, even though I never met him, or miss her as much as Paul McCartney misses John Lennon. I called her in early 2020, but she hung up after she heard my name again as I was calling and pretended as if the shit that happened on that day never did. I feel like that was one event she’ll personally look back at as an awful event of 2020, as much as COVID, or Kobe Bryant and Chadwick Boseman dying were terrible for everyone in 2020.

I just miss her so much that I see her in my dreams sometimes and wish I can see her again as she changed my life and made me happy, even if we can’t be a couple, having her as a friend is better than not getting to see her again. I even wrote multiple drafts of an apology letter and made a playlist of songs that remind me of her or that I’d think she’d like on my iTunes and Spotify. I want to let her know that I’m so sorry for the bad shit between us as I know that it was all my doing, also to give me closure so I can feel better with myself, and for me to truly let it go. I also don’t think I can as I had an anxiety attack when I thought I saw her one time as I fear she’d get me arrested for what I did to her.

TL;DR: I had a crush on a beautiful girl, but i scared her off after telling her my feelings for her and I wish I could see her again to apologize to her and get closure, but I’m afraid of how she’ll react when she sees me again. But I just miss her and want closure for us to move on and hopefully just be friends in the future.",16Nov2020,1
324,"So some backstory, my mom and dad are divorced (seems to be the norm nowadays) 

I’ve lived with my dad for over 12 years without ever seeing my mom, my little brother and older sister. I’m 16 now, (male) and I don’t have any family over here that I actually like. My sister over here has her own family now and never even sees me any more and she’s the only one I can semi stand. Me and dad are always at each others throats. He’s currently unemployed, doesn’t wanna live, and partially blamed me. 

So let’s clear stuff up, I wasn’t doing good at school and my dad suggested I should contact my mom to move with her, and of course I was excited at the thought. I talked to her and, when I told my dad he seemed surprised. For about another week I was constantly being shit talked. I stopped doing chores and he didn’t let me eat and locked me out of the house and so I called up some friends and they picked me up. I was told by an elder man to seek help from the cops or something like that so I did. I was just taken back to the house the next day and super pissed. So of course I got harsher over time and he got older. Now he claims to have a broken spirit. I live in Nebraska and mom lives somewhere in Missouri. I can drive but don’t have a car or anyone to take me. I wanna meet my brother and have a long chat with mom about life and catch up with my sister. I wanna live there and do all the things i should be doing as a teenager I’ve missed for a while now. Where I’m at now, I’m just losing myself.. if that makes sense

325,"My little sister stole from me recently in a series of events and I am done. To give you a little back story my sister admitted to me that she flushed my weed down the toilet and dropped my brand new necklace in there as well, at the time we were at the bus stop (went out to buy some dank) when she told me this. I asked if it was all of my pre rolled joints and she said she wasn’t sure. She asked earlier if she could have some weed, and knowing her addictive personality I was hesitant. I didn’t want to be a dick and bring up her really messed up past when it come to weed, but I also didn’t want her to go out, steal from my mom and buy weed from  a drug dealer (something she’s done before). 

When I came home all of it was gone, and it was a lot, I usually have a bunch to last me 3 months since I take one puff when I do smoke. Anyways, when I came home and seen all the weed I stashed gone I was salty. I didn’t really say much and talked to her abt the next day. That day I decided to roll two joints when I noticed that my 2g where gone, I asked her abt it and she really had nothing to say, first denying it then admitting that she took some when I backed her into a corner. 

I was not surprised and felt betrayed, when she does stuff like this I try to do the right thing and talk to her instead of letting emotions run me. I came home from the gym to find 1/2 joints gone, I text her she tell me she did it for no reason and that’s that. When she gets home she’s nice to me while I watch TV and throughout the next day acts friendly when I’ve told her before how I felt when she steals. I cuss her out and tell myself, fuck it. 

I bought her furniture from Ikea for our room, I eat out with her and I’m always supporting her goals and hobbies. She wants to start hiking I hike with her, she wants to do good in school and start studying, I help her. My mom told me not to do it but I’m selling the shit I got her. 

This isn’t the first or last time she stole from me or my mom. I’m going to hide my shit better, out of my own room. I get her expensive gifts, I respect her privacy, I’ve stolen from her ONCE 2 yrs ago. I’m tired of her bullshit, she goes out past midnight with no text, forcing my mom and I to look for her for hours. My mom is an angel and she really tries her best, today my sister took her phone and left. It’s not fair that we have to hide all of our valuables, and can’t keep cash around, but we do it anyways because we love her. 

It’s clear to me she isn’t willing to change and my mom has contemplated sending her to rehab. My sister has done xanax, shrooms, lsd, perks and who knows what else. I want to be selfish and sell everything I got her, she leaves me with these emotions and seems to hold or feel nothing. 

What should I do? Will she hate me forever for selling her stuff? How can I help her? What do I say? I’ve read about stoicism and have applied it to my life, but on this situation when I care so deeply for my sister wellbeing, how else i am suppose to react?",16Nov2020,2

327,"Hi guys :)

I hope you guys could take the time to just read this story and help me out, it won't take too much of your time I promise.

Two years ago, out of sheer curiosity, I joined a Discord server with a few people I met online. It was a cool server full of like-minded people my age except for one person (of which I will not expose his real name so let's just call him Parker) who was 31 years old at the time and I was 15. Parker was charismatic, nice, caring, and always complimented me which gave me a real confidence boost. He also had a semi-successful music career and a very manipulative personality. At the time, being the dumb 15-year-old I was, I found it really cool that an older figure was taking interest in me and so I unwittingly ignored all the obvious red flags he was showing. He complimented my body and said things that were blatantly sexual but would say that he was joking since I wasn't 16 yet (he was Canadian and with the age of consent being 16 in Canada, it went against his ""morals""). At the time I honestly saw no harm in his ""jokes"".

However, the moment I turned 16, everything changed. The things he was saying didn't seem like jokes anymore and with this newfound awareness of his intentions and words, I felt extremely trapped. He had said things like ""I want to touch your a\*\*"" and ""Damn, you have a nice a\*\*"". He also saved photos of me of when I was a toddler as well as ones where I was in suggestive poses, which were not inherently sexual, but he used them in a way that was.  He never took no for an answer and never cared if he made me uncomfortable. Yet, what really killed me was when he asked if he could touch my a\*\* and I said no, he said that if he got me drunk, my answer would change. 

He was everyone's friend and no one saw the harm it was doing to me. After months of constant torture, I went MIA from the server and didn't talk to anyone for months. 

This was my very first non-platonic interaction with a person of the opposite sex, and it traumatized me.

What made it worse was that it wasn't just me. My friend, who was the owner of the server, was a few months younger than me and when she turned 16, the same thing happened, just to a lesser degree. At that point, I was already kicked down by the fact that I was in quarantine (since I live in China), but then having to open up to my friend and dig up these old wounds that I had buried so deep, just pushed me over the edge. Along the way, I had lost friends who still stood on his side and at the end of it, Parker was banned from the server.

After his ban, I heard from even younger girls that he had been doing it to them as well, girls who were as young as 13.

I don't know where Parker is now. I don't want to know where Parker is now. But I do know that what he did back in 2018 and 2019 was most likely the worst periods of my life.

Now, I'm 17, and I still can't get over it. Being a senior in high school, I've never really got the chance to deal with it and now I'm still feeling the effects of it. Any topic that's sexual makes my heart sink and any male's attention makes my stomach churn. I can't hold a relationship and I can barely hold a fling. Professional help isn't really available to me at the moment and I just really want to ask...how do I heal from this?

This turned out to be a lot longer than I expected so I'm sorry if I took up too much of your time. I'd really appreciate any advice I can get.

Thank you and have a nice day :)",16Nov2020,3
329,"Hey so I’m (26m) certain that you all see plenty of this type of post on here - but I’ll try to be brief.

Essentially, I just went through a really bad breakup where for the life of me I don’t know what went wrong. I’ve been seeing this girl for a few months now and it’s my first serious relationship since college. Things were going pretty well, but I really suspected the whole time that she didn’t really like me, was looking at other guys, etc. Anyways, she would always tell me that it wasn’t anything or that I was reading into it too much - so I really tried to get over it. I was determined to trust that she wasn’t actually physically repulsed by me and maybe just had strong physical boundaries that I wanted to respect. Anyways, kind of out of the blue, she dumped me. Basically sent me a text that said “this isn’t working out, I don’t want to see you anymore” and that was about it.

Needless to say, I feel like crap. My feelings for my ex had really started to progress and I felt like I was working through some old issues and then this out of nowhere. Any tips for improving self-image? There was a dude on my bus today coming from the gym and I would honestly kill to look like that. Maybe I should try and get a membership? None of my friends even go to to the gym or else they don’t live anywhere nearby. How do you even start doing something like that? Any other tips for improving confidence? I’d honestly be interested in a rebound at this point if I thought any girl would pay me attention - but bars are still closed so who even knows anymore. Comments appreciated. Best.",16Nov2020,1

For some reason I wasn't fazed, and I just kept going until I came. Afterwards, I asked her again how old she was, and she said 15. I unadded her after that.

333,"I’m a sophomore in college and so far I’ve already missed about a year of school (two semesters) because of COVID, granted it was partly by choice since I decided to take a remote fall semester in order to stay with my family and get a job. 

I’m not upset by this that much since I’m very lucky that I love my family and my closest friend in college (my roommate) also took a remote semester so I don’t have too much FOMO with her at least. However, I’m not sure if I should be more upset? 

I’m selecting classes for my next semester tomorrow, and I’m going to try to take another remote semester (as is my roommate) but I’m realizing that by doing this I’m going to be officially missing two whole years of the college experience (I’m also trying to graduate a semester early to save money so it adds up to two years). 

Am I missing out? I’m actually really happy right now which I think should tell me enough, but I want to make sure I’m not stunting my growth with independence and whatnot. I love my coworkers right now so I’m getting good socialization, and I have a small, but close, group of friends that are from my hometown (didn’t go to same colleges) so I think I’m okay in the social department at least? 

I’m just not sure if this is something that I’ll regret later. I know it’s crazy times right now so nothing is really going to plan for most people, but I do have the option to be on campus if I wanted to so should I take advantage of that? 

I’d love to hear some perspective from college grads or even other current college students on if you think this is something I’ll end up regretting and I just don’t realize it, or if it really doesn’t matter and I should just stick to what I feel right now.",16Nov2020,1

340,"Background: Have had tics (or habits as my pediatrician loved to call them) since I was 8 or so [am 20 now].

In a simple sense, for a period of a couple weeks or so I would have a certain tic like a sound or slight head movement and pretty much as soon as I stopped one another would start. Over time these harmless tics became somewhat normalized in my mind.

I've seem multiple doctors and have a tourettes and adhd diagnosis, meds for both conditions were ineffective and amphetamine based adhd meds seemed to make them a lot worse.

Lately, the tics haven't been harmless. My current tics are as follows:

 cracking my jaws in such a way that my gum and cheek shin chafe really hard, pushing/pulling my stomach in and out, and fervently itching and picking at my head. These have been present for a month or so at this point and have been wreaking havoc on my life.

As I type this, my upper left gum and left cheek are so swollen and beat up from the constant jaw movements it hurts to so much as speak. My abs feel like I spent the whole day doing sit ups, and my scalp has about 20 scabs and open sores that I've picked time and time again more than I could count. 

I've tried taking control and forcing my body to not do these motions, but I become hyper aware of whatever body part I'm ticking with and feel like I'm losing my mind if I dont do it.

These past couple days have been hell. I hurt, I cant focus on anything but my tics, I'm afraid to go in public, and I cant be present in any of my activites. I've tried everything my doctors, friends, family and the internet have suggested.

Meditation, distraction, eating, singing, guided videos, all of it doesnt work. If anyone has any other ideas, any at all please do share. I really need something to try.",16Nov2020,1
341,"Basically we were heading toward a relationship, then we decided we'll just be friends at least untill we figure our lives out. 

I was thinking of getting her some gym wear, like a couple sweatpants and some sport tops plus a perfume, lady million empire specifically, but I'm not sure if it is a good idea... 

She said she was looking for new gym wear because she got bored of the old stuff.

I want something to show that I'm still into her but not so it will be too much and make her back off.

For more information she is 20 years old, a little bit superficial, gives a lot for looks and first impression, but she doesn't like very fancy stuff herself, like I bought her a dress but she'd rather wear casual stuff, jeans, shirts, so on. 

Also I bought her a bunch of jewelry in the past, last time it was in september so I don't think getting more is a good idea

So boys and girls any idea is welcome, please help me get something nice for her. Thank you.",16Nov2020,1
345,"So I'm generally a scaredy-cat. I'm spooked by most things and am generally non-confrontational unless the situation calls for it. I'm serious when I say I'm scared by a lot of things. But a few key ones would be the dark, supernatural anything, silence, and loudness. I don't know if it's particularly related, but I'm sorta seen as a creative person and I think I'm sorta well-read. I assumed because of how much media I consume, that whatever my fears are, it'll be nothing compared to what I've thought up in my mind. But the thing is, everything I've just said team up and its seriously at least like 40x worse. It's to the point that I rarely brush my teeth at night because its too quiet and using my toothbrush is very loud. I get very scared that I can't hear my surroundings and that something will jump out at me. It doesn't help I constantly see things in the corner of my eye and that I'm a very paranoid person in general. Also 15m. Also, very minute sounds such as floorboards creaking will make me freak out. (I'll add the important fears here) I have a fear of master bedrooms(I know i know very weird but also one of my first fears) i just remember seeing this, red thing, in my parent's old master in the apartment we lived in. I refuse to go in there if its dark.

This is insanely crippling and I need this to stop. I truly don't know what to do. I can't ask my parents for help since they're kinda old-fashioned and believe in the whole macho man.

I see them talking and can understand that they're a human etc, but cannot connect with them. I just cant feel it no matter how hard I try.

I am successful and socially normal, but I only keep friends for a few weeks before they start to distance from me. I dont know if I creep them out eventually (in a subtle way) or if they realize I don't have any emotional depth. Again I'm very normal but always just feel like my brain won't allow me to connect.

to clarify, i am not doubting his side of the friendship, because he does seek me out and we hangout and go places during break and chat on discord. he does seek me out, but he never wants to hangout in person. i think this stems from just laziness, especially when you can just hop on discord. He invites me to play games and stuff online as well.

 but any tips on encouraging him to hangout in person? ngl sometimes i see him hangout with another  friend over the weekend and its frustrating that he never does this with me. However it doesn't happen too often.

350,My job recruiter called me about an interview with a company and told me that the hiring manager wants to interview me and then he changed his mind after viewing my Facebook. Let me be clear whomevers Facebook page that he looked at was not mine because I deactivated my Facebook page. He told my recruiter that my Facebook page had a lot of “Black Lives Matter uprising” things on there and that I seemed “angry.” Yes I am African American .I was so offended by what I was hearing from my recruiter. She talked the hiring manager into bringing me in anyway and assured him he couldn’t be looking at the right Facebook page because I am very professional. But even if I did have Black Lives Matter things posted on my page SO WHAT? What is his issue with that? How is that relevant to my ability to do the job? Why was the “angry black woman” stereotype used on me before meeting me? I was horrified and disgusted. After hearing that it’s impossible for me to not think he is a racist. I obviously wouldn’t want to work for a racist idiot. My recruiter told me that if I get any racist or redneck vibes during the interview let her know.

354,"Kids (boys and girls) in the neighborhood was close to him (family member) Sometimes they go to his house to play which he allows, sometimes he just let them play with any videogames or the games in his phone. But one day, only the girl (10y/o) went to his house. He was playing with his phone when the girl grabbed it from his hands and sit near him. As he was reaching again for his phone, he might have touched her legs and from there he was tempted and let his hand in her legs,  I accidentally saw it as I was on the second floor and when I came down that's what I witnessed. I said the nastiest words and shouted at him, pointed at him and all the things that an angry person would do. I let the girl go back to her house. She doesn't seem to be bothered by it, maybe because she didn't know that it was wrong.
After I calmed, I talked to him. He apologized. He was so ashamed of what he did and admitted that he was tempted in that situation and gave in. He showed regret.  He promised a change behavior. He asked me not tell it to anyone because he will make up for his mistake.
This was what he did for his ""changed behavior"" - he cut ties with those kids; everyday he went to church to confess;  he gives food and clothes, and he pays for the tuition fees of the kids ( but he did this thru his son, because he promise never to come near the kids )
I always check that little girl, I observe her if she has trauma or any psychological issues because of what happened. But, thankfully she doesn't seem to have any of those. She just goes through her life normally. I promised myself that if she ever has any emotional problems, I will help her and I will support her, not my family member. 

- i tried to understand my family member. he really was going through a lot of things, he was at risk of losing his job, his wife was going through severe depression and if she ever find this out it will make things worse.
-i saw the changed behavior. He suffered too, silently, but he still suffered emotionally. 
-when I told her daughter about it (which I kinda wish I didn't) she suffered from depression. She was already suffering from anxiety, panic attacks, and ocd.
-he thanked me that I was able to witness it because I was able to stop it. I was able to stop him from doing a more serious damage. 
-he was really sorry
-he is actually a nice guy but that day he was weak and he gave in. but I know that whatever his reasons were, it was wrong.

I am actually worried about is his daughter. She is close to her dad, she's really broken, she goes to therapy and take medications. I really wish she overcome this and still live a good life because none of this is her fault. She tried to keep it too just like what I did but we did it for her mom and her brother. Her mother was really in severe depression. She don't want her younger brother to suffer emotionally like how she is now. I know her dad changed and was sorry for what he did but she can't seem to move on from it. Please don't judge her as she is suffering enough. She feels trapped. She carrying this burden and guilt. She feels hopeless but I want to help her. How can I help her? What can I tell her?",16Nov2020,1

She would grope my breasts and say how I'll make great milk for my  future children, would grope my ass and say how lucky my future husband will be or she would say on how big my fucking chest is she could sell me off and make money.  She would say so many horrible things about me and I'm really insecure about it

She would say disgusting things and would do this when I'm either alone with her or infront of my relatives and they would all just laugh and I feel embarrassed.

My mom tells me to ignore her but everytime I do she shouts these things so loud and won't stop till I cry. I told her to stop doing it but she says I'm being a brat and that she's older than me so she could do what ever she wants.

I tried fighting back and this morning when I was in the pantry she tried to take my shirt off and I just took off her glasses and threw it, it broke but I'm a bit happy about it.

She then tried to grab me again and say things like you wouldn't be like this if I got raped by my family member and I just stormed off and stayed locked in my door.

356,"For awhile now life hasn’t really been anything special to me. My friends think of me as the funny one in the group and when I hang out with anyone I have to put on a front for how I really feel. I’m not happy. Everyone I talk to sees me as “that one funny guy” I guess but I really don’t know how much longer I can keep acting like that. 

Everyday I wake up I don’t have the motivation to do anything. My grades in school are tanking horribly and the only thing that keeps me going are drugs and music. I don’t know what to do anymore. Everyone around me seems so happy and carefree and I honestly feel so alien around them. 

I don’t want to be seen as a sort of side character anymore I want to be happy I want people to see me as something more than the dude that tells stupid jokes and does dumb shit. Nothing makes sense to me. I’m sad all the time for no fucking reason. 

It’s getting harder for me to sleep at night no matter what medicine I take or what I do during the day. I just genuinely don’t know my purpose. Nothing seems fun or appealing anymore. I used to be able to go home from school and play video games with my friends but now getting on my Xbox isn’t fun. Things that used to supply me with happiness made me more sad or pissed off when something happens. 

I stay up really late every night listening to music staring at my ceiling thinking and my thoughts are rarely ever positive. I just want to give up. I want to sleep and not wake up the next day and be granted a better next life. I feel like nothing I do can change the way I feel and I’m really just rambling at this point but I don’t know what to say. I don’t want to give any details about myself but I’m pretty young and there’s so much more in life I haven’t seen but I just don’t care anymore. 

My parents probably think I’m stupid and get on my ass about grades all the time and I know it’s not because they hate me but thoughts like that creep up all the time. I feel like all my siblings get more attention and freedom than I do and on weekends I’m usually cooped up in my room trying to kill time to get to the next day. Time has been fading away slowly and everyday is starting to feel the same. 

I was doing online school the first 9 weeks of my school year but now I have to go back to normal school because my mom wanted me to switch. I absolutely hate school and I really don’t feel like it does shit for me. No one knows how I feel except myself and anyone that might read this. It’s been really hard for me to even get out of bed lately and I find myself pressing snooze 5 times and then sleeping the rest of the day. I feel fucking horrible and I don’t know what to do anymore. 

People that are going through shit like me ask more advice and I’m just a suicidal person telling people not to kill themselves. But I don’t know how to ask for help myself. This post is probably hard to read because of how bad I am at portraying my thoughts into words but if anyone sees this I really need some help. Any advice that anyone has that might make me feel like I can keep going would be fucking great.

One of my old math teachers in high school saw me as an arrogant and childish student, but, to me, he was a 60 year old man acting a lot more childish and arrogant than I was. He kept embarrassing me in front of the classroom by yelling out all of my mistakes on a worksheet, and no one stood up to him for his childish behavior. 

At the end of that school year, he told me that that was a disappointing year because he thought that I wasn’t the talent that he wanted to see in class and in school. At graduation, he further disrespected me by treating me as if I was a mentally retarded kid even though I had graduated at the top. I kept going to the restroom after what delivering what I thought was an embarrassing speech. I didn’t want to stay on the stage, because I literally didn’t care about these other kids in my class since I didn’t like them at all.

370,"Lockdown 1: in April, a woman moved in above me with a 3 month old and an 11 year old. She seemed nice enough.

She was soon joined by her boyfriend who also moved in. 

Since then all I have ever known of him is aggressively loud shouting. He's been too afraid to meet me I assume out of embarrassment despite me asking her for his contact details so I can stop asking him to be quiet through her. He refused to provide detials. He shouts at the absolute top of his voice at the 11 year old constantly, which wakes the baby.

At first I was concerned about her wellbeing but she made it clear there wasn't physical abuse and said he was pathetic, laughed at him etc. Over time she's proven herself to be just as vile as he is just with slightly more awareness and social skills.

It got super bad, having a negative impact on my life especially being woken at silly hours. I called the police and they gave me conflicting advice, they told me to call every single time they shouted. Well that would be daily. I only called when it was the worst. Around the third time I called at their advice they then told me the council would deal with it and to contact them. I wrote to the council and they informed me that they couldn't do anything as it was a private tenancy not a council home.

This is as far as I got before feeling helpless. But fortunately she got a job and schools opened, and he had noone to shout at. That is until:

Lockdown 2. Things are back to how they were. Today I am being woken at 7.30am by shouting and screaming. I said I've had enough and shes indicated that she can shout whenever she likes because she has a child, when I said I'd take it further next time she told me to do what I need to do.

They live as a family of 4 in a flat the same size as I live in alone (1.5 bedrooms), she is the sole tenant with a private landlord. The rent is paid for by the council. I have lived here for 3 years, I own my home. I work from home. I am planning to move for work next year but I cannot stand the idea of renting my flat to someone who has to deal with this. Also worth mentioning the landlord for upstairs does not like to lift a finger about any maintenance etc.

I admit it was a stupid decision, but I lost my family dog in a car crash the month before and also lost my best friend so really needed the companion. 

I'm really struggling to handle studying and toilet training her in an apartment. I'm also really struggling financially and cannot work because I can't leave her home for too long. She gets plenty of exercise as we live near parklands but I'm just worried she's not going to be happy.

My parents keep telling me to send her to live with them (12 hours away) until I finish uni. My issue is I don't trust my parents to look after her properly, as 1. My dad killed our last dog in a car crash while driving drunk, and 2. They let their other dog go for walks around the block by herself. I'm worried that they won't watch her and she'll get hit by a car or something. 

I love her to death and she's my best friend, but I'm struggling like crazy. I can't give her to another family because I still need her in my life. What should I do?

Week later she said she filled out the paperwork for a ESA parrot.

377,"Hello, so a little back story before we get into it. I was a super rebellious teen and started smoking cigarettes at a young age. I eventually quit and switched to vaping which, although slightly better, I know isn’t an amazing change. My fiancé picked it up as well I guess from just being around me about two years ago. 

So me and my fiancé had our baby girl a month ago. I have pretty bad anxiety as it but this has completely taken over my bedtime and sleep. If anyone doesn’t know, SIDS is sudden infant death syndrome which is essentially a baby from newborn to about 4 months can just die in their sleep because they forget to breathe. 
A few things can affect this, like being too hot while asleep, breastfed baby’s have lower rates, etc. but there literally is no rhyme or reason and it could happen to any baby. One thing that has a large negative impact on it is smoking. 
We never smoke near her and our vapes don’t have tobacco in them which seems to be the main concern for the doctor. But I’m still absolutely terrified. I have to check her breathing like four times for an hour before I force myself to sleep. I knock three times on our windowsill before going to sleep as I guess a comfort thing? But I’ve been doing it every night since she was born and physically can’t go to sleep without doing it because I feel it helps her keep from SIDS. Every night I go to sleep terrified that this could be the night. 
Is there anything that I could hear that would possibly comfort me or help me feel better? I do all the steps it says online to do (have a fan for air circulation, keep the room cold, have a pacifier in the crib with her ((and she doesn’t even use a paci I put it there for this sole reason it’s supposed to help)), have a sound machine, etc.)

382,"Lately, I’ve been feeling like the people around me aren’t beneficial to my growth. Sure, they’re all nice. However, I don’t feel much for them at all at this point. I call these people my friends, but if anything, it feels like I’m surrounded by acquaintances. I once read from somewhere that one needs to “Fill your circle with people who make a better you.” It feels like none of my friends really do that, and the same goes for me to them. I feel that I am the company I keep. But I don’t think I care much for my company. How do I find the true friends, that’ll bring the best out of me? The friends I’ll actually want to protect and make promises for, the people I’ll actually want to keep my word for? I’m not very social, and this remote learning has led to me not even going out.

I don’t know what to do anymore, do I move away or change my name and start a new life?

386,"TL;DR: I've budding heads with my parents all year long, despite my goal this year of having a closer relationship with them. After multiple instances and revelations, I gave up on the image of a close mother-daughter relationship. I found redeeming qualities in my relationship with my dad, but at the expense of being his personal therapist when I myself have mental health issues. I don't have the mental capacity to do so nor do I want this to be the foundation of our relationship, but I fear of losing the connection again.

&amp;#x200B;

I was never really close to my parents so I made it a goal for this year to begin to try to mend my relationship with them, but it seemed like this year had planned the opposite for me. Every year, my parents go through this period around their anniversary where they argue and it really takes a toll on my mental health. Unfortunately, I got more involved than I wanted to and was constantly arguing with both of them and had multiple mental breakdowns and suicidal thoughts. I never feel good enough for them. And I know the life that I want goes against core beliefs and I will just be the disappointment child, especially in comparison to my siblings. I went a week without speaking to either of them because they couldn't comprehend how I felt in the situation. My mom ""tried"" to sort this out with me, but she has narcissistic tendencies and somehow flipped the script on me telling me how ungrateful I am and guilt tripped me and made me feel bad to the point of another breakdown because I allegedly made her cry.  I called my sibling about it and she helped me to see how she was manipulating the situation (like she has done to me in the past) to favor her. After realizing this pattern, I got really upset kinda gave up on trying to have a close relationship with her. 

&amp;#x200B;

As for my Dad, he tends to apologize for his actions and I think it has to with a lot of childhood trauma where he's usually obedient, regardless of the circumstance. However, he is genuine about his apologies. I do feel sorry for my Dad a lot of the times because of his childhood abuse and I see it reflected in the arguments; when he gets angry/ aggressive a sign of wanting to be heard and projecting the anger that was targeted at him, apologizing first as he's been groomed to remain ""obedient"", and most importantly **neglecting his true emotions in fears of upsetting the other person.** I know that's one of my Dad's biggest flaws and sparks of most of my parents arguments; Bottling things up. I told him that he can talk to me, in hopes to help him be a little more communicative before irritation and aggression rises within him. Lately, he has been talking to me more often and constantly going over his traumatic past and current troubles. I'm glad that he feels more comfortable talking to me and our relationship is getting better, but now it's at the expense of being of being his personal therapist. I tend to have this habit where my empathy gets in the way and I over extend myself for others while my own mental health is deteriorating. And I feel that happening here. I love my Dad and I want him to get therapy (trust me I tell him time and time again, but he's FOB so he won't listen), but there's only so much I can handle, but I feel like if I don't talk to him about these things that I will lose another parent emotionally.  I honestly don't know how to handle this.",16Nov2020,1
388,"I currently live with an immuno-compromised family member so we have been under an extremely strict quarantine ever since COVID started. I haven’t left the house for 8 months except for ocasional walks around my neighborhood with my family. I understand that my family just wants us to stay safe, and of course I hope everyone is following their states’ guidelines for social activities. 
However, it’s my senior year of high school and I miss my friends so much. I am a very extroverted person so being inside for so long without seeing anyone other than my family has been incredibly hard. I keep thinking about how this is the last year I’ll be able to see my friends before we all leave for college. I’ve gotten very frustrated and upset, even though I know it’s not my family’s fault and I’m not angry at them, I’m just so lost and upset with the whole situation. I don’t know what to do, and I feel so lonely all the time. 
I have thought about a solution for a while, and one thing I did think of was maybe I could live in our basement. If I sealed off the door to the basement, I could live there alone just for a couple months and be able to see my friends. I would not be hanging out in large groups of course, just seeing my three friends and continuing to stay at home and do online school/activities. It’s just a very difficult decision because I will miss my family and also I’m nervous about their reaction. I think to get them to agree I will have to just move all my things to the basement and take a stand. I’ve tried to talk to them reasonably many times, but my family is VERY stubborn and it’s impossible to get them to budge on their decisions, and they are (understandably) too worried ab my one family member’s health, so I know I need to do something drastic like this and be assertive. However, I’m just unsure if this is what I should do. Please help me out, I would really appreciate it :)",16Nov2020,3
389,"Hi everyone,

I’m male mid 20’s high school teacher. A student asked if I’m gay and I thought why not just tell them. It was one of my difficult kids but he and his group took it great. I’m not in the closet in school and all of my colleagues know. Unfortunately I got an email from a parent from one of my higher end kids (she does extension work and always answering questions and helping out, very nice girl) said she doesn’t feel comfortable with it because her religious beliefs don’t support same-sex relationships. The parent assured me that it’s nothing personal and they don’t want to make a big fuss of it but want her transferred out of my class until another class.

I never ever talk about my personal life to my kids so the student isn’t going to be exposed to anything but I’m disappointed I made a lack in judgement and should have responded I don’t talk about my personal like I usually do. Should I be asking my Leading Teacher or deputy for advice or should I just pretend I was only joking? What does everyone think?",16Nov2020,1
390,"So i’m an 18 year old trans dude in my first tear of college. I moved all the way from Georgia (where I completed high school)/ South Carolina (where my parents live now) to Tennessee (a 6 hour drive) to attend basically the school of my dreams and to pursue game design, a long time passion. 

Over the weekend though, one of my friends who I’ve been hanging out with for months strangled me. 

We were cleaning my room before the inspectors came (i’m a notorious mess because of trauma and a bad back) and he kept insisting he wanted to crack my neck. I said no, I’m too tense and it will hurt, I just want to lie down. 

His response was to wrap an arm around my neck and then put a hand over my mouth. Some sort of rough housing or play fighting. But it came out of no where with no warning and I obviously got scared. So I laughed nervously and finally got him to let go but he just turned me around and wrapped his hands around my throat. I’m not into choking, I’m not even into pain when I’m not in that headspace. 

But I couldn’t breathe for a solid 20 seconds besides gasping and thinking of how I had to get out of my room or he would kill me right then and there. Thank god I managed to pry his hands off, and survived the encounter. But I told him to never do that again. 

I’m trying not to talk to him, on socials or in real life, because i’m scared of him now. He’s previously taken a snapchat video of my ass while I was walking up a flight of stairs (and yea I get it my ass is fat but I’m very self conscious about my body already...) and is very touchy. 

There’s also this inner joke in our cicle about “gripping food with force”, and he keeps making the joke but making it about gripping my rats with force. I own three lovely rats that I cherish and the way that he fixates on them and insists he wants to squish makes me nervous. 

My two closest friends want me to email the counselors on campus because he refuses to get help for any of his problems and it’s effecting him to the point where he can’t get any work done and he’s already failing his first semester. 

So... what do I do? Do I email the counselors? I don’t want to charge him for anything but... I’m scared of him. I don’t want to be alone with him, I don’t want him in my room, I don’t want to be around him, because I have never been so certain that I was close to dying in a single moment.",16Nov2020,0
391,"Hi. Sorry if this is really messy writing and doesn’t flow very well I’m not doing too good right now. I (21F) moved out with my boyfriend (25M) and his friends 2 weeks ago and my depression has came back really hard since. This is the first time I’m moved out. I’m not sure what to do and I’m crying and feeling hopeless almost everyday. 
I’m starting to think my boyfriend and I aren’t as compatible as i thought, we’ve been arguing and every time we do its so hard to get through to him and have him really listen to me or understand me and it hurts so much. 
2 of his roommates here are a couple and they don’t talk to me and I don’t think they like me, I get so anxious when I go downstairs and they’re there in the kitchen because idk maybe I’m intimidated by them and they don’t respond to me very well when I try to talk to them. There’s 5 other people here besides me and my boyfriend and they’re all my boyfriends close friends. I feel like I made the wrong choice here and I don’t think I’ll fit in with them and can really feel comfortable here. They don’t really talk to me and I try to talk to them but it’s really hard cause i have really bad anxiety / social anxiety. 
I just feel so lost and sad and scared. I would go back to my parents but my mom is emotionally abusive and my dad enables it. I dreamed of the day I would move out of that house and of course yeah it’s not great here but I don’t think it’ll be better there. I have visited my parents house often though because I do love my dad even though he does nothing to stop my moms behavior. I also go there for my brother who is very important to me and my dog is there and he’s one of the best things that’s ever happened to me I love him so much and I miss him. He was always with me and Im always there with him there because he’s scared of my moms yelling and I help him feel better and comfort him and try so hard to make him feel comfortable and safe. It hurts so much when I think about him there and if he’s scared or upset or lonely. I can’t take him to this place that i’m living because there’s no pets allowed. It’s so hard going to my parents house because I miss my dog, my dad, and my brother. 
But when I go I sacrifice some of myself because my mom. She guilts me every time i’m there and makes feel shitty and she’s just so toxic to be around. I’m not sure what to do. I feel like I don’t belong anywhere. I don’t belong here and I don’t belong at my parents house. It hurts so much. I feel alone. Thank you if you read through this

I've started going to the gym with him but I don't really like it and I've lost about 2 lbs so far.

399,"Hi Reddit. I've been struggling with this in my head for a couple of weeks now, so I'll get right to it.

I started working for this startup in July, and it's been amazing since then. I'm the only person at my work who can do what I can do, so there is a lot of responsibility on me, which is fine. However, I haven't been compensated as fairly as I wish I could. I'm making a $30k salary, which is nowhere near a range I should be getting for the work I do. I recently discovered that the person who gets paid the most at my work is the chef, and they are making alot more than I am. My other coworkers are probably getting paid the same amount as me, whether a little less or a little more.

I know startups struggle but I am debating with myself to stay or not. I can see this startup growing and we can have more money coming in, thus raising salaries for everyone. But I am a recent graduate and my student loan payments are coming up and they're quite expensive.

Any advice from people who have worked at startups are much appreciated. Thank you!",16Nov2020,2

401,"I (19, male, USA) recently sought help for mental issues I had been denying for years. While some of them are much easier to practice and improve on by myself I am struggling immensely with porous boundaries. 

My counselor only ever brought it up after three sessions and only after I had looked over some information they provided to make sure I felt comfortable discussing it and that I had the information I needed. I ended up checking off all the boxes: over sharing, difficulty saying no, getting too involved in others problems, and  tolerating abuse and disrespect.

The over sharing and over involvement issues are easy since I just make a nice head space and sooth myself  till the moment passes. The saying no one is difficult and that's usually the one that leads to me accepting abuse.

I just can't get over the notion that they NEED me and I am the ONLY one to do it because frequently I am. Alot of my family will leave the house and I'm an online college student left home alone to take care of everything. I picked weeds and shoveled gravel for five hours today while everyone else was out and about. They got back and were mad I didn't get straight to hw saying picking weeds was my relaxation time for the day. My friends tell me to stop and I just don't.

407,"3 months ago I started to work at a self proclaimed start-up. I was offered a part time contract and to be honest, a pretty low salary for my position. I told that to the owner but she said that at the moment the company couldn't afford more and that we would renegotiate in 2 months. It was a good step in my career and I took it believing her word. 

It's been 3 months and not only the contact I regotiated has not been put in place. I was put ""temporarily"" under a casual contract that does not grant me the rights, holidays, sick leave etc that a part time contract would. I did not agree to it. She said she would change it soon but she is been saying that for the last 3 months. Every time I ask it gets pushed aside.

In addition to this she put me under the wrong tax bracket and I have been paying a crazy amount of taxes. I'm still waiting for them to fix this. 

Her neglect has me checking my payslips every month because there is often mistakes. For example my boss stil owns me 200 in travel expenses. 

And of course my payment was never renegotiated. Instead she managed to call me several times a week talking about how little money the company has and how she does not know if she could make another necessary hire.

Every time there is a mistake or something has to be changed it takes weeks as my boss barely reads any of her emails. I am getting burned out but I feel like I need to fix it and stay, otherwise it will reflect terribly on my CV.",16Nov2020,2
408,"Hello everyone! I just found this subreddit while looking through google about some things that were troubling me so I thought I would ask straight from the source. 

It's a bit of a long post so sorry for this.

When I was a kid I was diagnosed with adhd (hyperactive) but didn't get any treatment aside from two years in a special school to get my hyperactivity checked. At school I was always getting good grades because I worked extra hard on my school work so my parents were proud. But socially wise I was extremely inept. Everyone hated me because I had no tact and sometimes would just spurt out things that were percieved the wrong way. So I focused all my time on studying. I was very athletic when I was a kid but around the age of 12 I stopped because I was overcompetitve and it broke my confidence every time I lost. Needless to say, team sports where not for me and I couldn't pull through.

A sidenote: I was always a slow learner. I couldn't grasp things easily so it took me a lot of time to do things. So I was always percieved as slow.

Problems with my attention started showing again in middle school, were I couldn't focus on school work no matter what. It got really bad to the point I had to get a tutor. The tutors helped immensely but I fell in the same hole again of only focusing on school and nothing else. Physically and socially wise I was behind. I was really fascinated by biology and in the final exams we give in my country to go to college I wrote the highest. But in essays or language (another subject we need to give exams on) I was terrible. All my teachers said I was ""dyslexic"" and wouldn't help me even when I asked for help. I wasn't really dyslexic (though I haven't checked) but I can't write or speak cohesively. The last year we got a private tutor specialising in kids with learning disabilities. I learned he was that kind lf tutor much later though because my parents didn't want to hurt my feelings. 

However the problem is that, during all this time because I was good academically the doctors told my parents I only had childhood adhd. Nowdays I am not hyperactive at all if anything I am hypoactive. I feel lazy and appalled by having anything to do with work and sports. I know it's because I'm afraid of failures and get angry at myself very very easily. But now in college (nursing) I fear that I never got over my adhd after all.

 I can't focus in class because almost every ten minutes I keep daydreaming or zoning out. Really hard. I come back after around another 15 minutes only to start the cycle over again. I take thrice the time other kids need in order to study subjects. I end up not finishing the work I need and barely pass. Some teachers (especially one who I see as sort of a mentor) is one of the few people who believed me when I told him I am actually studying and working hard but I'm tired of this amount of work every single time period of my life. He asked if I was diagnosed with adhd and I said yes but childhood adhd. He told me it never goes away really and just needs to be checked. I don't remember how I faced it in primary school anymore because I can't remember a lot of things from my childhood. 

However when I told my parents I want to get checked again they said (specifically my mom): ""You have nothing wrong. I had the same problems as you, you just need to focus on one thing based on what you like"". 

My mom was diagnosed with a lot of mood disorders (anger issues, gad, bipolar) and I have seen in her behaviour that she might have had adhd. She was also really hyperactive when young, interrupted others, an overachiever who gave up and in general she said ""I thought I had adhd but turns out I just needed to focus"". 

So it got me thinking. Am I just tired from working too hard when I was younger and I need to toughen up and work? Or did my adhd never leave and I need to get checked again?

Sidenote: When I was young I had some twitches (like rubbing the inside of my thumb, rocking and flattering my eyes or twitching my head. These stopped around the time I begun daydreaming a lot. But around the last year of high school (or second to last) I begun developing a new one where I would twirl my hair too much and pull it sometimes. I didn't realise I was doing it and was mocked by some teachers and classmates. I told them it helped me focus but eventually it stopped helping me and just became a new habit of sorts. Eventually I found myself doing it when I was in focus or even out of focus or zoning out. Does this have anything to do with adhd? 

Sidenote 2: In my country adhd isoften overlooked especially in adults. And to get a diagnosis is really hard especially during the quarantine times. I could try and reach out but I fear I'll just waste time. What should I do?

Sidenote 3: I forgot to mention! I also have a vitamin d deficiency. Does that affect my focus in anyway? I keep forgetting when to take it and miss it sometimes for multiple days before someone else reminds me",16Nov2020,1

I (27F) work full time, while attending an M.Sc. (also full time). It consists of two semesters of courses and two semesters for thesis. 
Last year, i failed two courses of the Winter semester, and none of Spring semester, meaning there are two courses left for me to complete. Those courses are project based, meaning i failed on final project. There is also a September exam period, but my depression was acting up during that period of time,i was feeling too overwhelmed, so i couldn't join (big mistake, i know).
I am working full time. I have no other means to support myself. My job is 9-5.  For the one course i failed, i agreed with the professor to write a paper for his course by end of semester, so that i pass the course. 
The problem is with the other course. The professor is a firm believer that ""a student should be a student and not work"". He has his lecture at 3-5 every week, so i cannot attend. Also he has given a short description about this term's project, but said ""i will give you more information at lecture"". I can't figure out what is needed by the description on the course's eclass. I also can't bring myself to mail that professor because i feel ashamed. What could i tell him anyway... I do not know what i should do, and i am losing sleep on it....i think i am in major trouble!",16Nov2020,1

415,"some context to start, a friend started dating someone who made a comment about my dead mum and i beat his ass.

after i whooped his ass half of my friends stated ‘i should’ve been the bigger man’ and should not of done anything.

i just don’t get this, he made a pretty fucked up comment and expects me to just do nothing? he kinda brought it on himself lmao.  i don’t feel bad about it at all, actually pretty fucking happy i knocked his ass out, violence isn’t always the answer tho so

guess the question or advice i’m asking is how do i be the bigger man when someone makes a comment like that?",16Nov2020,1
416,"I got a burn-out few years ago, when I was in my first your of grad school.
I found out I have dyslexia when I was 16. I worked always very hard in school, I always made my homework and had high grades. Then I went to university to study for my bachelor, again high grades, but I also had to work hard for it. During my first year I got a stalker for a year, during my last year my dad got cancer. Where I'm from it is normal to go to grad school after your bachelor. I did not really liked my bachelor that much, I liked the topics, but not the carreer perspective. Because I was not in a good mental space, it felt more that I was in surival modus and I just started the master program. I was selected for a special master program for excellent students. THis felt special and it was the master I was planning to do. However, I knew that this was not my career path, but i had the feeling that I need to do it. THen during my first year of graduate school, I got a burn-out, which laststed for 2 years. At the moment I'm finishing my last year, I have burn-out symptoms again. So I will finish my master program in 4 years, whereas it is normally 2 years. Everyone says to me: you are so close, keep it up. But to be honesty, I'm so so tired. I feel like these four years where a battle against myself. I always finish what I start, but I feel like 'giving up'. I will say to myself: you can have an other careerpath after you graduate. The only reasons I keep going are my students debts and the feeling that I do not want to give up. But everyday I feel closer to just stop. I image in my head that I just decide to one day not show up anymore. I do not really care anymore what other people might say or think if I do not finish my education, I do not care anymore if I end up with a low earning job.

420,"So, I have always been really fascinated with driving and couldn't wait to turn 18 to learn to drive. So, two days ago, I started my driving lessons in a really excited spirit but now...

I won't say it's very hard particularly but the driving teacher keeps using an intimidating tone and his strict vibe has really gotten me to fuck up more. It's like I make a mistake, he gets hella disappointed and then I get scared to make mistakes and the fear makes things worse.

My love for driving hasn't lessened a bit, but it has become quite uncomfortable for me to learn in an environment like that. I don't know if I am overreacting but can anyone give me some tips to calm down and not take the things that the teacher is saying too personally? Basically trying to be less sensitive about the whole thing?

423,"Hello, i recently graduated from high school, 2 years after schedule. I've had some part time jobs over the last three years also, in both sales and manual labor. All of the jobs were okay, but i couldnt picture myself working there for the rest of my life. So i guess its time to actually figure out what career i want for the rest of my life, or atleast the majority of it (im 23). 

I have thought about it for years and years, but everytime i think of something cool, a little bit of time goes by and i completely lose interest or realize that it would require too much effort to be realistic for me. For example i was thinking of a career in robotics last year, but i have always been bad at math and i really have no interest in learning it. I feel like im good at writing and politics, but i dont know if the jobs in that field would be suitable for me. 

I guess what im trying to say is, what should i do when there are so many different jobs in this world, and i have to choose only one? I kind of envy the people who know what career they would like from a young age. I have no idea what i want to do and i feel like time is running out.",16Nov2020,1
424,"So my best friend and I have been each other’s shadows for the last 5+ years, her mum even refers to me as her own daughter. 
In June-July i started noticing she’s quite mean to me but does it in a way that doesn’t sound mean at all (most of the time) but other times it’s like she’s purposely trying to make me feel bad about myself.

Eg. I have been through a few traumatic life events (which my friend knows all about) and because of this I can be very withdrawn in certain situations and it sometimes seems like I have no feelings. But then other times, if I feel I’m in a safe environment and comfortable with the people I’m around I let my feelings out, I cry with happiness, sadness and can act like a child and have fun being silly.
Then one day we were joking around and she said “I really think you have bipolar” I stopped and looked at her kind of waiting for her to laugh like she was joking.. she wasn’t.

I also have severe anxiety about being late and turn up to my job at least 15 minutes early and sometimes even 30 minutes if I’m having a bad day. One day I messaged her telling her I was 20 minutes early and she made fun of me. I know she was probably joking but she knows why I am like this.
Am I being silly? 

After this I noticed I was always the one making plans with her and messaging/calling her first. So I simply stopped to see what would happen. It’s been 4 months and I haven’t heard from her.
I should add, another friend told me she has not reached out because she thinks I’m mad at her (because I haven’t reached out first) so now she is just using that excuse that we have had a falling out. Which we haven’t, I was just over putting in all the effort.",16Nov2020,1

428,"Background:
Things could have gone so much worse for me but all things considered I'm in a decent spot right now. My dad was abusive, alcoholic tendencies, and likely had some kind of psychological problem (he offed himself while I was in college). Home life was so scary and unpredictable that I never felt safe in my home and I didn't reach out to people or talk to many people for a long time (it never felt safe to make friends). I have a (fairly minor) learning disability that makes me slower at tasks like reading, short term memory, multiplication, and similar tasks. I also have a mild studder that might be related to that learning disability (I also suck at spelling). As a result I struggled with timed exams growing up and with written english.

Now I'm nearing the end of my PhD with my first girlfriend (we just passed 3 years together). And now I'm thinking about what's up ahead.

Dilemma(s):
My girlfriend does not want kids for a lot of reasons. Really bad hormone related stuff prior to birth control (extreme mood swings, puking in pain from cramps in sketchy parts of town, ect). The loss of time, money, and hobbies. The irreversible changes to the body (potentially split abs). As well as climate change (asking the planet to support another human is really demanding). We also likely won't have nice looking kids.

On my side I'm torn, I guess this is selfish but having a little part of me continue into the next generation sounds kinda nice, tho a ton of work. On the other side I do have a learning disability that was only managed by a ton of work both on my part and on my mom's part. My dad also ended himself and those traits are inheritable, I also have type 1 Diabetes in the family. And the points my gf brings up are all very valid. I also question how good I'd be at being a Dad (I don't think I'm very good with kids, tho it would be nice to share some of the tasty things I've learned how to make like from scratch pies and roasted everything). Given all those things I really don't know if it's a good idea for me to have a kid.

As sad as I would be, if I did decide that I wanted kids I don't think I could make that work with my current partner. To find and vet another partner could take some time so I'd probably wanna make a decision about this in the next year or so.

431,"First of all, hello reddit.

I really don't know if this is the right sub, or if I will write this properly. Please note that I am not a native English speaker, but I could really use some advice right now. 
I'll try and make this as short as possible.

I will give a bit of context to the situation:
My family (composed of only my mother and my sister; my father cheated when I was born, she raised us as a single mother and she had never been with anybody after him) and I live in a pretty small city in Europe. Almost 3 years ago we adopted a dog and wanted it to socialize with other dogs, so we always went to a dog park nearby. At first my mother didn't bother to come, then we made friends with a lot of people as well, even older than us, and my mother joined us pretty quickly. 

It was a fun family activity if you ask me, and we got to spend time with our dog, which didn't hurt at all. 

This group of people was actually made of a lot of older people (40+, some people in their 20s, but the majority of them was elderly people or already married people with family dogs) so my mom fit in perfectly. At the time she was in her mid 40s; she had more in common with them rather than me and my sister, so she slowly started enjoying this new group of friends. 

Well, in this group there was this couple, let's call them L and R. L is a sweet woman a lot younger than R; no children together, but R has many from previous relationships. 
R is a man who has actually a long record of failed relationships at his back. He always brushed them off by saying misogynistic things like ""eeh, you know, women are tiring, they only suck the life out of you, so I got tired of them and left"". When he met L, he was getting out of a divorce which he claims was caused by his wife having a mental breakdown or an existential crisis leading them to separate. I didn't think much of them as I actually just didn't like the guy from the start, so I stayed away from him.

Well, sep. 2019 my mother asks me to talk privately without my sister knowing. She knows my sister and I talk a lot and say each other everything, so she kinda wanted me not to tell her anything about what she was going to tell me. 

She told me she had met a man and she liked him so much, she felt alive again and I will be honest, I thought it was amazing. Then she started crying. She told me the man she was talking about was actually R, and they were having sexual encounters since July 2019. I was shocked, just didn't know what to do. I felt bad for her crying so I didn't get mad at her and told her that there was a way to get out of that situation, since I thought she wanted to end things with R. I obviously told my sister but reassured her things were going to end soon.

I quickly understood that she wasn't going to end things and she actually read my reaction as a ""go on"" when she came clean to my sister too. We were both appalled, so I made things clear - I didn't like that man, L was too good of a person to be cheated on and I didn't want her to ruin her life and someone else's. I made clear that I was completely disappointed by her behaviour and that as a person who suffered this kind of situation I would've expected some more compassion. My sister took my side. My mom whined and claimed it was her life and that she had no responsibility at all regarding L, nor she wanted him to leave L for her - in fact, she really wants to be the side chick. She really does: she gets told she's the only one, L is just too weak of a woman and R can't leave her like that, but he loves her. He just lives with a roommate, cit. (My mom and R also fought a lot, almost everyday, so it's not even a healthy relationship.)

Fast forward to today, things have been the same (I'm in college now so I'm not home despite COVID), except for the fact that one day, a man showed up to my mother's house and asked to talk to her. He claimed he had been keeping an eye on his wife and found out she was cheating on him with R. He also told her that he hacked R's phone and saw that he was having an affair with my mother too, so he wanted to warn her. Despite all of the evidence he gave my mother, she doesn't believe him, yet she believes R without any problems. 

R also convinced her to change her phone number just to talk to him, so that people can't hack them again. She keeps claiming she deserves to be happy, and that she doesn't care about L. 

It just feels a lot. I know that giving advice here isn't simple, but I would like to know how to convince my mom to break up with R, come clean to everybody and try to live a normal life. 

Please reddit, help me untangle this mess of a situation because I surely don't know where to start.",16Nov2020,0
432,"How does one feel better after being passed up for a promotion? It’s been months and I still feel mad whenever I think about it.

I'm (20, M). Crush is (20, F)

So last September, I hit up one of the girls I found cute in my university. As it is quarantine, so most of our interactions were somewhat online. Months passed, I confessed, she said she likes me too and since then my morning was never bland as I always received messages which warmed my heart since I finally felt that I mattered to someone.

Today, she told me that she might be taking off time from social media because she said she ""felt like it."" Of course, I know if she needs to, then she could take time off. She also said she's not sure when she'll begin using it again, something about detoxifying and taking a break from responsibilities, that sort of stuff. She's reassured me that I can always text her if I need something.

Now the part where I ask advice is, how can I stop myself from nagging her when she obviously wants to take a break? Because I'll surely miss her sweet morning messages and how her face lights up my day, and I'm not gonna be seeing any of it for an indefinite period of time.

TL:DR: crush takes social media break, how to handle her lack of presence for some time.

Background story:

Me and my girlfriend met september 2019 at a party. We talked and so on. The next weeks we talked more and more on snapchat and hit it off. I said i liked her and she really liked me back, but everytime we were suppose to meet i didnt answer the phone and sometimes i didnt show up. I know it was really awful and mean and i regret it so much. She still liked me and i also liked her but she ended up blocking me a couple of times because of what i was doing. I totally understand that. I still wrote to her that i liked her and she really liked me to she said. Now its oktober and im out drinking and ends up sleeping with her coworker. 2 days later i asks if my now girlfriend wants to come over and sleep here. She says yes and she comes. We talk some more on snapchat the later days flirting etc. She wants to hang out some more but i really didnt want a relationship at this point because me and my ex broke up for some months ago and i just didnt want a new relationship at this point in life.

Some more weeks go and i ask my now gf to meet me when we are out drinking and she asks if she can sleep over, i say no because i feel like its starting to become a relatinship than, and i say the reason is im not over my ex, but i just didnt want a new gf now. She becomes very very sad and blocks me etc, i understand that ofc. After some days she unblocks me and we start chatting again, i tell her i still like her ofc and she deeply likes me back. We talk back and forth, didnt meet in real life. Some weeks go by and im out drinking and I make out with a girl she knows, at this point me and my now gf were not talking for some days. Still no excuse but was not meant in any mean way, but i do regret it very much. This friend of her tells her and my now gf send me a massage the next morning; so this is what you are doing when your out drinking"". I respond mean and says; i guess it is. Dick move I know .

a month go by without talking except when i said happy hollidays to her on xmas because i wanted to be nice. Its januar and i decicde that im ready for a relationship and i truly like this girl, she is perfect and i was stupid to not just grab her while i could at the start. I ask her out and she says yes. Im very happy. We start going out, meeting chatting and falling in love for the next week or 2, at this point i still got a pic of my ex girlfriend and me kissing on my IG, she comments it and makes singals for me to delete it, i dont pick them up becaue im stupid. But i end up deleting it after maybe 1 or 2 weeks , which ineeed is really bad. Some time go by and she starts brining up everything i did last year to her, every mean thing i did and eveyrtime i said i liked her but still treated her bad and never met her. She says this is bothering her very very much and she feels disgusted and sad. We both hope life will run its cours and time will heal it. Some more month go and its still a problem, we talk about it and try to figure ot what to do. We deeply love eachother and spend every day togheter, talking about the future and how perfect we are togheter. But the past is still bothering her and she says she cant live like this, and I understand her POV and i want to fix it, but i dont know what. Im treating her in the best way now and do verything for her, but she still feels like she wasnt picked by me and dont really feel comfortable that i treated her so bad in the begining, the pic about my ex, the coworker and so on. I totally understand, but we are truly in love and enjoy and we both think we are perfect togheter.

She says she love me but cant live like this with this things bothering her. It comes up maybe 1 or 2 times a week and lately even more. We both know if we fix this we can live so good togehter and ahve such a nice life. But we need to fix this, she is sad and at the edge of leaving, but she cant because we are so in love and the best possible match ever. If it wasnt for the past.

So im here begging for your help and advice on how to fix it, it would mean the world for both of us if someone could help us out in some way. Every tip and adcvice is deelpy appreciated. Thanks for hearing me out and thank you if you take your time to answer and help.

441,"Summary: Dated a new guy, got stolen from and put down/gas-lighted, in a really horrible place and need advice on how to proceed and trust myself/other people again

I \[22F\] started seeing a new guy \[28M\] recently, and he took me to his friend's house for a small barbecue this past weekend (I live in a country where this is acceptable/allowed now). We were going to stay the night and I left two precious rings in the guest room, believing I could trust the small group. Everything was alright until someone stole the jewellery out of my bag and off a bedside table -- I know this for certain because I was sober the whole night and didn't move or misplace my belongings.

He was incredibly defensive and angry when I told him that my rings were missing and I suspected someone had stolen them. He informed me that I should be aware of where I put my own belongings (which I was until someone violated my space and stole), that I was irritating and should STOP accusing people. The rest of the group gave me the cold shoulder and didn't offer any basic decency (such as asking around or even apologising for something like this happening at their gathering). I am a bit shocked by how brutal they have been, and can't believe that I'm being treated like there's something wrong with me for speaking out about being stolen from.

He is completely ignoring me now, and based on what I've seen of him this past week, and his defensiveness, I have reason to believe HE might have stolen my rings and was trying to keep me quiet by bullying and gaslighting. I don't really feel heartbroken about him because I've figured out that he's a bit crazy, but I'm super sad about the rings (I've had them for years and they were incredibly special). I also don't quite know how to forgive myself for putting myself in that situation, and allowing myself to be hurt like that when I COULD and SHOULD have paid more attention to the red flags. I'm really angry for going in the first place.

I feel incredibly uncomfortable, violated, unheard and put down today. I was considering reporting the theft to the police but the issue is that I can't remember the exact address (this psycho I was dating drove us there and I didn't think to pay attention), and even if we did locate the exact property, I have no evidence other than my word against theirs. While I really want to report this incident, I think it will only cause more strife and will just keep me in contact with this person for even longer. I could round up some male friends and ask them to go and insist that this guy gives my shit back or helps with finding out who took it, but again this will cause a lot of strife and I don't want to bring even more negativity and conflict into my life.

Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with and move past this? I am in a really dark place right now and am feeling quite used.

I thought it was a good idea as it was just some random guy she never knew. so she continues to take money from this guy when she needs it. at first it was OK because this man did not want anything in return, he didn’t want anything sexual. THEN he starts wanting stuff in return. she refuses to tell her boyfriend and continues to tell this guy what he wants to hear. keith has blown her phone up with messages calling her a shitty person and is blatantly just mad that she isnt texting him back when he wants her to text him back. turns out she’s telling him she’s his girl and all this stuff. I am extremely uncomfortable because I am in the middle of the situation knowing she has a boyfriend and she’s leading on a 30-year-old man for money witch neither of them (the bf and kieth) know about each other. so i need advice because i know what she’s doing is wrong, i’m just an terrible with wording stuff. thank you if you made it to here. &lt;3",16Nov2020,1
446,"Hey wassup guys, my little brother (15 yo) smokes weed, so I'm (23 yo male) thinking of telling my mom about his marijuana smoking so he stops before he makes it a habit. Thing is I smoke too and my mom is aware of that but doesn't condone my marijuana use.

My lil bro looks up to me and that's why I think he smokes weed too but to be honest I don't like that he's smoking because he's still too young to be smoking pot and he's brain is still developing and with the negative effects associated with marijuana, I don't want him to fall behind in life and dig himself into a deep hole of depression and anxiety just like I did which is hard to come out of.

I know it's his life but he doesn't know what he's getting himself into he's too dumb and naive to know and I don't want him to fall into the same trap as I did. So idk if I should tell on him or not, or maybe confront him before telling my mom. I would really appreciate it if y'all took time to advise me on what to do.

450,"My best friend has been suffering from severe depression for a long time now, and I really need some advice.

After talking to him for a long time and reading about his condition, I started to notice various symptoms of depression in his behaviour:
-He has trouble sleeping
-He's convinced he's weak and that has no room for improvement
-Decrease in focus and attention
-Overall sad
(Btw, I didn't just randomly diagnose him with depression, he told me).

It's also been quite a long time since I've known, but I never told any of his closest relatives because he didn't want them to know, and I've always been afraid of worsening his condition by doing so.
We sometimes talk about how he feels and why; I try to convince him to ask for therapy, but he doesn't trust psychology and medications at all, and says he would rather suffer on his own than involve others in his ""own"" problem.

What should I do? How can I help my friend?

455,"Good afternoon ~
So as title says, I just almost got mugged. I was on my way home from school ( it's a 30 min walk ) and a stranger approached me. This was in *broad* daylight, and he didn't look like a hardened criminal or anything. I thought he was either a beggar who'd leave me alone once he'd realized I'm a 16 yo kid with no money, or someone asking for directions. He reached for my hand and leaned in close as if we were friends, and then in a threathening tone he told me not to move or he'd hit me. He was like, don't move, don't tremble you'll be fine. He asked me what brand my phone was, and then told me to take it out so he could see it. I lied and said I left it at home but he kept insisting ( phone stuck out slightly in my pocket, he might've seen it ) I got really scared and told him I wanted to go him, and he pulled me in a one-arm hug and started walking with me a bit ( probably to avoid suspicion from passerby ) and told me he was about to count to 3 and then hit me if I didn't hand the phone over. I think he then saw someone he knew pass by, at which point he just let me go after making very sure I left walking and not running as not to draw attention. Turns out, that guy he saw knew of his shenanigans and he warned me about him as I was walking away, I got pretty lucky he walked by. 
So, I'm fine now. I was pretty freaked out the rest of the way, looking over my shoulder and all, but I made it.
I didn't tell my parents yet, and I'm not sure I want to. They would probably admonish me for not handing over the phone, which was pretty but in retrospect: 1. It was in broad daylight 2.He didn't have a weapon, his hands were both out of his pockets and he couldn't draw out one and attack me fast enough.
3. My phone has my name and by delving a bit deep into it you can find out info about me that would be very dangerous to my safety ( I'm gay and irreligious and this is North Africa )
What I'm asking here is, what can I do if it this happens again. And I mean, a mug attempt but in broad daylight. I don't really go out anywhere that's not full of people at night, and that guy today only managed to make this attempt because I was stupid enough to get too close. Now, suppose I find myself in this situation again - close to someone trying to mug me in broad daylight in a street where there are people but not too many people - what can I do? Should I just hand over what they want? Try to run and trust they can't do much about it in the open? 
I also considered taking a self-defense class but I can't just ask my parents that without telling'em I was mugged first + the pandemic's on and I don't know how you'd practice without getting close to a trainer.

But he was **extremely** smart and a truly well-liked guy. He has always been more on the sensitive side with a huge heart and a lot of empathy.

basically you know how there’s online school, well this girl let’s call her ‘L’, she came to actual school after like 3 months of online. and my friend and i are socially awkward and literally are outcasts -_- 
so we were like ok we gon nab her and try to make friends bc 3’s a mf crowd!!

so L got here and this other girl who we’ll call N, was like ‘in charge’ of her to help her around and shit. and i was like eh no biggie it’s fine. so then at break time, my friend and i were like ok now’a the time, let’s talk to her. 

she had detention in chem apparently so we waited like 10 mins and when she finally came, i saw her outside on the bench alone. 

i got really excited cause we could go up to talk to her and was like to my friend LET’S GO!1!1!

we started walking towards the door to go out and JUST THEN this girl who i’m pretty sure is RACIST goes to her with ‘N’ (‘in charge’ of L) and she asks her to sit with her.

now, keep in mind this racist mf is part of this group that consists of white girls or people from the UK or whatever. 

my friend and i were so pissed bc we had a whole plan and everything and the racist hoe who, i’m pretty sure hates us, took her away!!

the racist mf basically always rolls her eyes at us when we’re speaking in our language like wtf b mind your own business.
we were moping all day and were extremely annoyed.

473,"Sorry about formatting, I'm on mobile.

I am very passionate about linguistics, and spend most of my time self studying and learning as much as I can. It brings me so much happiness.

The only problem is, since this year I have gotten so into things that it is taking up most of my energy and I haven't been trying very hard in school anymore. It's very noticeable because I used to pour all my energy into getting perfect grades, but I was completely miserable, reliant on hard drugs and burnt out all the time. The only reason I kept going was because I wanted to make other people happy.

Now where I live, exams are on at the moment. Like I said, I haven't been trying very hard in school this year, and I am certain that I will not pass the majority of my exams. My parents have very high expectations of me, and when they find out I'm not getting perfect grades anymore, they are going to be so angry at me. 

I don't know if I should just give in and do what everyone wants by trying my hardest in school, or if I should do what makes me happy and accept the shitty grades. 

If I do continue studying linguistics, I probably won't be able to get a scholarship, but I thought that maybe I could get a student loan and a degree in teaching, then go travel the world teaching English. That sounds like a dream, but every time I mention this to my family they always shut me down and tell me that's stupid and I should focus on science (my best subject) or learn to code. They just tell me I won't enjoy it and it's unrealistic and I'd be bad at it.

474,"TL;DR : broke things off with fwb but met them as a friend. They forced me to do sexual acts when I didn't want to. 

Edit: I'm intentionally being gender neutral to protect everybody involved. 


This goes back to 4 years ago when I was in a fwb situation, the person and I had gone out for 6 months before and it clearly didn't work out. But we agreed to remain friends and since we weren't seeing anybody else we never really agreed (or disagreed boundaries when it came to sex) Thankfully geography helped(we were continents apart) and they flew in once to my place and that summer we agreed that I would travel to their location for christmas and started making plans.

In the meantime I met another person and our initial friendship turned into a romantic one like two weeks before I had to fly in to the planned Christmas vacation with fwb. I explained the events to fwb and wanted to cancel the trip since my new partner told that it was my choice on what I would do about the trip(a couple of thousand dollars were spent in bookings already). The fwb was unhappy that I found someone but insisted I carry on with the trip and we would just travel as 'friends'. So, like an idiot I continued with the plans. Even before I went to the house, the person fought with me saying I cheated on them and all sorts or nonsense and that continued throughout up to one point where I didn't have my passport on me anymore! I tried to resolve this without making the situation worse and agreed to continue the trip(I so didn't want to anymore by then but I had dug a hole myself)

There was no question of any physical attraction or whatever anymore(especially after that fight) yet I woke up one morning to them going at it on my genitals without my consent. I definitely resisted but they wouldn't let me go. I had to eventually give in and let them do it because I felt guilty of hurting this person. This happened one more time during the trip and I got out of that place when I could and have never ever spoken to or gotten in touch with them again.

I am in a monogamous relationship with my current partner ever since and they have no idea about this. I keep telling myself I'm guilty and deserve what happened and that my consent doesn't matter. Yet, I feel sad that I was forced to do something like that when I absolutely did not want to.

I don't know what to do, I force myself to erase that memory from my mind but have so far only managed to suppress it until it keeps popping up again. Thanks for reading this if you have, I feel lighter just typing it out.

482,"So, growing up I was always the outcast. I had  serious diagnosed OCD in 4th grade which resulted in me being bullied and such. The problem was extremely severe and led to multiple confrontations with the police, professional help, multiple suicide attempts, and medication. I don't want to regale you with details but it was bad. This experience really messed me up. I knew I was different and abnormal compared to everyone else. My schoolmates certainly treated me better after I solved the issue, but I always knew I was second tier. If someone had to leave the lunch table it was always me. As a result of feeling like an outcast I never really got involved in a lot of stuff other kids did. So, my best friend dated the girl I had a crush on and I was fine with that cause I didn't intend to date. This sorta mentality embedded itself in me. It resulted in me being reclusive in high school. As a result I never did a lot of stuff other kids did. For reference, my high school famously had a drug problem yet I was never even offered anything. Lots of kids hooked up, but I never did. I'm 19 years old and I still haven't had my first kiss. I googled it. You know how many college freshman have lost virginity? 70%. You know when most people have their first kiss? 13-15. I'm in the minority in both of those figures. I am once again abnormal. How can I be interesting to people when everyone else has done more interesting stuff with their lives? Why would anyone want to talk to me when they can talk to someone who has interesting stories about how the cops busted their alcohol infused high school party or whatever. I'm just fundamentally less interesting. 

Now, you may say: ""this is easy, if you feel too innocent compared to everyone, just go be not innocent"". Well here's the thing. Last night a bunch of my friends got together. I didn't find out until later was only get to hang with them for like an hour. They were together for several hours. I never get invited to shit I have to go over to their side of the dorm floor and invite myself. I constantly feel like a burden. I feel u welcome. This isn't a one time thing, it's happened a lot where I miss out on stuff. I can't do non innocent stuff alone, that's just sad. But if those people don't want me what do I do? Franky, what I want most in the world rn is to feel accepted by those people, but I just don't feel it. IDK how much this is self hate, ocd, or real. I want to sit down and talk to one of them and get them to be real with me and tell me what fears are justified and what ones aren't but frankly that seems wimpy and weak right?

I also have a very strong tendency to beat myself up over the slighest mistake. I beat myself up because I haven't done drugs but it i did do them I'd beat myself up cause I funded cartel violence. If I ask out a girl I'll beat myself cause I'll accuse myself of just doing it cause you felt like you should've done it by age 19 and don't actually want to be in a relationship. If I don't do it I beat myself up because I haven't done it by age 19. Then add onto thks the convene that a lot of what I'm insecure about reads like an incel wrote it so I'm worried that I'm misogynistic and bigoted at my core. This goes against all my values and so on top of all of this I'm worried I'm secretly a terrible person. There's no winning. I feel abnormal, different, and weird compared to everyone else and honestly I really hate myself for it. I haven't talked about these problems with people close to me because I would look weird and that's not what I want. At the same time, I worry that by not talking about it I am being unhealthy. And of course, all this worrying makes me anxious that I'm being too sensitive and not manly. Hell I beat myself up for a week cause I listened to a taylor swift song.

486,"I recently got a basic cashier job to make some extra cash during the pandemic. Prior to this I’ve only worked as a nanny and as a waitress, and at both those previous jobs I was expected to leave and clock out on time at the end of my shift. 

However, at this new job, that doesn’t seem to be the case. Almost every single time my shift is “over” there is usually still a line of customers waiting to be rung up by the 2 or 3 working cashiers, and I’ll usually stay and get everyone rung up until the line is gone and then I clock out about 10 min late and leave.

But on Saturday my shift ended at 6, and I had an appointment I had to make it to by 6:30. Saturday’s are the busiest days at the store by far, and by 6:05 there was still a very long line in front of all the cashier registers. If I stayed and waited for the whole line to die down it would have been at least an additional 15 min and I simply didn’t have that extra time on that evening, so I rung up a few more customers before putting up the “register closed” sign and hurrying out. 

However, just as I was about to walk out the doors my manager stopped me to talk to me. He basically said ‘your shift isn’t over at 6, it’s over when the line of customers is gone.’ I apologized and said it wouldn’t happen again, but am I in the wrong for expecting to be able to leave when my scheduled shift is over? If they expect me to show up on time, shouldn’t I expect to leave on time? 

I know it isn’t a huge deal, but my time is valuable to me and they never seem to schedule enough cashiers for busy nights like Saturdays. They have plenty of high school and college kids that work there and would be available to stay, but instead they assign only 2 or 3 cashiers and then seem surprised when it’s not enough. 

Am I in the wrong or is it common sense to not close up your register when there’s still a line of people in front of it? I have a bit of social anxiety and this has been bothering me all weekend :/",16Nov2020,2

490,"I (15f) have never been happy where I live (texas). I hate the climate, the politics, and over all the snooty rich people. Everything here is about how much money you have and how you show it off. There is also some other things that make me hate where I live but I'd rather keep that stuff private. I was talking to my grandmother last night and she had mentioned me living with her. She lives on the other side of the country so it would be a big change, but it's a change I want to make. I would go to the all girls school across the street and I think I'd be happier. My mother was the one that came up with the idea, but now that I'm actually serious about it, she's mad that I'm wanting to go. She doesn't want her mother to get her daughter. I go to my grandmothers house every summer, so this summer when I go, I will be bringing more than I normally do. Then, towards the end of the summer, that's when I'll make my final decision and I'll tell my dad. He is very against me even visiting my grandma for the summer, let alone me living with her. But when I live with her, I will be getting a job so I can come home for holidays and any time I may have off from school. I was planning on moving there after highschool for college, so it's not like it's that big of a change. This just seems like the best plan for my happiness right now. I can't live where I do anymore. It's not good for me. So, reddit, should I move in with my grandma all the way across the country? Or should I just stick it out for the last two years of highschool and risk my happiness?",16Nov2020,2

I'm afraid **I'm not ready to handle real life since I'm emotionally vulnerable** and could get myself used/hurt in addition to offending everyone I talk to (since I have so much anger/hurt and vulnerability) that I don't even know if I can get a sublet secured for **Dec 1st.** I could cancel things and lose a couple hundred dollars, and **plan an exit for a later date** (Though that may not happen). **Wait until I have a job but that may be until June.** Or I can move forward with all the stresses of living on my own, spending capital, having no one to talk to, not feeling secure or safe.

496,"I closed on the 10th. Pulled the washer out to clean behind it on the 13th. There was water pooling underneath it, uh oh. Figured the washer was leaking. Cleaned up and let it dry out. The next day, Sunday the 14th, I had a contractor over and mentioned I was worried. The wall was still wet and when I went to touch it, my hand went right through. Black mold in the walls. 

The contractor saw evidence that the same wall had been patched up. This is a manufactured home and instead of VOG it was drywall where the water damage is. So someone must have saw it and “fixed it” already once? This was not disclosed from the seller. 

The inspector missed the water damage. My contractor could see it from under the crawl space without being all the way under. Huge water spots where the sellers had duct tape the insulation bag over. Additionally, the shower leaks straight onto the subfloor from the shower pan. So the washer/dryer area, master bedroom closet, and master shower at least are effected. The hot water heater drywall has also been replaced and not disclosed. 

Advice.... was the inspector responsible for missing the water damage? Are the sellers responsible for not disclosing? Do I just get a lawyer? Take tons of pics? Please don’t tell me I am SOL.

The best job I EVER had was at a club. I did very well for myself and almost never had to leave early. I think because it was a dark environment, and I was already putting up a facade so it made it easier to blend.) The job I currently have has pushed me to my limits. The customers are hell, the workers are hell, even my managers are horrid people who can tell I’m different and single me out for it. It makes me feel like I’ll never be capable of being independent. I WANT to be capable. But I don’t think I’m capable of “normal” jobs. Is there a quiet hobby out there that can support a living?

(M22) so I have been in some what of a tough situation, me and my long term girlfriend broke up a couple months ago and since then I've reached out to some people she wouldn't let me talk to before hand, including two of my ex""s.

And I get that I'm not mad at her for that we communicated properly and we both agreed before we started connecting that we weren't looking for anything relationship wise. Things changed for me though over time and honestly, I'm in love with her now, but see now my two ex""s that I've been trying to only be friends with are seeming to reconnect their feelings for me as well and I mean I am very flattered and I flirt back here and there but honestly I just think about how we broke up for a reason and I know that I can't be my 100% self around then like I can with the girl I'm truest interested in.

520,"Hi, I have just came from confrontation between me and father, desperately need help on course of action I should go through.

My father has a incredibly bad temper, that even he's in a bad mood, he would lash out on anything provocatively. This was quite terrible back then I was a child but he's calm down more with cycles of religious atonement (which has it's own problems but that's for another time), but it's still there, breaking applicances and occassional belts here and there.

This doesn't mean he's abusive. He's alright, would be terrible role model, as most of our family problems came from him but I do love him as much as my mom.
Honestly, it made us, incredibly fearful of him, watching out what we say when around him. 

However, occasionally slip up do happen, and it's happened today. 

So after my father came home, he asked my eldest (younger) sister. Who did not turn off the TV?, This escalated to what I pressumed, having annoyed my sister and make a sound out of it. I came in, asking me the same question. I answered it's probably my youngest sister, who I saw needed to go to her room for something. 

After having to greet him, He's started being angry about my sister being disrespectful. After my father threw clothes and beated with the belt once at my eldest sister. And it escalated to threaten to beat my youngest, until my father was stopped by my mother. After escorted my sister into her room, my foolish brain burp out, that 

""He's shouldn't spread his temper towards us""

This enraged my father and asked me to say that again, which I did, and he's threaten me to beat me with a nearby standing fan, by grabbing it but was stopped by my mother, and she told me to back to my room.

And that's where I'm at. The strange thing, that this's my first time talking back, and it's felt great. Unforunately, it's back to no talking again...

This has happened almost thrice this year and countless more from before. So I really want to find resolution to this shit before more come...

528,"I know this is pretty long, but please hear me out...
I (16 F) have a pretty close online friend (16 F), who I'll call Ava. Ava and I are part of a really close-knit online 5-person friend group, and we regularly zoom and chat daily. We all text each other personally as well, and all of us have pretty good friendships with each other. 

I've never really questioned my sexuality before, and assumed I was straight since I was interested in guys. However, I've always found Ava quite cute, but always dismissed it. I will admit that my fleeting moments of interest did cause me to question my sexuality a bit though, but it mostly faded away after a while. Honestly, I didn't think she was very conventionally attractive; she has a habit of goofing off and acting a bit silly pretty often.

Ava later came out as a lesbian, but she's never apparently liked anyone before. We all accepted her. My feelings for her didn't really change at that point.

It kind of started to get a little bit heated one day though. It started when I complimented how she looked in a picture, and to my surprise, I got a genuine compliment back... and for some reason there was a bunch of tension in the air after that. We started flirting around quite a bit and teasing each other. And the scales kind of tipped further when during a Truth or Dare game, both of us admitted that in our friend group, if we had to pick, we'd date each other. (That eventually led us to being shipped mercilessly by our friends)

The flirting could be considered platonic up to a point- I've messed around with other friends a lot... however it started to feel markedly different. I'm not sure if this was because I was beginning to feel differently about her at this point. The flirting started getting more intense, to a point that we'd playfully invent scenarios where we ended up kissing.

It started messing with my head at this point, and honestly, it got to a point where I couldn't stop thinking or dreaming about her, and how it would feel to actually live out the scenarios we'd created. I knew that Ava lived in the next state, but... yeah.

I wasn't sure if she liked me, or if I even really liked her. I mean, maybe all the flirting was just really messing with me... but I found it hard to stop, it was kind of addicting. I think both of us were realising the relationship wasn't exactly platonic at this point though.

We kind of started pushing the boundaries and wondering whether we really did like each other, and eventually when I did ask her, she responded with a maybe. She told me that she never talked to anyone as much as she talked to me, and she thought i was really cool and she always considered me her favourite in our friend group. I unfortunately got a bit carried away when she asked me if i liked her... i ended up telling her that i couldnt stop thinking about her.

We had a zoom later that day, and even after everyone else had left, we stayed behind. She flirted a lot with me, honestly, but I was starting to feel a little worried. 

She's never liked anyone before, and she's repeatedly joked that she doesn't know what love feels like. And I was concerned that I was somehow pulling her into a situation where she kind of felt obliged to like me back. She kept saying she wasn't sure of her feelings, and I was starting to feel uncertain about mine too. Besides, even if she did end up liking me, I would be miles apart.

So that night, I told her exactly how I felt about the situation and I said we should probably keep things platonic until we were sure. She responded surprisingly positively, and honestly gave me the impression that she felt really relieved of the situation, although she said it didnt ever make her uncomfortable.

But later I started feeling really hurt and awful, and I'm not sure why. I cried quite a bit and sort of felt heartbroken, although nothing really bad happened. I'm really not sure why I feel this way, but I kind of feel indirectly rejected? Not to mention, I'm still really confused about my feelings for her and still feel bad for putting her in that sort of a situation. I've never been interested in a girl before, which makes the situation feel unreal. 

I'd really appreciate it if someone could give me some advice or clarity about whether she/I actually have feelings for each other, and whether I read into the situation too much. I'm also really unsure what to do next, because she hasn't talked to me in a while after that...",16Nov2020,2
529,"I'm a black 23 F and I recently just told my mother that I am dating a white man. My parents have this paranoia about me or my siblings dating white people because of racism and not being able to identify with them well, so I was aware of the pushback I was going to get. Initially after the reveal, ahe was shockingly chill, which through me off guard and had me fooled into thinking she was down with it as long as my bf was a decent person. However, as days went on, she started saying mad weird crap that's really been setting me off. 

She started asking me if I was considering marriage, or if I was even ready to get into this relationship. It was only a few months before, mind you, that she had been encouragung me to date again, and even try to get back with my ex eventually after he went and got some other girl pregnant shortly after our break up. Now she's  questioning everything about my decision making with this current relationship, and blaming my dad and herself for not putting me in ""black enough"" spaces when I was younger. Just yesterday she had sent me links for black social groups I can find here in NYC, and she claims that she's not doing this to ostracize my bf, but considering how she's doing all this after the bf reveal, I can't help but feel she's doing all this because of him.

533,"So, I feel like the person that I once considered my best friend is sick of me. I don’t remember a time where I was truly happy and I think that negatively impacted our friendship. From the beginning til the end he hardly told me things (such as getting a new job, anything exciting, new romances, secrets, etc) about himself, but instead would discuss it with other people. I began doubting myself, and felt so insecure about our friendship. I became needy and so concerned that he would replace me and find someone better (continuing to make me feel even worse) which then damaged us even more.

I guess the space was slow at first, but recently we never talk and it makes me feel so shit that I’ve lost my person. I miss him so much, but what hurts is that I know he doesn’t care about me the same way that I care for him. For example, I want to call him but whenever I do it’s a dry conversation which makes me regret calling in the first place.

I’m sorry, I guess I needed this more to rant, but do you guys think I should try save this friendship (which I’ve been trying to do - and if yes, how) or just leave him alone... 
It hurts me so much to think he won’t be in my life, but  I must’ve expected too much from him. I regret that so much as it only pushed us further away. I’m sorry.

535,I'm very social awkward but I want to break out of that and actually make friends in college and not be a sad loner again. How do I not do that. I'm doing an animation course if that helps with the advice. Thank you all,16Nov2020,1
536,"Hi there and thank you for reading my post. 

I would like some advice please. 

Me (24F) and my fiancé (23M) are engaged and we want to get married more than anything. But we are both very socially awkward and we prefer smaller quiet occasions to big social ones. 

After the events of this year we have decided that we want to make the most of our life and get married in an office on the day we got together 8 years later. We have lived with each other for two years and we are madly in love and this is what we both want. 

However, due to the uncertainty of the situation of the pandemic next year, we are only allowed to invite two witnesses to the ceremony and we are happy with that idea as it will be a small private ceremony and we want our mothers to be the witnesses. 

His mother will be very happy, but I know the rest of his family will feel left out and excluded, like his sisters, who he is very close to,  which we really don’t want but they may hold grudges and make this a little difficult for us. 

My mother on the other hand is very religious and I’m not, and she would want a massive church wedding with everyone invited and she would insist that it’s what my late grandmother would want also. 

I’m really torn between everyone because I care about everyone and wouldn’t want to put them at risk with the virus going round and I wouldn’t want to make people think that I’m being “selfish and pushing everyone else away”. 

I’m scared and I don’t want to upset anyone but this is what me and my husband to be want. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

Thank you.",16Nov2020,1

I want to learn something interesting that will also help me in the long run.

I want to major in aerospace engineering or computer science. I self learned programming for a while but it got boring and there were no projects that were around my level except game dev which I did plenty of (very time-consuming, I gotta say). I want to do aerospace engineering because I think rockets and those things are really cool. This field requires math and physics. I am doing good with math so I don't think I need to worry about that.

I actually considered starting learning physics because I plan on taking AP Physics in the following years, but physics is really broad and it's very intimidating so I don't know where to start.

I want to learn something that would actually end in a profit in the near future.

Well, I don't really care about the single life, but I have been so frustrated about being stuck in the same situation for years. To be able to get a job in my country, I need to have a degree or at least have a high school diploma (for a waitressing job). But I left year 10 due to some traumas I had and obtained a university foundation diploma overseas instead. (Which is utterly useless here!) That diploma was supposed to be a pathway to my university degree, but I had to drop out of it due to several life-changing incidents. I was supposed to graduate with a BSc at 19 (yes, legitimately.) and planned to be financially independent at 20. But damn, I can't even afford to get a new pair of knickers now. 

I'm so desperate to go back to studying and just become something for myself. I know I've got something to offer to this world but I can't seem to get out of this horrific cycle. I get accepted to good universities but always have to reject them due to my finances. I'm so embarrassed of my life and I'm getting really exhausted with the constant disappointment. I don't even have anyone to talk to about this because I'm losing all the small number of friends and family I had over the years and I'm just too ashamed of my life to be socialising.

Before anyone ask:

\- there's no government subsidies/loans for tertiary education.

\- the legal minimum wage here is appx. 200euros/month and the waitressing jobs that I cant even land usually pays appx. 90euros/month. What's funny is 90euros is less than what I got EACH DAY as a waitress when I was studying overseas.

After spending some time at S home, I made the decision that she needed immediate help and contacted our Step father M.

One of the things S said involved memories that I had locked away so tightly I didnt know they existed until she said, don't you remember A (family friends son), don't you remember his pool table. The second S said it my brain was overflowing with memories of being molested from age 4yrs to 9yrs. It went on in A dads basement where his room was. Sometimes my grandparents or my aunt and even my mom were upstairs visiting with his dad while it was happening. S who was 2 1/2 years older witnessed some of it and never told anyone, even me.

About a year later I moved in to her house after her parents gave it to her. When I moved in everything was fine but she slowly started to isolate me from my family and friends without me really realizing. Afterwards she started to sort of physically abuse me: pushing me a bit, lightly dragging me somewhere. At first I didn't mind it too much but over the 2 years living with her the abuse has gotten worse and worse each day, it feels like I have marks and bruises on my body permanently.

Three days ago she struck me in the ribs with a chair so hard that I thought some were actually broken. I finally decided to call the police and an ambulance. They arrived and the paramedics barely checked me out and told me and the police that my ribs were fine, so the officers thought that I'm lying. I showed the officers my other bruises but my girlfriend made some story that I'm a drunk and fight with others and they believed her and just left.

He told me very frequently that he loved me, and was quite... open about his physical attraction to me.

""It's really really important""

""You're the only one I can trust with that""

""Please help, I really need you to correct it for me""

575,"Hello! 14M writing here.

I am in a new school with new people. 

Recently, I've been growing a little wary of a few people in my class.

One of them is N. N is good in sports. I am not. He isn't great in a lot of subjects at which I excel at. 

N regularly calls me in the middle of online classes to ask me what should we do. He doesn't thank me at all. Same with A - who is a girl who does those things..

The second one is G. G is a girl who
- took a week to respond to a serious question regarding a yearbook shoot I needed to make
- also did this:

Context: In Sports, the teacher selects a few students to present training sessions to train the class, so we can get a grade on an assignment which is 18% of the semester grade. So, I had to do the right thing - question the 2 girls which would also make training plans tomorrow, and ask them which muscles are they going to train up, so the exercising tomorrow can be helpful to as much muscles as possible.

Contents of answer:
A voice message with N talking and G and A laughing behind him
- ""gogoks, we will be making a lot of push-ups, a lot of exercises for the chest, the legs, etc. I will be surprised if you all manage to come back to school without your bodies aching to the fullest.""

N doesn't take part in the trainings tomorrow. However, A does.

I feel like they are making fun of me. For no reason.

Ignoring hasn't helped it at all - I've ignored them for a month.

What should I do exactly? I want this tampering with my authority (I am a representative of the section that both of them are in - so I am closer to the deans of the class of '25 than them) to stop - what should I do that doesn't damage my reputation in front of other classmates and doesn't expel me from the school?

After quarantine, I noticed he started losing alot of weight which made me worried. He hates many different foods and is stubborn when it comes to eating. He accepts foods like spiced nuts, rice, popcorn, crackers/biscuits, swiss cheese slices, mangoes, chocolate, and peeled apples. I noticed there are foods he recently started to become very repulsed to eating them despite eating them everyday and was okay with it.

579,"Hi, (23) F here.

Recently I started talking to a guy and he seemed to be very interested in me, texts back fast, eager to meet up and see me, wanting to talk on the phone etc, but it's been a day now and he's gone MIA and hasn't responded to any of my texts. I just want to know why this keeps happening to me. Whenever I find someone I like, they just disappear on me with no explanation and I'm getting tired of feeling unwanted and so damn lonely.  I see all my friends are happy in relationships and I think to myself about why I can't have something like that and why I just keep getting left on read. Is it because I'm too good? I'm too nice to people? All I know is I'm so tired and I've completely lost hope. I'm starting to believe that I'm just destined to be alone",16Nov2020,59
580,"Hi, as title states. My step mom isn't really my step mom by law, her and dad have been dating on and off for a few years and I've lived with her for the last two and a half years. She met me when I was in a bad relationship and watched me deteriorate from that, such as unexplained illnesses and severe depression, all the way up to my diagnosis of PTSD, Bipolar disorder, and symptoms of BPD. I was in a very aggressive form of therapy and shut myself off from the outer world for a while and didn't speak as much because I had to determine what was good for me, but I digress.

Fast forward to Christmas last year, I started to date my current boyfriend, who is the most wonderful person in the world. I truly admire everything about him. He's my whole heart. The only downside is that he lives 14 hours away from me. Even then, the love is strong and I'll always take the chance to see him.

Fast forward to August of this year. My grandfather suddenly passes away from the most horrible case of lung cancer that had spread to his brain. The day he died, I had to be strong for my dad so I didn't allow myself to cry until about a week later. My step mom took this personally, and got mad because my boyfriend wasn't here. She started to suggest I date her son because my boyfriend wasn't there. I kept quiet about it because she doesn't understand.

Fast forward to now and the last month. Her son has been over at my house non stop. All day. Everyday. He has two kids of his own and owns his own home in a different town, but he's here at my house in the bad side of the city instead. I'd come home from work to find him sleeping in my bed. He shows up when I'm doing school. They both INSIST I break up with my boyfriend. My step mom even said that if I were to move to Florida, she'd slice my tires and make sure I can't make it down there. I'd move down there tomorrow if it weren't for college, and I graduate in 11 weeks. Now they're talking about kicking me out to his house. 

It's so bad even dad's in on it. My dad, who thought my boyfriend was awesome, was telling me one night ""(insert step brother's name) is a better man."" I can't escape it. I can't leave my home and I'm completely stuck until I can graduate. I don't know what to do. I have no friends to move in with.

582,"I met this person a year or two after I moved to the city and thought they were lovely. They warned me about how horrible &amp; toxic the local industry was and I almost ended up working for them. Initially, I really admired them. They do good work and are very vocal about ethics in our unregulated industry. They placed themselves in positions of authority and have respectable credentials.  

We had a bit of a falling out due to some minor issues and for the most part have just kept distance from each other. Over the next year or so I began to hear people talk poorly of this person but I brushed it off, figuring people were just people and either jealous or judgemental (which is common in my industry). I continued to view this person as a good person who was just under a lot of scrutiny. Recently, they publicly shamed via social media their friend's business partner and accused them of intellectual theft (not of their own material, but a different company). They used it as an opportunity to promote their new mentorship program. I have come to realize this person is prideful, egotistical, and worst of all willing to build their brand by stepping on others. They lack accountability (for example, they refused to acknowledge their part in our falling out and only ""considered"" talking to the person they publicly shamed after backlash from industry peers) for their actions and I suspect see nothing wrong with how they have behaved and will continue to behave in a similar manner. They are intelligent and good at their job and I think they will continue to succeed and grow. 

Their success bothers me as I don't feel they ""deserve"" it given their personal failings to be a good person. I know this isn't how the world works and I know I'm operating on the false idea that good things happen to good people and bad things happen to bad people.

583,"I graduated from college earlier this year and decided to take a gap year to kind of figure out what I wanted to do in life. This was a risky move because as a brown girl, there are certain things my family expects me to do by a certain age. 
It isn’t common for girls in my family to go to university because of multiple reasons, the biggest being that they’ll begin thinking for themselves and not just doing everything their parents tell them to do.
I’m only 19, but at the age of 17 I was told that I was to be married by 25 at latest and that thought honestly depressed me. 
That’s a bit of a background for my story. So me taking a gap year was basically a wasted year. I want to have a good job. I want one that’s well paying and preferably in medicine, but I won’t be able to continue studying after I get married (maybe for a year I might but I doubt that too). I just really don’t know what to do.

When I was around fifteen or sixteen years old, I got to know a girl. We first became friends and later some sort of a couple. However, we did never talk about us being a couple and, for some weird reason, we did not really communicate about things like sex at all. Although this was the case, we made our first sexual experiences. We, however, did Not have penetrative sex. I used to finger her from time to time, while she sometimes jerked me Off.
In hindsight, I think that I used to be the one to initiate Most of the time. I never asked her for her consent, which makes me feel Bad.
On the other hand, she never told me to Stop or shoved my Hand away or Something. After all though,I think that I do feel like she was Not very active during this things Happening.

593,"This will be lengthy to provide context:

I am a 22 year old college student that usually lives away from home year round. Starting in March, however, I came home due to school being moved online for quarantine reasons. I spent 5 months at home living with my mom and brother until going back to school in August.

During the summer, my mom fell into a very dark place. Being that she is almost of age to be considered “at risk” of COVID-19, she understandably stayed home as much as possible. Her work is now 100% remote, so leaving the house isn’t a necessity. A breakup along with the lack of socialization turned her from her usual fun, positive, energetic self into a very cranky and complaint-heavy individual.

During the summer, I went through my own battle with mental health. I finally ended an extremely toxic 4 year relationship as well as addressed my own problems with anxiety and depression. Dealing with that on top of listening to my mother’s daily complaints and attitude took a drastic toll on my mental health. After moving back to school, my mental health slowly recovered and I feel the best I have in years. During this time, the restrictions in my hometown also lifted, and my moms attitude returned to normal as she was allowed to socialize again (safely).

I am now back in town for Thanksgiving week, and the county announced new restrictions for the winter months. Already, my mom has returned to the cranky, negative person she was over the summer. She complains daily, even hourly, about how bored she is, how there’s nothing to watch on tv, how the book she’s reading sucks, literally anything. She also constantly tells me stories about the latest Covid-19 death counts, the latest of her acquaintances who have tested positive, and other depressing things. Very rarely does a positive sentence come out of her mouth. I hang out with her often, and have offered numerous times to go hiking, cook dinner together, etc. None of these options interest her either, even though she normally loves them.

While I sympathize strongly with her situation, I already feel myself developing anxiety and being brought down by her constant negativity just in this week of being home. I am dreading the thought of dealing with this for a month over winter break given how much my mental health has improved, though I absolutely will not leave her alone for the holidays. How can I talk to her about her attitude in a productive and kind way?",16Nov2020,1

599,"So I live in a shitty small apartment, I even made a quick sketch of the blueprint [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/HMjrLhS). I’m going on a rant of what the place looks like. The living room is pretty small, it’s connected to the kitchen. But the living room is a hoarders mess. Like there’s stuff all over the place. And all of my stuff are in boxes, it’s all dusty too. The floor is dusty. And I keep sneezing because of it. My parents blamed it on me not going to sleep. I do online school in the corner of my living room, but I feel uncomfortable talking because my family member might hear me. Also my oldest brother(32)’s family lives with us. But he lives in the 2nd bedroom with his family. He has a girlfriend(31) and a daughter(11). I get annoyed sometimes when someone is going to the kitchen. 

I sleep with both of my parents (56F and 65M) and my older brother(23M) in one bed. Our bedroom doesn’t even have a door. We just have curtains. I get annoyed when my parents gets ready for work and I can’t even focus on my online class. Then my dad wouldn’t shut up. And my older brother has a alarm clock on his phone, that’s so annoying. He doesn’t even turn it off. He has ADHD also, so he moves around a lot and it’s annoys me. Our bedroom is a hoarders mess as well. Our clothes are in bags and my mom has a online shopping addiction. Also my dad and my older brother likes to watch tv late at night and I can’t even sleep. Then my mom gets annoyed when it’s too hot or if it’s too cold in the bedroom. I can’t even have time for myself without anyone’s bothering me. Also they had sex and it always wakes me up. But they’re not doing it anymore.

I hate the bathroom, there’s mold on the ceiling. And there’s leaky pipes, so I smell shit when I turned on the shower. My oldest brother acts like a literal man child. He’s always jumping around when he’s 32 and holy shit he’s so ignorant. Also me, my niece, and his gf were watching the new Spongebob movie. And he literally got mad about it because he doesn’t like Spongebob. He’s getting mad over a children’s cartoon. What the hell. Like when he saw something he doesn’t like, he would make fun of it. This guy literally has the audacity to made fun of a baby on YouTube. Like he watches this YouTube family channel, so the dad is black and white right. The mom is Asian. And their kids are mixed. He said that one of them doesn’t look like the dad. Then he would say stuff like, “that baby looks annoyingly Asian” or “that’s not his kid.” Both of my brothers don’t like each other, so I’m afraid that my older brother is going to snap at my oldest brother. 

I did live in a house before when I was younger, but we had to move out. My mom blames my dad for losing the house. Before we just moved to apartment to another apartment to another apartment. I don’t even have my own bedroom before. I know I’m suppose to be grateful that I have a roof over our head. But I can’t take it anymore.

601,"Hi,

Basically, at the weekend, someone drove into the side of me while entering a petrol garage. 

There are two entrances to this particular garage: one at the back, straight into the pumps from a side road and one to the right hand side of the garage from the main road. 

I was coming down the side road, turn left into the garage to go straight to the pumps. 

The other driver came up the main road, turning left into the side entrance of the garage. She didn't even see me. When I entered the forecourt, she was not on the forecourt. At all. 

Then as I'm moving forward, I look again and she is now on the forecourt and about to go into the side of me. 

She hit my rear drivers door and wheel arch. 

My entrance says ""welcome - this way"". Hers has no visible signage. 

Who was at fault? 

If it was my fault, I don't want to blame someone for something they haven't done but at the same time, if it was her fault, surely she shouldn't dispute it? 

At the scene she admitted fault and then offered to pay cash to fix my car which I would have done, had it not been for the fact it would have invalidated my lease.

He’s this handsome absolutely shredded guy (I assume handsome, masks make things weird but he at least has super intense eyes).

I'm an average Russian provincial second year student and I study as an interpretor for governments money (It's called budget education in Russia). But one year ago my mom has died in an accident. It was hard to overcome, I had a really hard depression (Including the difficulties of being an interpretor, like gigantic homeworks and some other things in my university activity). But it has got even worse when my dad has started to drink alcohol (Yeah, vodka, beer, etc.). He was a worker at the city enterprise and had a small salary like 20 thousand roubles (about 300 dollars), but because of coronavirus and enterprise's budget crisis he was fired. And then he got a lot of debts from the bank and his friends. I was trying to overcome even those problems, but I couldn't (I have to study otherwise I would be kicked).

616,"Ok so my boyfriend (22M) and I (19F) have been together for about 6 months, but we have been friends for longer than that. I just found out on Saturday that I am pregnant and I am 100% having an abortion. We have discussed this prior and we were always dead set on not having kids until we are older (in general, not necessarily with each other). Although I was heavily debating on whether or not I should tell him about the pregnancy even though I was getting rid of it, I ended up telling him bc I knew that if he found out down the road this would be a breach of trust. We are very open with each other. He told me to not worry too much ab it bc I was nervous ab telling him, and that he is grateful that I told him. However, after having a very DRY, normal conversation, he abruptly  said ""I'm gonna give you some space."" I asked him what he meant and why, tried texting him a couple times throughout the next day, and he kept on ignoring me. I'm assuming that HE is the one that needed space because I did not, I needed his fucking support. I know this news was probably overwhelming to him and maybe that's why? But anyway, on Sunday he ignored me all day then today he wants to act like none of that happened. When I brought up that he just straight ignored me when we were supposed to be open with each other, he just said he was giving ME space. Maybe I'm just emotional bc I'm 2 months pregnant, but do I have the right to be kinda upset about this? I just wanted an explanation from him bc I had been VERY honest with him. I don't have any family or really close friends out here to talk to ab the abortion, all I wanted was for him to support me through it and he just wanted to disappear when I needed him  the most.

Some background info that may be useful: I am absolutely horrible at talking ab and showing emotion, he is very sweet and always reminds me how much he likes me and misses me when we aren't together. I have a hard time doing this myself and he gets frustrated sometimes because I just don't talk ab my feelings. So this was kinda shocking because usually he's the one that wants to talk to me all the time and he NEVER ignores me even tho, admittedly, I ignore him sometimes.

Maybe I'm overthinking this idk, but I don't want to lose him and I can feel the energy is different now.

I have no fucking clue how I’d mention it to my therapist.

I remember seeing creepy zoophiles on twitter and the fact that I’m probably one of them is absolutely horrifying. My brain feels like its shifting. I don’t want to like animals. I don’t want everyone I’ve ever looked up to hate me. I want to tell my friends and family about this but they’d never see me the same way again. I feel ill.",16Nov2020,0

Around September I met a guy in a subreddit and he turned out to be really sweet. We eventually exchanged other social media, leading to us hitting it off pretty well. We were feeling each other so well that we brought up dating, but decided against it due to way too far of distance. Ever since September we would message each other everyday along with hanging out via Discord.

   But ever since an incident with his online friends in a Discord sever, I felt like he began to lose interest due to me becoming negative. He was supportive of me speaking up about what bothered me, but I could feel something shift. Besides that specific incident, this is around the time I started to feel worse mentally. In late October my family started fighting again, making me feel even worse than I did before. I confided with him about what happened but this is during the time in which I could tell I was probably annoying him by being too negative. I wouldn’t be flat out pessimistic all the time, but if something was bothering me in life I would talk about it.

   More recently with the US presidential election it stressed me out even worse than before. It got to the point in which I responded very negatively to a snapchat he sent me. I realized how toxic and negative I was becoming and the impact I was having on others I knew, including him. Flash forward to Tuesday and I reached out to him asking if he was interested in the possibility of a long distance thing since I’ve been thinking about more, to him responding he needed to focus on school, work, and his mental health. I totally understood and I assumed we can continue on being friends, to which he said sounded good. But just last night I realized he blocked me on Discord, Snapchat, and Steam. He never reached out again after Tuesday and I assumed he decided to take a break from social media, but apparently I was blocked ever since the last time we talked. 

   I feel so horrible because I ruined the chance of developing a friendship due to my negativity. We’ve talked about mental health before and whenever I took a break from social media he said if I ever needed anything to message him. He even works for a mental health facility and told me his own struggles. Because of this I plan to go to therapy (part of the reason why I was scared to go earlier was due to the fear of my parents being in my business; they’re one of the reasons if not THE main reason why I need to go in the first place). Just with my family, lack of motivation in school and life, my own mental health, and 2020 in general, I let it get the best of me, resulting in losing someone I thought was cool. I tried to reach out to him but I deleted the message. He never told me about anything bothering him so this is why this is somewhat of a shock. I know I should give up but it sucks.",16Nov2020,1

My friends are all very successful.of course I am happy for them , but recently one of my friends started her own business , and a few finished their graduate studies while even some got international recognition ...
I am feeling like it is not my place to belong to . It is weird since we are all on good terms and I am genuinely happy for them but cannot shake out the feeling of being left out due to the lack of any sort of achievement on my part.
Not that I don’t try but I keep failing and I have this thought of being embarrassed and wanting to hide my face for good . I cannot keep up with all the conferences they get invited to , webinars ,ect... . 
What can I do to stop thinking about how i should have achieved that many things by now ? That till when will i have to fail and disappoint everyone.",16Nov2020,3

622,"i need to vent

i wish i could cry again, i havent cried in months bc i kept repressing my tears and my feelings to the point where i just cant do it anymore and it sucks becuase it was how i released my emotions so for months now ive been bottling everything up and its finally catching up to me. 

i cant focus on school im failing every test, every night im either cutting (i relapsed after a year) or doing pills in my room (some benzos i found in my house) 

my life is so depressing i cant ask for help i cut off all my irl friends during lockdown except one who i’ve only started to open up to so i cant just bombard her with this, i have online friends and they always say they’re there for me but they always leave me on delivered so i cant talk to them either

i kind of took a social media break and disappeared on them without saying anything for a week and they were all worried about me and i came back because i felt guilty for leaving, i told my online friends i wasn’t okay but that im gonna be fine (another lie) and i was active for a few days but now im on hiatus again

i was overthinking so much about how much of a bad friend i’ve been and wrote three huge apologies to my 3 closest online friends because i couldn’t stop thinking ab how much of a shitty person i was, but i think i ended up worrying them more bc they thought it was suicide note or something, they keep asking if im okay and like i cant keep lying so im ignoring them again bc i don’t know how to respond which is so hypocritical of me because i literally apologised for pushing them away and now i’m doing it again, 

ugh i hate feeling this way. my parents are the least understanding people i know i’ve tried to talk to my mum about my anxiety but she tells me i’m shy and should try fixing my sleep pattern and diet like no i have fucking anxiety an extra hour of sleep wont fix me, she’s a pharmacist so whenever i bring up the idea of me going to my doctor and getting put on some meds she’s totally against it bc she thinks only completely psychotic people take meds

 i’ve never even been diagnosed w anxiety or depression thats another problem, my mind tries to invalidate how im feeling by making me think im just faking my anxiety since i’ve never been diagnosed

i feel so alone and isolated but im the only person to blame for this, i dont see the point of living im not suicidal at least i dont think i am i just dont want to live this life anymore. im sick of being stuck in the same routine having no motivation to do anything but still having to fake being okay 24/7. i dont know how to stop feeling like this please someone tell me how to cope",16Nov2020,1
624,"So, one of my closest friends just mentioned to me that he became friends with a guy he thinks is ""Very cute"" and that he is crushing on him. He then goes on to mention the name of that person, and it's literally my childhood bully. Not even bully, but worse. He's talked a lot of shit about me to many people, spread rumors about me that made people stop talking to me, including most of my high school friends. He and my friend-group all just dropped me out of nowhere, with no explanation during year 11, and I think that among other things he did have affected me a lot. So yeah, there's a lot of hurt and unresolved feelings there, which I thought I was over.

I guess I was caught off guard. I'm just feeling really sad about the whole thing. Like out of anyone in the world, it happened to be that person... When I expressed this to my friend, he used humor to brush it off, and I don't know. Man, this sucks.",16Nov2020,0
626,"I’m in a bit of a pickle. This is more to vent and get my frustration out as I have been super stressed these past weeks. I am part of an honors college where they pay for my classes and give me extra money every semester. But they have rules like you can’t fail a course or drop one. This semester I have took 6 classes including organic chemistry. (My director told me orgo was hard but it was doable with the schedule not to worry) well it turns out I should’ve worried more. 

The other classes have given me a lot of work and by the time I finish everything and study orgo then there isn’t much time left. Being virtual only isn’t helping either as my teachers are giving more work believing that kids aren’t paying attention. This made me start being behind in that class. It’s especially my humanities honor class that gives so much work. This is one of the examples, I had an orgo exam on Tuesday and my humanities class made something due on Friday Sunday and Monday. And saturdays is the only day I work anymore because of school. 

I also have school every day all day. The homework are long and tedious and it’s just been stressful to keep up with everything and Orgo requires so much studying, especially that it’s so hard to understand. My orgo teacher told me that she recommends I drop the class as I had failed the two exams and would fail the class. I opted to drop out so I would at least not affect the GPA. I have a meeting next week with my director where I would most likely be kicked out of the honors college for dropping the course. 

I’m scared and worried especially with how I will tell my parents as they are always bragging about the program and how they are so proud I got in it. I’m also angry at myself for having picked this course which isn’t even part of an AA as I just wanted to get ahead as I wanted to apply to vet school as soon as I could. (I want to apply to a school that only needs an AA and I was trying to do as much as I could so that once I’m out of the program I don’t have to take so many classes that I have to pay and take so long before I could apply.) But now I see I have ruined everything and I’ve just been so stressed out these past few weeks with everything and I don’t know how I’m going to tell my parents. The only one that knows is my boyfriend who has been the biggest support and even he is worried about how I will tell my parents.
 Sorry for the long text it’s just been a long couple of weeks and maybe I’m just being dramatic but writing this helps. 

Short version:

I’m also worried about getting dropped out as they give me a lot of money and benefits at school for being in it.",16Nov2020,2

633,"Normally I am an insanely productive person, only 29F, so I still should have energy. I usually do have a lot! I  work 2 jobs, a 8 to 5 and then usually 5 hours a day on a second job, then 10 to 12 hours on weekends. I really enjoy my second one, so it doesn't feel tiring. I also do Youtube Streams and commissions (normally anyway). 

Lately, I've barely been able to do anything. I haven't drawn really in weeks, almost a month except small sketches and one of my commissions (deadline so I HAVE to). I've barely done anything for my second job (a contract) as I've been away on personal stuff travel related and moving. I feel so exhausted. I haven't uploaded to YouTube or streamed (my usual) in almost 2 months. I don't know what's happened. 

It's like I don't give a fuck anymore about anything and I can't figure out how to get back into my groove. I just got my roommate up here from Florida (to South Dakota) and I'm excited to finally have a friend I know well around.... but before and since I've just... not cared about anything anymore. I have a therapist but I'm afraid to mention it to her. 

My mother is clinically a narcissist (NPD) and BPD (bipolar) and she has been especially nasty the last 5 months or so. On my trip to Florida she was barraging me with demands for updates and insinuating I'd crash and destroy the jeep and uhaul (I'm currently paying off the jeep). This jeep I am buying for 2k, but I have already sank more than that trying to do repairs to fix the neglect on this vehicle. I want this jeep. But she is being unreasonable and still wants the original 2k cause it was a ""as is"" sale. I still don't have the title. I'm super stressed about her demanding the money, I give her 100$ a month or more and her treating me like im a 5yro incapable of living on my own. I work the second job because of my student loans.

I'm just wondering if this is burnout or something worse? How can I get my creative drive back? I'm super busy with 2 jobs and so taking time off isnt really an option. I've already cut off twitch and youtube trying to get some rest but is isn't working. I still feel burntout. I can still stream on YT but I worry my tiredness will worry my viewers and make me boring to watch since I won't be my perky self. I'm a terrible liar and bad at hiding my emotions... just between the stress of working multiple jobs for 5 years, my mom and this jeep, I'm so worn out.

What can I do to get my groove back?

637,"So pretty much what it says above - we've been really good friends for two years now and I moved in with her in July, after she broke up with her now ex bf. (disclaimer - there are 0 feelings between us, we're like brother and sister). 
I'm moving out because I like things pretty clean and tidy and she tend leave plates etc in the sink for a while, and I often have to clear it all up before I cook in the evening, even if she's had the day off work.

 Whenever I've brought it up, she makes excuses.  for me, what tipped the scales was the other night, she came back home from work a couple hours late (it had gotten dark, so I was worried and tried to call her, but no answer). When she did get home, she said her bf was going to be coming over this evening (I don't take issue with this, it was just v short notice) and that she wanted to cook. (I usually do the cooking for the two of us and I was just finishing off cooking dinner, so I felt this was a bit rude)

Besides this, it's quite far from my university (half hour walk) and it's pretty small for two people, but it's a good size for a couple. 
There's a hefty fee for breaking the contract early, but I'd be happy to pay this and I wouldn't move out until I had found someone to take my room. 

How do I tell her?

638,"For a long time whenever i would get angry or sad and someone would ask me why I’m feeling this way I’d just start getting overwhelmed. I’d eventually come up with some lame excuse like “I’m tired” or “I’m stressed” to which the general reply would be “get more sleep” or “spend less time on that phone”. 

I’ve always been the type of person to listen to others and their issues, I kinda think because I’ve never open up I don’t know how to anymore. I’ve been to therapy in the past but I wouldn’t know how to speak to them. I went with my mum one time and she would do most of the talking. Not because she was imposing but because I don’t know how to talk. I would just sit and nod my head politely when talked to. 

I want to be able to tell my parents or my friends how I feel without feeling like my head will implode because I’m struggling to say the right words. I just feel like screaming it out. I’ve found myself becoming much more snappy to my family, just an overall bitch tbh.

640,"For context, I’m a 31-year-old woman who met a 35-year-old guy on a dating app 4 months ago. From the minute we met, we just gravitated toward each other in a way I’ve never experienced before. The majority of our relationship was like a dream, we were all about each other. We met each others’ parents (his mom LOVED me) and a few of each others’ friends who thought I just fit right in with them. It felt so perfect. We have so much in common and agree on a lot of things.

There was an incident with my roommate that caused a lot of stress that I had resolve, as well as an incident with my mom, but things in our relationship really took a downward turn when I caught a cold in mid-October. At the time, I didn’t know if it was COVID, but I wasn’t going to take any chances. I quarantined myself and cancelled plans with my (then) boyfriend until I got the results of my test. Thankfully, I was negative.

A couple days later, my ex and I went to see my family for a small gathering. The night he arrived, my mother had screamed at me and I held in how much that hurt me until my boyfriend went to sleep, then I started crying. He woke up to comfort me. 

A few days after that, my parents were confirmed positive for COVID. Because we were exposed, I immediately went to get tested and though I was negative twice, it caused more tension with my roommate and I felt like I had to leave to get away from the situation. I went to my ex’s and again, he had to comfort me while I was upset.

My parents were sick and my roommate was refusing to speak to me, now I’m so stressed out by everything that’s happening and scared of getting sick myself that I cried the next time we hung out with each other. He comforted me again and said this was starting to affect him, though he didn’t know what the solution might be. Just that it really hurt him to see me this way so much and that there are people in my life who don’t treat me with respect. That was on Sunday, two weeks ago. I could also feel through his texts that he was drifting away from me, but I didn’t want to overthink things.

Things have improved since then. My roommate is talking to me now and I’m able to speak up more against my mom. My ex and I were supposed to meet up for dinner on Thursday the 5th of November. I made his favorite treat for dessert and wore something cute, determined to show him that things were gonna be ok, and we were going to have fun.

We never got to dinner, however. He broke up with me. It essentially boiled down to how things have been really hard. He mentioned how my mother likes to infringe upon my boundaries and I need to develop a stronger sense of self. He said it was really affecting him, making him sad to see how some people in my life treat me. He said he wants me to love myself more. He was crying as he was saying all these things.

He said I was a great, wonderful, fantastic girl. He couldn’t think of many girls more sweet and compassionate than me. It’s just that he was thinking about it and something told him it wasn’t right. He said it’s cliche, but he didn’t want us to be out of each others’ lives. Maybe we can be friends. He said there he’s been with some really awful women that he wants nothing to do with, but I’m someone different. I guess that’s what all the guys say to make themselves feel better.

Ultimately, breaking up really helped me dig deep inside myself. Being alone helped things settle in my life and I have a better grip on things. I’ve been practicing meditations on self love, journaling and writing about all my good qualities. I also noticed that a lot of my stress came from me doing whatever I can to keep him around, like I was so worried he was going to leave at any second. I now realize I don’t have to do that. I also don’t plan on renewing my lease with my current roommate. It’s time I got my own place. 

He never took me off social media and he still watches my Instagram stories, which could mean something or nothing at all. As for me, I was single for years before I met him, so I feel like I’m used to it. I never lost my core identity. I do miss him terribly, and I feel like because of the circumstances, he didn’t get the best version of me. There were so many situations and experiences he didn’t get to see me in. I wish I could reach out to him and talk to him about these things, but another part says it won’t do any good.

I also see a therapist, which I think is a great place to help untangle these feelings too.

I guess my question is, is there hope for reconciliation with this guy, if not now, then down the road. If so, what can I do to improve my chances of us getting back together? He really means a lot to me.

I will wake up feeling really emotional, like today will be my last day alive. It gets so bad, that I end up believing it. I also have insurmountable fear that  I will lose my girlfriend.

""what if she passed away, and that was her coming back to see me?""

I couldn't take this thought, and I started balling. Moments like this don't happen seldom either. They happen once a day or more. I already go to counseling for the abuse as a kid.

My name is Nicky and i am 17 years old living in Belgium. I am in a brand new relationship with a girl that I like a lot. Everything was going alright until she called me saying the following. Her best friend had committed suicide. 

Her best friend that she has known for very long had taken his life last weekend and has left her shattered. I have never been in this situation before. So when she FaceTime called me telling me this news I was speechless. I didn’t know what to say. 

My girlfriend and her best friend used to have a ‘thing’ between each other. You see, her best friend is a guy and they used to go out. Last summer they broke up and that’s when I got to know her. She had told me that they still meet up but I was okay with it because I didn’t want to seem obsessive or needy. So I let her meet up with him. She told me he was mentally unstable so he needed attention and somebody to talk to. And I didn’t want to ruin their friendship. 

Now that he left us it has given me a problem. What do i do? How to I help her. I am afraid that this tragedy will have an affect on our relationship and most importantly her mental health. I let her know that she can talk to me and that I’ll give her space. But what do I do now? When do I message her? Or should I even message her or wait for her to message me?",16Nov2020,1

He and his ex broke up when he moved to the States so their break up was purely bc of distance. He said he would marry her if he stayed. And don’t get me wrong I know he loves me. He really does. He tells me every day, every second like the way he acts is pure love. But I am sure if his ex was here I would be his second choice no matter what.

I (F) have recently started to get in touch with an old friend of mine about a moth ago (M) who I've known since middle school. It's probably worth mentioning that we've been texting each other only, but ever since he's asked me to have a phone call with him some time ago we've been calling each other once or twice a week, as well. I noticed that most of the time he's the one to initiate those phone calls, so I started to initiate as well, because I didn't want him to feel like it's a one sided friendship where he's the only person who has to make the effort.

However, I've wanted to ask him to hang out with me for a while now. I told my friends in school about it and they say that I should definitely do it, but I'm too anxious. One of my worst ""traits"" is that I literally never meet up with people in my freetime as I'm a bit of an introvert, so this aspect makes it even harder for me. We attend the same school, I'm a sophomore and he's a freshman, but we rarely see each other in real life and if we do, it's usually a quick greeting on the hallway when we pass by each other.

I obviously don't plan on asking him to hang out with me during a pandemic right now, but once things get better I wanna meet up with him. How do I even bring it up? And most importantly: Where do we hang out? Are there any suggestions for activities perhaps?",16Nov2020,1

She responded back with “it’s only awkward if you make it awkward”. Stuff like this is some of the comments she has made that just confuse me so much.

I feel pressure to get engaged and have a baby when I shouldn’t because I have so much going on. But I keep seeing people left and right getting engaged and having babies or getting a house and that’s something I’ve wanted for so long. I work my ass off and I’m constantly dealt the shitty hand in life. I’ve had to break so many friendships this year and now I’m starting to block my family for their lack of being incapable of not insulting how my life is when I literally do nothing to them or say hurtful things. But when I had my apartment and paid cash for my car and have been in a more stable place, they had nothing to say. I’m just so tired of being there for people and being nice, and everyone is so quick to say things to me that make me feel even lower with myself. Idk how to keep holding on. I’m sad all the time, I’m stressed, I’ve stopped eating, I can hardly sleep. I don’t understand how I got here when a few months ago everything was fine.

654,"Hello, so I (m25) am in my first job out of college. I work in the student housing world for a company that develops student housing at big universities. Part of the reason I got hired was to plan this large parties to signify our lease launch in new markets. Because of COVID, the lease launch events could not happen because we typically would get around 300+ people into a venue with food, music, drinks etc. My bonus was based off of how many people showed out to that lease launch party. I manage teams of students who attend the university we are building our apartments at. These students' job is to spread the word of our building, hype it up and try to get people to live there.

&amp;#x200B;

I brought this up to my manager and he told me to come up with a new bonus. I don't know how to do that or where to start since this is my first big boy job. I also don't know what to base my bonus off of now. Maybe I can base it off how many leases my student teams got? Any suggestions, tips, guides or help would be very much appreciated.",16Nov2020,1

656,"We are both under 18.  We are long distance and fell in love before I truly knew just how bad her family was.  They manipulate her every day and constantly verbally assault her to the point she becomes depressed and filled with anxiety.  She has hinted at suicide attempts in the past and beatings, but has not outright said it.

Both parents are almost too good at manipulation, from what I have gathered.  Her father is a high ranking officer and I'm afraid his status could make him immune.

I'm not entirely sure what to do.  I don't want her to live through two more years of this but I just dont know what to do.  Do we just wait it out, call CPS, trick her parents to have her moved to a relative?

657,"I got hired about 3 weeks ago. I was told it was a seasonal position with 5-6 hours a day, sometimes pushing 8-10 when it got really busy. 

&amp;#x200B;

The first day at work I get bailed on by the person I was supposed to meet and I get a call asking me to come in 4 hours later at a different location, a 25 minute drive and 20 more minutes than what it was supposed to be (this wouldn't be too much of a problem, but I get driven and nearly 2 hours of their day driving me back and forth is a lot of time out of their day/work). No problem, shit happens. I go to work that week normally at the new time/place under the promise it would go back to the normal time/place the next week.

&amp;#x200B;

Next Monday comes and I wait at the location for 45 minutes with my ride until we have to just give up and head back, due to my ride taking the time off work just to drive me. I give the people a call and they tell me they now want me to come into a different location, 20 minutes away at a different time and it's now gonna stay like that permanently. 

I go in the full week and every single day is only 3 hours. I was told it was just a slow day until Friday when I asked to get more information and someone to call (Because nobody had given me anything, I had to ask the person I was with for their number just so I could talk to someone about the job). I was told it is only going to be 3 hours and they can't give me more than 4 a day.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I am here, 3 hours a day instead of 5-8, a 20 minute drive instead of a 5 minute, and with just about as much information as the day I was hired. Not to mention I had to sit with their tech support for over 3 hours of my own time to get into their system, just to find out it's my account and to have to spend more time with the people just to get my banking information processed to get paid, which took about  2 weeks for them to do.

661,"Hellow! 
 
Sorry in advance if I fuck something up fairly new to Reddit posting. Also english is not my first language. And sorry for the long post.

So I live in the Netherlands and prostitution here is legal. You probably all know the Amsterdam red light district. Well we have more of those in other citys. I live in a big town up north. We used to have two streets in the city center that were ""red"". One closed down in 2015 and I live there now in a house with 2 other girls. 

When I first moved in I saw the occasional guy looking in the abandoned windows looking for girls but now not as often anymore. Most men know the prostitutds have moved.

Last week in the evening a man rang our doorbell. Popped my head out of my window asking him what he needed. He was looking for girls. I informed him we were all out of girls and directed him to the other red light street. This encounter was not that strange to me because of the history of the street. 

Next day around 12 pm a man rang the doorbel. Young guy looks like a student. We have alot of those here. He imidiatly says oh sorry I think I have the wrong adres. Then a german guy rings the door bell. He is saying something about a telephone card. Next is another young guy that wants to walk in the second I open the door. I block his entrance. At this time I already feel that something shady is going on and I try asking the men were they got my adres. They all seemed really uncomfertable with the questions. The last man from that day says he is looking for Yvonne but he does not want to tell me what he wants with her. 

Next day same thing keeps happening. One man I try to question admits he got our adres from a dutch sex site and tells me the name of the prostitute. She is a woman with a little bit extra (between the legs). I contact the police and the sex site. The police say they put the local government on it(they do checks for unlicensed prostitution). The sex site first tells me to call her myself and give her number to me. I try that no answer so I leave a voicemail. A friend of my roomate whatsapps the number pretending to be intrested in her service and gets a quick response with our adres. I email the sexsite again an they take the listing down. The local governement also calls me and they think that miss prostitute lives nearby and she sends men to our door to see from a distance if they are creepy or not or if they are the government people checking up on her. If that is the case they don't get her real adres. That is all fine and good and I am all for legal prostitution but don't bother me with it. Intresting detail to add is that due to covid the red light places have to be shut down. This happend the second day the men started coming. Now that the listing is down all seems to be quiet. No more men. 

Here is were it got creepy for me and not just an inconvinience. I was telling my friends about all this and they wanted to see what she looked like. So this weekend I went back to the site to see if maybe the listing was up again and she had decided to bother someone else. Yes the listing was up but now her location was not my town but my parents town were I grew up and lived for 20 years. I visited them last weekend. This town is like 2 hours by car or by train from my town. It is also not a very popular or intresting city. It would be a giant coincidence if this prostitute would all of a sudden move from my town to this place. It scares me because this is my family and I don't want them to get hurt. As of now they have not had any strange men encounters at their home but they also have a big gate so you can't get to the house very easy. 

The last part of the story makes me think it is someone trying to fuck with me. But I can't think of who. I feel I am overall a nice person and havent pissed anyone off. I am a 30 y female work in a callcenter and tend bar in a metalcafe. 

I had one other incident like 2 years ago when a random nummer started texting me. We had a polite conversation but he did not want to tell me who he was. Then he asked me if I had a boyfriend and I said yes for like 8 years. He tells me he does not believe me because he always sees me comming out of my house allone. He tells me you live on &lt;mystreet&gt; number 16 right? . Well he got the street right but I live at number 61. A bit to close for a guess. I tell him he is a creep and to fuck off and after a wile he leaves me alone. No clue if this is at all connected it was a long time ago.

Maybe you guys know how I can figure out who is behind this. I did some googling and reverse image searches with no luck. The pictures of the woman are only on that site nowere else. I want to know who is doing this so I can know if my family is save. Any advice is greatly appreciated!",16Nov2020,3

The issue stems from my decision to not extend my holiday. My mother and family are going on a holiday for a while which I will be joining later. I will also have to leave earlier because I have online exams and I know for a fact I wont be able to study while on holidays.

Now my mother disagrees with this and has made that very clear. She says I should return home with the family because it could be the last time we see each other. Our conversation very quickly turned into an argument and she began to guilt trip into leaving early.

666,"I am a female who is 33, and managed to last until I was 21 before I had my first bout of anxiety.

It first hit me when I went to my besties house warming party, where everyone was smoking cigarettes in the house.

The party lasted 12 hours and the smoking never stopped.

Now, being smothered with cigarette smoke as a child, I am very sensitive to the smell to begin with.

And it absolutely got to me, even trying to hide from the smell under a blanket.

But it was like I got smoke poisoning from being around it for too long.

I felt gradually worse over the course of a week.

My appetite dwindled to nothing and I could barely get crackers and water down.

I am 150 pounds and 5'10"", so I really can't afford to lose weight.

Sadly, it has been impossible for me to gain weight, but if I don't eat I can very easily lose weight.

I had no energy and barely slept all week.

I ended up having to be taken to the hospital because I started shaking uncontrollably and dry heaving, puking up what little bile I had in my stomach.

They gave me 2 large IV's of something to calm my system down, gave me nutrients through IV, as well as gave me Ativan with am Ativan prescription.

The first couple years after that any changes in my life, mainly work and relationship, triggered it.

Appetite gone, poor sleep, and constant nausea.

Thankfully as it progressed it stopped arising during the day.

Now, it is triggered by stress in my life.

If my brother is going through tough times, family members health is affected, or I have something else adding stress...it gets triggered after I fall asleep.

This I do not like!

I do not like it because it's like my anxiety lays in wait for me to be at my most vulnerable to attack.

I wake up and I'm worried sick about death.

How I will die, when it will happen, and the unpredictability of not knowing.

A blessing is that it only lasts a few minutes before I'm able to coax myself back to sleep.

Then I wake up in the morning and remember it and hate that I can't just get past this.

I realize that I'm not alone in suffering mental illnesses, and wonder if anyone else experiences anxiety similar to mine and what you do to help lessen or deal with it.",16Nov2020,2
668,"First of all, r/relationshipadvice wouldn’t let me post this since it was a yes or no. Here it goes: So I’ve been with my girlfriend for a while and it was going very well. Recently a guy started texting her. She was open to making friends with us alright with me. But, he sent a list of some questions, half of which was dirty. (Like a dumb Snapchat list that kids do with questions about sex.) She responded to him. But she only asked the good questions and only responded because she wanted to become friends. Yesterday, he told my girl that he was masturbating. She immediately told me and showed me the chats because it really upset her. I’m stuck on this because she didn’t stop talking after she saw some of those questions. The only thing keeping me on edge is that she was uncomfortable when he told her that, and the fact that she only was beyond friendly and not engaging in anything sexual. One more thing is that she didn’t try to hide the chats, like she didn’t care that I seen them and it only upset her of how I perceived it. Is she in the wrong or am I overreacting?

671,"So I (19f) am currently on a gap year before I go to university next September. I currently have a place confirmed at a really good uni to study Criminology - a subject I did at college and really excelled in - but I’ve been having lots of doubts on what I want to do with my life and I’m really in need of some advice about it. 
The way I see it, I currently have 3 options that are the most likely for me to do:
A) is do nothing. Continue as planned and study Criminology next year.
The pros of this are: it’s an extremely prestigious university, I’m interested in the subject and I’ve already studied lots of key themes so things won’t be totally foreign to me.
The cons are: the university is very close to where I currently live, which I’m concerned about because I feel like I’m not really doing the whole “going away to uni thing”. I’m also not sure what I’ll do WITH a criminology degree or what you can do with it, other than join the police but i really DON’T want to do that. I’m also concerned that maybe it’s just a hobby for me as opposed to something I could make a career out of it.
Then there’s option B). That’s to reapply for unis to do a law degree WITH criminology. So this would be a qualifying law degree as opposed to a BA and it would learn more about criminal law. 
The pros of this are that I feel this that I feel it’s more useful and versatile than a standard criminology degree - the law side is the part i find the most interesting. 
The cons of this are that to reapply for university, I’ll have to cancel my current UCAS application and therefore lose my current place which scares me a lot lol. I’m also worried that I’ve never studied law before and I might find it boring or difficult, and due to the subjects I took i fear I won’t get in anywhere as good as the place I already have. 
Lastly, option C), which is a bit of curveball. When I initially applied to university, I applied to do media production. I really enjoy drama and television and I liked the idea of being able to make and star in things, plus I like the whole practical side. I’ve been thinking about applying to do that again as my last option. Ideally, I’d love to be an actress but I don’t dare apply for drama school in case i end up blocking my future career by doing a drama degree. With media I’ll still get opportunities to be in front of the camera but I’ll also get technical skills I can use too.
The pros of this are: it’s more hands on which is suited to my learning style and it matters less about my subject choices as good unis don’t necessarily have the best facilities if that makes sense? It’s also more personalised as you get the option to explore more things such as radio, film, television and the different jobs within that. I’m definitely a creative person too so these courses would play up to that.
The cons are: I’m scared that people will think I’m wasting my potential on this sort of course. I’ve always pushed myself extremely hard and I want to have a lot to show for it and I’m worried that I’ll just be one of thousands of people who leaves uni with a degree in a field it’s impossible to find work in (particularly in this current environment with the whole global pandemic thing.) I’m also worried about letting my parents down too - they’ve both worked in law enforcement for 30+ years and were so proud when I said I was applying for criminology, and were even happier when I got into the uni I did.

All in all, I’m extremely wound up and anxious about all of this. The UCAS deadline is getting closer and I’ve still not made a decision yet. I don’t know what I want to do in the future and Im terrified to make the wrong choice now and end up ruining my future. Any advice would be REALLY appreciated, because I’m in such a tizzy:(",16Nov2020,2

I´ve been hospitalized for almost two months now - getting the therapy I needed for my bpd+adhd :)

Now it´s almost time for me to be released and they require us to do some sort of final project.

There are no rules to this project, I think it´s about personal growth and new realisations in the first place but not even those seem to be an obligation.

However, I´ve been pretty busy preparing my life ""after the stay"" and haven´t given much thought to that project yet!

My mom kicked out my stepdad a few weeks ago after he hit my brother. She finally had enough of his cheating and abuse towards my brother (15) and I (19). These past few weeks have felt amazing and I’ve felt quite free and relaxed. But, my mother has been allowing him to come over for various silly reasons (he’s come over six times to pick up some tools, came over today to fix our window) and I’ve tried telling my mother that  he cannot come here or I will call the police next time and report his abuse. Whenever he comes back over, I also feel like it resets my freedom and my 'moving' on phase. Today when he came over, I told my mom that I don’t want him around my little brother and said I was going to let him know that his dad was here. My mother said not to tell him as that’d upset him. I said  “wow, I wonder why he’d be upset...” and she said to just drop it and leave it alone. I told her that my stepdad could be COVID-19 positive as his new job has him interacting with lots of people and he thinks COVID is fake. She said that he takes it seriously - when he really doesn’t! I also told her that he smokes weed while driving, which puts people in danger obviously and she said that he doesn’t; however, I have evidence that he does do this. She said that all I do is point fingers but I don’t know what she’s talking about. I don’t think she’s mentally well. I want to get her help, but I don’t know how to convince her to seek help. In addition to the abuse from my stepdad towards us, she’s also not sent my brother to school or educated him in a few years and doesn’t care if she goes to jail which further makes me think she’s not mentally well.

Me and my dad were making matzo ball soup for dinner a couple months ago. If you don't know, towards the end of preparing matzo ball soup, you need to leave them in a pot of simmering water for 30 minutes.

During that interval, I went on a Discord server of mine for feminine people assigned male at birth (don't ask) and we started playing Among Us. In the chat, everyone was carelessly tossing out grammatically incorrect messages. I, on the other hand, was fastidiously checking my posts to make the sure the punctuation was present and accurate and that I was using the correct pluralizations.

Then, this bizarre feeling of distance from everyone there washed over me. I felt totally, fundamentally different. I looked through my other communities online and in-person, and found constant, categorical differences between myself and the other members of these groups.

I feel disconnected and aloof. The adults in my life want me to be proud of how different I am. My father constantly tells me not to be like my peers. A lot of my friends are members of the sports teams at my school, popular kids, et cetera. And I'm over here writing essays on the psychology of obscure Jewish theologians for fun.

I just want to sob typing this. I feel like I'm a septuagenarian. My pubic hair is gray, my back hurts, and I have eye bags (likely from the stress of pretending to be cisgender) and every adult tells me I'm like a aging professor of philosophy. It sucks. I just want to feel young and feel like I belong.

But I feel like it's impossible. I try so hard to connect with others, and build bridges with my peers. But all it seems to translate into is social failure and a feeling on inauthenticity on my part.

I feel like I'm pretending to be someone I'm not. I look for more communities on Reddit, Discord, etc. for similarly mature, gifted adolescents. Yet even they see me as smarter than them and feel alienated from me through alleged intellectual inferiority.

684,"I (27M) am having on-and-off issues moving past this. For this story to make sense, I’m Asian and I live in an apartment with my parents currently. I actually require 2 separate advice, so I will try my best to break it down as it’s past midnight now... 

Needed advice 1) 
When I was 10, I developed a fever halfway during school. Naturally, the school phoned my father to pick me up to go back, consult a doctor and rest. He picked me up and brought me home, but then he ranted on about why I’m always such a problematic kid (I am raised in a household of 4 kids, including me). As a kid, I didn’t know what to say so I kept quiet as I was also in pain. 

The next thing I knew, he held me with one arm on one of my legs and dangled me over the ledge of the window. I had a clear shot from my apartment to the ground level and needless to say, I was terrified. He held me there for about half a minute, expressing how he wanted to just end my life then. But, I don’t know what happened and he took me back in. 

Sadly, it didn’t end there. He carried me back to the bed, then walked away. He came back with a cleaver and said that it would be so easy to end my life this way too. But, he didn’t. He then went to put the cleaver down and took some Panadol out for me to eat. 

This was a one-off incident; it has never happened again and my dad has never once, in 17years, made an attempt to verbalise an apology to me. He is still a loving dad/husband/(insert all other roles) to everyone else. However, this incident has always been etched deep within my heart. Nobody in my family nor my circle of friends know about this, and honestly I do not have the courage to tell them because I do not want to tear the family apart. I am afraid to even consult professional advice about this despite holding a Bachelor’s in Psychology and knowing that I actually do need therapy (It’s still a taboo subject for Asian parents/culture in general although it’s shifting). 

How does one move past this? I do not wish to cut ties with my family because they are in the dark about this even happening. 

Needed advice 2)

When he got home, he exploded in rage, for the first time in 17years towards me, because I, (a) disrespected his authority by moving it inside without consulting him and subsequently asking him why he brought it out again and (b) removed the slippers, placed it back in the house and threw the whole shoe rack away. 

His outburst reminded me of the incident when I was 10 and I immediately disengaged, went back to my room and shut the door while my mum tried to stop him from further confrontation. I teared up a little because he also mentioned that he wanted me to move out (Asian kids usually stay with their parents until they are married where I come from).

I am not in a financially strong place as I’m out of work, but I know that if I do not move out soon, every extra day I spend there could be dangerous for my physical safety. I feel like it might all just be in my head but at the same time, not.  

What should I do?",16Nov2020,7
685,"Throwaway account because I'm nervous. I'm currently 19 years old and in college. My dad passed away when I was 16 during my junior year of high school. Just a year and a half before, he was rushed to the emergency room and my mother and I got surprised with finding out he was an alcoholic. My mom and I had no idea. He had been drinking for most of my life but discreetly enough that it didn't seem suspicious, and the past couple years he escalated how much he would drink and was able to hide it very well. My mom was heartbroken, as I was. He went into rehab for a few months before returning home with us, where my mom gave him an ultimatum of going to therapy or taking a break from the family until he got his priorities straight. He went to therapy every week and went to physical therapy to get his mobility back--he even enjoyed it and would seem happy and rejuvenated after every appointment.

However, my junior year, he suddenly got worse again. He was dehydrated, weak, and was throwing up continuously. We called the doctor who told us he could suffer kidney failure if he didn't go to the hospital immediately. The hospital was a blur, but long story short he suffered a lot. His stomach was filling with fluids and he had to get an urgent procedure done that gave him blood clots in his legs that were serious and ultimately ended up being fatal. The doctors were convinced it was some late-stage cancer, so they bombarded him with different tests that only increased his discomfort and pain, and nothing ended up coming from the tests anyways. Everything happened so fast; we never even got a final ""diagnosis"" on what was wrong before he passed suddenly. I didn't even get to say goodbye.

The summer in between his two hospitalizations, I remember coming home from something and going into my dad's office to say hello. He was napping on his couch, and when I woke him up to say hello he told me ""good morning"" even though it was 3 in the afternoon. I would've normally said it was just him being confused after being woken up from a nap, but then I noticed one of those mini bottles of alcohol in his lap. I didn't even look twice, I just turned away and ran to my room and tried to forget about it. I didn't want to tell my mom because this would be considered his second ""strike"" and she would probably have kicked him out of the house and/or considered divorce. I was selfish because I didn't want my dad to leave. And less than a year later, he did leave anyways. He died.

I know it wasn't 100% my fault, but I feel so guilty by not telling my mom that I saw him with a bottle when he was supposed to be clean. But that summer, he went to a few doctors and all of his tests came back fine, so I convinced myself that it must have been okay and I was overreacting. But now, I feel like it is my fault. And I feel horrible for hiding it from my mom. She was already struggling with anxiety and depression, and now a widow, I can see how lonely and sad she is sometimes. I don't know how to tell my mom what I saw that day and how sorry I am that I didn't go to her before it was too late. I feel like if I had just told my mom, maybe it would've forced my dad to get help again and he could've avoided dying the way he did. I feel so horrible.",16Nov2020,5
686,"(edit: told my parents and they were pretty weirded out, but at least they know now)

I’m a freshman and I recently switched to traditional schooling. I used to eat lunch at home but now I had to eat at school. I sat alone until my friend (J) invited me to hang with his friends. Warned me that I would be the only girl, but I didn’t mind. Then this guys with an almost beard sat with one of the guys. I pay no mind till he said the n word. I was uncomfortable but ignored it (my mistake). 

He started to joke around with me and show me memes. I laughed along despite my discomfort and my gut feeling. As he became more friendly with me he’s tried to hug me, pick me up, and has patted my head. I told my friends (my two best friends in the school) about him. They called it weird and pitied me. Later he came to me while I was talking to my two best friends and informed me that he recently turned 20. I was of course shocked but laughed it off. After he left my friends told me that he was weird and later texted that he is basically a predator. I thought they were over exaggerating.

Two days after that we had no school. Friday came and I chilled in the library. Today it was closed so I sat with the group. I sat down and quietly read my manga. He sat next to me and showed me memes while I was clearly reading. I was a bit annoyed but still gave him a half assed laugh. Showed me a meme about tomboys and he gave a throw away comment about how they are the package. I remembered he has called me that twice. Then he showed me one thing and I said,

“Haha wow I’m lonely.” As a joke since I’m clearly emotionally unavailable. He then said,”haha lets be lonely together.” I said no and thrown a comment about how I like being alone. Then lunch ended and he asked for my discord. I was too nervous to say no and reluctantly gave in. I told my two best friends and they immediately got worried. Told me I should tell admin. I should switch lunch. They suggested to tell (J) or ask about him. So I asked (j) if he knew him, he said no. He then asked if he was making me uncomfortable. I said yes and he said he could tell. I threw in that he was 20. (J) was shocked.

After, I told my family friends to hear their opinions. They were more worried. Told me to go to admin. Switch lunch. One chimed in saying how they wanted to punch his face. 

Both my best friends and family friends were pushing me to tell a teacher. Calling him a predator, a groomer, and etc. I think they’re exaggerating, but at this point I don’t know.

Should I tell an admin or teacher? I can’t really switch my lunch for no reason. A friend suggested to switch my first with my third to get a different lunch but I feel like I would get a panic attack from the sudden change. 

(J) hasn’t responded to my other text so I don’t know what he has done in regards to my issue.

I’m thinking of just avoiding him the whole time. Go to the library. When’s it’s closed I’ll just sit alone again. But I don’t know. My friends are pushing me to talk to an adult.",16Nov2020,1
687,"I moved away from this girl and we both liked each other, and cared for each other. I had to move because of my family. We have stayed in contact though and we have talked almost every day. I told her I still have feelings for her and she told me she was trying to lose them but admitted she cared for me still as well (a year after I moved). We didn't know what to do though so we have just continued talking as normal. However I feel like I am probably being way too attached and wanting something she might not. We have usually had great conversations together, but recently its been not the best. 

2 days ago we had talked in the morning and we typically talk all day but we talked a bit in the morning, she saw one of my messages and left me on read all through the day into the next morning. I messaged her ""hey, you doing good?"" She responded with ""yeah, why?"" That made me think a bit, I didn't expect that response from her tbh. I feel like I'm being clingy and I want to apologize for that but don't know how. Through instagram her spam account randomly was suggested to me, its private and I'm not following it, but the bio she has on it is something like this ""people view me like a mushy sandwich, they only want me when they are desperate and if something better comes they throw me away"" she doesn't have quotes so those are her words she is thinking. 

I really feel like she's talking about me there somehow and idk how to fix this. I want to tell her I'm sorry, for being petty and clingy, and desperate. I should also probably not talk to her as much as its obvious she doesn't want anything between us to happen as we live states away.

688,"I was lucky to get into a special program where I get 6 months of free college and a 6 month internship. This is my fist time I have been able to go to college, I’m 25 years old. My main issue with this program is their ways of “holding accountability”. 

This program is made for young professionals who are kickstarting their career. So, while in class we are expected to uphold professional etiquette and work ethics. I love this expectation... except the people in the program don’t enforce all of the rules, only some. 

I could deal with this. My problem is, I’m stuck in a bad group for one of my classes. They expect me to treat it like work. I’ve been trying to, but there’s only so much I can do to encourage grown adults to get things done by deadlines. For the first phase of our group project I took on a heavy workload. I was creating my part of the project, plus acting as a project manager, plus fixing other’s parts. I burned out HARD. So, I decided I would stand back more on the next phase of the project. 

Well, bad decision. I still made the outline, still did my part early, and still they were down to the wire with their parts. One of them said they’d turn it in. I trusted them to do so, and had a busy night anyways. Minutes before the cut off to send in, I realized I hadn’t heard anyone say they turned it in. So I rushed to my computer to do it myself. I got the spinning wheel of death and it didn’t go through on time. I asked the person who said they’d send it if they had. Nope. They didn’t because I “hadn’t said to go ahead”, though their message about sending it in wasn’t a question, it was “if no one else wants to send it, I will.” Now I will get a missing/late assignment infraction which takes away my ability to win “professional of the week” this week and money from my stipend. Infractions influence their choice on what internship I will get in March. 

For the infraction my plan is to see if the program director will hear me out. That only solves part of the problem, as I’m still stuck with the group. In the beginning the year her made it explicit that no one can change groups. We have the final phase to complete now. I am losing my mind. I want things to get done on time. I want to be able to trust my group. These aren’t huge things to ask for. 

I’ve already gone the route of laying down the facts with them. I tried reminding them of our goals, too. I even tried stroking their egos. And, as you know, I tried stepping back and believing in them. Nothing has worked.  So... any ideas on what I can do to avoid more damage?

(Summary: Trapped in a bad group that’s affecting my grades, stipend, and internship opportunity. Paragraph directly above describes what I’ve already tried.)",16Nov2020,1
689,"I'm going to try to keep this brief. Last year around February my sister got very sick but never got tested to confirm if she had corona virus or not. After 6 weeks of quarantining at her apartment, my sister moved in with my mother and I. We are all adults.  My sister highly suspects she had Covid-19 back then and is now immune to both getting it again, and possibly bringing the virus home with her.

&amp;#x200B;

Without notice, approximately 3 months ago, my sister decided to take a plane to Utah from Florida to ""hang out with friends"". I suspect more happened such as some kind of festival or event or something but that's just speculation at this point. Before the pandemic she went to a ton of EDM concerts all over the country.

She decided on her way back she was going to rent a car instead of fly back, and stop at a few places on her way to kind of make like a vacation out of the trip back. We thought this might be a decent idea so she has time away from the people she was there to see if she develops any symptoms, and will have time to get a Covid test before coming back so she doesn't risk infecting us.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's where it gets sticky. She changed her mind last minute and flew back anyway. I believe one of her intended destinations in Texas had a hurricane / flooding at the time so she just said screw it and came back immediately.

Her version of ""quarantining"" changed to climbing through her window and just staying in there for a few days while she waits on test results.  Her room shares air supply with the rest of the house and is basically right next to mine.

I was furious. To me it really felt like she just doesn't give two shits about my life or my mom's life.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward to today.

&amp;#x200B;

I just found out she's going on another trip up to Georgia to spend the weekend with friends again   this upcoming weekend, and she has no intention of staying quarantined at a hotel to await test results. Apparently 6 weeks ago she did this already without us knowing, and now she's going to do it again.

The conversation devolved into a verbal brawl. I'll spare you the details but at the end I came down to this ultimatum: Stay gone and quarantine until you get tested negative. If you try to come back without doing that I'm changing the locks on the house.

&amp;#x200B;

Her response? I pay rent here. Go get an eviction notice. I'm smarter than you. If you lock me out I'll call the police.

&amp;#x200B;

What the heck do I do here? Am I overreacting?

&amp;#x200B;

It just feels like more of the same attitude of not really caring if we get infected. She thinks its safe and the risk to us is minimal because ""she had it before so therefore I can't possibly get reinfected and can't possibly spread it to you guys"". I found evidence online of people catching Covid a second time but she basically has her fingers in her ears to anything contrary to her vacation.

She's spending entire weekends with groups of people then coming back here and basically giving me the finger for giving a damn.

PS; My sister says I need to apologize to her for getting angry with her for not giving a shit if we live or die.

&amp;#x200B;

Trying to remain objective here but I fully realize this is not my house and I have no right to come down with ultimatums on who is allowed here, and most likely if the police do get involved, I will be required to let her in as all her belongings are here and she gave some money to my mom once so she has ""proof she pays rent"".  

&amp;#x200B;

It really feels like my only option is to leave but what about my mother? She's 60. She has one of the comorbidities that make corona dangerous. Does she just forfeit her home to my selfish bitch of a sister?",16Nov2020,1
692,"This deals with politics, but I’m going to try and keep it as apolitical as I can.

For some background, I write posts for an Asian activism Instagram page. Everyone who works for the page are all Asians. ‘Coworkers’ are people at my level and my ‘boss’ is the page admin.

I recently wrote a post about Asian-American trailblazers in the world of politics. I went back to check on it today, and I found a lengthy paragraph underneath it from my ‘coworker’, detailing how much she disliked one of the politicians I listed and stating (to my knowledge) heavily disputed claims. My ‘boss’ also wrote a paragraph, agreeing with her.

Since my expertise is in the world of American politics, most of my future posts will be about this person. I wouldn’t have cared if they’d said anything about this in the group chat, but they put this down under the post on the main page. It doesn’t look very good because their accounts are both directly linked to the page.

I’ve been considering quitting for some time (I have a very full schedule and it’s difficult for me to keep up with all the things I need to do). However, I feel like I’m being a little intolerant, and possibly overreacting.

694,"A friend’s family is hitting some real challenges. His grandparents went from fully independent to suddenly needing some serious supervision almost overnight.

695,"I...I honestly don't know what to do or say anymore. Ever since I put myself back out there I've gotten shit on in return. 

I went out with someone from like feb-may (bc covid limited our seeing each other) and we just kinda grew apart were fwb for a bit and then he got a gf. 

Second guy I was seeing and then he stood me up on a date out of the blue and the next day he tells me he met someone else. They broke up after a month. So, I started seeing him again. However. He would talk about trying to get with other girls and stuff like that in front of me so I didn't think he was interested (he claimed that this was him ""teasing"" me).
 
Now this 3rd guy that I've ve been seeing for about a month and we wanted to be fwb but ended up calling eachother babe and he even stayed the weekend with me at one point ( I dont like to be alone when my moms out of town and I dont really have friends here). Now today, after I write him good morning, he's like ""I'm sorry I haven't been fair to you"" and tells me that he doesn't like me in the same way that I like him but that im fantastic ect.

This being said, (and I'm going to sound self centered when I say this) I know that im a fantastic person and I have a ton of love and care to give so its not a self esteem thing.

705,"I’ll start from the very start (sorry if my storytelling is boring). I just turned 18 and I wanted to gain a bunch of new experiences. Hence, I downloaded Tinder. At first, it was just for fun. I just wanted to learn how to talk to guys Then, I swiped on this guy my age who was just looking to make friends and get boba. We started talking about our favorite drinks and stuff until I made a stupid bet like “YO if biden wins ill suck your dick” inspired by the many tweets like it.

Then, I didn’t log on for 3 until he was officially elected president LOL I went back and I told him I was half joking. He said something like “damn alright. well let’s just get boba and hangout” r something. He also said that he didn’t want to make me do anything I was uncomfortable with. I gave him my number and we started texting and we were really vibing, it seemed to me like we had rlly similar humor. Once I felt comfortable enough with him, I let him pick me up. We got some food, boba, went to a viewpoint where we cuddled. 

But then, he got hard :O I didn’t get off of him :O I just said: really? and then he asked me.. if I wanted to touch it. So I did. Now this was the first time I ever did anything like this. EVER. Because I don’t have any guy friends. For some reason, guys just don’t like me, even as a friend 
:( So this was a very exhilarating experience. He also put his fingers in my mouth which was super hot and we ended up moving to the back of a church parking lot.. where I lost a lot of firsts. The only first I didn’t lose was my virginity because he knew that’s not what I wanted when I was in my right state of mind (while we were doing stuff I guess I got kind of stupid and said “maybe” to him putting it in but he said “I thought you said no” like teasing me). 

Anyways after that, we went thrifting together for a little. Now after the things we did, he was acting very sweet. Like saying he feels closer to me after what we did. And hugging me randomly saying “I just wanted to hug you.” We also held hands and we just expressed super gross PDA in public lmao. He dropped me off, aaand then he didn’t text me. Soo I decided to text him after a day. His response were .. pretty dry. Very odd considering how he acted after when we went thrifting. But still, we texted back and forth until I decided to talk about my V-card and losing it. I told him that I was really comfortable with him and I don’t really care about it. Just the thing is, I don’t know how he feels about me. I don’t think I reeaaally like him or anything. 

I think that he’s hot. And after losing so many of firsts, I am .. basically a touch-starved virgin. I want sex and company. He agreed to take my virginity? But didn’t really say anything else after that. It’s giving me mixed signals because his last response is just “I can do that :))” after saying stuff like “I’ll be gentle.” I just don’t know how to continue the conversation so now I’m reconsidering. I do want to keep doing things with him. I don’t know how to ask him and make sure that he won’t just cut contact with me after we do it. Like I want to ask him to help me gain new experiences. I don’t want to feel like I’m “losing” something but rather “gaining” experience and he makes me feel comfortable when I’m with him but lately his dry responses just have me feeling iffy... but horny :(((

Uhh summary: I, a virgin, went to like.. second base? with a Tinder date. And now I want More but his responses have been very dry. He still told me he wants to do more stuff with me though. What should I say? Or do? Has anyone else lost their virginity this way?",16Nov2020,0

I always brushed it off but now during the pandemic we don’t go to “in person” school. So her parents have been making her work the front deck and answering work calls from clients while on her online classes (Google meets/zoom calls). Today she texted me that she couldnt finish our assignment for History Honors because she had to answer clients calls on the work phone. I tried to help with the assignment but she still ended up turning it in almost an hour late. She was freaking about and was on the verge of crying but couldn’t because of customers at the salon. She seemed really stressed and I’m honestly worried about her. I talked to my dad about it and he said that her parents should let her stay home during the pandemic and let her focus on school and because it’s just not safe. I think that too.

Recently though I got sick. I have a nervous system disorder that cause my body’s reactions to go haywire. I often have sudden tachycardia, shakes and tremors, syncope and a few other symptoms. I’m starting some treatment that might help but there are no guarantees. 

I haven’t been able to work steadily because of it, so I can’t pay for my own place to live, I hit a deer with my car a few weeks ago and can’t get a loan for a car without income. I will often need to go to the hospital when I have sudden tachycardia to make sure my heart is ok and need someone to take me. 

My parents have offered to let me live at home again but only if I fall in line to the religion and their rules. This would mean attending their meetings which they are doing over zoom currently, no associating with anybody who isn’t in the religion, so that would mean going no contact with all my friends, not dating any women so I’d have to break off things with a girl I’ve been seeing for a few months. No secular music which is one of my biggest coping mechanisms, no secular entertainment, and more stuff like that.

I am 13 and I live in the UK, It started 2 years ago I was nice to people and stuff I found this girl I liked she was nice 2 friends I told that I considered best friends pretended to be that person on WhatsApp then posted all the messages on Instagram.

I started to lose friends they would laugh at me call me small and stuff even now all my friends call me retardo and shit (my name is Leonardo) and my dad calls me a failure  what should I do?",16Nov2020,2
715,This girl I’ve been speaking to had opened up to me with has some clear psychology issues. I for one unfortunately tried to take my own life and was In the hospital for 4 days. I can’t deal with her stress. She didn’t understand that and kept overwhelming me with her shit. Her issues. Now trust me I understand being a friend involves this but she was well aware I had just gotten outta a mental hospital. A major red flag she told me was she has a little assistant in her head that tells her what to do. It’s not that I don’t want to talk to her it’s just theres so much going on in my life. And I’ve made it clear so many times friendship is more then her just unloading her problems on me. I’ve told her a dozen times I am not a doctor and have no qualifications to give mental or medical advice. She keeps asking for. All I can tell her is get therapy but she keeps saying she can’t. Maybe I am in the wrong here but like my dad and grandmother also died within months of each other. I am trying to deal with my own problems right now. Maybe that’s selfish. Idk.,16Nov2020,2
716,"Long story short, I have 4 children. Three are adults. Their father and I divorced and I got into another relationship. Thus, my 4th child was born. 

For five years he abused me. Physically, mentally, emotionally. I finally got out of the situation because I was truly afraid for my life and my 5 year old. 

He is an alcoholic and not a very nice one. I blocked him out of my life completely, and I have only heard anything from him once in over a year. He asked a friend of mine to ask if I would call him. I refused and that was the end of that. 

My little one is having a really hard time understanding why he doesn't see or talk to his Dad. Honest to God, I don't know how to ease his little mind. He started therapy last month, but if anyone has any advice for me, please do let me know.",16Nov2020,1
717,"Edit: Nearly forgot to mention a bit of biometric data about myself. I was born biologically male, gender is trans MtF. In India, I am currently an Indian citizen, but have lived in North America for most of my young age.

I am crying on my bed as I write this. I have always 
had a little doubt in my head since I was 7 about my gender. I loved female clothes, I loved makeup, basically, very stereotypical. It just seemed nicer than being a jock, playing sports, i.e., stereotypical. It intensified into hating my genitals actively, by the age of 10. They seemed wrong, and caused me a bit of depression. To combat this, I leaped into work and forgot about everything else. Zero heed to health. Tried to forget the notion. Lasted for around 3-4 years(really intensive in the last year).

However, in lockdown, I inevitably got a bit of free time, and my mind wandered to the forbidden place again. I am now 14 years old. I was in denial for quite some time. I just accepted that I am probably transgender now. However, I have been nearly 3 years actively in the closet, and as days pass and puberty intensifies, the bodily changes happening are causing me a lot of distress. I hate my body hair with a passion, I hate that I am getting a deeper voice, and especially, some expansion in the nether region. 

However, here is the problem. I live in a VERY transphobic family. You think your Catholic parents are bad? You have never met my family. They actively think trans people are freaks of nature, and only recently, have they even warmed up to the LGBT community, because a family friend came out as lesbian, and tbh, she is too nice, and whomever she may love, she is always family away from family to me. So, coming out, or them funding puberty blockers or anything of the sort is just off the tables, or even just basic therapy sessions.

Here is the other kicker. NO JOBS. Or at least, none where I can keep my income secret and reinvest in my mental health. The economy has been totally fucked, and I cannot compete with people who have degrees for paid internships, and your classical minimum wage jobs are already chock full.

Is there any way to manage this until I can support myself? I am afraid that if I put it off for too long, I am not going to get my desired results from HRT or anything I may get down the line, but then, I am stuck between a hard place and a rock. Is there anyone who I can talk to for free, even for a bit? 

I do hope this is within subreddit rules. I desperately need answers.",16Nov2020,1

This is a big wall of text. I’m so sorry. Now, I can’t really tell how I’m feeling. It’s weird and numb. I wasn’t always the perfect friend. I was average at best. But so was she 25f  after a certain point. We were unseperable and just confided in each other about everything. We didn’t like each other much at school. Left, went to uni at the same time. Shared experiences and just become best of friends. 

I started to move on and not talk to her as much , I feel like she didn’t like the fact I couldn’t talk to her as much I don’t even know. But after a while the vibes were always off around her. Almost like, she was there but not there. I had ALOT of issues whilst we were friends. 

I was the girl who needed validation from men. I grew up an only child and super lonely so really this was all the validation I needed when I left school. Anyway, she always supported me and backed me up but then things went wrong after I was in an abusive relationship. She just stepped back. I already lost all my friends after this, she was pretty much all I had left and I was losing her too. I tried to tell her I was being abused and she just turned a blind eye. 
Her father was abusive so I’m not sure if it was a mental shut down on her part when it was happening to me. 

But she just never helped me or said “I’m here. Not to talk to but trust me I’m here”. I was just alone in this thing. No one understood me. 

When I left him and tried to explain to her that I was being abused by him she just...sat there. Just, said nothing. I felt like if lost her. Then I went off to another uni and met new people. Some really cool people and I hung with them a lot. (Sadly they’re not around now) but I was doing great. I don’t know if it was jelousy or what. But she just kept backing off. Sometimes I would talk to her and the convo would end. Then later I’d try pick it back up but it was just crap. When the friendship ended she said that was her main problem. 

She even tried to end the friendship over a text. A 3 year friendship ending, just over text. Not even the decency to say hey I need to talk. You’ve been a shitty person and we need to get this straight. She just wrote me out of her life and said hey I’m pretty much done here once she’d been on her gap year. 

I had to explain to her my depression and my fathers car accident and she said “oh no let’s meet” after saying for ages and profusely refusing. I assume
She felt guilt but idk. 

We met up again and she just seem like she clocked out anyways, she was nice but not the same. Things went kind of back to normal again but then when I met my partner. She backed off. I went to Paris with him and I asked her for gift advice  for his bday but she would just ignore my messages. I’d even text her back and she’d say “sorry been busy but you could do xyz”

I then met her for dinner at the end of 2018 and my partner was trying to become a medic but kept failing the interview process. This was before we became official and he was still working in retail to save up. And I distinctly remember saying. “I really like this guy. He’s got big hopes of being a medic r” her words were “Sarah are you sure..maybe he just wants to stay as the manager of Walmart. If he’s failing this many times something seems off” 

I said “no I believe in him” even though we weren’t together we knew we were headed that way. But she planted a spiteful seed in my head that grew into a Beast and I would ask my partner. Are you lying about wanting to be a medic. He would always say “no that’s so silly I would never.” 

In the end fast forward 2 years hes in his second year of medicine and she was wrong. 

I just look back on my memories with this friend and they’re so mixed. Recently she unfollowed me off all socials. Admittedly I would think of her if her name showed up but never watched her stories as she was on mute everywhere. But I didn’t hit delete. She went first and my pride kicked in and i so wanted to be first. 

It all just feels so final. I know it ended a long time ago. But this really is it. Neither of us can contact each other ever again. 

It’s over. I can’t help but feel I never had the closure I needed. 

TLDR. Lost a friend. Mixed emotions on it. How do I move forward",16Nov2020,2
721,"I'm going to be house/dog/fish sitting for a week for my cousin and his wife as they go on a trip, they are going to be paying me.

They're asking me to send them a list of groceries to buy for me while I'm there and I'm sweating over this because I thought it was etiquette to buy groceries for yourself when house-sitting for someone else, so now I'm wondering a few things:

Is it rude to reject it? Should I insist on buying the groceries myself?

Or should I accept it because it would be rude to shut down their hospitality?

Or should I reject it but then accept it if they insist on buying me food?

722,"so basically I got addicted to this subbredit, it's so addicting and in the same time it's really depressing, I can't stop reading every post even if it depresses me, how can I stop doing this ?",16Nov2020,0
723,"Ever since I was a small child, I’ve been absolutely terrified of women outside of my family. For years, I’ve been trying to figure out why and the best I can come up is childhood trauma. Back in elementary school, these group of girls used to tease me and make fun of how I looked EVERYDAY. They’d make fun of my body, my voice, my hair, etc (basically anything you can think of). I had a crush on a girl that I didn’t know was in THAT group of bullies and when I asked her out, she went and told the rest of the group and they basically told the whole school. It was so humiliating. I was only 9 years old... I didn’t know how to comprehend it. Also, I had 2 older sisters who bullied me almost worse than these group of girls did. They’d attack my deepest insecurities and it made me hate myself for so many years. I was their personal ash tray. 

I think the accumulation of all of this over time overwhelmed my mind. I did the only thing I could think of and it was just to avoid women. Obviously, not logical but it was the only way to stop the suffering. 

Fast forward to my teen years, I never talked to a single girl in high school except if we had to do school projects together or something like that. Every interaction I ever had with a woman outside of my family, I have panic attacks. Anxiety goes through my body, I shake and can’t control it, and I stutter. My mind goes blank. The best way I can describe the feeling is like a fight or flight sensation. My brain doesn’t know what to do or how to respond.... especially when a girl is being polite to me. My head is screaming “danger danger danger!”. 

What really tipped the iceberg for me was something that happened two days ago. I was walking from class back to my apartment and this really nice sweet girl walked up beside me and just randomly started chatting with me. I think she thought I was cute or something. Anyway, the panic attack happened once again. I was shaking, sweating, and almost started to cry. My brain was trying so hard to figure out a way out of situation. It felt like I was having a heart attack and I immediately threw up right in front of her. Everything was looking and the girl seemed petrified. 

So, I sprinted away. Sprinted half a mile to my house. I legit thought I was going to die. Again, there’s no logical explanation to this. 

I want this to stop. I want to have female friends, maybe even have a relationship one day. I want to be able to sit in a room with people and not have a panic attack when a girl enters. 

I want to make this one thing clear, nothing sexual crosses my mind when I have an interaction with a girl. The fear doesn’t stem from that. There’s just always something in my body telling me I’m in danger when I have to interact with a girl. 

My question to you all is (and I know I rambled, sorry), what is the next step I should take here to fix this problem? I’m more motivated than ever to do something about this. This will destroy my life if I don’t solve this now.

Another thing that scares me is that once I’m healed and I meet a potential GF, that she will learn this about my past and be off put. Specifically, the lack of any female interaction. I feel like I’m already too far gone and that any girl who learns about me will think something is terribly wrong with me (quite frankly, I wouldn’t blame them). I’m very insecure about this. No one in my family or my male friends know I’m going through is. I’ve hid it from the rest of the world. 

Sorry if none of this makes sense, I’m trying to express what’s going on the best way I can. 

Thanks for reading.",16Nov2020,1
724,"13F here :)

First up: a bit of backstory

A year ago when I just started high school, I was so good at keeping track of my homework, I was smart, I got 80%+ on every test I took, etc etc. Well my second year rolls around, and I suddenly have absolutely no idea what I'm doing anymore. I can't be bothered but I'm constantly stressed, I'm always tired, my test results are awful, everyone is expecting so much more of me but I just can't. I don't know what's wrong with me, and why everything changed. ( btw, my school hasn't gone totally virtual, we just wear masks and stuff, in case you were wondering ) The only subjects I'm doing okay in are business, English and art, but the rest ( Irish, French, maths, music, etc ) I'm having so much trouble with studying for and doing homework for. My confidence has also deteriorated and I barely ask for help anymore, I just draw until class is over. 

TL;DR:

I was smart and now I'm not send help",16Nov2020,4
726,"Everytime I go downstairs I see my dad on his tablet propped up on the back stand he used. I have a railing but it’s big and I can’t see what he’s doing on the first 6 steps which gives him the time to click off the stuff he was recently on. 
So he hears me before I come down in sight. And I can tell what he was doing before even seeing him cuz he’s rushing and he fixes his posture in in a quick action, and slapping his tablet shut. He could at least not make it so obvious ... but now it’s happening a lot more and I’m getting annoyed cuz I keep having to see this. 

Now I start singling loudly, yelling, stomping, playing whatever video I’m watching and bring my phone when going downstairs because this makes him know before hand  I’m coming down and he has more time to stop rushing when seeing me. 

It angers me that I see this almost everyday. My mom doemst know about this. And he’s spending more time in the bathroom whining he  wants a better toilet seat😒 lol why do you want a new one all of a sudden? We had the same thing for 4 years.

I’ve also been ignoring everybodys messages and have been trying to avoid going on phone calls with anyone cause I feel like talking to anyone right now is draining cause I’m expecting the conversation to be boring. 

I also recently moved schools as I thought that would kind of change the structure of my life and make me more interested and hopefully get more friends but that wasn’t successful at all and in fact it’s making my day more repetitive since I wasn’t able to make friends since I moved schools two months into the term.",16Nov2020,2

731,"So I’m 19(m) I’ve been working for my boss Jennifer (36) on her ranch for about a year. She inherited it when her dad died and her mom (62) retired from it. I went to work for her about a year ago and we hit it of. Normally there’s about 7-8 other hands but as of right now there’s only 3 others besides me. About 2 months after I started working for her we went to an event out of town together and she got a little tipsy started flirting with me and well we had sex. We’ve been sleeping together since and tbh it’s been awesome I was a virgin and we’ve really been enjoying being  around each other(go ahead and laugh I dint really care). In October bow season opened in our state and we both love to hunt so she took me out with her. I grew up rifle hunting in my home state and she grew up hunting on her ranch with her dad. 

I’ve never bow hunted so she took me under her wing to teach me. She’s also been tutoring me with online college classes since she got her degree in wildlife science and that’s what I’m going to school for part time. Well a couple of days after bow season began we went out and didn’t see anything she got cold so we started d to cuddle and we had sex. I wore a condom and she took her pill so we weren’t worried or anything. Well it broke but we weren’t worry. She missed her period but didn’t tell me and she went to the local drug store and bought a test she also decided to go to a doctor just to be sure. Sure enough she’s 6 weeks pregnant. She told me the day she found out and it’s been 2 days and I’m still in shock. 

She told me if I dont want to be involved not to worry she would never call me and I wouldn’t have to worry about it. I want to be involved it’s me baby to. Thing is I’m scared to tell my parents. They think I have a girlfriend here (they live 6 hours away) but they dint think it’s Jennifer and they dint think I even like her. I’m scared to death to tell anyone I haven’t even told my sister and she told me if anything like this vet happens to tell her and she would keep my secret.

If you were to google overall state rankings, no two lists are usually the same, but the same states are usually in the top 10, and the same in the bottom 10.  I live in a state that's always within the bottom 5 it seems.  I have a great job here, and am pretty happy.  I'm in my late 20's, own a house, and usually surrounded by people I regard to be pretty smart folk.  That being said, I do not quite fit in politically or religiously here, and I think the state is pretty behind in infrastructure based on all of the places I've traveled to.  I know all that really matters is if I'm happy, which I am, but I can't help but wonder:

Is living in a top 10 state really that much better than living in a bottom 10 state?  Like I said, I've never lived anywhere else and I'd love to try it out some day.  Just looking for some insight or advice from people who may have lived on both ends of the spectrum!",16Nov2020,1

I have been living at my grandparents summer house all fall to take school online as my college went fully online. A recent friend I became friends with last summer was also doing remote so we choose to live together. We have been living together since the middle of September and it has been a super great time with no issues whatsoever. This weekend my sister and her friends were coming up since I have not seen her in a while and we are a pretty close family. Bare in mind that she is 17 and my friend and I are 21. A girl I am friends with was also coming up this weekend and she was sleeping in my room. The first day went well with no issues we all had a good time and nothing weird went on but the second night was when it all broke down. First off to make this clear I told my new friend not to go for my sister because she was 17, had a bf, and it was also my sister, I felt like I had to make this clear because I have only known him for a few months. At around 1am I choose to go upstairs with my friend and my sisters friends went to bed. I noticed that my sister was still hanging out with my friend and did not think much of it until the next morning. That night he put his hand on her lap while playing cod, offered her to sleep in his room because of what might be happening in my room(Saying oh but don't worry nothing will happen), asked about her age then said to hit her up when she's 18. He was also acting super weird and trying to slide. It is now a day after and i really don't know what to do. I am not very confrontational but I want this kid out of my house. I never want my sister to feel uncomfortable with my friends and I do not want to live with a predator.

746,"I’ll start from the beginning, I am 19 (M). In July of 2019, the results of the test at the end of year 12 came out, and my result was not as good as I had hoped. This took a toll on me and I was very embarrassed, so I lost touch with most of my schoolmates. Then I got into med school (happens immediately after high school in my country), so my friend group got separated (not all of my friends got into med school). At that point, I had still been embarrassed by my grade and so I wanted to stay away from people. I decided to take things slowly and make a few friends during university. I made a few during the first semester of last year, then the pandemic happened, and we started studying online. This resulted in me keeping in touch only with 2 of the friends I had made, which are brothers. Fast forward to the summer semester, they started to slowly get out of touch with me, to focus on their studies more. I felt like 9/10 times they talked to me, they needed help with something. They did not call to have fun or vent or just talk, they asked for help with stuff (which I only rejected when one of them asked me to answer an exam with him, I hate cheating). We had some gaming sessions with an old friend of mine, but as soon as the semester started, these ended too. I should mention now that they (the brothers) are from another country, which they decided to go back to last week, considering everything is online anyway.

Now that you know what happened, here is the thing: I’m really lonely now. Yeah I have my family, but you can talk to only 4 people for so long. How do I make friends while I can’t even see them, and had not met them before online learning?

748,"It's more of a rant than needing advice I guess but yea,,, I have no one to talk to about this 

I met my best friend about 12 years ago and we've been friends for about 10. We've lived in the same town this whole time, apart from the times we studied abroad for uni. Everything was fine up until september last year, she wanted to talk to me and it seemed serious, which never really happened before because we've always been on the same wavelength and have never fought or even had a heated discussion or anything like that... She told me she was going to move away with her family to a city about 90 minutes from here. I was sad about it but I thought it was going to be okay since we've spent long periods of time apart without seeing each other and everything would be normal when we did meet up. 

A few weeks after her announcement she did the same thing, but over the phone, that time I got really nervous because I was confused as to why this kept happening and it seemed serious, again. She told me that she was going to get married,,,,,,, I was like, huh? I didn't even know she was talking to someone or that she was interested in anyone at all. We're both diaspora Kurds and in our culture it is normal to get married soon after meeting the other person (though I wouldn't choose to do this personally) so I understood why she would get married quickly, however, I was really hurt by the fact that she never told me she even liked someone. We have had many conversations about these kinds of topics, and every time a guy was interested in her she would tell me everything about the situation. It is now a year later and to this day I never understood why she kept it from me, the only thing I can imagine is that her parents told her not to say it to anyone, so that no one in their community could find out? But even then it doesn't make sense. Anyway, she didn't really have a wedding ceremony because she didn't want to, she only had two dinners with both of their families and she did a photoshoot with her husband. For none of these things did she ever ask for my help, even though I had told her she could ask me. She also didn't invite me to any of these events, which is hurtful because she was always the one who said that it would be fun to attend each other's weddings and see our kids have play dates etc.. lmao

Since they moved away I've seen her twice. Yea, I know. But that's not the real problem, it's the fact that every time I text her, to talk about how she's doing or how she's genuinely feeling, she doesn't really say anything to me, it's like I'm a stranger to her, or a colleague she met 2 weeks ago. She's not opening up to me, which is fine, except that she was never like that before. And every time she texts me it's only if she needs something, or if her parents are asking something to my parents (since our families are acquaintances as well.) Even our small talk feels weird. 

I feel abandoned and lonely, this is not the first friendship I've lost, the other one lasted 14 years but it was a more natural and mutual parting. This one was so sudden, it's not like I expected everything to be the same forever, but I also didn't think that she would ""ditch"" me so fast. I don't think she realises how it's hurting me, though my mom made it clear one time.. I think her life changed so much so fast and I don't fit into that life anymore. If I were to ask her about it, I think she would say that I'm still like a sister, but it doesn't feel like that anymore.

751,"First time poster, but I could use your advice. Sorry for the long post.

I am a project manager and have been at my company for 4 years. I have been building a new project from scratch as part of a larger program for the past 2 years. It was tough work and I had very little support with a small team. The overall program manager was over his head and communication was very poor- he didn’t read any of my proposals for building the project despite my many emails and offered no advice. I was left to do this alone and after months of hard work, I was able to successfully build a project, identify and contract partners, and manage the implementation of the program. 

In February, I expressed to my manager my unhappiness with the work due to the workload and lack of compensation (my salary is at the low end of the band for my position, despite my high responsibilities).

Over the summer, we started the hiring process for another project manager on the team. I was excited for additional support on the team and participated in the interview process. I was told she would be building a different project within the same program. I set up multiple meetings with my managers during the hiring process to discuss roles and confirmed we would be leading different projects. Recently, in a whole team meeting, I found out she will be taking over my project and my role would be to “assist” her.

When I set up a follow up meeting with my managers saying this caught me off guard, I was told I shouldn’t be surprised because I expressed I was unhappy in February. I mentioned that I felt disrespected that this decision was not shared with me earlier. I told them if this was the case, I would have come up with a transition plan for us. I was then told, “you have the right to feel how you want, but frankly you have not been disrespected.” I am not sure how I have not been when I feel like I have been demoted despite the success of this project and without any warning.

Not only this but her salary would be higher despite having little experience in this space and one less year of work experience than me overall.

I feel disrespected and frankly insulted. I have worked very hard at this job. I know that I do great work -mine is the only project in this program that is successful at the moment, hence why I thought we were bring on staff to build the other projects. I also proposed the alternative that I can build out other projects in the program as I did with this one, while the new hire takes on the project I built - I was told that was a non starter. 

I want to quit. But I am nervous about doing so in this economy. I also enjoy my work a lot, which is why I was ok with working long hours with no support earlier. Part of me is nervous that I am reading too much into this and I should try to take on this new role and not care as much about how I feel I have been treated. My friends say that I should try to do this as I will be paid the same to do less. But I also don’t feel comfortable staying in a space where I don’t feel appreciated or respected.

I feel stuck and am not sure what to do. I would appreciate your thoughts! Thanks in advance!",16Nov2020,2

753,"I (23, male) am at a crossroads in my life and dont really know what to do. I want to appologize beforehand, since my situation is very stable and protected compared to others on this reddit, but i still dont know what to do.

I have always been a good but lazy student. After graduating Highschool (and doing my military compensation service in a retirementhome), I briefly started studying Technical Physics but quickly realised that i was not up for the task (Not good at learning, didnt brush up on my math, unexperienced witht the administrative side of Uni), which lead to a small mental breakdown. My parents then convinced my to try Political science for a year. I liked Political Science, but it seemed ""not enough"" for me.

The next Year i wanted to move to and study in the Capital (Vienna, about 2hours by train from home) because all my friends from Highschool were already there (I went to a somewhat posh catholic private school, its basically expected) and my best friend was moving there too. In retrospect it was really silly of me, since i didnt go to vienna for a real reason but for social ones.

I would have done Polisci in Vianna too but instead did the admissiontest for psychology. In Austria, there is a cap of about 1000-1500 people per year who get to study it. I passed barely, but was very happy about it. Two years i studied Psychology, but this Summer, probably somewhat related to covid, I fell into a depression (or realised i had dysthymia or something, i was never really diagnosed, though i saw a therapist and a Psychiatrist).

After a lot of Introspection and help from my Family, i realised that Psychology was also not for me (although i liked it every bit as much as polisci, it just wasnt something i wanted to make a job of, which is not that easy to begin with) and that i wanted to do something real, that had to do with technology, industry etc. Basically what i was already aiming at with technical Physics.

This fall, i started mechanical engineering, to see how that affected my mental health. This time I did brush up on my maths with a University course in the Summer. So far, mechanical engineering is very interesting, but also insanely demanding. The math is not beyond me (as in i understand whats going on which i didnt in technical physics), but id have to put in a lot more work than i currently am to pass even the first (of three) maths courses.

As i already mentioned i live in Austria, so my indeciciveness at least hasnt put me into a cent of debt (free college yay). My Parents are also supportive since they see that i am intensively looking for the right path for me. Whats more, both them and my granddad and aunt have offered to just train me in their field of work and letting me inherit their businesses \[My parents have a small Furniture store and my aunt inherited the position of undertaker from my granddad (You need a licence for that business in Austria and they are rather valuable as well as inheritable)\]. Thats what i mean by ""stable and protected"", i have enough privilege to do what ever i want, which probably plays into my indeciciveness.

At the current moment, i am rather frustrated with my self. I have all these opportunities, but i am not really passionate about any of them. Its not like im doing nothing, but i could definitely put a lot more effort into mechanical engineering, but i am just too undisciplined and weak to change that. I actually feel like i might need to be cut of by my parents and work in retial for a year just to reset my expectations of comfort. I have actually been a disciplinned worker the few times i had a summerjob, in my military compensation service and when i worked in a Museum during my Polisci time, i guess the structure and stress of a job makes me a lot more productive. A lot of people are like that though and i also realise that studying unfamiliar material for 8 hours is a lot different than stocking shelves or waiting tables for the same amount of time (Atleast my parents forced me to do summerjobs, so i am not a completely disconnected rich kid). 

After a lot of backstory (it be like that with lifeadvice), now for the core of my problem:

I dont know if i have the dedication and self motivation to become an engineer. I know that i want to my job to be somewhere in that area (industry, technology, Production etc), that atleast has become clear to me. So in that case a mechanic, welder, lathe oppereator or similar would be fitting too. Trades  have the special advantage (in my eyes) that i would start as an apprentice already in a business, and as such would have the structure that makes me more productive in work than studying. Sure there is tradeschool, but that one is still a far shot from beeing as hard or as hard to manage as is studying in university. The horrible part is: I dont know if i want to take the ""social step down"". I dont need the money a mechanical engineer makes, i am actually rather ecconomical i would say. I dont need the skills, i actually rather want my job to contain hands on work, rather than planning on a pc-screen. I just cant swollow my pride. All my friends are gonna be lawyers, Doctors, Mathematicians, some variety of engineer, and so on and so on. I also realized that pride is a rather bad motivator, since my studies are going subpar. My whole life seems to have lead up to studying in university, and now i want to throw it away and become and apprentice (who are usually 15-18 yo when starting out)? 

Additionally i am worried that i just want to take this step because of lazyness, just so i dont need to study right now, but would be just as lazy in a job (as i said, ive been a good worker in the past, but its still rather bothersome). This thought is especially threatening to me, as it sugests that i am just too week to make it without familial support. That i am too pampered to get of my ass and realize my parents wont always be there. I know that kognitively of course, but i dont seem to get myself to act like it.

This summer was really hard on me, i constantly had thoughts like ""if work is 30% of life (and 50% of awake life) then living is not worth it""(My ""work"" at that time consisted of studying for a neuropsychology exam, so hardly the acid mines, just to give you a feel of how pathetic i was/am). I definitely dont want to go back to that place, but i fear that its always gonna happen at some point and i am just too spoiled to commit and go through with something.

I realize that all these problems are not on the outside but inside of me. I really have the feeling that i am gonna be a parasite leeching of my family for the rest of my life (I dont intend to kill myself, but it would seem to me a more ethical decission than that).

I know that noone can take decissions like that from my shoulders, but i hope that i get some external viewpoints from writing this.

Thank you for reading

tl;dr: I have tried out a bunch of different  paths of study in university. I dont know if i am too lazy for Uni, i dont know if i can cope with the status loss of learning a trade at 23, even though that atleast sounds like a more enjoyable career path.",16Nov2020,1
754,"i’ve got a friend who I’m really close with, and he has recently been having some troubles with money. i helped to pay off some of his bills but it wasn’t enough, and he took out a payday loan. he is very calm about it but it stresses me out, cause i know some people who have lost their houses because of these kind of loans. i offered to try and help some more but he keeps refusing my help and tells me not to worry about his finances, as it’s not my problem, which is technically true!

however, i cannot seem to be able to separate myself from this situation. i feel responsible for him and want to help, but clearly he doesn’t want me to interfere. I’ve always struggled with feeling like i need to be the parent figure to my close friends and don’t know how to stop stressing myself out about this. i even thought about starting a go fund me campaign to try and raise some money for my friend but i know that if he finds out, he will hate me for it (he’s very prideful and doesn’t want anyone to know about his financial issues).

755,"I (F, 16) had a sleepover with my best friend (F, 15) a few nights ago. We got pretty drunk but everything was going fine. We were having loads of fun. I finally decided I was gonna go to sleep so I laid on the bottom bunk (she usually sleeps on the top bunk). Then I felt her get in the bed with me. We are both LGBTQ+ (Pan) but we never have had any feelings for eachother. 

We basically just cuddled and I was too out of it to tell her to go to bed on her bunk. She was rubbing my back for awhile and I think she kissed my forehead. I fell asleep. I woke up to her doing online classes (CCD classes) and I had asked her if I had fallen asleep. 

She said yeah and said that she had ended up going up to the top bunk like right after. Everything was completely fine the morning after. We had breakfast and she taught me some more chords on guitar. 

But today she has barely texted me and when I mentioned we should do room cleaning again (we sometimes get together and clean each others rooms) she just flat out responded “no” and hasn’t said anything else to me. Is she mad at me? 

I don’t think she has feelings for me and I hope she doesn’t, because anyone that has rejected her but asked to stay friends usually she just cuts out. She is like my best and only friend and my other friends are friends I met through her. I don’t hang out with them unless it’s all of us.

757,"Hey so I’m living with my parents and I had bought a puppy, named her Bella. Apparently that is the neighbors dogs name, I’ve been training her to respond to the name and making some progress and I myself am attached to it. I see the dog and think Bella, they’re intertwined in my head so I’m really against renaming the dog especially because I’ll be moving out in either a year or less so it won’t even be my neighbor for the vast majority of the dogs life. 

Dad is upset but I’ve looked up hundreds of names and none of them sound right to me because I’ve connected that name to the puppy. I’m really not trying to call my dog something I don’t like for 12 years just because 1 of those 12 years there is another dog near us with the name. 

In my head I’m thinking, what if we had this dog a year earlier before we moved here?? They would still have the same name and you wouldn’t make me change it so why does it matter now.

Considered just fast forwarding my moving out plans because this and some other things I just don’t want the external hassle In my personal decisions anymore. Should I stay firm on the name and if it’s gonna be some huge deal just focus on getting my new place faster? Thoughts?",16Nov2020,1

So at the moment all i feel im doing is working. Im not a big fan of my job or any job ive had to be honest! I get stressed, upset and mad about my job there isnt much i can do about it, i really hate my job. this is probably due to my depression and anxiety making days and work worse i end up bringing these emotions home and im never in a great mood. I work a lot of unsociable hours so it makes me feel so alone. 

I have also been struggling to deal with my brothers drug addiction, i dont think i will ever forgive him or forget what he put us all through the past few years. I still live at home at the moment and this also stresses me out because we are all always arguing and fighting, police turning up, court cases. 

I also feel like im losing friends every year and they are all moving on with there lives and getting boy friends etc always doing things with them and they are never free to do things and im just stuck on this downward spiral to being alone i dont have anyone or anything to look forward to. 

To continue on that my dating life is what id call a joke for a number of reasons. Ive only really had one proper relationship which ended in disaster. I have struggled with sex since my first time at 17.... always so nervous and scared which makes it worse for down below because it never relaxs enough for sex and it always hurts. I even thought i was gay for a while because of it! I have seen a specialist all normal just in my head apparently - So i have now related sex to be a bad and painfull thing. Dating in this day and age is the worst its all about the “Netflix and Chill” or “Send Nudes”! I genuinly think im going to end up alone because everyone i chat to always ends up not working out and im always devastated and back to where i started! No where!

761,"I’ve been having issues doing anything sexual around my partner. For me, I’ve never had a sexual past, I’ve always kept myself to myself.

She (16F) hasn’t done much, however it is been much in the sense of being ‘used’ for the other’s pleasure, and it’s only been oral. Before going any further, I want to reassure that I know I’m overreacting and acting selfishly, but I don’t know how to control my emotions.

We’re both very much dom/sub, we’ve made each other aware of it, but the first time we tried something I couldn’t stop thinking about the idea of her being ‘used’ (in her words) by someone else. Even if it’s in the past, it was enough and has been enough to completely throw my mood into being upset and unable to keep an erection. This happened around 3-4 weeks ago, I apologised and have reassured her that it’s completely me and not her, however I told her that it’s because i was nervous, not the reason above.

I can’t bring myself to say anything, I know it’s in her past and there’s nothing she can do about it - if I say anything, I’ll get a reply along the lines of her saying she shouldn’t have said anything and that I’ve made her upset at herself. She also has a lot of other boys interested in her, and she can only be so reassuring, so I feel like I’m stuck and impossible to move forward. Even today, we somehow got onto the topic of her past, and she brought up the idea of being ‘used’ and she wanted it for her own validation (I knew this already, it’s just seeing those words that hurt).

I don’t know what to do. I feel like I can’t do anything with her. I was getting to a point where I felt exclusive to her and she was exclusive to me, but then that was brought up. I feel like I’m genuinely going insane from the idea of it, and when I do anything with her all I can see is her being ‘used’ by someone else in the same room and I can’t be the 100% thing that she wants. It’s brought me to tears, and to help for context I have diagnosed anxiety, I dislike saying it and I know it’s not a reason, but I can’t bring myself to be confident enough and after the images come into my head I can hardly even be affectionate or talk to her, I can feel it strongly getting in the way of the love I have for her.

To add to this, I already have had issues as my girlfriend had to point out numerous issues with my penis: phimosis, short frenulum (having surgery \[redacted\]). On top of that, I’m only just about 7inches, and I believe her past experiences were larger and she watches porn with larger sizes and of course better performing men, I can’t see myself satisfying her, and my once high sex drive has gone through the floor because of this.

771," Looking for some advice on how to handle a bump in the road in a relationship. I am a 24 year old male and she is a 24 year old female. We have been seeing each other for a few months.  Any advice or similar stories are greatly appreciated. TL;DR at end.

I started seeing a girl I met through mutual friends back in early September. Let's call her Sarah.

We went on a first date early September, and really hit it off. Sarah came back to my place and we hooked up. A day after that, we both said we had a good time and made plans together for another date, and also hung out casually again during that week.

Anyways, the weekend immediately following our date, I was out of town for a wedding. That weekend she hooked up with another guy that she met at a party. I can forgive this since at that point we had only been out once on a date and had only hung out a couple of times so obviously it wasn't like serious at that point yet. I did not learn about this until our convo last night

So time continues and this next incident is two months into consistently seeing each other / dating (we went on a nice date night every single week since we first saw each other, and we were spending 2-3 days a week, sometimes more, seeing each other i.e. staying at each other's apartments on work nights during the week, doing things together during the day, and consistently having sex throughout this time). One weekend she kind of went radio silent on me while she was out at a party and it turns out she went home with a guy she met and hooked up with him.

I am more hurt about this situation. Because, to me, we were consistently hanging out and I thought it was implied that it was a higher level than just a casual fling since we were spending so much time together seeing as we stayed over 2-3 nights a week and we had also been going on date nights every single week. Also I wish she would have atleast told me about it on her own accord, especially since we were regularly having sex and that brings the backdoor chance that I could be exposed to like STDs or something (which I did not get an STD , but just the principle here... I feel like you at that point you should tell someone. But maybe this is a poor assumption). However, we did not formally have a discussion explicitly saying that we were exclusive. We did have deeper level discussions about us but we did not specifically say exclusive.

I had some suspicions she might have been seeing other people. Saturday night I told her I wanted to talk to her as that suspicion had been growing and I wanted to address it, and I felt like I was getting mixed signals from her and I wanted to address that.

We were talking and communicating very well about the things that were bothering each of us and how to fix them. Eventually, I told her that I had some suspicions I wanted to address and I asked her if she had been seeing other people. She openly admitted and told me about these two instances, told me it was the only two times this happened (two different guys) and she hasn't seen either person since those one night stands after the parties she was at.

I am really hurt because I really like this girl and really see potential with her. To me, the first instance is understandable and forgivable - I can let that go.

That being said, I feel like with the second instance, that was a really big violation of my trust and I feel like she really walked over me. However, in her defense, we had not had a formal talk saying we were mutually exclusive.... but I did think the level at which we were spending time together constituted atleast an implication of it. She said to her, in her mind, that since we hadn't had that talk yet that thought it was okay for her to hook up with other guys she meets. And I understand that, but I am still really hurt because I would not have done that to her based on the level we were at, at that point. 2 months of hanging out and staying the night together 2-3 days a week plus a nice date night every single week too. I also am upset that she didn't tell me about it until I confronted her.

When she told me this I got upset and asked her to leave my apartment, and ordered her an uber home as I was really heated and I needed time to digest.

We talked through it last night. She basically told me she wants to try to make things work with me and keep this going at a more serious level. I told her I really like her and want to be with her but that this might be too much of an obstacle to get over for me as I don't want a relationship to be on a broken foundation of trust like this so I needed time to process. Although the more I think about it, I think I could possibly get past this. My feelings towards her outweigh the feelings of being upset... I think. She told me when she did that she was still trying to figure out her feelings for me and she promised me that these were the only 2 times it happened. It seems at this point in time she was still unsure her feelings about me

I asked her what she wanted to do going forward. She said she wants to try and keep things going and take it more seriously and see where it goes... So that is good.

But then I told her if we do that, I need to know we are exclusive and if she is going to hookup with someone else I need her to tell me beforehand that she wants to see other people and that we are over BEFORE she goes and does that. And of course I would respect her wishes to cut it off if that is what she wants.

However, she did tell me that she is afraid of the idea of commitment / being exclusive but she wants to give it a shot. I was kinda taken aback by that so I said look, if we keep going there can't be more hookups with other guys like I need to know it will just be us. And if it gets to a point where it won't be just us, I need you to tell me first and end things.

But instead of flat out saying yes and agreeing to that, she said that she wants to really give us a try and promised that if something happens again she would tell me after it happens..... Which almost felt like she was saying sure we can try but I can't promise you I won't go hook up with someone else while we are 'exclusive'. The difference here being that she is implying that she try her best, and would tell me after as opposed to agreeing when I told her I need her to tell me beforehand and need her to end things with me before it happens. So that kinda spooked me a bit as it sounded like she was saying she didn't want to give up 'random encounters' kind of things. Its like she wants to take the cake and eat it too. I 100% respect if she isn't ready for that commitment.... and she said she does want to really give it a try with just me so it felt like I got some  mixed signals there.

Today we are supposed to talk again. I am going to ask her to elaborate on what she meant. I need to tell her if I want to keep this thing going, if I want to take a step back and make it casual and both see other people, or if I want to stop. Do you think I am in the wrong to be upset and hold this against her since we had not formally had the exclusive talk and that I should let this go? Or do you think it is a huge red flag that she hooked up with this other guy she met at a party 2 months into us consistently spending a bunch of time together? 

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR - Girl I've been seeing for four months was hooked up with other guy 2 months into us consistently spending large amounts of time together, and I am hurt by it. However, we had not formally specifically said we are exclusive so she argues that it was okay. Unsure if I should give it another shot. Feel like almost like I have been cheated on, but I know I can't say she cheated one me since we did not specifically say exclusive yet, even though we were acting very much as exclusive people would. Unsure if this is something I should try and work past or if this is a big red flag?",16Nov2020,2
772,"We're both early to mid 20s and not super experienced, which we've shared with each other.

However, just in the past year, she's gotten specific about her...shall we say - *needs*...and she'll bring this up completely unprovoked.

We've always talked about dating and who were attracted to, but never anything explicitly dirty. Now though, she's brought up to me just how horny she is (verbatim) and it wasn't just a one time thing. The pent up frustrations of not having an active sex life are what's spurring her. She also discussed how she has been searching techniques on how to give amazing blow jobs.

Is it normal for girls to open up this exact kind of dialogue with a male friend? This would be someone who you are fairly close and open with...except when it comes to sexual stuff. Or could these be signals I'm missing? Is she bringing this up because she wants me to 'help her'?

773,"What to say or do for my housemate/friend who's uncle is about to die of Covid? She says she is mostly feeling angry. Which to be honest is justifiable and I completely agree with her. She is angry at this death that could have been prevented, angry that  the world around us didn't take this virus more seriously, that the government didn't do more, that the general public acted seems to be more selfish and less selfless.

I agree with her anger but if we just dwell in the anger I don't think that will be very helpful.

What can I say to her when she has every right to be angry at this shitshow? Her uncle will die just like many other and I don't know how to help. This isn't an inevitable death, this isn't some elderly relative who has lived a good long life.

I am worried the person may have been calling about a job offer, and may think I have hung up on them. But, I quickly recharged my phone and the phone number that called is nowhere in my call history so I can’t call them back. I guess that’s what happens when your phone dies in the middle.

I don’t remember the full phone number, but the area code I remember matches the location the person would have been calling from.

I don’t want to appear rude as I really want this job, but if this person wasn’t actually calling from the employer I don’t want to bug the employer and piss them off because it hasn’t been that long since the job interview.

Two Fridays ago (11/6) the recruiter called me saying that they were offering me the position and that the onboarding process would take a month or so. She then emailed me a form to fill out, and passed off the process to the administrative assistant who emailed me saying that she hoped to have my offer letter by the following Wednesday (11/11). However, I didn't hear from them at all last week so I emailed the administrative assistant last Friday asking if there were any updates, but have not yet received a response.

779," Hi, I'm an introvert, have social anxiety, and had some bad experiences in life where my friends turned into bullies.

I have always been the quiet one in the class. Always been super nice to people. Never been shady or rude even when it was necessary. I avoided rude behaviors towards me most of the time and almost never stood up for myself. Tried my best to be kind to people and help them out ( even the shittiest people). Though I did some dumb things in the past and still do, I know I've learned a lot and still learning. I avoid dramas and also I don't share much about my life.

I speak in a very formal and polite way. I had a really low tone but now I've set my voice tone to the medium so that people can hear what I am saying

Anyway, I do think it's necessary to have an attractive personality on the outside. Something that works for me and fits me and feels comfortable. And I know it's necessary to learn how to be rude to shitty people and stand up for myself because not all the people are gonna be nice. But I don't feel super energetic and motivated all the time around people and I don't talk much unless it's necessary.

Some of my acquaintances told me that people kinda perceive me as ""dumb and easy"". Also told me to spice it up and level up my game. I know their opinions don't matter. But how do I change my behavior so that I don't get labeled as ""dumb and easy""? How can I learn to be confident socially?

782,"My (21f) brother (23m) got a Doberman puppy. Lately he’s been leaving his puppy to go out and drink. He’ll leave for hours and make his roommates watch the dog for him. He also ignores her to play video games and hasn’t taken her to the vet to get her shots. She’s coming onto 15 weeks and she only has gotten her first rounds of shots. She still needs others but my brother won’t even get her registered to a vet so that I can take her since he’s so “busy”. My brother claims that she’s not potty trained and that it’s hard for him to train her, but when I watched her for a day, she had no accidents. Every time she signaled to go outside, I made sure to take her out, even if I was in the middle of something. She’s a smart dog, and knows not to go inside, but since my brother isn’t giving her any attention she has accidents in his apartment. I’ve also trained her how to sit, lay down, shake, and stay in the times that I’ve dog-sat for my brother, so she’s very trainable. It’s just my brother not making the effort. 

I tried talking to my brother about being a better owner but he claimed he was being responsible and that it wasn’t my place to step in since she’s HIS dog. I’m getting frustrated because my brother doesn’t work and is planning on enlisting next year and leaving the dog with me. He agreed to pay me to take care of her while he’s gone, but I feel bad that he’s neglecting her. He doesn’t even have enough money to care for her (I found out from my mom that he only has $800 in his savings). He still needs to pay his rent which is $600/mo.

785,"I'm a 25F and I live at home with my mom (58F) and my girlfriend (24F). Because this is relevant to the current disagreements, I am living at home because I am getting my master's degree. I am working full-time. I was going to move out of the house before I started my master's program to live with my girlfriend, but my mom convinced me to stay at home so that I could pay for my program straight-up and avoid going into debt. I cannot afford to pay for both rent and my degree, so I agreed. My girlfriend ended up moving in with us at the beginning of quarantine, and she pays a small portion of rent to my mother. I do not.  

Our disagreements revolve around the current pandemic. I live in the US, for reference. I have been working out the entire time, and when the gyms opened up again, I returned because I go to a small, private gym with very few people. While she has never been 100% comfortable with this, she has told me that it is alright since they are taking precautions.

Now that it is fall, my mother has become much more stressed because of the coronavirus numbers going up again. She decided that she wanted to move out of the house into a new apartment for a few months until March and the numbers hopefully go down. Both me and my girlfriend told her we didn't want her to feel like we were forcing her out, but she said that the risk that we go through daily was too much and she was afraid for her life. I work for the government, and I work from home 3 days a week and in the office 2 days a week, and I have since the very beginning of quarantine because my position is considered essential in the office. Even when others were working entirely remotely, I did not. My girlfriend works full-time at a golf dome, and there is no ability for her to work remotely. When the dome was shut-down, she was out of work. She has returned to work again for the past few months, though there has been talk lately that the dome may shut down again. My mother's office recently went on shut-down again (this week), but before that, she was required to go into the office 5 days a week. The only things I do outside of the house is go to work, to my night classes once a week (there is no remote option for them) and very infrequently the store to pick up necessary goods for us. I have switched to private lessons at the gym, so it is only me and my trainer in the gym while I am there. There are other people in the gym before and after us, and she has recently informed me this makes her highly uncomfortable because she thinks that I could get infected because I share an air system with these people, even though I am not in the building at the same time. 

I did not want her to move out, but as I said before, I simply can't afford to move out on my own until I'm done with my master's program in the spring. My mom said that she was going to take one of our three cats with her when she moved out, and I told her that I didn't think that was a good idea, because there could be potential problems with stressing them out if they were to frequently come back and forth between households, or issues reintroducing them if they were gone with her for a few months. One of the cats technically belongs to my mother, but I do all of the work for all three of them (litter, feedings, groomings, vet, etc). The one cat that is hers, she does not like him as much - I think partially because he has taken to me more and she fears he has serious medical issues. I have expressed interest in buying him from her (he is a purebred), since she will often bring up that he is hers whenever the topic of me moving out one day comes up. She likes the cat that belongs to me, and has tried to convince me to ""trade"". (I want to take them both.) I think that this is why she won't give me a straight answer on purchasing her cat from her, because she is hoping to keep my cat when I go. The third cat is my girlfriend's, and isn't a topic of debate. I haven't been too adamant on this because I don't plan on moving out anytime soon. However, it's become an issue again now that she's looking to move out of the house. When I told her that I didn't think it would be good for any of the cats for her to take just one, she started to cry and say that she would be all alone, and that I didn't want her to have a pet. I said this wasn't true, that I had the best interests of our cats well-being in mind. I suggested that she foster a cat if she doesn't want to be lonely, and she said that she didn't want to. After a bit of back and forth, she told me she didn't want to talk about it, so I said okay. Not a few minutes later she came to me, saying that she felt disrespected that I continued to go to the gym even though it was putting her at risk. I said that I did not think it was putting her at risk, but we cannot agree on this. She said that the house belonged to her, and she didn't think it was fair that she was moving out. I said I didn't want her to move out, and she insisted again she didn't feel safe. The only thing I could change right now is stopping my one session a week with the private trainer - I can't not go into work (which is under 25% capacity right now on any given day) and I can't not go to night classes (at least not until this semester is over). I could work entirely remotely if me or any of my household was considered high risk - however, none of us are, so I have not asked for this. My girlfriend has debt, and cannot afford to quit her job or find a new one (she technically works for the university she attends, and gets free tuition - she is not attending classes anymore, but she is locked in her job for a year, or she will have to pay it all her previous classes back to them.) However, my girlfriend going to work is never brought up as a problem to her.

I asked her if the only thing making her move out was me going to the personal trainer once a week. She said she would think about it, and cried more. 

I'm at a loss what to do here. I genuinely do not believe that me going to the gym once a week with only my trainer who is wearing a mask is a risk, but I am willing to give it up if it will make a difference to her on moving out. Me going to the gym and having this plan is extremely important to me. I was previously overweight, and I am trying to move into a position where I would have to pass a physical fitness requirement. However, I feel like she's being extremely unreasonable here, and I feel entirely trapped because I would like to move out if I could, given how stressed this is making me and all the tension it is causing. She's expressed several times that she thinks me going to the gym is too costly (I pay for it entirely) and a waste of my time and money as well. I feel as though I am too close to this, and my girlfriend is too close to the situation to get advice from her. Am I the one being unreasonable here? How should I approach this?",16Nov2020,1

Originally the intentions were to date but we never put a label on it or did anything beyond hanging out all the time. After about 3 months we both decided due to things going on in our life it just wasn’t a good time to commit but that we could still be best friends. Once Corona hit she blocked me out entirely after a small fight. I went home and we didn’t speak at all which was heartbreaking for both of us. About a month ago she reached out wanting to talk and apologized genuinely for everything, she gave some reasons as to why she acted how she did but made it very clear that none of the reasons were an excuse for her actions. She has many mental issues going on in her life and many family and situational issues. I don’t envy her life but I care for her nonetheless. I was absolutely destroyed by what she did to me but since she has reached out and admitted that she was wrong I have more hope for the situation. 

Recently she was sexually assaulted to add to the list of pains in her life. I feel for her and want to be there for her. She has recently been hooking up with guys to try and cope for what happened. I’m a virgin, grew up in a religious home and I don’t agree with it but I want to be there for her and to support her. But I am wrestling with this news. I think the issue is I think I love her. I have done everything I possibly can to be there for her end she relies on me a lot. But listening to her talk about the people she is hooking up with to get over what happen hurts me. I’m also conflicted as to how selfish is that thought. That I am hurt because she is trying to cope in that way when she is the one who went through the assault. Maybe I’m just a simp haha.

I just don’t know want the next step if any there is to be taken.

My mom knows about this, she says to ignore it wheras my dad is very naive about this. I tried to bring this up to him and he said it was all in my head and I was just being negative. He loves his family very much and can't see that these people are really selfish and only want to be in our company to one up us and pat themselves on the back for being richer than us. 
Family gatherings are unpleasant and anxiety inducing for me due to this fact.

My birthday is Nov. 25th, due to it being on a holiday I always celebrate the weekend before. I always try to make my plans for my birthday to go out.

For my 21st birthday I invited 25 people, made reservations for a restaurant and only one person came.

For my 22 birthday I planned to just go out bar hopping. Everyone canceled last minute and I drank 2 bottles of wine alone before my roommate said let’s go to a bar.

For this year dispute covid restrictions I invited 10 people to go to a restaurant for margs. Being as we are all students and get tested weekly and all have classes online I figured at least a few would say yes. 3 weeks ago I send the message asking them to come, to day I asked who was for sure coming and not a single person said they would come.

I guess my feelings are just really hurt. It’s like this every year. If I am invited to someone’s birthday going out I always make the best effort to go. Now that it’s mine here I am yet again planning to spend it alone at this point. 

I guess there isn’t much to do from here. Should I say something in the group chat like “I guess I’ll just spend my birthday alone like I do every year?” Or just let it go. I’m just not sure what I’ve done to deserve this every. year. 


Also to add it’s not like the people I invite are staying strictly in quarantine. I see them at dinner with people and out and about on social media every day.

I stopped eating for a minute for two to talk to a friend and then a staff lady came up to me and started scolding me for having my mask down when I wasn’t eating when she could clearly see the sandwich and other food in my hand out in front of me.

This not only happens to me by a lot of friends. It’s even always intentional. Like when we are talking naturally we move closer to each other and we are wearing masks. It’s not like it’s not consensual. People could ask you to back up and stuff and there wouldn’t be an issue.

To explain that, she cheated on him with multiple men. She also forced my dad to attend the funeral of one of these men. She bragged to him about cheating, even telling me, a 4 year old about it. She's terrible.

When I was around 4 my best friend was the opposite sex as me which was not a big deal we were kids. He has an older sister though, she made us do weird and inappropriate stuff (I won’t go into detail about it) and this continued until they moved away. I never told anyone about it and honestly just kinda forgot but recently I’ve remembered for some reason and thinking about it makes me uneasy. 

Other information that might be important : me and the kid were around the same age I think he was a year older. I don’t remember how old his sister was but she more than likely knew this was wrong.

I thought i was was prepared for 5th grade. 
Well... i wasn’t

It was so different from my elementary school. 
So much Homework and tests. 

Unlike my friends who got used to that new system real quick, i was just so „shocked“? 
Nothing made sense anymore. 
I basically only had D‘s and E‘s for the first semester. 

I‘m only in 9th grade and i don’t have motivation to do anything at all. 
I know very well that i need to become better in school so i get my Abitur (a higher degree ig) , but like- i just don’t have the motivation to do anything at all.   
Because at the end of the day i‘ll get an E anyway, no matter how hard i prepared for that exam. 

I cry a lot thinking about school. 
I also have struggles breathing because i panic a lot especially in french and Math classes. 



Also, most of my teachers say that I’m actually very intelligent but too free spirited, if that makes any sense.

825,"Hello there! I am a full time university student (24F), and I work multiple jobs, including a retail company, as well as a school. The school I work at has a thanksgiving break, and I wanted to coordinate time off Monday- Friday at other jobs a few months in advance so that I can just have a week of not a single job going on for relaxing, mental health, and to catch up on life.

The retail job approved me vacation Mon-Wed for the week of thanksgiving. They are closed Thursday and open Friday. Almost a month ago, I changed my default scheduling availability to be open every day except for Friday, since it was becoming hard for me to coordinate extra work Friday with other jobs. My boss had mentioned us needing to work fri or sat as required for the holiday which I understand.

This week I got my schedule and saw that I had been scheduled on Friday outside my default availability that was put in the system weeks ago (for the years I have worked here it has been said that should not happen). I am mostly upset and confused about the response I got after reaching out about it. My boss considered my schedule outside of the retail job, noting that since she knew of the school vacation at one of my jobs, that I “should be fine” in still working, and to reach out if I really did have to work at the school. I am frustrated because on principle I think it was unprofessional for her to weigh my obligations outside this workplace and then assume entitlement to my closed availability because she thought I wouldn’t be at one particular job, as well as specifying the condition to get back to her about it. I was also a little peeved because in her email to me she said we’d have to work “at least” Friday and Saturday shifts, but in person she mentioned either or (I am working Saturday as well but I had expected that).

Ultimately I know that even though this is not how my work has handled being scheduled outside availability in the past, it looks like legally I can still be disciplined for not going. Should I stand up and say no I won’t do the shift? I don’t think that’s worth it since I could make the shift in reality, but I feel like I should at least say something for boundaries/express that I am more than just my work shifts and that I didn’t appreciate her assuming about my other job, and assuming anytime I’m not at work can belong to the retail job (I already have six days a week available normally when I just need three). Though I’ll probably go through with the shift, it doesn’t quite sit right with me not to say anything at all. I have gotten some mixed advice already, but would love to hear any advice or perceptions you all have. This is what her response said

“You are scheduled because it is Black Friday and it is all hands-on deck. It is also part of the Black out period. Schools are closed it is a holiday so you should be fine. Please let me know if for some reason your school is open. Also, I know we had a conversation around that week's schedule and I shared because it was Black Friday Weekend you would be scheduled at least Friday and Saturday. Also, per our conversation you have Monday through Thursday off. Please reach out or feel free to reach out or set up a time to call me on Tuesday”

832,"Hi all. 

I want to go back to school to finish my degree and then go on to get my MS in mental health counseling. I’ve been looking into how I can “life coach” as an alternative, but I’m worried about legal repercussions as well as not being as trained as I could be and therefore endangering clients even if I trust myself to not do so. 

On the other hand, however, I want to start a YouTube channel discussing spiritual and “New Age” ideas about metaphysics and how they relate to the nature of consciousness and reality. I’ve had a wide range of experiences that prove to me that we are eternal spiritual beings incarnate in temporary physical bodies, and that consciousness is the underlying unifying principle of all of reality. That reality is ultimately a sort of illusionary construct designed to evolve souls spiritually which would otherwise have no challenges in their existences. We live in Gods’ dream, and are God dreaming. 

I wonder what your thoughts are on trying to help people with their mental health professionally while delving into these kinds of topics publicly? My concern is mainly my license being revoked due to someone deeming my channel “irresponsible.” I don’t know how being someone who helps people by the books mixes with someone who may induce psychosis through my thoughts and opinions. On one hand it’s my right to freely express myself, but on the other I’m not sure if the world of academia and regulation boards will approve of what I express if it leans towards me claiming truth from a solely subjective perspective, even if that perspective may be convincing. 

Idk I’m just trying to figure out my life. I’m also a musician, but I don’t want to solely rely on that for money and would love to help uplift the world as much I can and make my dent in it positively.

So me and my friend have been very close This past 4 years, She is 21 and i am 18 now, i basically grew up with her. We are so close We tell each other everything (or as i thought) and call each other family (we say “oh this is my sister etc”)
But recently I found out that my first real crush/love and her fucked. It was over a year ago and she knew how much I liked him.
Last year she told me that he tried to fuck her but she said no and went on, this year around 3-4 days ago I asked her if they fucked and and she said yes and started crying. I told her to go more into detail and she said she had his Snapchat and one day he asked to come over, so they fucked.
The reason I’m not mad at her or told her to fuck off is because she have had an history of never being able to say no to guys when they asked for sex.
I believe/believed her story but it just..feels wrong.
Like if he asked over Snapchat why didn’t she say she was busy? Or that idk no maybe don’t come over?
I have an insane fear of people always liking her more and that’s why I fear inviting people over. Should I be even more scared and not invite people even less because I’m scared she is going to fuck them?
She also was/is in a relationship when she fucked my crush and is still together with this man (she has never told him this)

Now, I was supposed to babysit them two weeks ago. Mom cancelled on me like an hour or two before I was supposed to pick up the youngest because the oldest got sick. I had said no to a 5 hour shift at my retail job where I actually earn more. So I didn’t just lose the 60$ I usually earn, but I also lost the 120$ I could’ve earned at the retail job. It sucked but I was understanding and wished them better health.

I asked a few days ago if they were better just to make sure and she said yes. Now, the night prior she cancelled again because she’s sick. I fully understand that illness can come unexpectedly and that it’s not her fault she got sick but fuck? All of my Tuesday shifts have been cancelled at my retail job even though I only babysit them two tuesdays a month. I have to say I’m super frustrated because now I lose money again with so little notice.

I feel like I should let her know that I cancelled shifts at my retail job to babysit them. I also thought about implementing a cancel fee? Take 50% of what I was supposed to earn. 100%? That would be 30$ for 50% and 60$ for 100%.

I'm a European, which means the process for applying to medical school here is done straight outta high school based on your grades, some colleges have an entrance exam( it's similar to the MCAT )

I love medicine, I am deeply fascinated by the human body and capable of working hard, I've always enjoyed the biological sciences as well as chemistry.

However, in the recent year I've been exposed to some physics at a slightly higher level and I've become mesmerized at the equations and their implications in the real world.

In terms of years studying both medicine and physics would take me about 6-10 years,(specialization in medicine and going down the PhD route for physics).

I'm fairly smart and whilst in terms of better living conditions, medicine would be a no brainer, but I want to also consider the possibility that I can do some good with my brain in the field of physics.

847,"There’s no easy way to say this but. I messed up.  
My brother and his girlfriend always argue! Like a lotttt, and I always give them advice on how to work things out. So when they do argue, she comes to me, and we seem to get on really well. And we like the exact same things. She’s told me many times that she’s chose the wrong brother. A few days ago, she came into my room, closed the door and we had a little chat about what to get my brother for Christmas. And then. 
We made eye contact, staring into each others eyes, and we out loud said ‘I know what you want to do’ so we both felt it. And then, we kissed, multiple times, she said she’s wanted to do that for ages. And so have I, she said her heart is pounding. Anyways then we went to the shops and kissed again. It’s pretty weird and canny hard to act normal around my brother when she’s there and act like nothings happened. I’ve never been in this situation before. But here’s a few more details. 
She’s once said about a year ago she’s had multiple sex dreams about me, so the other night I asked her if she actually wants to have sex, she said yes. 
And then says she wants to see how things go with my brother. And for us to be close friends. She said just relax, chill. 
So I have been and I’ve acted normal around my brother. Last night. She came into my room, pretty much done a slut drop and then stuck her arse out towards me and was singing. 
Part of me is thinking she’s playing mind games and stringing me along. Obviously I feel terrible about the whole situation, I’ve done the most selfish thing a person could do. Thing is, I know that you’re going to tell me to sit him down and tell him. How I’m earth do I approach that. My family including him, will hate me forever. Part of me thinks me and her could work. But is that a fantasy and not reality. Tbh I think the best thing to do is end it with her completely but don’t tell my brother. 
Anyways. Please help.",16Nov2020,2
848,"Exactly what the title says.

I took time off college this semester (it’s supposed to be my first semester) to figure out what I want to do.

I was studying physics to become an astronaut, but I was incredibly bad at almost every class, plus I have ADHD, so it’s basically impossible for me to become one.

Ever since I was a kid I wanted to study acting (been a theatre kid all my life), but I want to have a college degree that provides money.

I have an *idea* of what I want to do, but I’m not sure yet. I want to study creative writing, but the local college I was attending (and the only one in my town, mind you) doesn’t have that degree.

The only college that has that degree is the capital of the country I live, but my parents don’t want me to go there since it’s one of the most dangerous cities in the world.

The only degree that’s closely related to creative writing is journalism, and it’s a degree my local college offers. But when I told my mom this she lost it and called me a failure and told me I’m going to get myself killed.

Which is somewhat true, I’ve looked at the statistics and yeah, most journalists get killed. 

It seems like every career I want has only a set of cons, and no pros. 

I just want a career that’ll help me pay the bills, since I want to move out of this country and family ASAP, and that allows me to travel the world. 

I was thinking maybe I could study psychology, but I’d be overwhelmed by the amount of emotional labor I’d have to do.

I just don’t know what do. It seems like every time I make my mind up about a career I want to study, there’s something that comes in the way of that.

I’d appreciate if someone could help me out, or give me some perspective. TIA!

TL;DR: The major I want to pursue isn’t a career that’s offered by the college I’m attending, it’s only in the capital of my country. Parents don’t let me go to said university. There’s related majors to the one I want, but they’re not the same. What should I do?",16Nov2020,1

850,"Hello reddit

So i’ve been in love with a girl for 6-7 months or something and I’ve just been very nice to her, giving compliments etc. but haven’t told her.

Now apparently she told her friend who knows about this that she had a small feeling that I liked her just but because I looked at her differently lately (I didn’t even realize this myself though), and then she told her that she wasn’t really looking for a relationship with anyone though. Her friend then told me this.

I felt sad, I didn’t want to because for the last 6 months I was preparing for a “rejection” but still I feel really sad. 

(She still doesn’t know btw)

I really do respect that she’s not looking for a relationship or anything but I just can’t stop thinking about it. I’m just feeling very depressed, I don’t know what to do anymore, I just want to take “a long break from life”.

My dad was a dangerous person who has been out of my family and I’s life since I was 3 years old (I’m in my 20’s now, a college graduate, graduate student, and STEM professional). I was in contact with my paternal grandmother and cousins for a few years afterwards but cut contact when I was 8 due to the dangers of my father (attempted murderer and repeat assaulter). From them I learned I have a little sister, who I will call X. X will be turning 18 next spring.

While browsing for a new tattoo artist, I came across X’s mom, whose a tattoo artist in a city an hour from mine. Her portfolio is on Instagram, and on her page I saw pictures of X for the first time- we look almost identical. From her mom’s page I found hers (I’m certain it’s X, she has an extremely unique name). We have very similar interests and are both artists, musicians, and outdoor enthusiasts. 

From X’s page I found out X’s mom had two other children with my father- a girl (Y) and a boy (Z). My little sister Y is 16 and my little brother Z is 14. Y looks even more like me than X, and Z is a spitting image of our father. From their mom’s page it is 100% clear that they have no contact with my dad or his family.

I was planning on reaching out to X after she turned 18, but now that I know I have two more underage siblings I’m not sure if I should. I have always wanted to develop a relationship with X, and since learning I have 2 other siblings, I would love to create a relationship with them as well. 

Should I still reach out to X next year? Or should I reach out to their mother now that I know I have underage siblings? Or should I just forget them all and go my own way and let them go theirs?",16Nov2020,3

862,"Hi everyone,
I [22F] am getting ready to leave for college within the year. I spent some years in a community college so I could stay home while I get credits. My mom is 62 and it will be the first time that she'll have no kids at home. All 3 of my siblings have gone. I'm the last one at home. For the past year, I've tried helping her clean the house out (a lot of clutter ...borderline hoarder) I don't want to abandon her. I tried looking for smaller apartments to downsize but she keeps pushing it off and rolling her eyes when I explain why she must downsize. She works 2 jobs and barely is home to sleep in her bed to manage this. I found a supervisor program so she can get a promotion  at her current job. I asked her if we could both put money together so she could get her certificate and just work one job to afford a single bedroom apartment. I'm afraid she thinks I'm pushing this on her but I've taken so much time already to declutter, find job opportunities, and downsize this apartment so that she'll be okay if I move out. Each time she hears this she says ""why are you in such a rush to leave"" or ""you always say that...I'm not a child""

I'm a healthcare worker, I know it is hard for older parents to get adjusted to living alone. I explain things to her &amp; try to finish paperwork of things so she isnt overwhelmed with info. How can I prepare my mom for her last child moving out? I don't want to postpone my education too much longer. Thanks in advance.",16Nov2020,1

865,I wanted to tell the authorities about it but it seems a bit complicated. I also thought about going to the press but I have no idea how that works. I'm also currently trying to join to see what it's all about (not gonna pay anything though).,16Nov2020,1
866,"I want to start this off and be very clear on something: I don't believe they have any kind of dependence or actual drinking problem.

Now that's out of the way.

Basically, the person in question (who is also my boyfriend) is a very inexperienced drinker and has just moved into uni accommodation with a flat of party animals. When he got to uni he wanted to get drunk for the first time and try lots of different drinks etc. Now, 2 months in, he's tried lots of drinks and been drunk but he insists he's never been drunk enough. I've seen him barely able to hold his head up over the toilet bowl, I've seen him barely able to formulate a coherent sentence, the list of things he does that he doesn't remember the next morning is piling up, he's been sick both on the night of drinking and the next morning but still insists he's never been \*that\* drunk. He wants to drink himself into a complete state of paralysis and it... scares me, I guess?

&amp;#x200B;

His flat is currently self-isolating as they've tested positive for corona, and that just mounts the worry. Drinking, apparently, has adverse effects on the immune system and makes corona symptoms worse and I don't want him to suffer for days on end for the sake of a few hours of fun. But honestly, I think that's just me trying to justify it. The real reason is that I'm worried because I can't be there to look after him. On Friday night, he got really drunk that he couldn't stand himself, and has bruises on his back and his back was aching from constantly falling over (still not ""that drunk"") and he said that would be the only time he drank over his Iso. I didn't think that would last the whole remaining 7 days, but I thought he'd make it a bit further than Monday evening, where he plans to get as drunk as on Friday. Not that it matters what he plans to do, because he can't say no to his flat. He has work to do that he's starting to fall behind on because his flat wants to drink most nights, and he can't say no. He can't stop unless they stop. He can't pull himself away from the party. He said that on Friday he got to the point where he felt sick and wanted to go to bed, but stayed because he couldn't pry himself away from the flat. And he's forcing himself to finish bottles of gin or vodka that he doesn't want because he's determined to drink himself into a coma.

&amp;#x200B;

I know it's unlikely that anything extremely negative comes out of the amount that he drinks. He's not likely to actually drink himself to death or vomit his intestines up or anything. I just worry because he is so determined to drink to the point where he can't look after himself. A few of his flatmates have a history of being pervy (and interested in him) and being far too violent and aggressive when drunk and I do really worry about him. But also, I'm not going to tell him how he should act or behave. He's my boyfriend, not my child. He wouldn't appreciate it and I wouldn't feel good about it. I guess, I just need advice on how to deal with this from my point of you? How I can reduce or manage the worry? I'm scared of what he's going to do to himself, or what someone might do to him when he makes himself vulnerable. And I don't want him to suffer.",16Nov2020,1
867,"Back in July, I bought $60 worth of merch off of someone I knew through college. He’s an amateur rapper with a side clothing business. He had been taking a very long time to complete my order back in August and dmed me about how busy he was. I told him how it was fine and he even mentioned how he would throw in an extra piece of merch for me. Fast forward to September and he said “shipping your order next week bro” and that’s the last I heard from him. I messaged him a few days ago asking if he had shipped yet and so far he has been ignoring that while posting up several new stories. Obviously I know that I’ve been scammed but I’m wondering if there’s any way that I could call my bank and possibly receive those funds back. I feel cheated and I hate being taken advantage of.

868,"tldr is the title. sorry if formatting is weird, I’m on mobile. 

For more context, we got the heartbreaking news that my cousin unexpectedly passed last week, and my mom’s been taking it really hard since she watched him grow up and is very close with his sister. 

Funeral plans are most likely going to be at the end of this upcoming week (nothing is set in stone as far as the date yet). There’s going to be as low as less than 30 to possibly well over 100 people attending a most-likely indoor service, and I’m nervous about the COVID risk since numbers in my state (as well as every other one) are on the rise lately. There’s also the possibility of a drive-up gravesite service that’ll be broadcast over FM radio for social distancing, but i’m not sure if that’s going to happen. 

We both live with my grandmother, who just turned 65, has pre-existing health conditions, and has been staying home for the better part of the last 7 months. I’m nervous about the chance of all of us catching it, but for her the most since she’s the highest risk. 

When I tried bringing up my concerns, she told me that she’s adamant on going no matter how many people are there and whether it’s inside or outside, and that i can choose to not go myself if I’m that nervous about it. She said she’ll wear a mask and that was the end of the conversation.

I don’t want to sound like I’m trying to control how she grieves / gets closure in this situation and most likely start a fight if I bring it up again. I also want her to be able to be there for his sister, wife, and kids, but I’m scared that even if everyone’s wearing masks, this could still end badly. I’ve read articles about people going to weddings or funerals and infecting entire families and some even end up dying, and that’s the scariest part for me. 

Am I selfish? Am I overreacting? Is there a way I could bring this up again without feeling like I’m walking on eggshells? Or should I just let it go?

**UPDATE**: The funeral’s going to be indoors and be held on Thursday so it can be done before county mandates prevent it in the area. They’re going to have a contact tracing sign in sheet, masks are required, and the family is asking everyone attending if they’ve been around large groups of people recently, but this doesn’t make me feel better. My anxiety about this is through the roof and I feel selfish because I would rather not have my mom go to this, but she’s still set on going. I’m not sure what else to do besides convince her to get tested afterwards and hope everything turns out okay.",16Nov2020,1
869,"Hello!

The title says a lot of it, but I'm very torn. I have been working at this location for ~2years, and I absolutely love my job. The problem is that it is a PT Job with very little in the way of short or medium term room for advancement. 

When I was hired two years ago, PT was fine. Since then, my boyfriend and I have bought a house and gotten more bills. My job has been poorly staffed, so I've been able to get between 40-56 hours per week, mostly owing to coworkers going on FMLA, and the inability for management to recruit other PT employees. 

I have spoken to my boss on several occasions explaining that I need a FT position. Her reaction is ""I'm sorry, but I can't create new shifts."" While this is disheartening (especially after the sacrifices I've made to cover while we've been short staffed,) it's ultimately understandable. I have an interview coming up for a job in the same field that is FT and may pay slightly better. 

My boyfriend and family thinks this is an excellent opportunity, but the coworkers I've spoken to about it seem to think I'd be a jerk to leave just as we're getting fully staffed. 

My dilemma is: I would feel terrible leaving. I absolutely love my co-workers and my job, and if it wasn't for the issue with perhaps going from 40+ hrs/week to ~20 hrs/week, I would never consider leaving. On the other hand, I'm not sure it's entirely fair to myself or my partner if I stay here.",16Nov2020,1

My addiction started when I started at a pizza place. Everyone did coke and while I’d tried it before with no problems, they were giving it to me constantly for free every day. That is, until I was hooked. And as I struggled with anorexia it felt like a miracle drug to me. At my peak I was doing $200 a day.

I don't see her like that but I think if I just reject her we'd most likely not remain friends. Also, I kinda wanna try out being in a relationship since I've never had a real relationship of the romantic sort, but the irony is that I don't have feelings for her. 

I suggested that we go out on a get together someday. Since, I live in a different city that 'date'  is gonna be when I go over to the city she's in. She also thinks long distance relationships work so maybe that's also why she thought she'd have a shot with me if I liked her back. 

And that brings me to another problem, there's this girl that lives around where I live and she is really cute like definitely my type but I know nothing about her. I only saw her once for a few minutes at an event and then she left, I don't even know her name. More importantly I don't even know if she has a boyfriend.

874,"Apologies for the long paragraph, I had a lot to pour out.

I am a 17 year old male, and I live in India. I have OCD, difficulty in communicating with people, for the past 3 years I have had a persistent headache(I am on medication for that), and for the past few months I believe I have been suffering from psychosis because I have experienced various audio and visual hallucinations. But my family doesn't know about this because I have been quiet successful in keeping this a secret from them. This may seem a bit weird but I had to do it because my family has a history of mental illnesses like both my grandfather and father have had nervous breakdown few years back, and my older brother is autistic and he started having aggressive episodes so we had to get him admitted in a neuropsychiatric centre; So my parents have very high hopes from me, since they have seen that I am extremely talented in Mathematics and Physics and have been at the top of my class since I started schooling and they believe that a person with a mental illness cannot accomplish something in his/her's life. During my early years at school(actually till 5th grade), I used to be very scared(for no particular reason and it sure wasn't bullies because I found a way to deal with them)  and had no friends till 2nd grade until I met him, let's call him A. He kind of understood me and we  became friends pretty fast. Since then he has been my only friend and he knew all about my struggles. We shared each of our problems and tried to support each other. Still, there were times when he completely abandoned me, because he wanted to try hanging out with the ""cool"" kids, and I also understood that and was never upset with him regarding that. Our friendship hit a bump because my family had to shift to another city and I had to change my school. My condition started to worsen and this was the time I started having random audio and visual hallucinations; with this my headache also didn't seem to improve and I had a very gruelling time. I sometimes was so frustrated that I banged my head hard on the walls. My grades started to worsen and thus I was getting a lot of pressure from my parents as well. I still used to contact him and we used to meet for movies and other stuff. I tried to share my recent problems(regarding hallucinations) with him and he kind of ignored it. The same happened the next few times we met as well, so I made sure that if he had any problems of himself. I contacted his siblings and his parents without letting him know but everything was good with him. Whenever I brought us this topic, he diverted the conversation and then he continued to ignore me for the next few months. I tried calling him but got no reply. My condition wasn't getting any better and one day something happened with me that I would not like to share here, and I was scared so I decided to try meet him one more time. This time he answered his phone and we decided to meet. I told him all that was happening with me and he just laughed a bit at the end and again changed the conversation. I was heartbroken and couldn't face him again and decided to not to contact him in the future. I never received a call from him after that. I spent the next few weeks in utter despair. This pandemic actually gave me some time away from my school and everything else and I am actually better now. 

Last month he just called me but I was shocked and wasn't ready to talk to him, he then texted that he just wanted a book. I decided to ignore it. But yesterday he again started sending a series of texts saying that I have been ignoring him and now he wants to talk. My plan was to ignore him again but he started calling and that caught my mother's attention and now she says that I need to contact him.

880,"Ok so I’m going to give some quick background to hopefully get some specific advice but general advice welcomed also. 

I don’t get on with my in-laws. It’s always about what they’ve got us and done for us, but they’re pretty awful at respecting my choices and boundaries. They’re not quite bad enough for a full justno rant, but I am very low contact. 

Despite not speaking to them they will get me a Christmas gift. It won’t be because they want to make up to be nice, it’ll be a spite gift. 

I already tried laying the groundwork last month by posting a public Fb post saying that due to moving house we had no Christmas budget and wouldn’t be getting anyone gifts and we did not want gifts from anyone (more politely than that obviously). But I know they are still going to get me something. 

I know people are going to say just take it, but honestly the guilt if someone gets me a gift and I don’t get them one back eats at me, I really hate that feeling. But I also don’t want the drama of refusing the gift or not taking it. I don’t want to break my no contact to just say thankyou and then not speak again. I just straight up don’t want a gift. 

I feel like they know all this and they’ll do it just to stress me out.

882," 

I have been dating a girl for close to three months now. I have never connected with a girl like I have with her, but of course we have our differences.

The one thing that worries me most is that she loves to get drunk. I go to an international school in Europe and she goes back to her country every holiday break to hang out with friends + family. During those days she is gone, she has told me she goes to clubs and gets drunk with her friends.

I have a bad past with alcohol. Lots of family issues have rooted from it. I have let her know of my concern for her and she was really nice about it. She did not argue and try to gaslight the conversation which I appreciated.

She has explained to me that all of her sexual encounters have occurred when she has been drunk. Whether it be from groping to full intercourse, it has happened only while drunk.

I have never had alcohol in my life and therefore do not know how self aware one can be when they are drunk. My SO claims to be pretty self aware when she is drunk, but due to my lack of knowledge I just find it hard to believe/understand.

She did tell me that she will attempt to cut out alcohol during our relationship. (Keep in mind she did that on her own, I never told her to do that.) She has done an amazing job so far (10 weeks) and I am very proud of her. I do check in with her and ask her how she feels not having alcohol for so long and she replies every time with ""terrible"".

After discussing some things with her, she asked me if I would be more comfortable with her drinking if she only did it with her childhood best friend (F) at her house in her hometown.

She is returning back to her home country in the second week of December and will be gone for XMAS and New Years. I will remain at home with my family with nothing to keep me distracted.

I have had a lot of trust issues in previous relationships. My most recent one ended up with me punching walls to not have to feel pain in my heart being caused by sadness. This constant worry that my current SO will get into a situation she cannot get out of, where she could get hurt, or where she engages in infidelity really worries me and has caused me to hurt myself again.

I am extremely happy with this girl. We hang out pretty often and we are always open with each other. I do see a pretty good future with this girl.

I do want her to be able to do the things she wants to do, but I also don't want to lose her to some freak accident.

She does know that I hurt myself when I am angry/worried/stressed and so do my parents.

My main question here is am I allowed to be worried about these things? I do not want to wake up at 9am on New Years Day to a video of her getting railed by some other European lad that she accidentally sent in a drunken haze at 2am while drunk.

My mind really wanders with possibilities. I like to call myself Doctor Strange because I can conjure up hundreds of different ways a situation can play out pretty quickly, but in this situation I would rather not have that ability.

Is there any questions I can ask her that may put me at ease? I have lost sleep over thinking about this and do not want to be passing out from tiredness during winter break.

Any comments/suggestions would be appreciated.

I do not want to break up with her. I do not hurt myself beyond punching walls and do not plan to either. If it gets to that point, I will end the relationship which I also do not want.",16Nov2020,1

885,"For context, I'm (33F) currently WFH, as are the other two people in this scenario. My coworker (35ish/F I'll call her ""M"": she is in a different team to me) called me earlier today with a request that usually would have gone to someone else assigned to her projects (S) but as they are on holiday, I'm covering their work. 

I think M's lovely but our work hasn't really crossed paths so we've never been chatty but when we have spoken it's always friendly.

I tried to resolve M's request but I was struggling to locate the information required so I called my line manager (40s/M ""P"") for assistance. P is a great line manager and a great guy but sometimes a little socially awkward. P turned our call into a video meeting so he could share his screen while he tried to find the information. When he couldn't, he decided to invite M in for more clarity and the conversation went like this:

P: Hi M, thanks for joining. I hear congratulations are in order
M:.......yes......who told you that? S?
P: No, actually it was *M's line manager*
M: Oh, that's my news, he should really let me share it with people
P: It's so exciting, when are you due
M: April
P: do you know what you're having
M: No
P: are you going to find out?
M: Yes

At this point, M cut him off and asked why he had called. She was clearly annoyed that her news was being shared before she had a chance to tell people which is understandable, but I felt so uncomfortable I didn't say anything at all. I was dead silent. I'm completely on her side that it's her news to share and if I hadn't been on the call I wouldn't have known.

It's now 5 hours later and it's all I've thought about; should I call her in the morning (I'm in the UK, it's currently 9.30pm and we work office hours) and say congratulations and apologise for not saying anything at the time because I appreciated the news shouldn't have been shared with me like that. Or do I not say anything at all and respect her view that she should share her news and pretend I don't know? For what it's worth, I don't think she minds me knowing, it's more the circumstances.

I am due to have a meeting with her in the morning anyway but I'm worried I've messed up. It's not unusual for me to be stunned into silence when I feel awkward or uncomfortable but I'm worried about how I've come across.

889,"Key word here is NEW friend. We met around 3 months ago. We are always together on campus (now with the Rona it's not that often), but we don't really text unless there's a couple task. We are gradually becoming closer, but are still not nearly close enough to discuss stuff like that. Also we're both extreme introverts. 

A few days ago we practiced drawing blood and I couldn't help but see scars on her arms (and I believe she's well aware that I saw). Horizontal scars placed directly below each other, so there's no mistaking here. I tactfully ignored it then, but I find it hard to stay indifferent. 

She \*seems\* fine (talks enthusiastically, laughs easily and sometimes straight up goofs around), but I know that doesn't necessarily mean anything. 

There's not much I can do, but I just want her to know that I'm there for her if she needs it  (I myself stopped antidepressant treatment like 3 weeks ago, so it's not an entirely alien subject, even though I've never cut myself). 

I'm afraid that it's too personal and it would be tactless of me making assumptions, putting my nose into her business, perhaps reviving painful memories etc...

After all I am currently the closest person she has on campus. I like her and just want her to be okay and not alone like I was. 

Should I message her saying something like 'sorry if it's too personal, I just want you to know that you can talk to me if you ever need to""? Should I wait for us to become closer? Ignore the whole thing??

I can avoid our old hangouts but a little worried about bumping into him randomly or even him showing up to my house.

I don’t want to see this happen. I don’t know who would “win” but that doesn’t matter, one swing is too many! 

What do I do if there’s an encounter? Beg my ex to leave it alone, step in between them, call the cops or let them figure it out? I have no doubt my new man would do his best to diffuse but my ex is a hot head and would probably do his best to provoke him or maybe even just start swinging.

I gave my new guy a heads up about it and he says he isn’t worried about it and that he won’t fight unless he needs to defend himself or his girl.

893,"[Cross-posted](https://old.reddit.com/r/Huntingtons/comments/jtunfs/my_dad_has_hd_42_repeats_hes_58_between_early/) in the /r/huntingtons Disease subreddit. 

I'm posting this request for advice to a larger channel because I'd like to draw from the experience of others who have had to handle family dynamics while also dealing with a parent suffering from some similarly awful diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and ALS that progress with age, are horribly debilitating, and incurable. 

If you're not familiar with Huntington's Disease (HD) it's probably because it's not as common as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and ALS.  a result of a single genetic mutation that causes cells to create an excess of the huntingtin protein. The excess proteins build up in the brain and lead to neural degeneration over 10 to 25 years or more.  Since it is a genetic mutation, it is passed on to offspring with a 50/50 chance. It is always terminal, and there is currently no cure, though a few medical trials.

....

So now that you have some background about HD. My parents are getting a divorce, it's not a surprise, their relationship has been rocky for a very long time, even before my Dad had a positive test (positive test was ~3 years ago). They probably should have been divorced more than 10 years ago.

Our family is in the USA, I don't live in the same state as my parents at this point, so I don't interact with my Dad on a daily basis. According to my Mom, his symptoms seem to be progressing, I'd say based on her reports, he is somewhere near the Middle-Stage. My understanding is that his behavioral and cognitive symptoms are progressing more than the motor symptoms.

If you're curious, my siblings and I haven't been tested. We haven't talked about it either. My Dad was surprised by his diagnosis(he has 42 CAG repeats), his symptoms didn't get serious enough for him to get a test until much later in age at least in comparison to his dad and brother. Prior to the test, he thought that the disease wasn't passed down to him. From my perspective, it would be safe to assume my Dad is not particularly prepared for this from a life planning perspective, the divorce throws all of whatever planning he did have, right out the window.  

Just looking for advice on old people divorces, HD symptom progression, caring for an HD parent when their partner isn't in the picture anymore, or anything you think might be helpful. Thanks",16Nov2020,2
894,"Pretty much what it says on the box:

I had been previously molested by older girls as a child, so I was already pretty messed up at 15 and this woman I barely knew (a neighbor of my father) took advantage and lied about her age she told me she was 21 but told my relatives she was 29) and about using contraceptives.

This has ruined me. I have been suicidal, depressed, PTSD for more than half my life and the older I get the more impossible it feels to get help or even explain any of this to people. My family never believed it was rape. My mother pushed for years to build a relationship and my father basically disowned me for years. This has effectively alienated me from family and I have never felt like anyone was on my side. People super don't care if little brown boys get hurt.

I did see her with another man and there has never been a test so there is still a question of paternity, but I'm pretty sure.

TL;DR Do I tell my possible son that his mother raped me as a boy and ruined my life? Would you want to know?",16Nov2020,6
895,"I’m seeing a therapist for a myriad of reasons, most of my problems stemming around my lack of assertiveness, overall fear of confrontation, and what my therapist describes as “big feelings” which is essentially emotional regulation issues. Anyway, something I’ve told her is that I get upset when someone (generally my bf) doesn’t do something that I would like them to do. Let’s just use the simple example of him posting me to his instagram.

- i want him to post a photo of me to his instagram
- he’s never posted one, but I’ve never told him that I want him to because I want HIM to want to do it without me asking him
-me expressing to him that I want him to do this would (in my view) make it not mean anything because he didn’t choose to do it on his own, &amp; me saying I wanted him to was the only reason he did it

My therapist actually said “well doesn’t you wanting them to do something &amp; them listening to you and responding accordingly mean something? Does it really matter WHY they did it, if they did it for the sincere reason of making you happy one way or another? If you got the result you wanted?”

Disclaimer, this is in regard to asking one time for something (e.g. i wish my bf would post a photo of me on insta). Not in regard to repeatedly having to ask someone to do something like dishes or taking out the trash. 

I thought this was very interesting, but I don’t know if I feel like I could ever feel that way about the situation. The instagram thing is just an example of me navigating this type of thing that happens a lot in my head.

Does anyone experience the same thing, or have an argument for either side? 

TL;DR - i don’t like expressing my wants sometimes because i feel it makes it less meaningful if the person doesn’t do it on their own. My therapist said that it’s just as meaningful if I ask because “does it really matter whether you asked them or not, if you get the result you want?” Disclaimer, this is in regard to asking one time for something (e.g. i wish my bf would post a photo of me on insta).

898,"Throwaway account, I know it seems stupid, I just don’t want to take the small chance of unintended people seeing this (really only one person, people it involves generally know, only looking for outside advice). For backstory, I’m a 18M in college with nearly zero relationship experience before, I have friends, but am the type to only have a few super good friends than a bunch of mediocre ones. The only thing close to a relationship was two years ago when a friend of mine and I went out twice but when I didn’t feel comfortable having sex with her yet she dropped me (call me crazy for a 16 year old guy not wanting sex). 

Anyways, this is my first semester in college. Met a really nice girl in the first or second week who lives on the same hall as me (in a dorm) and we share a couple classes. One of those is in person, and we met after she approached me getting food after class one day. This turned into us going out every day we had class and we got really close pretty quick. We would sometimes just meet up and talk for hours on end, just about anything, she’ll say she needs to go do work, but she likes spending time with me too much and doesn’t want to go back (this is probably the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me, I have some of the best friends in the world that would say this as well, but I’m not sure what it is about her, it felt so genuine and caring). One of few people I can actually talk and really enjoy a conversation with for so long. We’d go on long walks together and she gives a lot of signs of having feelings for me, only thing is, she has a boyfriend back home. 

When I say signs, I mean almost anything but tell me directly. She’s *very* touchy, and she even has mentioned it once or twice asking if it made me uncomfortable, which I replied to as no, as i actually liked it, it felt comforting. But this is just her personality, there are plenty of touchy people in the world, right? Then she starts choosing to see me alone over doing something with her already established friends (to note, I’ve always asked if she wanted to get any of her friends to tag along with us, which she also promptly denied every time). She would always compliment me and tell me how she thought I was attractive and such a good person to everyone all the time. She says her cheeks hurt after seeing me from smiling and laughing so much whenever we’re together. When her boyfriend found out about me and was at least hesitant, she defended me (to add, I told her it is completely alright, and offered to keep my distance, I don’t want to get in the way of her preexisting relationship!). You get the point, if I were to actually go down a list, which one of my friends has started to do, it would legitimately take an hour to write down all these little things she says or does that makes it seem like she must have some feelings towards me.

Now, I *never* wanted to develop feelings for her, I knew she had a boyfriend, and she was completely off limits to me, also, at the time I met her, I was still moving past a previous crush I’d had. It just happened. We clicked so well, and she’s one of the most genuinely kind and caring people I’ve ever met, I just feel so happy around her, looking forward to seeing her every time, and, it just happened. I haven’t said anything to her because I fear she might think I’m trying to get between or make her decide between me or her boyfriend, when in reality, that couldn’t be father from the truth. From at least what I hear, she seems to like her boyfriend, and I would never want to get in the way of that. So easy solution? Just never say anything, suck it up let it go away, I’ve done it before.

Here’s where things change. Met another girl, she *does* (for certain, she is very direct) have feelings for me (holy shit! another person actually having interest!). We talk, she’s super sweet, smart, and I really do enjoy getting to know her, but I feel wrong to talk to her because I don’t want to give her the impression that I’m leading her on, as it’s the same situation I feel like I’m in, and I would never want to do that to someone else, and definitely not this super nice girl! This is where I fuck up though. We kissed (me and the girl that’s into me). This was my first kiss, it just sorta happened, which is something I never thought I’d say. Don’t worry, we talked about it, very mature, neither of us regret it, she does have some personal issues and isn’t entirely sure what she wants from me.

My problem is: I *want* to like this girl, like seriously, I really want to be into her because I could finally have a relationship with someone, which is something I believe I need (I have a lot of personal emotional issues, no need to explain, just know I believe a real, healthy, relationship with someone could be very good for me), but I just don’t. I think she’s amazing, but I feel really strongly about girl #1, and I can’t start dating this girl if I knowingly have feelings for someone else (which girl #2 knows about girl #1, again, girl #1 knows nothing of any of this). 

So I’m just at a crossroads of what to do, I have super strong feelings for girl #1, she makes me feel different than anyone ever has, but she has a boyfriend, whether or not she really is into me and doesn’t want to admit it (based on signs above), seems irrelevant. Girl #2 is great, but I would be lying if I said I felt the same about her, but I care for both of them and don’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings, while staying friends with them all.

Thank you to any kind soul that has taken so much time to read this, I know it was incredibly long and a little all over the place. I’ve never been in a situation remotely close to this and don’t want to hurt anyone, and the biggest thanks to any advice anyone can give.

TL;DR (wouldn’t blame you for not reading): Have feelings for one girl that gives signs of feeling the same to me but has a bf, another girl actually for sure has feelings for me, but I don’t feel the same, trying to satisfy everyone.",16Nov2020,1

905,"My best friend named Kate(not her real name) is talking to her “toxic and manipulative” ex girlfriend Sally(also not a real name) again. Sally used to be one of my best friends, and I was unaware that they were dating and I was also unaware that there was toxicity and manipulation happening between them until after they broke up. Sally never did anything to hurt me or anyone else I know except for Kate. But, i did know that they had an “on and off” friendship, where they would fight, stop being friends, and then start talking again. They claimed to be best friends with each other I believe. Their breakup left Kate completely shattered and in a terrible headspace, while Sally walked off like it wasn’t a big deal, or so I’ve heard. Kate told me about what happened and gave credible, detailed examples, demonizing Sally. I only got my Kate’s side of the story and I didn’t bother getting Sally’s side of the story, because Sally had previously told lies &amp; i knew she wasn’t very mature, so I distrusted her. I’m starting to regret never talking to Sally about it, though. After the breakup, they stopped contact completely and Kate told me to stop being friends with Sally. Because Kate had my full trust at the time, I ended my friendship with Sally, addressing to her that I don’t want to be friends with anyone who would hurt Kate. She was peaceful and accepting about my decision. Now, almost 5 months later, after I’ve tried so hard to help Kate get through all of the rough emotions that came as a side effect of the breakup, she’s started talking to Sally again, and now they’re best friends again. They even have matching profile pictures on Instagram. I was unaware of this at first, until I found out by accident when I was logged in to Kates Instagram(we know each other’s Instagram passwords and occasionally log into each other’s accounts to mess around playfully) and I clicked into the direct messages because I was going to send a silly text to one of my other friends, and Sally was at the top of Kate’s dms, with the last message sent 10 minutes prior to when I opened the dm page. I didn’t read any of their dms because I respect Kate’s privacy, and I exited her account after that because she obviously had something going on that I was not aware of. I was hurt that Kate had told me to get rid of one of my closest friends because “she’s toxic,” only to have Kate become friends with her again. This made me confused about the seriousness of the situation, wether it was actually something that needs to be dealt with or if it was all a big fuss, because Kate had made the situation a really big deal, and I watched her change into a completely different person after that breakup. I talked to Kate about this, and she apologized that I had to find out that way, and insisted that the situation was serious to her and that she won’t continue to speak to Sally anymore. She’s still talking to Sally. I’m now beginning to believe that Sally isn’t the toxic one, but I don’t know if I can handle being friends with Sally again after what I watched Kate go through. What should I do? Should I ask Sally for her side of the story? I know it seems like it’s not entirely my situation to be caught up in, but I promise that I am very involved and invested.

907,"I don't remember when I started doing it. I think it was somewhere around 10 years ago. It was only when I started going to private school that it became less of an act and more of a false narrative that I got completely wrapped up in and started to believe myself. I wasn't consciously bullshitting people after a certain point, I was authentically living a lie.

Naturally, day after day, it wore me down, though on the surface level I no longer thought of myself as low class. The version of my family and my upbringing that I had manufactured became realer to me than the truth. When I thought of my parents, I thought of the versions I preferred. And after awhile, without thinking, I carried myself with the demeanor of someone who had pocket aces that didn't exist.

Though my whole identity had become this, the weight became difficult to maintain little by little. I confessed about 6 months ago, first to one of my best friends, then to everyone else. I wish I could say that this was the first day of the rest of my life, but the truth is that it hasn't been the same since, and I profoundly regret telling the truth.

Every day I wonder if I'll ever come back. I don't feel myself anymore. I've grown apart from my friends, not because they rejected me after they found out, but because I can't do my vibe without the assumptions I used to set up. I don't feel beautiful anymore. I don't feel high. I don't feel clean. I don't feel good. I used to be the coolest inheritance kid, and now I'm just deactivated. I chose to give up the pedigree I internalized, but the price I paid was far more than I ever bargained for. I'm no longer interested or interesting. I'm not happy. I'm not eternal. I'm nothing. I've been trying to create a new identity around my true background, but it's just not the same. I'm going through the motions. I needed the veneer, not for them, but for me. It became like a perfume. I just can't carry myself how I used to. Everything's begun to be pathetic and forced.

I've thought of dropping everyone I knew and starting another life as an imposter. Deep down I knew I was a fraud the whole time, but for the most part the stakes made it even more glamorous. I knew I could be exposed, but that only caused life to be sexier. Now, everyone knows that I'm just trash. And not only trash, but also an insecure poser. I feel like people own me now.

When I convinced myself I had wealth, I was above it all. I'm now distinctly aware of the fact that I'll always be trash, no matter how much money I make. I never wanted to have to worry about making money. That shit is lame. I never wanted to feel like an upwardly mobile wannabe, so I pretended I was already on top. Now, it's like I have the moral imperative to improve my position. But I don't want it. I want to continue focusing on what matters to me while being granted all the dignity one can get in this life. But now that I'm not perceived to have pedigree, it's like there's nothing I can ever do to replace that.

I want to feel high again, beautiful and high. I *need* to feel beautiful, and I can't unless I come from a respectable family. Should I try convince my old friends I was joking when I confessed? Should I run away? Should I cope? Should I choose to die? I have the temperament of an old Hollywood star. But right now, my makeup is running and my face is smeared in shit. I'm disgusted with myself. I can't accept myself. I can't fall in love with anything or anyone, let alone the world, because I despise my own image. I'm ashamed of my family and I know it's absurd but it never goes away. I'm bored of myself. How do I feel high again?",16Nov2020,1

I got one interview, and I thought it went really well but I got a basic rejection.

914,"Okay so here is the deal. I (30F) and my husband (29M) live in a neighbouring city to both of our parents. His parents want us to stay away because I work with the public and they are both high risk. I get it, they are looking out for themselves and doing what is necessary for their comfort level. The issue is with my family (per usual in our situation)

My mom and sister are both high risk, but my dad still invited the family (8 including SOs) and various 'close friends'. So that is a minimum of 4 households with 1 traveling via plane. My dilemma is I don't want to be around that many outside sources without the proper precautions, as my husband and I need to continue working and cannot afford to take time off if exposed (both employment quarantines based off of 1 primary bnb or 2 secondary symptoms) .

I said that I didn’t want to move in with them because it would only be for a semester and that I would have to think about it. Now after some thinking I kinda just want to have my own apartment to get away from her toxicity but I could never actually say that cause I can’t hold my own.

I was taking the trash out of the bathroom when I accidentally stepped in some dried up piss. I was disgusted and after cleaning my foot off I went straight to my mom to complain. She yelled at me and told me to just tell him myself. I'm really quiet, and that was the first time i ever screamed at someone in anger. He's still definitely not going to clean it up.

931,"6 years ago (2014) I became friends/classmates with this guy who eventually started to have feelings for me. When I noticed that he was trying to pursue me, I began to ignore him and stay away from him. It’s not because I didn’t like him. He was genuinely sweet and nice, not just to me but to everyone. I knew he wanted us to become more than friends. But, I wasn’t ready for anything serious, which is why I kept my distance from him. I was just really immature at that time and I didn’t know how to handle that kind of situation. I didn’t know how to straight up tell someone that I wasn’t ready for a relationship. 

A year after (2015), I moved to a different state. Before moving, he messaged me but I didn’t read his message. He also sent me a recording but I never listened to it. In fact, I deleted our whole chat. There’s no way I can retrieve that chat anymore. He also gave me a necklace. He definitely didn’t fail to let me know how I much I meant for him despite the things I did to him.

Since years has already passed, I don’t remember everything that I’ve done to him. But one thing’s for sure, I hurted him. I know that he thinks that I never cared about him. What he doesn’t know is that ever since I left, I never forgot about him. 

I’ve always felt sorry for what I did. I never forgot  about what I did to him. Last month, I got to catch up with my cousin who is friends with this guy. My cousin told me that the guy was asking how I was doing. I’m just not sure how long ago he asked about me though. Could be months ago, maybe a year ago. But since I’ve got so much more time now that I’m always at home, I’ve also got more time to think about him and remember the past which makes me feel really awful. For almost a month now, I would wake up crying because of how bad I feel.

The problem here is, he’s already got a girlfriend and it’s already been 5 years since we last saw each other!! I’m not sure if he’s already moved on. If I send him a message out of a blue, all the pain that I’ve caused him might just come back to him again which I don’t want him to feel/remember anymore. 

I just feel bad. I’m scared just thinking about never having the chance to say sorry to him. I know I deserve this. Maybe this is how he felt when I stopped talking to him and when I left him behind. I’m not hoping for anything more but I just want to talk to him and sincerely say sorry for what I’ve done to him, even if its just through a message.

938,"I'm (F18) a senior in highschool and my ex (M18) and I had been dating for almost 6 years. He broke up with me over a month ago and then an hour or two later told me he made a mistake. The next day after a football game he told me that he might have started to like someone else. We went on a break so he could be left alone with his thoughts but that didn't last very long and we were dating again. Fast forward to that Wednesday, he had sex with me with the intention of getting me pregnant. Afterwards he said that if he was going to ""heal"" that he needed time and space and that the only way to do that was to break up. I agreed to it because he worded it in a way that said, ""I'm doing this to better myself"". But that wasn't what he was doing. He just wanted freedom. (I know because later on in all of this, he told me that's what it was about).


Two days later before band practice he took me to his house to talk where we kissed. The next day was his birthday, he still invited me and I still went, which was really awkward. I left early because I couldn't stand being there and being around his family who were basically my second family. That next Monday before band practice he took me back to his house and had sex with me. That same day he confessed to this other person. The day after this he told me we couldn't do that stuff anymore because it was going to mess everything up. The person that he liked was one of my close friends (f15) and she told him she liked him back. I told her that if she liked him she could be with him but not to lie to me about it. She did. She lied straight to my face, saying that she didn't like him and wouldn't do that to me. To try to focus on something else I ended up talking to a senior (m17), with the intention of dating, from another school for about two weeks before my ex texts me one night asking to talk. 

The next day we end up talking and he says that he can't do this, that he's going to kill himself if it doesn't go back to the way it was and that he's not okay. He was telling me that he wanted me back but I was in a weird spot. The friend (f15) was someone I cared about a lot so I asked him what he was going to say to her and that this wasn't fair to her either. He didn't seem to care about how she felt in this situation at all. He told me about how, before we broke up, he was planning on proposing to me this year. Me and the boy from the other school stopped talking so that I could figure out what I was doing with my life and so that I didn't mess up his life any. 

I ended up unblocking my ex that day from all social media. I also talked to my friend about what he said, asking her what happened. I told her what he told me and she was pissed. Ever since we've been on better terms. Anyway, after that me and my ex (who still wasn't making an effort to date me again, shocker) talked about how we could fix this. I also realized I hadn't had my period for a month and had to take a pregnancy test. My ex seemed to not really care whether I was or not. A week or two later he starts acting fishy again. Three days ago I finally told him enough was enough, that I couldn't wait around anymore for him to stop being indecisive. I had to force his answer out of him. He said he didn't think we should try to save our relationship but he said he didn't mind me being in his life. I told him that I did mind and that I didn't want anything to do with him anymore. I told him to not come back into my life and to not regret what he was doing because I wasn't going to take him back again. I also ended up blocking him again except for his phone number. 

Oh and this entire time he still followed my friend (f15) around everywhere and he still does. Even when he said he wanted to try again and fix stuff he still walked her to class and all this other stuff. The entire time we were trying to fix stuff he started playing the victim too. I'm not going to lie and say I wasn't the perfect girlfriend, I was mean to him sometimes. But I never pretended to be and I apologized for what I did wrong and was working on my issue of being snappy before we broke up. 

Anyway, I feel relieved that I'm not in pain anymore over this boy but was I too rude about it at the end? Even if I'm in the wrong for being rude, I don't really regret it. I'm just happy that I finally stood up for myself in this situation. How should I be from here on out?

When I opened the washer, I noticed my pot had turned from a nice shiny clean metal to a dull, dark and tarnished looking eyesore.


Here's some reference photos: http://imgur.com/gallery/p29tVv5

Keep in mind, I have never used this pot before and this change occurred after only one wash. All reports I've heard is that oxidation can occur ""gradually over time"" and should be safe to use ""if its always been used for cooking.""

 But I've never used this pot before.. is this oxidation? Or what is it? All images of aluminum oxidation appear like a white film on the bottom part of the pan. It's like a dark purple/brown rainbow coating covering the entire pot. You can tell the difference by the handle -- that's what color the pot was prior to washing.

Our next door neighbor is a sweet older lady who I introduced myself to and talked to her for a bit when I moved in. 

She was good friends with the previous owners and is trying to make sure their mail gets to them since they’ve moved out of state. 

After we closed on the house I looked in our mailbox and noticed a post it note in it saying to not deliver mail because the house was vacant. I removed the post it note since the house had been purchased and I had forwarded our mail from our previous address. 
Every couple of days she puts a new post it note in my mailbox to not deliver mail and to forward it to the previous homeowners new address. 

I am not getting any of my mail delivered to my current or previous address, so I’m not sure where it is going. I nicely spoke to my neighbor and let her know that I’ve already forwarded my mail here and that the previous owners should’ve done the same.

She’s never been skinny and that’s totally okay that’s not what this is about, I just wish she would be HEALTHY. I don’t live at Home but she does and my family have always provided a super nutritious and balanced diet, my mum is an extremely good cook and has tried to speak to my sister on various occasions about her weight, even trying to approach it from a health based angle because; obesity, heart disease and diabetes runs in my father‘s side of the family and cancer, heart issues and strokes run in my mother’s. Many family members on my fathers side have died due to obesity leading to other health problems etc. We’ve tried to speak to her about how her diet affects her health especially if she’s already at a bad stage and so young, but it doesn’t seem to phase her. I don’t know what to do. I know she doesn’t want to be like this deep down but I hate to say it, she is super lazy in all areas of life. She’s such a beautiful girl and I don’t want her to develop some kind of eating disorder or take it the wrong way and I definitely am not saying she needs to be skinny, I just don’t know how to speak to her about making healthier choices and that her weight is becoming an issue for herself...",16Nov2020,1

I spent 25 years of my life severely depressed and lacking an identity, hobbies etc. I found out I have severe ADHD which may have caused a lot of it. I'm on medications and have been in therapy for years, but this problem remains: I don't know what I want. I dont have any concrete goals. 

I have some generic passions such as enjoying helping people. I wanted to be a therapist but after being a social worker for not much pay since I graduated, I just dont want to live like this anymore- so much stress and an impossible workload while I'm not going anywhere in life or doing more than paying my bills. I feel like I'm not living, I'm just existing. 

Ever since I graduated I'd tell myself I would go back to school ""next year"" but by the time it comes around I still have no idea what to go back to school for, and given how difficult it will be to pay my bills at the same time I have to really want it. But I feel like this is going to keep happening and I'll never progress. Nothing is getting clearer as time goes on. 

People tell me I'm intelligent, talented or compassionate and have so much potential, yet that makes me feel worse, not inspired. I do want to use my skills to make a difference but how can I when there's nothing I am sure I want? Everyone says ""follow your passion"" and they usually mean going into psych, but I want to be financially stable sooner than later. And there are other worries (the stress, burnout, etc).

Additionally if I want to be able to afford children some day...I feel I have to go back to school sooner than later. Else the timeline would not matter as much.

963,"TLDR:  Miserable 30 year old virgin, no friends, brand new really stressful  job, never gets human interaction because of WFH and aforementioned no  friends, only way I experienced joy was through alcohol, however, due to  health reasons I want to stop drinking for at least 14 days at a time,  so maybe twice a month. Whenever I stop drinking I get very depressed as  all I do is work with no joyous outlet, and I know it is also unhealthy  to just work and never experience joy, how do I maintain my well being  without alcohol given it is my only source of happiness?

\-------

I  am really lonely and stressed out. I work a full time job where I am  currently in the prospecting period for my employer. That means I am  taking multiple tests per week, learning new things every day,  constantly under scrutiny by new supervisors, and operate under high  pressure situations where I have to explain legal liability to many  different people while it's being recorded so I can't make any mistakes.

I  get 0 in person human contact because of covid since I have to WFH and I  will be WFH until at least the summer. I only have 1 friend I see very  occasionally and am essentially a 30 year old virgin. I had sex once  with a girl 7 years ago and the sex was shitty at that.

The  only thing I can do for human interaction is go to the gym, which I  like to do, but that also makes me feel bad as I see beautiful women  every where and it's a tease as I want to be romantically involved with  one yet am reminded of the stinging pain of how badly I want to  experience sex and how much it hurts to have not had sex for the past 16  or so years of my sexual maturity.

This  brings me to my overall point, I used to get drunk every weekend to  feel some sort of pleasure/joy in my life. I have stopped drinking for  the past 10 days and plan on continuing to abstain as it interferes too  much with my new job, plus for health benefits, (I want to lose weight  and improve my mental health).

Without  alcohol I have no source of joy/play in my life. I feel as if it's  unhealthy to constantly be working and have 0 time for joy. How do I  continue to maintain my sanity without developing crippling depression  now that I have lost my only 1 source of joy?",16Nov2020,1
964,"Hi Reddit,

When I was in high school years ago, I had a friend who I truly considered to be my best friend. Let's call her Amanda. While Amanda and I did have other friends, we really relied on each other throughout high school, and I have lots of fond memories of us being friends. However, sophomore year she and another one of my friends got into a fight, each accusing the other of a serious lie, and I chose to not take sides and remain friends with both of them. During the end of junior year, she started distancing herself from me and hanging out with her other friends more, until the point that we both just stopped reaching out. My mom ran into her mom at the grocery store a couple years back when I was still in college, and her mom seemed a little sad that we weren't friends anymore. I've thought about her several times over the years, and sometimes wonder if it was me not taking her side that got to her and eventually caused her to end the friendship, or if it was maybe something else I did to hurt her without even realizing it. However, there is a distinct possibility it could just be she found people she vibed with better, as our personalities were vastly different. I look back on our friendship fondly, and I would feel bad if she looks back on it negatively. 

I've thought about messaging her something along the lines of ""Hi Amanda! I hope you're doing well. I know we've grown distant, but I've thought about you from time to time these past years, and I just wanted to say that I hope you're doing well in \*insert city name\*. I know we stopped being friends sometime around senior year, and if there was anything I did to hurt you or cause that, I just wanted to let you know that I didn't mean any harm, and that I valued our friendship. I'm reaching out because I wouldn't have wanted our friendship to end in a negative way. I wish you well and hope the best for you in your future. Thanks for the good memories in high school.""  


Would it be weird to send a message like this? If not, any suggestions of how to phrase a message like this?",16Nov2020,1
965,"Hi everyone :) 23F ... I need therapy but it's really too expensive for my budget right now. 

I have come to the realization that the downfall of everything negative in my life comes from my lack of self control. I have lack of self control when it comes to binging alcohol - I black out too much even after having serious talks with myself about how I need to change my actions because the alcohol makes me depressed. I try to stop buying the disposable vapes and always end up buying them when I'm drinking. I tend to overeat, more than your average girl, and so even though I work out like a tank I never seem to lose weight. I don't have self control when it comes to an ex boyfriend who hurt me so badly - no matter what he does I always seem to forgive him to keep him in my life. I don't have self control when it comes to stalking on social media. I have serious conversations with myself about my flaws everyday and I'll get my s\*\*\* together during the week and feel great and then by the weekend I end up self destructing again - either by drinking too much and reaching out to the ex, or upsetting my friends, or even just waking up in the morning feeling hungover and depressed, and then over-eating. Does anyone have any advice? Typing this out I feel like I sound like a total degenerate, but I really am just a normal 23 year old trying to figure life out.

But if he were to get a job, the household could end up having too high an income to live in the government aid housing. They likely couldn't afford any other kind of housing, even with whatever income he had. And besides, he's a kid, he shouldn't have to work to afford a home to live in.

So there is a group of 8 of us that he has authority over and he treats everyone apart from me incredibly badly, like it straight up bullying there's no other word for it. He purposely tries to make the time more difficult, humiliates them and then when they go to anyone to talk about it he friend makes the person that they have told but leave that the person that told them was lying to them. However, I am treated much better than the rest except from one thing. I get away with a lot of things that the others don't and that I probably shouldn't, he makes exceptions for me, he talks to me distracts me from work,he talks to me about things that you shouldn't and tries to get information on other people out of me. But the worst thing is is he makes a lot of creepy jokes and comments that make me quite uncomfortable. However, because I get treated much better than everyone else in the way that he isn't picking on me at all I don't feel like I can say anything. I'm also too scared to say anything because he has an extremely bad temper like smashing glass and throwing trash cans temper and I don't want to be on the receiving end of that. I feel like he's also driving a wedge between me and my friends and my family and is now trying to separate me away from the things that I like. He has also started to try and drive a wedge between me and another person in authority over my education that I get along with and I'm close too.

He’s a total jock and a bit of a meat head, but he means well. Loves Trump, which, is fine...but he talks about it too much. He also pays NOTHING to live with us. I am going nuts because he makes more money than my sister and me, and he’s just here all the time! I need my space. I can’t talk to my sister about it because he’s always there.

976,"I need advice.

My best friend's older brother is just...well, I do not like him. He treats his GF like shit (verbal abuse, and even hit her once.) He emotionally manipulates his sister (my best friend) and depends on her too much.

We are all like family, the whole neighborhood knows one another and all of our families have grown up together. So, if there is even a birthday party, wedding, holiday, we are all there. Obviously this does not apply with COVID, but throughout our kid and young adult lives this has applied. All the girls from the neighborhood are in college, and my best friends older brother is mid twenties.

Over the years my best friend has confided in me about the brother. Everything from kicking his crying GF out during arguments, calling her fat and throwing away snacks, emotionally abusing both of them, yelling at my best friend, not paying my friend back from his gambling debts, getting drunk as a designated driver so his sister can't go home and is forced to stay with him. When someone calls him out, he will get angry and tell them to shut up.

Even as a teen, the brother would scream at parents, party and have sex constantly, give bruises to his sister, tickle her until she was begging and crying for him to stop. There have been allegations of r\*pe come up this past summer from multiple girls against him on twitter, back from high school. But no one talks about it.

No one really confronts him and just ignores his past and current behaviors. They are a hispanic household as well, and he (as the male son) was babied way too much growing up and faced little consequences (in my opinion.) My best friend knows what he does is wrong, but has long since given up and defends him as he is family.

This weekend I finally saw my best friend at her house. The brother asked the GF where the lighter was. She said she didn't know. He then said ""Well what, can you not go f\*cking look for it?"" Instantly her face fell and I knew this condescending and abusive behavior happened often.

He also argued with us about politics, as he is now a proud trump supporter.

I do not want to be around this man. But it is an expectation that when I host parties for the families or get married or do anything involving the girls, he is invited. What do I do? It would be extremely obvious if I left him out. And by doing this, I would risk my relationship with my best friend. Everyone just ignores his behavior and we all play nice and keep peace, but I just don't want to be around him.

I feel as though I could be biased, as my best friend has been confiding in me for years. Not everyone has heard all the stories, or seen his behavior first hand. So, I know people will think I am being dramatic and judgemental, as these are incidents throughout the years. But from my viewpoint, he's an asshole and abusive towards women.

I have never changed who I am or made it seem like I was someone I'm not. This means people see the real me, I am socially awkward and sometimes I can be too nice but I truly believe I'm an incredibly caring, loving, supportive person who will do anything for someone. I always put others before myself and that happens in friendships and relationships. Sadly, I have been taken advantage of and kicked to the curb for being that type of person. Whether it's relationships or friendships, people either take advantage of me being me or they don't even care about me at all. It's so frustrating and quite honestly pretty depressing. It hurts more with dating and relationships, I put my heart out there and care about them so much just to get hurt, every single time. I waste my time with people who don't care about me and honestly it basically feels like how everyone in the world thinks of me. I have one friend who I feel wants to be around me and has cared the most out of anyone else.

987,"Around a little over a year ago, I became really good friends with this guy. We started doing everything together and without realizing it, we were both really bad for each other.

Around the beginning of quarantine we began dating because we were already so close, but it, again, was bad for the both of us. To put it less harshly than he did in the breakup, despite contradicting everything he had said done beforehand (speaking of marriage, saying he loves me, etc.), we broke up mid-June. We wanted different things, I guess, but he basically told me he didn’t feel guilty for purposely lying because it made me happy.

I handle my problems, usually, by ignoring them — so that’s what I did with my breakup. I was immature and blew it off, acting like I wasn’t phased by it emotionally besides a ton of anger. He handled the breakup (and no longer speaking with me, while we had considered each other best friends) back then, but I’m just now getting around to really feeling it.

A few days ago, I reached out to him and I apologized for how I handled things. He apologized, too, because he hadn’t before, and I wished him well. When he did the same, I replied with something that implied I missed one of the things we always did together, which was have nights in watching older films.

But... in a moment of weakness less than an hour ago, I messaged him with “Is it too late” — I figured it would be implied of being friends again. And, I mean, I don’t regret it; I miss him a lot and lately I feel like he was the only person who really got me.

He didn’t even respond to the message from a few days ago, and I don’t know how he’ll respond to this, if he even does. I know he used to dislike me after the breakup, and I’m not sure how he feels now.

He was my best friend for about 4 years. During this time we talked all the time about any and everything and developed a strong bond. For a long time it was just friendship, and eventually feelings got involved, we had sex, he was my first. This didn't change our friendship (yet), and for about two years after he 'took my virgintiy' we remained just as close with the occasional sex and flirting. Long story short, he got upset and wanted to end our friendship because I began sleeping with someone else. Meanwhile, he'd slept with many many women before , and even told me all about it. But i'd never expressed my issues due to trying to be a good friend. Fast-forward, our friendship has gone downhill, and we've gone months without contact. It's strange because its as if we had this unspoken bond and this knowing - that we'd always have each other to go back to. He's now in a relationship, and it bothers me because i wanted to be first. I knew that our friendship would have to change/end eventually, but I wanted my transition to be easier. He's now practically in love with this new woman and I'm no longer that one thing in his life. I just hate that I'm the one that has to move on alone. We still have some sort of connection (as admitted by him) and it's possible that I suck it up and keep in contact but im not sure if I should try to set aside my feelings or end contact. As of right now, we've agreed to be 'friends' and keep contact once in a while. But how can I claim to be a friend of any sort , when I don't wish the relationship well.

I told my brother it was never my intention to lecture him, and that I was sorry if I was overbearing. I also told him that it was scary for me to see them fight and react this way, and that I nearly had a mental breakdown because of it. 
In all my honesty, I think they are really immature with their reactions. Im a teenager and they are engaged adults, leaving groupchats but still living together. Sending memes and then blocking me. This is how I behaved in 8th grade, and I am so concerned they act like this now. 
My brother also comes to me every week about some sort of fight they have, and I always have to sit there and listen. I feel like this is a toxic relationship, but then again, I’ve never been in a long term relationship too.",16Nov2020,1
994,"I (17F) live half the time at my mom's, half the time at my dad's. They divorced when I was in 4th grade and my younger brothers were in 2nd. My mom kept the house, my dad rented a house for a when but about 3 years ago he bought a house and we moved in there. At both houses, my brothers and I are responsible for our own breakfasts and lunches but my parents make dinners.

Now, my mom makes really good food. Lots of rice, fish, soups, etc, and she also makes homemade bread. She always has veggies to go with each meal, and she makes sure we have fruit at home.

My dad... Doesn't. I think he's kind of burnt out from the pandemic. He rarely makes veggies, he mostly makes potato and wheat based meals (neither of which are great on my digestive system).

Whether it's the food itself, or something else, I'm always nauseated at his house. It's worth nothing a few things: 1) I'm on a medication that makes me somewhat nauseated, but I'm not nauseated at my mom's. 2) he has a girlfriend who smokes weed (she stays that he house when my brothers and I aren't there) and he frequently uses an essential oil diffuser to counteract the weed smell because I told him it was making me nauseated. 3) I frequently open windows in my room/light candles to attempt to get the smell out.

So, I need advice on two things: how do I get the smell out of the house, or find something strong enough to counteract it? And two, what meal suggestions* could I give my dad?

*So you can get a sense of what we eat... A lot of Japanese food (yakisoba, rice, fish, udon, etc), fried rice, pasta with sauce, pancakes. As well as some stuff I don't like, like baked potatoes, biscuits with eggs, mashed potatoes, honestly anything with potatoes or dense wheat, if that makes any sense.

Thank you!",16Nov2020,2

996,"It has now been over a year since I left this guy. It was a toxic relationship that was physical based for him and I've never felt like a complete sex object to someone before like I did in this relationship. On  top of that, he was narcissistic, a complete gas lighter, and not receptive in the relationship. Ultimately, his craving of sex is what deterred my interest in the relationship as well as my interest in him. That's all he cared about. There were occasions where he would get upset that I wouldn't immediately ""jump his bones"", as he would say, every time we saw each other. There was an occasion where I was on my period and he was really adamant on having sex, but I'm almost never in the mood during this time of the month since I get extremely painful cramping, yet he kept trying to have me lay on top of him and would even verbally say ""I'm not trying to have sex"" and then forcefully reach down and yank the tampon out of me and then shove his dick in me. Mind you, the abrupt removal of the tampon left me with minor cuts inside. The was another occasion where I was over during the weekend and it was about midnight and I had fallen asleep. He woke me up wanting to have sex and then got violent when I didn't immediately want to since I was tired and he proceeded to knock everything off his side table and start kicking things around in pure anger telling me to get out of his house. I can't tell you how many times I gave in just to avoid conflict only to have sex I didn't enjoy. This is just a little taste of what this relationship was like.

Coming to present day, I'm now in a wonderful relationship with someone who I connect with emotionally and physically, who treats me right and shows me he loves me. I've never been happier with someone. Recently, as in a few weeks ago, I got an email from the ex (who I've blocked on every other outlet) saying ""There’s something that is extremely important that I need to discuss with you in the near future. If you could find time to talk just for a few min that would be great."" What could this possibly be referencing? Mind you, he has an ongoing case for his 2nd DUI where he violated probation by not showing up for work order or whatever, so he has a hearing coming up on Dec 29th. Also, he had a recent restraining order against him in July, so I could only assume it was due to his record, but I genuinely have no idea. I ended up responding with ""why are you reaching out to me of all people"" only to not get a response. Finally I caved about a week later and emailed him again basically getting the closure I wanted for him being a complete POS during our relationship. I didn't say much, other than its typical of him to reach out and never respond (He's the ""hey"" texter that never responds when you text back) along with stating to delete any contact information he had for me permanently and that I wanted nothing to do with him or anything he had going on and to respect the fact that I am in a new relationship and leave me alone.

Fast forward to last week. I hardly check my Facebook messages, but I logged onto FB from my computer and saw that I had a message request. It was from his current GF. She asked if I was the one who used to date him. Long story short, she's going through the same events I did with this guy and wanted out, but she was too far in. I informed her briefly of what I went through and told her I would have left the restraining order against him. (apparently she was the reason he had a RO against him in July, but she removed it because he ""convinced"" her that they would work things out) It was a short conversation between us and I said good luck to her. 

Now today, I was checking my emails and noticed I had one from the ex. He basically implied that I must be miserable because of my ""bitter"" email I sent him and that he saw the message exchange between me and his GF. He also made it a point that he still had possession of a notebook I let him borrow when we were dating and that they both went through it and found certain notes from my past that he tried to intimidate me with because he claims he ""never forced sex on me, and that Just because I still had sex with him occasionally and weren't really into it does not constitute rape"". I never used the word rape once both in emails or to his GF, but I did say forced, because it was. Now, I don't know if this is considered blackmail or what I can do about this. I literally want this guy to rot in hell. I have no idea why a year later he's reaching out to me and his gf is reaching out to me. Its all a series of ridiculous events. 

I would like to get others opinion on this situation and possibly provide some advice on how to handle all of this. I have considered responding by just repeating myself and telling him to not contact me and if he pursues further communication I'll file for harassment. I ultimately just want to ignore it, but I'm extremely pissed off that he thinks he can try and pull a fast one on me over this (what he thinks is) blackmail. Might I add that what he found in this notebook is something I've already served (a short amount of) time for, in which the case has now been dismissed. It comes before I even started dating him, so really, there's nothing I'm concerned about, but he did say "" Im sure you wouldn't be too happy to have all that info spread around to people you don't know just like your completely false allegation of forced sex."" So to me, that only implies a threat.

997,I met this guy from OfferUp so I drove to meet him and he seemed like he was ready to buy the item from me. He lived in a pretty ugly neighborhood so I gave him a ride to his apartments. As we arrived to his apartments I ask him “you got the cash?” and he just opens the passenger door just to take off with the PlayStation 5. I didn’t want to approach the guy because he had a backpack on and he could’ve had anything in there to harm me. This has never happened to me and I already filed a police report. Is there anything else I can do? Thanks.,16Nov2020,2
998,"So I graduated college in May, and have been doing food delivery full time while I applied for jobs. Recently I landed an internship at a company, but am only being paid around $10 an hour. I thought this would be a dream company to work for, but a week in and I kinda hate the company culture, basically I'm an introvert in an office of only extroverts. It felt completely different during the interview, or maybe I missed something. The company is Christian and gives conservative vibes, which isn't a bad thing but I'm agnostic/liberal so I feel like an outsider. I'm only in the office full time 4 days a week (36 hours a week). Long story short, I know it's great experience to have but I really miss doing food delivery full time where I was able to make $25 an hour every part of the day. I kinda hate going to an office, and it also gives me a bad feeling that the company isn't working remotely during this pandemic that's still happening and doesn't even consider it. The internship is 3-6 months, but they said it could be extended based on performance. How long should I stay before I consider quitting and moving on to something else? Maybe 3 months in February? Any help would be really appreciated, I really need it.",16Nov2020,0
