1,"I (22F) am 5 weeks pregnant with a guy (26M) who ive been on and off with for 2 years and after I told him I would not have an abortion he told me we can’t be together because he doesn’t love me (which is fine with me) but he will be involved with the child. Since this has happened he has been very rude and selfish. He has gone out of his way to tell me how he is meeting with a girl tomorrow night for “advice” and he’s saying very mean things or saying he almost said something mean and he can “make me cry” so I need to watch what I say... well anyways, He is in a custody battle with his ex over his daughter and I know for a fact that he has been lying when I’m there during the case (I’m at fault for this as well as I went along with it) and I also heard him in the bathroom on the phone talking about hiring a hit on a her new boyfriend for wanting to move to a new state if they were to be granted permission... not just saying he would but going into detail about how he would do it knowing his cousins knew people... He knows all about this custody stuff and I don’t, and I don’t like the way he’s been acting or what I’ve seen from him in his court case with the mom of his other child. I am wondering how I can use this to get the upper hand in court in the future? I want to find a way to contact his other child’s mom and tell her everything but I know that’s probably out of line and he would absolutely hate me for it- maybe it would cost him time with his son... but it makes me think if that was documented it would help me with my case... but I also have no proof of him saying what he did and he will deny it... I guess I could show proof of his lies with my own texts showing I was at his place but what would that do for me?

Also, this is a crazy thought but what if I lied about getting an abortion and just kept the baby without contacting him..... what would be the repercussions if he found out? 

I’m not sure what to do, but I want to make sure he doesn’t have the upper hand. He is not a good person and I want to know If any of you have advice on what I should do to get more out of court. Or any advice on how to go about things in general.

TL;DR pregnant with a man who I am no longer involved with however I am not sure if I should come forward with lies he told in his current court case to possibly help my case in the future or what to do about a weird threat I heard him make",13Sep2020,0
2,"My family is ...idk how to explain it. They are weird. My mom has some kind of mental disability or some shit cuz she’s always being everyone down, bossing everyone around and my dad does nothing but sit on his ass. And doesn’t do shit. Doesn’t tell him to do things. And my sister is upstairs all day with her boyfriend doin nothing, no chores. And I am the lazy one yes, I’ll admit but I started doing the dishes a lot more. I one tiem did the dishes for a full week and the next week after my mom bitched to me about how I do nothing. And I literally cleaned the entire house. That got me so upset and mad I can’t even explain. Like I’m invisible to her. I did the dishes today and she said nobody does anything when I literally cleaned my room,  the dishes. I tell her I cleaned and I have a list of things I did with the date but she shrugged it off, because she knows I’m right. She just wants to bitch. I’m always staring fights cuz my family wanna treat me like shit. Ans my mom wonders why I stay in my room all day cuz my  dad bitches how I’m in my room all the time. They can’t say anything better.  So I hold in so much anger and resentment to my family and it grows and grows. Now I ultimately hate my family. And nothing will change that. I dont care if my sister dies cuz she’s a fucking abuisve bitch. 

My sister was full speed running RSS in the house tot he kitchen and I opens the fridge. She almost ran into it but I didn’t know how close she was to me. She said “Watch it girl” i hate when she talks to me like that. I was so confused why she said that and she said I almost hit her and I said that’s why you shouldn’t be running in the house. And I dropped my ice cream. My mom wasn’t even on my side. She said I got karma and my sister teased me. I had enough with my family and my sisters verbal abuse I smacked her. Ik I shouldn’t have but I couldn’t take the abuse. That’s no excuse tho. And I yelled at my mom and sister and went to my room
I can’t take it with my family anymore. I stopped being happy fake work them and showed my true side and they started bashing me how I have anger problems. Everyone gotta make me the bad guy all the time. Idk what to do. Help me please I don’t wanna be suicidal again cuz I was last time this happened",13Sep2020,2
3,"A while ago my friend got a new debit card because his old one wouldn’t withdrawal money at the ATM or something like that. I asked him if i could have his old deactivated one for free trials and what not so i dont have to keep asking for my parents’s card. Today my dad told me doing this is “identity theft” and “fraud” and made me throw the card away.

4,So basically I am looking for a accessory to wear on the field. I play high school football and I was thinking like a arm sleeve or something with his name and number on it.

5,I recent just moved from California to Washington and unfortunately during my travels I lost my wallet. What are my next steps here in getting a replacement license? Do I just need to go to a WA dmv and have it replaced there? Will I need to take the written and driving exam since I don’t physically have a license on me? I looked into just trying to replace my CA one but it looks like I have to physically be at a dmv location there to do it? Any help would be appreciated!,13Sep2020,2
7,"this is more so towards people that believe in ACAB. (i, myself, being one of them) i am a white person.
my belief is that they all serve a corrupt system that needs reform, so as a group it is bastardized, but there is no denying are ""good"" cops out there. there just needs to be major changes.


but anyways, i went to the police station to report my abuser/r*pist the other day, to prevent him from doing those things to anyone else. i found out there were others as young as 13 and i just couldnt live with the guilt to keep quiet anymore as terrifying and traumatic it was to re-live everything through an oral &amp; written statement... &amp; a detective will deal with my case soon.
i feel guilty going to the cops since my beliefs against them, i had an advocate with me so i wasnt alone with one but it was inevitable in order to try to get justice for myself and others that have fallen victim to the person that hurt us.
is it contradictory? am i shitty person for going to police when it was necessary to persue a legal conviction? are there exceptions in certain situations? i just feel so conflicted and shitty especially because of my appreciation for the cop that was empathetic with me. as a white person that doesnt face racial discrimination from them obviously, i feel guilty more than words can describe - almost like a traitor. i dont know, i just need unbiased advice.  :/ 

thank you in advance",13Sep2020,1

14,"This isn't a matter of somebody is wrong (except me possibly).

I've been best friends with this girl for 7 years. Our parents even dated for a bit. I was her prom date, I talk to her family like my own, we are essentially sisters.
I am endlessly happy for my bff for meeting a man who treats her so well and is genuinely a great guy.

Well today I got message saying she posted photos of her bridesmaids and wanted to talk to me about why I'm not one. It's all distance and financial stuff. I completely understand. She even said she always imagined me there but it didn't work out.
I told her not to worry and I'm just so happy for her that I just want it to go well and support her.

I am happy for her. I'm also a little crushed. She was always front runner for maid of honour in my wedding and not being part of her wedding sucks. I'm not mad at her or any of the girls she did pick. I still value this relationship over bruised feelings.

I just need advice how to take this in stride and be a good best friend. I don't want to be sad.",13Sep2020,2
15,"My (20 F) boyfriend’s (19 M) mom (50 F) keeps trying to be my parent and always oversteps her boundaries.

Some background info:
My parents are divorced, up until college I mostly lived with my dad. My mom is from a different country and my old room was turned into my grandmother’s room once she moved to the states (which I had no problem with).

When the pandemic hit, I was sent back home from my dorm. My dad is immunocompromised &amp; also works at a hospital so he didn’t want me to stay at the house due to possibly getting me sick and I didn’t want to be home for possibly getting him sick. My boyfriend’s mom was living with her boyfriend for the past 3 or 4 years but kept her apartment in case they ever broke up &amp; so that my boyfriend would have a place to stay when he came home from school. She let us stay at the apartment during the pandemic.

Her and her boyfriend broke up about 2 months ago and she’s been back since. She told both of us that she wants us to pay half the rent, we agreed and looked for jobs once things opened back up. 

I got a job at a gentlemen’s club as a bartender &amp; I was supposed to go in for training last night. They just opened back up last week &amp; weren’t expecting it to be so busy. I went in and met with the managers and they told me to come back on a different day during the day so they could train me. I’ve waitressed for 5 years and most of the restaurants were BYOB so I’ve never really worked with alcohol. I said great, and left. Prior to me going, my boyfriends mom was excited for me, saying that I’ll be making good money and what not. She doesn’t know that it’s a gentlemen’s club. 

I came back and was immediately bombarded with questions. I just told her it was a club (like a dance club) and that I was going to train Monday instead. She told me to give her the exact address &amp; name of the club &amp; said she wanted to check it out because she’s ‘worried.’ I told her that my boyfriend has my location &amp; that there was no reason to be worried. The parking lot is right in front of the bouncers and they keep an eye out to make sure all the staff leave safely. It’s not that big of a place and only 25% capacity are allowed in. 

My dad is the person who worries about me an INCREDIBLE amount and even he wouldn’t make me give him all this information —he would when I was younger but because I’m an adult, he trusts me to make my own decisions &amp; just asks me to tell him when i get there, when I’m leaving and when I’ve made it home safely. That’s it. 

My boyfriend’s mom constantly oversteps her boundaries, not only with me, but with most people she interacts with and gets into other people’s business where she doesn’t belong. I feel like being that I’m an adult, I don’t need to disclose any information about my job if I don’t want to, especially if she wants me to pay rent. 

I could either 
A) Continue dodging her questions until she drops it &amp; this might create unhealthy tension or
B) Tell her that I work at this gentlemen’s club but if I do then I feel like this will validate her continuing to hover over me and not respect my boundaries (and she does this to behind with)
Or 
C) ????",13Sep2020,1
17,"So I just got into an accident where I avoided a car coming to pretty much a sudden halt trying to cut in between a group of cars (like a party drive by group). I ended up hitting some bushes (avoiding a light pole) and hit/swiped some bark off a tree. The driver in front of me didn’t stop. I had 3  witnesses stop to give their input on the police report. 

My dads upset bc he just wanted me to drive it home with no report, since he claims now, our insurance (Farmers) isn’t gonna help, his rate would go up, and now the city is probably going to want money for the tree. I have the police report number, but he doesn’t want to call the insurance company. Is he right? I’m just a little lost rn, any help is appreciated.",13Sep2020,1
19,"2020 has taken so much from me. More than I can bare. I know that this is a sentiment a lot of people can relate to but I think I'm on the verge of losing myself and idk how to deal with it. My friend took himself from us and I havent been able to cope. Losing him has been one of the hardest things I've had to go through and there's no one I can talk to about it. I guess I just haven't accepted the fact. He was one of the most beautiful souls I had ever met. Full of life and love. Always with a smile on his face. And yet something in him decided that there was a void he couldn't fill and decided to take the pain away for good. Idk I guess I just don't.. idk. It makes me wonder. 

I've been rejecting the idea that I may be depressed and that I have been for some time now. But I just can't accept that. Despite everything I have a good job thats provided me with more than enough, 2 beautiful children that love me to death. I should be fine. I mean, there's people that have it worse than me right? That have it way worse and don't have these reoccurring thoughts in their minds? I have never been open to the idea that I may have a problem. I know depression is a real thing but I just didn't think it could be something real for me. But with whats happened.. its made me think. Would the world be better off without me? Am I hurting for no reason? Is it that easy that he did it too? I consciously know that I have to be strong for my kids but there are days where it just isn't enough. With these fluctuating emotions I neglect them and makes me feel like a terrible parent.

 There's so much pain that I carry in my heart and I'm afraid that its become too much. And I dont want to tell anyone how I feel because I feel that it wouldn't be fair to dump all my demons onto someone that could be going through their own issues to be having to deal with mine. Or I'm afraid that I'll talk to someone and that they won't care and make me feel more insignificant. Idk I guess I'm not really looking for advice. I just needed an outlet.",13Sep2020,1
20,"Hello, I am a high school student who is looking to meet new people, but I'm not quite sure where to begin. I find it easy to make new friends online, but when it comes to making friends within my school (or even area), I struggle a bit more. I always get the advice of ""join a club/sport!"" but I'm not much of a sport person and my school isn't doing clubs this year. I've looked into clubs outside the school, and most are closed (of course). I do try talking to people in class, but it doesn't really go anywhere.

21,"I am a 17yo female who lives with my parents and siblings. I want to know if I am the wrong for wanting to cut my parents of from my life once I move out. I know other people who have had way worse things done to them by there parents and still stayed in contact with them so I just want others opinions.

My family is extremely sexist, racist (were black btw) homophobic, and transphobic. I am bi and have had to deal with there biphobia for years. I had been in private schooling for years and after I left my private school, there fear of public school made them keep me at home to be homeschooled. For years I was alone and isolated. I suffered alone without a single friend. Evey day was like hell. Studies show the negative affects loneliness can have on a humans life. Regardless they never saw anything wrong with that. Never even apologized.  Then they put me in a public school which was amazing. I loved my school and the friends I made there. Then my dad decided to move us into a place with a totally different environment and when I cried about it completely ignored my feelings. Which is something they do on the regular. I won't deny that I am a very emotional girl. They don't trust me, barely give me any privacy. I am split on how to feel about that, I have done things in the past. For example when I was homeschooled I would have adult conversation with adults. But I feel I have grown from them and should be given more privacy. Even before then they would use little things to take my phone and go through it. The worst part is even if I didn't have anything wrong on it, my mom would ""find"" things and keep it. Overall just things like this are the reason why I have issues with them.

More context: age 14. When I was young I was molested. I had supressed the memory for years, but one day I had a dream about the person who did it and decided to research about what happened to me. My mom saw me reading something and took my phone to check. She called me into her room later to tell at me and accuse me of wanting to molest my younger siblings. I didn't say or do anything except cry then she sent me to my room. Out of frustration I wrote out what happened and why I was looking at that. She then awkwardly told and told me there's nothing we can do about it now, gave my phone back and sent me to bed in tears. 

More context: Age 11. My cat had died, and I only had his two kittens to remember him after his cereal girlfriend brought them to our door. I kept them in my room and I was working on getting them comfortable with people. I love animals and want to work with them in the future so I saw this as a great opportunity. Also it made me feel better after I had just lost my best friend. Then one day I let one of them walk around the house, my dad went to pet him and he hissed and scratched at him.y dad then threw him out of the house. When I started crying he came and yelled at me.

22,"Back in November I met a guy on grindr. He was 18 and I was 21 (now we’re 19 and 22) and we went to the same college. We hooked up, started hanging out without sex, he ended up moving in at the beginning of 2nd semester in January and we became roommates and friends with benefits. But since college ended in March due to COVID, we stopped mainly because the only time we hangout is in my car. But he went to my lake house with me in June and he asked to do it again and I said yes. And that was the last time we did anything as well as the last opportunity we had to do anything.

But for the past couple months now, we’ve been talking every night for 2-5 hours and hanging out in my car once a week. We live 50 miles away from eachother and due to the age difference he’s hesitant for me to meet his family so we really just drive around and talk for an hour or two. But when we talk he’s just been way nicer and wanting to stay on talking for hours. Mostly we both talk using our PS4s and watch movies and such. Due to our history of beings friends with benefits, it’s complicated. Plus add in the fact that we are 2 closeted bi guys more so on the straight side of the bi spectrum.

24,"I am 25F, who is a senior financial analyst. I’m good at what I do and get great reviews from my manager. I’ve recently started to work with a new internal business partner (BP) who is an older male and also a VP. 

There are a few times a week where he will ignore my presence on a call, purposely leave me off of meetings I should be attending, and when mentioning something on a call that I was involved in will give credit to everyone except me. 

It was getting under my skin, but I remained strong and didn’t let it get to me until today. I sent a very thoughtful email on Thursday about a particularly unique situation. He decided to pick and choose parts of it and reply with something I honestly never even said. Then blatantly ignored many parts of it. My manager replied and said the same thing I said and the BP magically understood. 

Does anyone have any tips on how to grow a backbone and stick up for myself?

I’m currently 18 and throughout my teen life I had many, many rough patches... my mom is extremely emotionally abusive, but I don’t have any friends or family so I’ve only been VERY dependent on her..
I tried to break myself out of it, by trying to find a lover, get a job, make friends, but it’s always her who’s blocking my way to prevent me from doing so (like she’ll literally scream in my face if I go against her)

so basically abt a year ago i started hanging out with this dude (please keep in mind i have no interest in being more than friends) during breaks in band rehearsals. we became quite close, and i felt almost immediately i could trust him n stuff. there was never a dull moment, we were always laughing or up to some kind of idiocy. i have a lot of great memories. 

fast forward to the whole covid thing, we start texting during the summer. probably once every couple weeks we would chat abt whatever for a few hours, just goofball stuff. 

the week leading up to school we txt almost everyday. i was feeling anxious over school, and he had previous experience with very similar situations, so i felt he was a good person i could go to. i opened up quite a lot, and again we talked for ages. 

now we are in school, in person, and he seems.. off. we’ve talked a little bit in the last two weeks, but there seems to be a disconnect. he barely makes eye contact, and it’s not like he’s ignoring me, but he’s not going out of his way to talk to me either. i can sorta tell he wants to talk and stuff, but irdk. he mostly just seems nervous to make eye contact. can someone pls lmk if he just doesn’t want to be friends, or if he’s nervous, or embarrassed of me? did i screw up by telling him so deeply of my distress, and now he doesn’t wanna talk bc i’m “too emotional”? i miss all of the laughter and happiness, and want to make more silly memories. does anyone have any advice..? i’m getting very worried that if i don’t do anything we’ll drift apart. can someone who is willing to respond back and forth be willing to help me?",13Sep2020,16

36,"So a few weeks ago I tried to sell my car on Craigslist and some guy messaged me saying he’s out of town but he will buy the car and send some guys to pick it up. My dad who used to be a dealer thought it sounded pretty normal so we went with it. 

He sent over a check with some extra money to pay the guys when they come. I put the check in, but unbeknownst to me and my dad, the bank doesn’t truly show if a check bounced until after a week. It went from pending to added to my dads account so it looked good. Then the guy gave me the venmo account to send the money to, and I sent it. 

I couldn’t see my dads account at this point because my dad had been rushed to the hospital for an emergency surgery. But since a few days ago it looked like it cleared, I was ok with sending the money. After a week or so my dads home and we check the account to see the check bounced and I lost my money. 

I reported it to the police and did what I could (never heard back from them). Lately I’ve been getting a letter once a week that shows I’m the sender. The recipients name is some random BS name. It has a check in it written to the recipients name for a car decal thing (getting paid to put ad stickers on your car).

39,"On Wednesday I asked my crush out in person. It was my first time asking someone out. She said “yeah I’ll text you to reschedule” but it’s been over 3 days and there has been in response. She let me down easy and I’ve been feeling like a mess ever since. I haven’t been able to sleep, eat, or exercise. All I keep thinking about is how I’m not good enough, that everything is my fault, and everyone is better than me. I feel like I’m behind everyone else. And I know comparing yourself to others is wrong but how can’t I when I see these people everyday. This rejection opened up a Pandora’s box of my past and insecurities. Did she not like me because I’m too short (I’m only 5’5 and she’s taller than me by an inch. You know how weird girls are with height, they put so much emphasis on something so dumb just to feel small and feminine)? Because I’m a small person? Because I’m weak or weird? Maybe it’s because I honestly don’t know what I’m doing? I can’t get the thought out of my head that I’m not good enough and that no will will love me. That others around me are so much better than I am. I want to love myself but I just can’t and I don’t know how to deal with all these emotions I’m feeling",13Sep2020,2
41,"So I have a friend I have been friends with for 20 years. And lately they have just been in a ""fight"" mode so to speak. They always find something to argue or complain about. They are always accusing people of reporting their social media posts that get taken down, and they always tell people to start harassing the ones they think did it.

They are also the type of person who when others want to do something there is always an excuse or they say they have plans, then turn around and whine about being bored at home or they try to start a fight.

For example this friday today got pissed when myself and 3 others went down to some public tennis courts and played tennis. They told us before hand they couldn't go because they were busy. We get there and about an hour into it, they come speeding up cursing and yell at us how we "" never invite them"" and how we are bad friends.

I'm in my 30s, I don't need this type of high school drama in my life, I'm tired of it. How should I approach this, should I cut them off completely or how would I approach a discussion? Before someone asks how old the person is, they just turned 29.",13Sep2020,2
42,"Right. So. 

Basically, a fanfiction I started writing like four years ago got really popular. It's the top ten most reviewed fic in the fandom, which is in the top three most popular fandoms on the site. The reviews/follows/favourites are in the thousands, the views in the millions. I'm saying this to give some kind of scope on the situation, not to be boastful, because quite frankly, I'm starting to hate the entire fic and site and fandom. I wish it had never got this big. Because it's attracted some VERY unwanted attention.

I have a troll. I say troll, but it's more like hacker/harasser/stalker. They have not left me alone for a single day in nearly three months. Doesn't sound like a long time, but this has f**ked up my mental health so much that I just feel sick at the sight of an email notif or follow request.

Basically, there's a lot to unpack, but right now, they have my full name, my age, my town, one of my emails (unconfirmed to them), my snapchat and my insta. They had my phone number, but I had it changed the day after, which was a pain, but I'd do it a thousand times over than be on the verge of tears at all times. This makes me sound like a baby but this shit was so scary. I've put two factor authentication on everything and my new phone number has only gone to people I trust entirely. It's a long story on how she acquired all of this information, but I want to make it clear that this was not free to the public- she stalked and hacked and impersonated to get this information. This harasser has threatened to kill me, rape me, hurt me, hack me and release my information to the public. I'm posting because they've just done the last one.

So on my story, before I deleted it, there were close to maybe fifty reviews (and she wasn't slowing down) detailing all the information she had on me. I say 'she' because the hacker has presented a female persona thus far. Whenever I block one of her accounts on anything, she returns not seconds later with another one. Reviews made from a legit account can't be deleted by the author, which is a f**king horrible oversight on fanfiction's behalf, just fyi. So in the end, I just deleted it. I can recover it at any time for two weeks, then it gets deleted permanently.

So the advice I'm asking is this: what the hell do I do now? I'm not even blocking her on insta anymore, just not responding at all, but I can still see the messages, and she's claimed that as soon as I put it back up, she'll spam it some more. If this was a small story, I'd delete it and be fine. But this is four years of work. This is nearly 300 thousand words. This is/was something I was proud of and worked hard on it. People say that it's their favourite fic, and I've had people delete things I liked before, and that sucks. I really don't wanna be a dick to these people, and I sure as hell don't deserve to have all my hard work flushed down the drain because some f**king loser out there doesn't have any friends. My current plan is to recover it after 13 days, then delete it again. And keep this up til the troll disappears. 

I have lost sleep over fear of being hacked and having them empty my bank account or get me kicked out of uni or make me lose my job. Every time my phone goes off, my heart starts to have palpitations. I don't trust anyone anymore. I feel like s**t at all times. I have cried enough tears to feel like that Ariana Grande song. 

I'm a f**king teenager and I'm starting uni this week; my stress is at an all time high. My dad's the one who helped me sort out my number after I ended up just bursting into tears in front of him, and I'm so grateful for his help, I'm literally almost crying writing this I love him so much.

Please, I'll listen to any advice at this point.",13Sep2020,1

48,"Let's call him B.

B and i have known each other for years. Used to consider him my best friend, but now I'm starting to reconsider.

He has a sufferer mentality. He always likes to claim I'm ""spoilt/comfortable/rich"" because he's seen the few material stuff I have, all while ignoring the stuff he has. He always thinks he has it worse than anyone, and it's quite draining.

Just today we were talking about possibly schooling abroad, then the topic of what we would cook came up. I jokingly said the only thing I might be able to cook is rice. He then said ""I doubt that, you're spoilt, you probably don't even know how to make instant noodles, I bet you don't even wash your own clothes."" That's not what he said word for word, but it's the closest thing I could translate to. 

Then the convo moved to our parents, and he was convinced my dad was ""chill"" because he's never seen him yell at me. But when I used reverse psychology on him and told him his dad seemed chill to me too because I had never seen him yell at him, he immediately denied and started ranting about how his dad is so ""mean"", and in my mind I was thinking ""Have you ever considered that maybe you might be the problem?"".

Then when I told him my dad was occasionally mean to me too, and that he's the only issue I have in my life, he then suggested that I might be the issue, because my dad is so ""chill"". The fact that he couldn't sense the hypocrisy in what he just said baffled me.  

I kept telling him ""That's your perspective, just like my perspective is that your dad is a cool guy"". But he was adamant about his point, even ignoring what I was saying, and just kept saying ""Your dad is chill man"".

He's always done this since high school. He even went as far as asking a common friend of ours if I seemed spoilt, just because my hands are soft. Someone stuck up for me, saying ""Just because his hands are soft doesn't mean shit."" That was the first day I started noticing that he was constantly trying to shame me for being comfortable, but doing it in a joking way.

I'm sorry if this seems incoherent, but I did my best to articulate what's been bothering me. I'd really appreciate any advice on how to handle him, as it's getting really draining and I'm afraid I'll snap at him eventually. I'm also worried that he might have some real mental issue, which is causing him to act like this.

Now I'm in my bed, thinking of all the things I could have said to shut him down, but couldn't because I was shocked at the way he was behaving. Now I can't bring it up tomorrow because it will seem like I'm butthurt, so I have to wait until the next time he does something like this.",13Sep2020,5
49,"I’ll try and keep it brief! About 2 weeks ago I launched an Instagram page where I’m selling charcuterie boxes locally. Immediately I got a follow from a girl in town who’s doing them as well. This was the first I heard or saw of her but she posted me on her story and “welcomed me” in the cheese world to her followers. She wished me luck and so on. Seemed like a very kind gesture and I believed it was genuine. Fast forward to now. It seems that every time I post something she posts immediately after with a dig about my branding,business, or boxes. At first I thought I was being crazy but now it’s clear it’s not just coincidental. I hate confrontation but this isn’t the kind of negativity I need right now just starting off. She’s the first to watch all my stories and capitalizes on her differences from “others” aka me in her posts. AITA to block her? I hid my story but it doesn’t seem to be enough. I dropped a giveaway then she dropped a giveaway, I dropped a larger board then she dropped a larger board. Maybe this is just business and I’m too kindhearted for this mess but I just don’t want to make enemies so early on. Although I don’t want to be target and preyed on either.",13Sep2020,1
50,"I've been considering it for a while. I live in a country where it's not that expensive, but I'm still quite young, and I'm afraid I might change my mind some day. I don't think it will happen but how could I know? I'm not the kind of person to sleep around so there is no hurry but that might save my life one day. Did anyone went through this procedure? What are your experiences? 

Another question I have is... If I go through with this procedure, when I'll find a partner, should I express it? When? I'm ashamed I even thought about it but if I don't tell it there's a slim chance that it would help me spot a cheater if I ever enter in a relationship with one. That said, I would feel terrible keeping a secret from someone I'm in love with. The price would be high, as I don't want to start my relationships with defiance and distrust, but at the same time it seems cautious. Probably too cautious because someone careless enough to cheat on their partner AND having unprotected sex would probably be careless enough to get caught by other means but I can't help thinking about it. I want a perfect love, and a healthy relationship, of course, but lurking thoughts whisper in my head that everyone want that and that it's precisely because of that that most people never realise their partners betrayed them. On a more general note, in future relationships, would you advise choosing self-protection or complete trust? Even with all those doubts I'm having I think I would probably choose the latest. Firstly, you can recover from being cheated on, even if it hurts a lot. Secondly, I still dream of having the opportunity to live an ideal relationship and I feel like keeping secrets would prevent me from getting that. 

Anyways, I'm really curious about what you people have to say about all that. I'm still fairly inexperienced and I feel like having multiple opinions on the matter would help me see things a bit more clearly. Thanks in advance.",13Sep2020,27
53,"Sorry for the rant and rambling I mainly need to just say somewhere and get this out. 

I’m  23 F. My dad got told he has high blood pressure by the doctors probably around 10 years ago. He’s obsessed with conspiracy theories and believes doctors are only there to make more money for hospitals (we live in UK for reference not USA which makes me confused) he’s been on tablets since he was told, but recently told me he’s stopped taking his high blood pressure medication and is taking herbal stuff he’s found from online research. 

I have no idea how long he’s been doing this but he’s made me promise I won’t tell anyone else in my family.

My mother who is still married to him and live together seems to have accepted he is obsessed with hating the government and conspiracies and they barely even interact despite living in the same house, I live with them both and she constantly complains to me about how crazy he is with all his conspiracies and how she’s embarrassed of the things he says in public. 

I feel really sorry for him  as his two best friends have passed away and he only has one friend who he sees probably once a month or less for an hour or two and the rest of his life is being in the house and doing house work as my mother has a job or babysitting his grandchildren (my niece and nephew) sorry for rambling I just want to explain the basics of how he is. 

I asked him “what if you die and I didn’t tell anyone about this?” And he got angry and asked “I’m not stupid I know what I’m doing do you think I’m stupid?” 

I’m torn because I’ve been brought up on this sort of stuff with him and Its a topic I’m interested in and believe that medication can be damaging and a lot of the time (not always) there’s natural alternatives. But my issue is he doesn’t even change his bad diet of high fat foods and alcohol to support this natural way of helping his blood pressure -  and the main reason I think he doesn’t want to take his medication is because of an argument over wearing masks in the doctors. Masks to him = mind control and turning us into sheep. 

If I tell anyone in my family they will go crazy and no one would be able to change his mind when his mind is set on something none of us can change it he’d honestly sooner move out or let my mother walk out on him before doing something he doesn’t want to in terms of the government “controlling us”

If I don’t tell anyone It’s like what the f*** happens if anything bad happens to him and I kept my mouth shut? 

Idk what to do I really can’t be f****** bothered for this as I’m dealing with other stuff atm too.

74,"So I (18M) haven’t seen my friend (18M) for a while as a couple of months ago, he was arrested for possession of 12g of MDMA (ecstasy) with intent to supply. I don’t know the exact legal term but he got off with a caution and had to go in front of a judge. He is thankfully still going to university but it’s permanently on his record now. 

The other day, I arrange to meet with him and another friend in our gc and my friend accidentally sends a snap to us. In the snap he says “yeah I’m going to get a bit next week I can bring you some.” Sure enough, it’s about drugs. Specifically, MDMA. The exact thing that very nearly fucked up his entire future. I was pissed at him for buying more but he just brushed it off. 

Last night, I meet with them both. We meet at a local supermarket and me and the friend in question go inside to buy beer, whiskey and Pringles. As soon as I start talking to the friend, I know something is up. Turns out, he’s on coke. As we are walking around the store, he’s very erratic and excited but also very aggressive. He keeps saying he’s going to snap my legs and break my jaw but then laughing maniacally and breathing heavily. He’s joking but with all the energy, he seems very angry. We get to the checkout and rather than the self scan one, he practically races over to one with a cashier. He dumps all the stuff on the belt and hops to the end. The woman behind the till asks for ID and he starts quickly rambling about how I’m “fucking ancient” as I’m 19 next week and he only turned 18 around three weeks ago. From the way that he was talking and acting, he may as well have looked at her and said “I just did two lines of cocaine in the car park”. She could definitely tell. 

A couple hours later, we are back at mine and sitting in my summer house in my garden, away from my house and very anti-drug family. Halfway through me and my other friend joking around, he rails a huge line of coke off the table. At my 18th birthday party last year, I took him up to my room to get a charger and he started doing MDMA from his keys and spilling some on my bed. Three years before that, when he was 14, I was having another house party and he was laid on the floor stoned with laced weed. Now, I have smoked weed a fair few times and enjoyed the occasional edible. But, that is on a purely recreational basis and not just to get me through the day. 

My friend has had a bit of a tough life in terms of his home life and own mental health issues. He’s done a lot of drugs since the age of 14. Weed, various pills, acid and he even got the nickname Captain Ketamine at school. I’ve told him a few times not to do any drugs at my house but obviously he won’t listen to that. After he did the coke at my house last night, he spent the next 30 mins angrily pleading for a cigarette from me and his other friends on the phone, punching my sofa and eventually leaving me to go meet his other shitbag friends (one of whom used to date and abuse one of my friends). 

I had spent all night talking to him about he’s an idiot for getting involved with more drugs when he only just managed to avoid serious punishment. He insists he won’t touch heroin but a year ago he insisted he wouldn’t touch cocaine. He’s genuinely a good guy but his other friends are pieces of shit and he’s reliant on drugs but won’t admit it. Now we are moving to different universities that are very far away from each other and I will no longer be able to take him for drives when he’s on withdrawal or a comedown or even be there for him. I’m genuinely worried about him but he won’t listen at all. 

TL,DR: my friend has a drug problem that has got progressively worse and now I won’t be able to help him.",13Sep2020,1
75,"As the title implies, my dad is really annoying and weird. He constantly walks around the house shirtless, and he wears nothing but a pair of checkered boxer shorts. They cover the knee and are very lose, and they have long straps dangling out of them. He drinks water out of a jar that used to be a pickle jar, and he drinks milk, soda, juice, etc. right out of the carton. He goes to the bathroom about 50 times a day, and he spends nearly 2 hours every time he showers. He eats a lot of cookies and pastries and chips each day, and he sticks his hands down his pants all the time.

Every time my dad goes in the bathroom, he makes a lot of loud farting sounds, and he forgets to flush and then makes a mess in there. He fills the toilet too full and uses like half a roll of toilet paper. Someone else always has to go in there and plumb the toilet and put air fresheners in the bathroom. This happens around 50 times a day, and it's so annoying when he makes a mess in there.

When he eats, my dad has terrible table manners. He comes to the table wearing just a pair of gross boxer shorts, and he slouches all the time. He eats with his bare hands, he puts his feet up on the table, and he dips his hands into the bowls where everyone gets their food. He farts really squeaky and loud farts when he eats, and he spills food on the floor, on his body, on his clothes, and on the table. He drinks a lot of wine at every meal, and this really ticks off my mom. She has asked him to drink less, but he just ignores what she says. Every single time when he reaches for something, he knocks over his wine glass and it spills on the table and on the floor, and sometimes in other people's foods as well. He just continues eating and taps the wine glass loudly on the table, asking for more wine. Someone always has to take a cloth and wipe up the spilled wine, while my dad doesn't give a crap about what happened.

He also does really obnoxious things. For example, we would be playing a board game or watching a movie or something, and then my dad just spreads his legs open and releases a loud, stinky fart. Or we would be walking in the mall and he suddenly rips out a colossal toot. Everyone stares and laughs at him. It's so embarrassing when he does that. Or we would be dining out, my dad always props his legs up on the table, and he just abruptly burps really loud for like 30 seconds. It smells terrible afterward, and it's so gross. 

My dad is extremely gross, and he never apologizes for his boorish behavior. For example, he would pick his nose in public and then \*eat\* the booger, and he would sings really loud and off pitch when he's in the bathroom. He's just trying to cover up the farting noises.",13Sep2020,2

77,"Hey reddit!

So, there's a lot of messed up shit going on right now, and a lot of people are suffering. Over the summer, I was pretty unhappy, and I relate some of that to what was going on in the U.S., including unemployment, racism, police brutality, etc. However, I also am extremely fortunate in that I am working towards a graduate degree, have a supportive family, and also have a lot of privilege. In trying to recognize my own privilege (as a white, upper-middle class person) and think about how I fit into our country right now in speaking out against racism and oppression, I've gone through phases where I feel personally guilty or like a ""bad person"" for what's going on. I recognize that this shit is NOT about me (my guilt/feelings etc. are obviously irrelevant in the big picture of people being marginalized for hundreds of years) which has helped me get through those phases and hopefully get to a place where I can actually be a productive citizen in working against those forces of oppression. I also acknowledge that a lot of oppression isn't just us individuals, but these larger systems as a whole.

What's weird is, I'm a lot happier now in acknowledging that I'm not perfect - that I've probably contributed to oppression at some point and likely will in the future - but that doesn't mean that I can't keep working against it, learning, improving, and speaking up for what I believe in (instead of trying to defend myself as a ""good white person"" etc.) I've also recognized that it's a lifelong process, and I can't get discouraged.

So I guess I'm wondering if anyone feels similarly, and also is it selfish to be happy or still love myself in these times? I think I had an epiphany where I was like, okay, I actually love myself, yet it almost feels wrong to be happy when so many fucked up things are going on. But I feel like if I am at my best and I am happy, I'm much better equipped to contribute to society and be a good citizen. Again, it's not about me. Let me know what y'all think!",13Sep2020,2

They had all been living together while I had moved out. I personally was never happy living at that house. It had too many cats and I am allergic. My mom was a handful (rude, controlling) and every once in awhile she was really nice and sweet. My step dad was also a huge dick with the occasional nice-ness. The only reason I would visit my parents house is to see my brothers.  

  
Recently, I’d say about 3 years ago, my mom’s mental health slipped A LOT. It started with her being bizarrely impulsive, taking off on random road trips and staying in hotels she could barely afford. It caused issues with her husband, threatening to force her to come home and such.  
  
It only got worse. She increasingly went on these trips, spending too much money, and even giving money to strangers online. Eventually she started recalling memories from 30 years prior that made NO sense whatsoever. One example is her being a rock star’s love child. Why would this matter to her now, at the age of 50?  
  
Crazier things happened. She swears she was gang raped as a teen, by big famous politicians, rock stars, and a few of her childhood boyfriends. Just startling, insane memories that don’t sound plausible. 
  
Cue spring 2019. My parents fought more often. My step dad wanted her to see a mental health professional. She claims she would go (alone), and they would tell her that she is fine and is clear to go home.   
  
My step dad thought perhaps he could make a false claim that she is suicidal, to get the police to come and take her to the hospital. Instead what happened was, he lost his temper, broke down a door, and called the cops on HER. The cops arrived and told him maybe he should leave for the night because he had been violent.   
  
He basically left, took the 2 younger brothers (13 and 15), and moved across country to be with his family. This had been a process of 2 weeks in a hotel, then eventually leaving. This is in the US, so we’re talking from California to Alabama.   
  
My step dad receives retirement benefits (military), enough to live off of. My mom has ZERO income. He left her in a foreclosed upon house, with no intent of coming back and helping with the animals he left behind (a few dogs and cats), and not paying any utilities.  
  
I had to step in and help with living expenses. I am not rich by any means. I have a stable job, enough for me to own my own house, pay bills and a car. My boyfriend has a stable job as well and we survive, but we don’t have much extra money.   
  
For awhile my mom was lucky enough to avoid getting evicted. But at one point she had no water or power, and no AC in a hot ass desert. I slowly chipped away at the power to try to get it back on. I stepped in and helped a lot. I even have 2 other adult siblings, one older brother 30M, and one younger brother who still lives in town, 23M. Nobody can seem to help.  
  
I am the only one helping at all. I suspect because everyone has resentment towards mom. She does bring any type of energy down, not fun to be around, and can argue a lot.   
  
To add onto her negative tendencies, NOW she is all, poor me, pity me, I’m mentally ill, I can’t work any jobs, my kids don’t love me and don’t want to come home, what am I gonna do?  
  
After awhile, it just gets so tiring. It is obvious the answer is she should get a job, a part-time job like fast food or stocking shelves, leave the foreclosed upon house (which is filthy, by the way), have a regular therapist and meds, start over and build her way up to make an honest living in a clean house. Then maybe it will be easier to ask her children to come home.  
  

She has gone to therapy, gotten new meds, and goes regularly. However her therapist did tell me that she is pretty sick and it will take a lot of therapy to help her. It will need commitment from her to make sure she goes regularly.  
  

I am almost at a loss of what to do. I thought I was doing the right thing by helping her with money and feeding her dogs, helping with electricity bills, and some money for living. Luckily she has food stamps so I don’t have to worry about her going hungry.  
  
She is currently in the divorce process. She states she is close to bringing my step dad down, by claiming he illegally took the kids out of state, and could hopefully get custody or visitation and alimony. Of course the process is lengthy, and I feel like it’s dragging on.  
  
Some people have told me I should cut contact with her until she figures out her life. It is hard for me to do that, because I do feel bad that she is all alone now, with nobody to help take care of her. I personally don’t want to take her into my house because of the negativity plus the animals.   
  
Any advice would be appreciated... what to do next, how to process my thoughts, how to help her in the situation? I’ve given up on getting help from my siblings. Are they right, and I’m wrong for helping my mom?  
  
TL;DR my mentally ill mother forced everyone away from her, including my siblings and her husband. She has narcissistic tendencies, is not fun to be around, and is in NO way financially independent. What can I do?",13Sep2020,1

85,"I am a 29[M] and My girlfriend[23] loves animals, she has adopted, or helped to adopt quite a few animals: a large dog named brandy, she is great and lives at her dad's house, another small dog, A cat that was given to her that also lives at her parents house. Then a while later she ended up with a baby kitten. I wasn't all for the latest cat addition, but I suppose he grew on me. The most difficult part about this is her affinity for animals. Every time since she got the second dog- she has always had to take in a rescue animal or some pet without a home some friend wants to find a home for which brings me to my question. I specifically told her She has enough pets, including the ones at her parents house that her family takes care of, and the cat that is living with us at our home. I expressed my feelings about not wanting another pet of any type for a while because the cat is just enough for me to deal with because i'm putting up with him. Now today she was given another pet and showed up to her parents house with another cat and I'm stunned that no matter what I say, or how I feel about the situation this is going to become a recurring issue. It's another four legged mouth to feed that I have zero interest in and temporarily it is at her father's house, because she already knows and I told her I don't want it here. My fear is it's just going to end up at our house like every other pet she's ever wanted and brought home. What should I do?",13Sep2020,1

91,"Hi all, to start off I’m 19F and from the UK. This post is creepy and going to make me sound like I’ve got issues but I need some advice... basically there was this college tutor that I’ve had a huge crush on for 3 years now and my feelings just won’t go away, he’s 26M, He first caught my eye when I had just started attending college and I was 16 at the time, What struck me was how cute he looks, he has a baby face which makes him look younger and I actually first mistook him for another student until I saw his badge, after talking to him a few times and him helping me get out of an anxiety attack my first few weeks at the college, I realised that he was caring and had a sweet personality too and that’s when I caught feelings which is pathetic.

I had him as my main course tutor at the start of September last year for a few months and before that I would just see him around college and speak to him every now and then. When I had him as a teacher my feelings grew stronger, he generally treated me better and trusted me more than the other students but not because he liked me or anything, it’s because my class was a bit of a trouble class and most of the students didn’t respect him and didn’t keep up with their assignments and was just bad behaved despite being aged from 16-20, most were immature. I was one of the few students who actually cared about the course and tried my best. He would always use me as an example of a good learner and told the class that they should be more like me and he always asked me to help him with certain tasks, he also let me get away with stuff like he wouldn’t tell me off for charging my phone in class or turning up to college wearing white air forces which was against our course uniform code but he would tell the others off if they did the same things, he was all very caring regarding my anxiety issues and let me have time out of lessons when I needed it. All of this made me feel special and made me like him more, people would call me his pet which was annoying lol.

He ended up leaving the college before Christmas, On his last day I bought him a bottle of Jack Daniels to say thanks for everything and told him he was a great teacher and he went all shy , I think he is a timid sort of guy who struggles to take compliments but he was still very grateful and said his goodbyes and wished me luck for everything.

I was completely devastated when he left and still am but at the time I thought at least I will get over him now... but no, I still fancy him like mad, I think about him all the time and I’m always daydreaming even though I haven’t seen him since December and I wish I could speak to him and befriend him somehow even if it’s just in a friend way. 

I don’t know what he does now as a job or anything but he told me he was leaving teaching,  I think he has deleted his Facebook account which I find really odd (exposing my stalker ness) one day I searched him up and couldn’t find him anymore like I used to, he hasn’t blocked me or anything because I checked on a different account and I have never messaged him or accidentally liked his stuff so he would have no reason to block me so that account has definitely been deleted, but I find it so strange why he would do that and was getting paranoid that it was because of me (not like it’s any of my business though lol) also I will add that for some reason he still comes up on the fb messenger and it says ‘using messenger without Facebook’ but I dunno just seems weird.

He has no other social media as far as I am aware too which is actually a good thing because I won’t have the temptation to message him, after he left the college, my friends were egging me on to message him but I wouldn’t do it as I know it’s wrong and I would regret it because I know

I need some advice that will help me move on, I would like to get a boyfriend but I’m never interested in the guys that like me, I don’t know why but I seem to always have a thing for men who I can’t have. This tutor isn’t the only guy I have liked who is out is bounds, they are always... teachers, live too far away, have a girlfriend etc, I typically like guys who are a bit older too (mid 20’s) like him and I don’t know why this is but I wish it would stop so I could actually be interested in someone who likes me and is not out of bounds, it’s so frustrating!",13Sep2020,1
94,"I'll start this off by saying what happened today.  After work today a coworker told me that my other coworkers (my supervisor and another girl) called me a ""big brain"" in a condescending tone and when she asked why they thought that they said ""oh you'll see."" They called me a know-it- all. This hurt my feelings and I'm stressed about some other things at work so I called my boyfriend to vent to him. He said I'm very argumentative and I correct people too often and use a condescending tone. I went home upset and talked to my dad about it. He agreed with them. (My dad thinks he's king of the world and an expert on everything under the sun so he's not very reliable on this.)

Now let me tell you some things about myself. I'm a 20 year old girl in college becoming a doctor and I work as a pharmacy technician to pay my bills. I have pretty liberal views and I think all my views are heavily based on fact and statistics. I accept everyone for who they are. (except racists, pedos, etc.) I DO NOT like people who are mean. I don't accept rudeness in any way. I challenge myself to be as polite and kind as possible, mostly because I was mentally abused the entire time I was growing up. I refuse to do that to other people, especially because I have no idea how they're struggling. I suffer from severe anxiety and depression disorders, I used to take medication, but it didn't work for me. I had severe childhood trauma. My health is pretty bad otherwise. I have have a hereditary disease that affects my energy levels, mood, and metabolism heavily. My relationship is healthy. We've been together for 4.5 years and we have great communication and a lot of love. My relationships with my parents are horrible. 

I cannot think of any instance that I've corrected my coworkers. I'm a pharmacy technician in training and I ask them questions constantly because I don't really have a lot of answers when it comes to pharmacy. We don't talk about anything else at work. Someone else told me that they're jealous that I'm in school (they didn't go to school), but I don't know if that's very likely. 

It is unacceptable to me to think that I may be hurting other people or making them mad. I do not want to be like that.

I am not aware of the behavior that is making people dislike me, and I don't know how to change it. I'm worried that being mean and annoying is just hardwired into me and that I don't have the ability to see it. I don't know what to do, I feel unwelcome at work now, and I feel like a terrible person. Please give me some advice.",13Sep2020,1
95,"I’m one of two children that my father had with my mom. They met in the navy and entered a long term relationship that eventually produced me and my younger brother (about 1 1/2 years apart). They broke up sometime after my brother being born. He soon married another woman and they have now have two young children. 
My father was absentee. He paid his child support but he did not raise me or my brother. I would describe our relationship like distance acquaintances. I think he’s very guilty for being a shoddy dad, but hasn’t really made up for it. I forgive him, though. 
I’m interested in getting to know that side of the family. My two younger half siblings, maybe even my stepmom; but I’m scared to reach out. I don’t want to be rejected and I’m also uninterested in bringing messy family members into my life. (My grandma on that side and two aunts are notorious shit starting but play the victim types).
There’s also the case of my older half sister. She’s also a child of my mother (my mother raised all of her children by herself, there’s about 4 dads in the mix. Don’t talk about my momma 😝) and she’s about 10 years older than me. She was around when my mom first started dating my father and started acting like a heathen around 14. She loves mess too and she’s since gone to New York and shit talked my mom with my messy grandma and aunts (who aren’t even related to her in any way) and members of my mother’s side of the family; who our mother DOES NOT contact under any circumstances. Our mother had a shitty childhood and was bounced around several states; between several shitty family members who used and abused her so my mother doesn’t have these people in her life anymore. I have a tight family unit of just my mom and my siblings and I don’t want to disrupt that if that leads to mess. Did my dimwit of a half sister fuck up my potential contact with my father’s side of the family? Should I take the leap and reach out to him and ask to meet my half siblings and that part of the family? Or should I just keep it pushing. I’m 20 and in college and I don’t want to take any steps back.

I should mention my father and I talk every so often on Facebook messenger. It’s the occasional awkward “hi, how you doing” type of thing 😂we had the longest conversation we ever had in my life, last year on there. He even said that too. Ruined the moment a little",13Sep2020,1
96,"Like the title says, have you walked out on an appointment? Why? And were you charged for your visit?

Recently I was scheduled for a follow up appointment after a colonoscopy in August. I've visited this office once before and the first visit ran behind nearly 45 minutes late. I thought okay, cool, whatever, I have an issue and these people are within a reasonable. I live in a relatively rural area so we have one main hospital about an hour out. 

When I went in for my follow up they got me in at my appointment time, but I ended up sitting in the room by myself for 45 minutes. Nurse comes in and we talk about what's been going on, she said my procedure was fine all of the biopsies and tests they ran were normal. Refilled my prescription and did everything I needed to potentially be on my way. As she is standing up she mutters something along the lines of ""okay, we're gonna wait like an hour for the doctor to come tell you the same thing I just said"" Excuse me, what? Can't I just leave if he's going to tell me the same thing? ""What do you have today that's so important?"" Now I'm just dumbfounded this nurse is even saying this shit to me right now. Eventually she settles on ""just wait 15 minutes"" and I agreed. I ended up waiting 25 minutes before heading out. 

Now, usually I don't mind waiting. I get that doctors will get caught up, have emergencies, whatever they do. I'm not a doctor I just appreciate what they do. I do not appreciate being treated like my time does not matter.

My patient portal is showing they are billing me $250 for the visit. Would it be worth getting in contact with office management to try and sort this out?

98,"I have a colleague who I'm slowly getting close to confide in me a very personal problem that he is having. After hearing his situation, I was at a loss for words, so I thought I would ask around to see what others think about this from a few different perspectives. 

This guy was abandoned by his father when he was about one years old. So, he has never met his father in his life, but the worst part is that his mother has no recollection whatsoever of his paternal father. She doesn't remember his name, where he is from or anything. So, the guy has nothing to seek out even if he did want to find out more about his paternal father as an adult. Additionally, the guy's last name is not his paternal father's last name, nor is it his mother's last name, it is the last name of another guy the mother married at one time. She has since re-married and has another last name.

The man that this guy was raised with (his stepfather) was very abusive, both physically and mentally, so he is glad he doesn't carry his name, but his question to me is what last name should he give his children? He hasn't gotten married yet, but often wonders if he should use the last name he has to give to his girlfriend when they get married. I mentioned him taking her last name, but he said he doesn't get along with them well at all. What a very difficult situation to be in!

What's in a name though? Identity, culture, history, etc. A name can have characteristics that align one with a certain group of people that share similar beliefs and backgrounds. I think about African-Americans when they were brought here as slaves and one of the first things they had stripped of them was their language and their names. Their sense of identity was destroyed. Many African-Americans that I've met told me that they still have the slave names that was given to their family many generations ago. I surmise many don't change their name, because they don't know where they came from in Africa so all they have is the name that they currently have no matter how painful the backstory is. This is also a big reason why many Africans in Africa dislike African-Americans, because they lack a connection to Africa. I noticed this during my travels on the continent in different countries. But perhaps one could say that this man could start anew, change his last name to whatever he wants and redefine whatever he wants his life for his new family to be. I wonder could this be looked at as something that is liberating? But then again, many people tend to group others so he could be stuck constantly having to explain his life story or just ignore those who ask about. I really don’t know how to approach this.

What do you think? Also, do have you any similar stories in your family or close circle like this that could help this person. Thank you.",13Sep2020,1

104,"I would like to have advice from people who have experienced this.

To have some background, almost all my life I cared for people who show less interest in me that the interest I had on them (an sadly) only a few times I had what is called 'an equal relationship' so I don't really have much experience being on the other end.

Not many years ago I experience a feeling of annoyingness toward someone who I didn't care much when they texted me that surprised me. Since it was just one person, even though I felt bad about it, I didn't give it too much thought. But it is happening to me again recently with some new people I met. And I wonder how can I learn to manage this in a positive way.

What happens to me, it's that I meet someone new who I get interested in the first place, and a few days later I loose almost all interest. I don't know why, they didn't seem to have done anything wrong.

It makes me feel guilty (because they keep texting me) but it also generates me some rejection towards them. And it's not even that is because they text me all the time, maybe they didn't text me in a while and write me to know how I been going and I feel annoyed.

The reason y don't block them or just say that I don't want to talk to them, it's because I don't dislike them, and maybe we can connect better in the future, who knows. And because I know that it doesn't feel well to reject someone or ignore them, so I don't wanna do that to others. But it's not good to give them hope either, right?

Also (if I give Facebook as an example) they might benefit from the things I share even though I don't. Bonds aren't always equal and that doesn't make them necessarily wrong, right? But you can't just go to someone and say ""listen, I'm not interested in talking to you, but if you wanna follow me be my guest"" that sounds terrible, right?

So to;dr I don't really know what annoys me from this situation, but I just wish I find a way to manage this and treat others the same way I want to be treated. Thoughts?

Update: I posting this with the title ""as an introverted"" because, as you know (or maybe not) introvert people tend to have a thinner protecting 'barrier' towards other's people energy and tend to feel invaded.

Pants I'm not worried about because no one can tell the brand from looking at some jeans. I have a variety of nice skinny jeans that fit well on me. I have nice shoes also - again you can't really tell brands by looking at shoes except if they're Nike running shoes for example.

I think the only place brand can matter then is shirts. I don't find button up shirts really look good on me. They just look like I'm posing for ""LinkedIn"" or a resume. They don't accentuate my physique at all. They make me look smaller. So for me it's all about t shirts and v neck shirts. 

But plain flat colored shirts (which is what I prefer - I like things simple) don't work for getting attention. 

I went to the mall shopping and most of the shirts in the stores had tacky logos/designs/slogans on them. I figured if I'm going to wear a shirt with something dumb on it may as well make it a logo that might help me.

I looked online at different designer brand stuff to compare. Gucci and Prada shirts are gaudy as hell. Loads of gold. Some D&amp;G shirts look decent. Armani Exchange t shirts are okay but not sure if they're ""fancy"" enough to help. 

I don't know much about brands or this sort of thing. Help me out. What brands/logos might make a woman pause if she saw them on your shirt in an online dating profile?

I know what you're going to say - ""women don't care about brand name clothes"" and ""you'll attract the wrong type of women that way."" Actual truth: I need to increase any chance I have and I don't have any other things left to try so I'm not concerned about that.

My problem is that I become overly obsessed with trying to be close to my therapist and trying to ensure that they like me. I’m overly needy, need lots of reassurance and I feel the need to connect with my therapist on a deeper level than the vast majority of people. I have this overwhelming need/obsession with making sure that my therapist thinks my problems are legitimate and that she truly sees how much I hurt and struggle. I fully realize that I’m not her only client and that yes, she has a life outside of work, but I still take her silence personally (she encourages the use of e-mail and writing as I struggle to open up and to be vulnerable during in person sessions). I know none of this is healthy but does anyone know WHY I may be doing this? And please don’t just tell me to ask my therapist....

hi everyone! so im a 14f and i cannot bring myself to believe the compliments my coaches, teammates, and parents tell me. i feel like im just playing the role everyone sees me as.

so give some insight, i wont say im like a child prodigy or whatever but i would say i'm one of the best on my team? i play for a decent size club so we do have big name sponsors but nothing like nike or adidas. 

anyways, i have been playing soccer since i was 6. then joining the competitive club when i was 8, although i didn't officially play for them until i was 10. during that time i was one of their youngest players so i ended up playing in u12 brackets. so for a while i hit a slight wall because i always felt like i wasnt good.

eventually the club grew big enough i was able to play for the right age group and thats when i started to realize the potential i had? i started with just 1.5hrs of practice 2x a week but then i started also training with some of the older girls, changing my practices to around 3hrs on one day, a normal 1.5hr practice, and another 1.5hr private session. i started gaining confidence and i ended up winning mvp 2 years in a row. 

now entering hs i have soccer training/conditioning for school 3x a wk thats can range from 45-120mins and weight room 2x a day thats about 45 mins. i still play for the same club and its gotten big enough that i now have practice 3x a week, ranging from 1-1.5hrs. i still also attend my private session that's usually 1.5hrs but i been doing 1hr since its really hot where i live. 

so i would say soccer pretty much is my entire life. recently though, i feel like i just cant do anything for my team anymore. i cant even think about telling my coaches because i know im a good player. i mean i just went through a tournament and played 4 full games. but for some reason the most recent game earlier today i just played felt so overwhelming. like my body just felt more exhausted than usual and i felt hyper aware for all the voices around me. it also didnt help that we lost 1-3 so i felt even more awful throughout the game.

this is usually a problem with me because i also feel like some of my teammates and their parents think im just a coach favorite. i feel like they know im good but they dont know why the coaches keep me in the game. it feels like everyone is just seeing the player i really am especially in the past 1-2 seasons (about a year).

but truthfully this something i been feeling a lot more recently. like i know im a good player and i know my coaches, teammates, and parents support me but i also feel like im letting them down. i had a talk with my mom about my future and she told me ""i think you have potential to play in college."" but how do i tell her that i dont think i can? i feel like people have started piling up expectations for me that i cant reach. in honesty its almost driven me to quit soccer. i love soccer too much though to quit, but if anyone asks if i plan on playing for college, then i dont have an answer. 

i also finally fell out of the thought process that every loss my team had was my fault but now it's becoming a ""im not good enough for this"". i want to be the player that everyone sees me as but i just feel like everyone else is working hard to get better when im just stuck at the same level i am at while the coaches praise me. like my parents have told me i did or my coaches would tell me i had a great game, but i feel like i cant see it anymore. everyone says good job but i cant help but wonder if theyre just saying to my face. i dont be insulted or brought down for a shitty game i had but i cant make myself believe the people around me.

so i want some advice on how i can stop bringing myself down because its starting to reflect on my gameplay. i want to be able to actually be there for my team and be able to support my team the way everyone else does.



tl;dr: i play soccer and i dont feel like im as good as everyone expects me to be and it's making me depressed and stressed over it.",13Sep2020,1

124,"All my life I was excited to go to college. Teachers and my family thought I was going to be the successful person in the family. Yet now that I’m in college I am sick of it. Before this I was already starting to hate education. Go to school, take a test, get good grades, and that’s it. I tried to spice up my schedule senior year of high school and took 6 AP courses. You know what my hard work yielded? No college credit and me getting the same diploma as the kid who sold a gun at school. Yep so much for hard work. It just seems like all the effort in my education means nothing and this is coming from someone who has gotten good grades most of their life. What even is education if all the work we put into it means nothing in the end? Since I’m hating the first year of college so much, I really want to specialize in community college (where I am now) and finish there. I want to go into programming and get an associates in that. Then on top of that I want to get other IT certifications. I feel like this is the best for me at the moment because I’m despising this so much.

125,"So, I'm new to reddit so please excuse my formatting, but I really need the internet's advice. But just so you know, I'm 14 year old female.

Some quick information so you can understand: In 6th grade, my sister won a stuffed hedgehog in a game and named it Nubo. Since then, its been passed around the friend group and everyone who is in friend group knows about it. We would sometimes play catch with him in the middle of class after we finished work. In 9th grade before quarantine started, my sister took Nubo home since he was in her locker. No one knew about it.

Anyway, my friend, let's call her Harper, came to me asking about a certain text. She was asking saying stuff like, ""Did you do this? If so it's not really funny."" She was asking around our friend group and she sounded really heated and upset. So I asked her, "" What are you talking about?"" Harper then sent a screenshot of a text that she got. The text consisted of an unknown person who I'm going to call Mysterio, claiming to be Nubo and stating that we had 14 days to figure out who they are. Harper guessed a couple times but they said that it was the wrong answer each time. They barely gave out any clues and whenever Harper asked for a one Mysterio would usually respond with ""I.AM.NUBO."" When things got even more creepy for us is when they started to say awfully specific things about us when we were asking questions on where they were/ where they lived near (My sister and I knew where most of our friends lived even though they didn't know where we lived since we never invited them to our house.)they said that they were at my house even though we didn't tell anyone about Nubo's location. They also knew stuff like specific nicknames, secrets, and some other stuff like that which a lot of people in our friend group don't know. So we were all understandably freaked out and I decided to do the sane thing to do and try and track their number. Unfortunately, I couldn't get very far since most trackers cost money and my parent won't give me their credit card information. I tried to figure out their identity in different ways but it mostly ended up in dead ends. A couple hours later and Harper says that Mysterio has changed a couple of things. Now we only have 8 days to find out their identity or else... Even though they didn't finish their or else... I still didn't like the prospect of what they could do. Depending on who this person is, they could have a lot of sensitive information that we entrusted to them.

So Reddit, what should I do? Not engaging with them would have been smart at the start and I wished I told Harper that in the beginning but I guess I wanted to play Sherlock Holmes of some kind. And even though I want to, I can't go to the police because we don't have a lot of evidence to go on. Any ideas would be helpful at this point.",13Sep2020,3

134,"I am F17 and have always been an only child. My family recently accepted a F15 foster child into our home. She doesn't have any serious behavioural issues apart from being sexually active since a young age and often staying out late (haven't experienced her acting this way yet but have heard from her previous foster families). She also suffers ADHD and has self harmed in the past.

&amp;#x200B;

We are her fourth foster family in the past 6 months, prior to that she had stayed with one foster family for 14 years, but due to them having newborn grandchildren and health issues they could no longer take care of her. Her social worker also told us that she has abandonment issues from being removed from her foster family of 14 years and two subsequent families. The second family was due to her and her foster parents not getting along because of strict rules, and she self-placed in the next family as it was the family of her friend from school, but had to leave that one after 3 months because her friend got jealous and got her friends at school to beat her up.

&amp;#x200B;

She has evidently had a rough time the past 6 months and my family was eager to take her in because we thought we could provide a safe and loving home, despite previously telling the foster agency that the oldest age we would take on was 13 years old. At first I was excited to have someone of a similar age in the house as it would be fun and I thought we would get along well. However, she has quite a different personality to mine (or any of the people I am friends with). She is very outgoing but slightly rude in the way she speaks and always directs conversations to revolve around her, often interrupting my parents while they are talking. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been in a very strange mental state since she arrived, and have realised that I don't want a sibling anymore, as I am a very solitary person and her presence in our house ruins the equilibrium of the home. It no longer feels like a home to me, and I have only been happy when she isn't around. I hadn't realised how much I valued the moments with just me and my parents until they were gone. I can't explain why exactly she changes the family dynamic so much because I can't figure it out myself, but all I know is that the thought of her living here for at least another 3 years is very depressing. My parents no longer feel like mine, and I feel so anxious and sad, I can't focus on studying for my exams (I am currently in the middle of my year 11 exam period). I am entering into my most stressful year of school next year and I can't afford to be distracted by family issues.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, I think we decided on taking her on too impulsively (we only took 1 day to accept the offer) and we hadn't properly considered how much of an impact suddenly getting a 15 year old sister would be on me, considering my family has just been my parents and I for the past 17 years. I have told my mum about it and we agreed to wait for a month or so then see how I feel, but if after that time my mental state hasn't changed, I don't know what to do. She moved from a different city to live here as there were no foster families willing to take her in her past city, and she is moving schools and everything. I would feel so guilty if we uprooted her entire life just to get rid of her after a few months. Also, it may be hard to find another placement for her as there are not many families willing to take on a 15 year old. I also think her mental health would be impacted if she had to move families yet again.

I will tell my story and tell me what do you a thing. Giving me a piece of advice would be appreciated.
I am from saudi arabia snd I lost my parents at the age of7. I have many brothers and sisters and u am the youngest.
At the age of 12, one of my brothers (age 25 at the time) sexually assaulted me several times and I didn't know what was happening. However, i told my sister (3 years older than me) and she get pissed and told me to go up stairs and tell him I won't do this again. I went and told him that but I still didn't knew what happened ment. He didn't sexually assaulted me afterward.
However, my family is very conservative and strict. I was forced to wear Hijab and Niqab and i was physically abused through out middle school by one of my older sisters. I was psychologically abused my other siblings, telling me am ugly and stupid all my live. The same sister i disclosed the abuse, always told even if i studied hard it would for nothing cause my family wouldn't allow me to do anything and I should just be like her.
My movements was always monitored and I had to fight fir every the simplest things, getting in idea was after a major fight, going to university was the same, I remember clearly that my brother who sexually assaulted me, through the uni car on my face and told me even i will go to uni i will never have a cell phone ( which I never had till 1st year of uni). After uni i fought and cried  for 6 months to convince them to allow me to work, eventually the same brother drove to my first day if work to make sure that it's not mixed work and women have a separated entrance than men.

Anyway after two years if work I received a full scholarship with monthly allowance to study master abroad. According to the saudi system I have to be accompanied by a male guardian which they pay allowance to and also pay for his studies if he wanted to study.
The same brother told he will go with me but made it clear that if his work didn't allow him I won't go. I also received a call from another brother, not to congratulate me, but to tell me the same. Eventually, he traveled with and the same sister who disclosed the abuse yo came along to study English. I have been living with for 2.5 years.
Even here my movement is watched and sm not allow to be later than 10 pm. I take off my hijab and drink behind his back. In 2019 i met a European man and fell in love behind my brother back. 

This man knows my whole story and we have been together for 1.5 year. Now long distance because of Covid he had to go home. 
Because of him and therapy, I managed to tell 3 of my older sisters back home about my brother, all of them told it happend because my clothes was revealing and I should not hack mixed with him. One if them told another sister but she never bothered to txted me or call me.

Just to mention one of the things my sister did is that she and my brother went to have a weekend away, he was angry to leave me alone in the house. Anyway, me and BF decide to seizes the opportunity to go in a weekend away as well. On Sunday we were coming back and my sister told me to buy her a tooth brush because she list hers in the hotel. Their flight back was landing at 10 pm. Me and my BF had a car accident at 6 pm.

I
We were not hurt but the car was damaged and dangerous to drive, However, I couldn't not stat the night out side the house at all. My BF drove me un the same car for 3 hours drive full of fear snd anxiety. I send my sister a text that we gad a car accident, she txted me back "" don't forget the tooth brush"".

Obviously I didn't had time to buy a tooth brush because the pharmacy was closed.
When she arrived home she asked me about the tooth brush and i told her I didn't buy it, she said "" if u know u wouldn't buy it I wouldn't have told u when our flight was going to land so my brother would cone home and see you with him"".

Now am in my last semester of university and I have to go home by the end if December and I don't know what to do.

My BF already told his family and friends about me and they txt me to check on me. 

I am terrified of leaving because i am afraid they will fund me, i feel more safe staying with the evil I know then testing the beast and face his anger.

I can apply for skilled immigrant visa but i can do thus after graduation and it will take 3 weeks. Meaning i can this visa mid Jan. The problem is my family would expect me to come back home with my brother late December.

I don't want to leave when I return back homes because of two reasons. I am afraid they will take my passport or they will punish my sister thinking she knew about my plans of running away.

I have a lot of saving so money isn't a big issue, i am just lost and terrified that if i did this they will find me. I don't know how to this.

But I would feel immensely guilty if I did that but at the same time if I keep a laptop I may never use it'll be a huge waste of money and that brings me even more guilt I'm fully aware how entitled or crappy this may sound and that's why I came to reddit I truly don't know what to do if I keep it I probably won't use it but if I take it back I feel it'd hurt my mother's feelings and I don't want to do that.

144,"Hey everyone, long time lurker, first time posting in a long time. 

So, I’ve lived in Austin, TX since day 1. I was born and raised here. In fact, the hospital I was born at is still down the street. I’ve always wanted to venture out and live elsewhere, specially Colorado or the west coast, but never found the strength to do so. Enter, my wonderful girlfriend. She and I have been dating for nearly 3 years now. We’ve lived together for about 10 months out of those 3 years, so, living together isn’t new to us. We managed to do it with 2 dogs in a 450 sqft studio apartment, so, if we can do that, we can do basically anything. Anyways, my girlfriend misses home and her family and wants to go back to the west coast. She has a great job opportunity in LA, so we’re pushing to go there. I’m currently unemployed/furloughed &amp; have been riding off of unemployment since being furloughed in mid-March. I’ve tried my hand at multiple WFH (work from home) jobs with no success so far. I have a decent bit saved up, but no real income other than unemployment currently. We both have friends out in LA, and most of the people I’ve talked to that live there say it’s expensive, but should be “doable” with two people splitting costs. Some tell me about it as if they’re living by the hairs on their necks. Some tell me about it as if it’s sunshine and rainbows. I’ve done my own fair share of homework too, plus I went there for work and stayed for 3 weeks while I was there. However, my work experience while I was there is not an ideal depiction due to my old job putting me up very nicely and giving me a hefty stipend. 
She’s leaving on the 25th of this month and I’m helping her move her stuff to her parents place &amp; am staying with them for a week while we look for a place. I’m going home later to get my own stuff to drive back. If it helps anyone diagnose this situation as a whole, I’m 28 and she’s 25. 

So, I’m just anxious about the job situation &amp; the moving situation in general. All of it has my head in a whirl and I can’t seem to not think too hard about it. I started looking for jobs in LA, but I figured “what’s the point?” if I’m not even there yet. I’ve looked for a few WFH jobs I can apply to when and wherever, but I didn’t get too far because I have zero idea where to look or begin &amp; it started to overwhelm me. 

I’m sure I’ve left out some important information for someone to help me, so if I have, please tell me. But, if anyone has any advice on how to combat this or what my next steps should be, I’d be very grateful. 


Thank you.",13Sep2020,1

146,"I do not live in the house anymore because I’m an adult, but my little brother does. I also spend every day there to be with my brother. My mom has not been involved in either of our lives because she’s in jail. 

Anyways, my dad apparently has been dating this woman for a long time and her and her children moved into the house a couple weeks ago. The biggest issue was, there wasn’t a lot of mental preparation for it because we found out they were moving in the day before it happened. 

The girlfriend is really nice and her oldest child is just fine, although her youngest is a special needs child. I don’t know the child’s exact condition but he is physically 7, but mentally I’d say he’s about 3 or 4 if that makes sense. He’s a nice kid when it comes down to it, but him and my brother haven’t stopped fighting since they got here. Of course my brother is 8, so that’s of course a normal thing with boys anyways, but I’m getting worried that it’s going to be a lot deeper than that. I think my dads going to marry this woman, and they’ll be around for a long time. What I’ve seen so far is that it’s her oldest sons responsibility to take care of the youngest. For example it’s his responsibility to put the youngest to bed every night. (Which is a huge task because getting that child to do anything he doesn’t want to do is horrible) but I’m worried that as they all get older, the youngest is mentally going to stay the same and it’ll eventually be my brothers responsibility to take care of him. 

Maybe I’m just worrying myself too much, but I’ve read a lot of horror stories about siblings of special needs children. Also the youngest child is also not getting any of the help he needs, he’s currently enrolled in a public school that doesn’t exactly have a special ed program (I know because it was also my school) but that’s basically about it. Of course I don’t want to go into much detail because I do not like saying anything bad about the child, because like I said he’s a sweet kid when it comes down to it. He’s just very difficult when he doesn’t get what he wants. 

Anyways what I’m asking advice for is my little brother. I can’t get him into therapy because I’m broke and in college. Also our dad really doesn’t believe in therapy. Maybe I’m just worrying myself too much because like I said, I’ve seen a lot of horror stories about special needs kids with siblings. But how could I help my brother more with this large adjustment?",13Sep2020,1
147,"Hello everyone! I will try not to make this post too long, but sorry if it actually does. 4am loneliness makes me write a lot.

 So basically, I've been feeling very romantically lonely for a while now, and I have no way of meeting new people outside of video games and the internet in general. 
 Thing is, I do not want to use anything specifically made for dating because I do not want to ""force"" a relationship or to have a date before actually having feelings with someone, and I'm a bit scared of finding people that I knew beforehand, or to just being disappointed by not finding anyone I'd like or anyone that'd like me.

Here's a bit of context about me, my situation and why I need help with this:
 First of all, I'm a very passionate 20yo guy that lives in Belgium. 

 I've always been very shy in real life around people that I don't know. In general, I never go out alone or without a specific objective in mind [like buying groceries], and I'm quite anxious when I'm alone with someone I'm supposed to socialize with, as I am scared of saying something akward, or just to not have anything to say. I still try my best to avoid akward situations though, and I appreciate this part of personnality, so that's not really the problem. 
 The real problem is that my personnality never allowed me to meet new people outside of school or video games. All the friends I have came from these 2 places and are sometimes living in different countries, so when I stopped my studies 2 years ago and started to work full time, my only way of seeing ""new faces"" was through competitive video games, which are hard places to find someone that you might have a romantic relationship with. 

 So, in 2 years, I met very few people, in which there is almost no girls. I always felt quite lonely even before that, but now it got worse, and I'm afraid of being desesperate for affection, even around my friends.
 These last days, I started to really want to take a step forward and to meet new people, specifically girls as I have tons of guy friends already, but I genuinely don't know how to do that outside of the typical dating apps or by going out and asking people I find cute out, and I'm extremely not into these 2 solutions, for reasons that I cannot pinpoint correctly outside of what I already said above. 
 I think that there must be another way, like websites or apps that are not made specifically for dating, or video games that are very good to socialize while having something to talk about, but I couldn't find something I'd like to try even after trying to make my own search, so that's why I came here for help.

 Thank you for reading, and sorry if I made spelling or grammar mistakes, English isn't my first language!
 I'm now going to sleep and hope to get some answers, so please, if you have any questions or advice, feel free! I'd be happy to answer! :)",13Sep2020,1

What should I ask her? What do I say to her to make her last moments peaceful and comfortable? 

We were close growing up but I have lived on the other side of the countryg for the last couple years and haven’t been able to visit as much as I would have liked.

151,"Lately my mom has been pressed about me not wanting to go spend time with her.

She asked me earlier today if I wanted her to pick me up tomorrow so I could spend a day with her. I politely told her no, but she guilt trips me about me never coming to see her. It’s not that I’m trying to be rude or have anything against her, I’m just not interested in leaving home right now.

I just graduated college and she knows I’m having a hard time looking for work and studying for my boards. She knows I don’t even have a car to drive to go see her. The last time I visited her was a month ago when she hosted a family dinner, and last time I seen her was last week when I went with her to run errands.

It would be nice to get out of the house for a quick break, but knowing her, one day will turn into a week and before I know it I’ve lost time to get any studying done. Sometimes she’ll drag me to go places with her and most times I don’t feel like going, usually to see other family which I honestly don’t care too much to be around. I’m from a big family and some members can be gossipy. She is one of them and I absolutely cannot stand it. And some conversations I have with her can be frustrating. She will ask or talk to me about certain subjects that I rather not discuss. Even if I’m polite about what I say, she will still shove her opinions at me, or swear that I’m being hard-headed or disrespectful.

I get that family is important and Lord knows I love her and all, but sometimes I want my space and now is the time I really need it. I’m taking my boards for the second time soon and I really need to be focused. For these reasons, would it be wrong if I don’t want to spend time with my mom right now?",13Sep2020,6
152,"I’m a 20 year old girl who has never been in a serious relationship before. About three weeks ago, I met this guy on Tinder who pretty much had the same interests and life as me (he had only been in one short relationship before but claims that it didn’t really “count”), so obviously we hit it off right away. I loved talking to him through text and he felt the same. We talked every single day until we met yesterday in person for the very first time. We agreed to have sex the first time we saw each other purely because me and him both envisioned that our first meeting would be perfect and that we would automatically click. This caused us to also look way too ahead into the future and we found ourselves thinking long term even though we haven’t even met yet.

Yesterday was our first meeting. However, I purely think we were both just in it for the sex even though we said we wanted more with each other. He told me that he felt we didn’t really vibe, and I kind of agreed with that too. The majority of the date was just us having sex and we minimally talked. Obviously, it was nothing like we had envisioned it to be. 

Although I know for a fact that we didn’t really have that “spark”, I’ve still been feeling a little down. I’m confused and don’t know if I actually still really like the guy, or I’m just upset that the relationship that I’ve built in my head for three weeks just went down the drain. I guess it just sucked because I was close to having a relationship for the first time but now I don’t think it’s possible. He is a nice guy, and I am considering just being friends with benefits with him. Would this be a good move? I am someone who gets emotionally attached, but considering that I’ve never had this sort of dilemma in my life I’m just confused as to what I’m really feeling at the moment.",13Sep2020,1

I live on the top floor of a 3-floor apartment building. For the past 2 years it's been wonderful. The neighborhood has been very peaceful and quiet. Everybody (for the most part) keeps to themselves and overall it's been a pleasant experience. Recently (as in last week) a Latino family moved in down-stairs. I've already had to call the cops on them for noise-complaints. At 12AM-1AM they are outside on their patio, blasting Spanish music all hours of the night. The cops come, tell them to quiet down, and as soon as the cops are gone they crank it back up. They're kids are playing and screaming bloody murder. I don't mind the music or the kids playing, I actually like the lively atmosphere it brings....before 10 PM. After 10 PM I'm a different person. I need my sleep. Me and my Fiance both work retail and sleep is very important to us. What do I do about this? Ever since they've moved in life has been a living hell, and my performance at work is slipping due to the lack of sleep. I've tried ear-plugs, but they don't help much and it angers me that I have to use them to begin with. The sad part is I've started blasting White Noise in our bedroom, and because their music is bass-heavy, we can hear them over it.

166,"I (21ftm) just broke up with my partner (23mtf) even though I still love her because because my family often showed concern about some red flags. We live an hour apart and I would always have to drive over for the past few months cuz there’s something wrong with her license + her car doesn’t work well and she only just got the chance to have it all fixed, meaning I would have to put in way more effort just to spend time with her according to my family. If I missed a few texts she would text 10 times in a row like “Are you mad at me?”, “Whatever it was I’m sorry”, or “Please text back I’m worried” even if it had just been a few hours since we last spoke and I had told her that I would let her know if I was mad at her (she’s on the autism spectrum and can’t always tell what other people are feeling). She would also sometimes text me to ask if I was dating anyone else cuz she “couldn’t believe I chose her” and it kept happening even after I assured her that she was the only person I’m dating. My family (including my sister who is also autistic) said that even if it wasn’t on purpose she was being manipulative. She also withheld some major info about her past earlier in the relationship because she didn’t want to scare me away but it honestly changed how I view her in a way and I wish she’d been more upfront about it instead of adding a lot of stress to the relationship.

Despite everything I still love her but my family kept pointing out what they said were red flags and it all just freaked me out. I just broke up with her and she said she wanted me to stay but it was ultimately my decision while crying. I talked with my mom afterwards about it and said she didn’t realize how much I love her and that it could maybe still work out even though my mom was one of the people to point out all the (valid?) problems in our relationship. Now I’m crying too wondering if I fucked up and let my family get in my head. Should I go back and try to apologize or should I do my best to move on from a possibly unhealthy relationship?

I worked through the summer and my productivity wasn’t great but I always got the job done, sometimes late. About a month ago, I was assigned a project at work that I was overwhelmed with from the beginning. Working as an intern from home was very difficult since I still have a lot to learn, it is much different than being in the office surrounded by people I could ask questions. This is the project that would lead me to get fired. The thought of even starting the work would cause so much anxiety I’d feel sick, and I would deal with it by avoiding. I couldn’t force myself to do it even though I knew the deadline was coming. My boss emailed me asking what progress I had made and I lied and told him I was having problems with the program, and he replied telling me the project was being taken over by someone else. Then today I got an email saying my last day at the company will be on Friday. I hate myself. I did this completely to myself and I knew what I was doing while I avoided my work, but it felt like my anxiety was controlling me. I feel like I have no self discipline. I’m going to schedule a psychiatrist appointment on Monday to discuss starting an antidepressant, I talked about it with my therapist prior to being fired and this was the push I needed to finally schedule the appointment.

I was filled with shame for a few weeks, but as more and more time passed it has gotten a lot better. Looking at it rationally, the possibility of this one little thing I did getting back to me are so small I shouldn’t be worrying about it, especially since it’s been over a month since it happened. However, whenever someone treats me remotely differently I way overthink. For example, yesterday someone unfollowed me on instagram and I basically went into panic mode thinking they somehow found out. Once I calmed down I realized that that’s definitely not the case, but that was after I had an anxiety attack. Similar things to this have happened a couple other times as well. Does anyone have any tips on preventing this overthinking and moving on? This one moment and one mistake has seeped into my conscious for over a month, and I just want to move on but I keep on getting anxiety over it.",13Sep2020,1
183,"Second year college student here, and I made a group of friends freshman year. It’s only been a few weeks of college, but I feel like my friendship with this group has been meh recently, because I have realized how different we are. 

I moved over 2,000 miles to go to college for a really good program for my major, and most people in this program are out of state students as well. My friend group is all in state, they’ve all grown up in our colleges city, go to school in the same city, and they want to stay here after graduation. Also some of our ideas on politics and outlooks on life are very different. 

This is totally fine because I understand being close to family is a want by many, and being far away from home can be hard for people. I also think it’s good to meet, and befriend people who are not the same as you! I just find myself realizing more and more everyday how different we are, and I don’t feel like I click with then as much as I used to. 

I’ve recently been becoming better friends with people in my major, because I feel like our goals and ideas about life are much more similar. So is it wrong of me to “outgrow” my freshman friend group and put less effort into those friendships? I feel like we don’t have anything in common and that I don’t “fit in.”

My mother and father loved each other, however my father was NOT  a good husband by any means necessary. He never hit my mom or cheated no nothing like that. His faults, the reason they eventually split up, a decision my mother made n father had no choice but to except, was bc he absolutely did not do anything to help my mother.

If my mom would have just left, I feel like I wouldn't be as empathetic as am I'm to the bs I constantly put up with. I watched her give chance after chance.

190,"Hi all. I'm a math teacher and am currently in grad school to continue my education (aka I need the pay bump). In one of our online discussion postings another math teacher talked about their experiences with Pi Day and etc in their course. The entire time they keep referring to Pi as approx 3.18, even going as far as to say their kids ""never forget March 18th.""

I tried to pass it off as a typo, but the entire post continues to post Pi as 3.18. There are only 6 of us in this online course and the professor is a former math teacher as well (course is unrelated to math, it just so happens this other person also teaches math).

I want to tell them in a way that does not attract too much attention but makes them realize they have a major typo. I want to tell them because I would want someone to tell me, especially if my professor was also a math teacher.

I've tried looking up their email but there is none listed on their profile and the course communication system is not enabled for this class (can't send DMs).

At the moment I posted a reply about how I too love Pi Day and how I was sad March 14th was a Saturday that the kids wouldn't experience, especially since that's the weekend our school system shut down for COVID.

P.S. I recently came out around a month ago as pansexual but my oldest brother (bisexual) and my cousin (straight AF) said I'm not old enough to know my sexuality and to just identify as bi since I won't get as much backlash and it is angering since they're practically telling me its a phase even though I've been in the closet for a while ( around a year ago I realized I was pansexual but I've known I was attracted to females for around 4 years) I've known munchkin for 6 years And we have been dating since Feb and I'm scared to tell certain people to cause of the fact they'll be mad I didn't tell them or the fact that they won't believe I actually love munchkin since I'm 'too young' and I'm fricking scared.

194,"So for the past 2 years my friend has been telling everyone that she got into medical school; everyone in her life: her parents, her boyfriend, her friends all think she's in her second year of med school. Her lie was so convincing I believed it for the last two years her being in med school was part of her identity. There would be times where she would subtly brag about it and bring it up in totally unrelated conversation (for example any time I would need to do something that needs steady hands she would insist she should do it since she has the hands of a future surgeon). She even gives medical advice when her friends and family are sick. She would come up with interesting anecdotes that happened in class, tell us stuff about her classmates and even tell me about the research labs she's worked in.

&amp;#x200B;

It has always seemed a little strange that she was in med school since even in undergrad I never seen her study she always seems to have a lot free time to hang out/go on vacations. My other friends in med school seem to be always studying and never have free time. Even I don't have as much free time as her and I'm not even in medicine my program is no where near as rigorous, in fact there were times she would be confused why I was so busy for weeks during exam season in her words ""why are you socially crippled every time exam season comes around"" which amazed me because it's like she has no idea what it's like being a student yet she's supposed to be in med school. Another thing that made me suspicious is that a mutual friend of mine who actually is in med school says he never saw her once not even ran into her between classes in two years. There was always this suspicion in the back of my head that something was off but I chalked it up to maybe she's just sharp and doesn't need to study as much and my other friend just so happened to be in different classes for every class and they coincidently never ran into each other. 

&amp;#x200B;

Recently while my friend was at my house she was doing something on her laptop and left it open while she went to the bathroom; I looked at the screen and she had her school account open. I know this was wrong of me to do but I guess curiosity go the better of me and I looked at her transcripts and I saw that not only is she not in med school she didn't even graduate undergrad, in fact she got suspended in her 2nd year for having a gpa that was too low. I'm not mad or anything that I've been lied to for so long I guess it doesn't really effect me in any way and in general she's a good friend it just feels super weird sometimes because she doesn't know I know that it's all a lie and she's still telling her anecdotes about her classes in 'med school' and the research she's been doing and I have to pretend to believe her and go along with it.  The only thing that she does that actually pisses me off a little bit is that she talks shit about a mutual friend of ours who graduated and can't find a job because I guess she wasn't proactive enough about talking to her professors/making connections; but the thing is at least she graduated who is she to talk shit about her but I guess this also doesn't really affect me in any way.  

&amp;#x200B;

I guess my question here is what should I do about this? I feel like if I tell her I know she's lying because I looked at her private documents she's going to hate me and it was definitely wrong of me to do that. Having said that this is pretty self destructive behaviour. Eventually her family is going to find out that she's not in med school and flunked out of school and that she lied to them for years and it's all going to go downhill from there I don't even know what her boyfriend will think of this when it all comes out eventually. She is quite close to me and I don't want to see her get hurt by this behaviour but I also can't confront her directly without her knowing I violated her privacy so what should I do?

195,"* ""Advice Received"" but I'm still up to hear some more opinions and suggestions*

I'm still 18 but we've been together for almost 2 years now and, we're really close up until Quarantine happened. She used to live downtown since it was closer to school but since quarantine she's moved back to her bigger house 40-60mins outside of town and the only way for me to get there without spending a ton of money is buy a monorail system which takes me around 2hrs a day to get there.

I was fine to travel that far for that amount of time because it was worth it you know? So since quarantine started and graduation, we haven't gotten to see each other much since my parents restaurant  was on the brink of collapsing since there are no customers left as of quarantine. Which meant I had to help in the restaurant and take over the restaurant for them, in order for them to find another income stream while I work the 9-5 every single day except for Tuesday which is my day off. And my girlfriend happened to also be involved with a business her mom is working on which consumers a lot of her time so we barely even see each other, let alone even talk. I still love her very much but I feel that time away from each other has caused her to lose her reliance on me, therefore she doesn't talk to me about her problems anymore but rather texts me once in the evening maybe about where she is or what she's doing, which at the very least is fine but once it's like that for 3-4 months then it gets annoying you know.

As it goes on, she talks to me less, doing her own thing, facing her own problems, but I don't want her to face it alone. Around 2.5 years ago her dad cheated on her mom and she's been in her own little shell since, it was very hard to get her to talk to me about her in general, and she's the type of girl who's independent and doesn't like to ask people for help with anything personal. For a really long time I used to be 'that guy' people turned to for help you know, I knew every little secret about everyone in my year (dw I don't get close to ppl to gain their darkest secret). I love helping people because it became what I was good at. Anyway, she's been battling court cases filed by her dad all year long putting her in a very stressful position all the time, and I try my best to help. I go all out on any special dates, valentine's, anniversary, national girlfriend's day just because I think she deserves it and I love her.

The most recent disappearance of her was this week where she didn't talk to me for 5 days, and this stage I know she's doing her own thing and I let her cuz she'll talk to me when she can right? Right, so I talk to her mom out of concern for my gf (I'm really close with her family and they're practically my family, I treat her siblings like my siblings and her mom like my mom too), her mom lets me know everything is good with her but she's just been a bit quiet and doing her own thing cuz she's stressed about the business, I have no idea if she was just covering up the bigger situation which is that my gf's dad is dying or not but today I learnt that her dad is in a critical state of I don't know what. She called me whilst crying telling me to leave her alone. I don't know what to do, I want to help her but I know she'll get mad if I try anything.

Sorry for the really long post! I just felt that context and background was necessary.

Note: Yes, I have been letting her know that I'm here for her, I've been letting her know since the beginning of our relationship. I just need some advice and I need to know if I'm being a shitty boyfriend or not if she tells me to leave her alone.

She's never been the type to ask for help so I want to give it without her asking. I'm thinking about going over to her house on my day off to surprise her with snacks and flowers. But I've tried smth like that before when she lived downtown and it took a while before she let me in (this was during the court cases). I want to leave her alone as she says but I don't know if she'll ever come back to me and I can't lose her guys, I really can't.",13Sep2020,1

197,"

I really love my friends. I’ve never had a group of gay friends before and they welcomed me with open arms. I felt like we were getting close and everyone once in a while they will say hi if I message them or if I comment on a post. They aren’t really rude either. Honestly they are very loving when they can be. I’m also younger then them, not by much but enough to where I feel like the little brother I guess (my own words not theirs). 

Recently though I’ve noticed that there has been distance between us. I thought it was because of quarantine but that hasn’t stopped them from hanging out with each other. I honestly would usually complain, but it seems that the actively don’t invite me to things. 

They throw pool parties and Tahoe cabin trips and go to dinners. I thought it might be because I’m not reaching out enough, but even when I do it either ignored or it “ we just saw this/left. “ One tome I invited them to a cabin in Tahoe for my birthday and they declined only to be going to a cabin in Tahoe that same weekend. 

I’m always the type of friend that gives 100% because I believe that if I care about you I care about you and they led me to believe the same. Given that we are in quarantine my mental health has been wrecked and I really wish my friends were there for me like they are for each other at the drop of a hat. 

I want to talk to them about it but I feel like asan adult I should really care because it might not even be about me. I really care about this group of people and don’t want to ever annoy them or be a pest because they have never given me a reason to doubt them being my friends before. 

Should I talk to them or should I just leave it alone?Or should I just cut my losses. (Ps we’re in the same circle of performers and dance company’s so it’s not like I wouldn’t ever see them again it just would only be professional) ( pps they are on a trip together and again didn’t ask if I would like to go or anything)

207,"Content warning - mental health struggles, suicidal ideation

My (21F) little sister (17F) has been having a really rough time of it lately. She’s super close to being done with high school, which has been a struggle in general, but online schooling + ADHD has made things a nightmare. She has to sit in online classes for about seven hours a day, plus additional homework, and she spends most nights sobbing about how miserable she is. She can’t focus, can’t keep up with classwork or hobbies, and can barely sleep. I’m honestly incredibly terrified that she’ll do something to herself while I’m away at school (I go to college nearby, home on the weekends). I’ve been having nightmares about it almost every night. She’s attempted suicide twice in the past, though neither attempt was actually life threatening. 

I try to be supportive, and so do my parents. She’s on medication for ADHD + depression, but her last meds gave her awful side effects, so she’s still in the process of transferring over to the new stuff.  Her school is completely unhelpful, and even though she has a 504, a good number of her teachers straight up ignore her accommodations. She’s in therapy, though it doesn’t seem to help. We’re looking for a new person.

I don’t know what we should do. Could she take a year off &amp; come back to school when distance learning is over? Should she just drop out and get her GED? Im worried that not attending school at all might make her depression worse, since she might go back to just sleeping all day.

We hung out almost every day outside of work. After a few years he left the job and only spoke with me a few times over text and we did hang out a few times over the months but we slowly grew apart and eventually have not communicated in about 4-5 years. He was never a good texter and he’s not on any social media except reddit but I don’t know his username. I am unsure if he has the same phone number but he’s had the same number since he got a phone so I feel like it’s most likely the same. I did text him a year back but he never replied. A few months ago I accidentally found out where his brother works I wasn’t sure it was him until after I left so now my predicament is, should I go back to where his brother works and ask his brother to get him to call/text me or should I try calling him and hope he’s willing to talk? 
I don’t want to do both because I don’t want him to feel like I’m harassing him but we were friends and we don’t have any bad blood between us that I aware of.

213,So I needed to purchase Cengage Unlimited for my college course. The price of it was pretty expensive so I decided to purchase it through another website. Since I am too naive I thought I was getting a good deal and proceeded purchase the Unlimited. Now I am being asked by the website to send them my Cengage account's email and password in order to activate it as well as prevent fraud. I sent them the information and an automated email sent me to also send a screenshot of the transaction statement for proof of purchase. Now I am stuck with deciding what to do and if what I am doing is even legal. Please Help.,13Sep2020,1
215,"I’m 17 and have only smoked weed a handful of times. Last time was about a year ago and I had a really bad trip. It felt like I was losing control of myself, as if I’d made a horrible mistake that I should feel guilty about, and that I’m trapped. For like 6 months after that, I felt disconnected from reality and had constant panic attacks. Ever since then I’ve been too scared to get high. I’ve told my friends I’m not comfortable and they completely respect that, but I really want to get over this and be able to experiment with things like shrooms or at least be able to occasionally smoke a joint with some friends. 


Even when I started drinking at a get together the other day ( i was a little tipsy) I started getting very anxious and having a panic attack. It went away when I started socializing with others.... I trusted the people I was with. I don’t know if it would’ve gone away so quickly if i had drank more. 

I just want to be able to get drunk without be anxious of stuff like that. I could always not drink, I know that, but I really want to beat this anxiety. Can anyone help me?",13Sep2020,1

218,"Good morning redditors, was looking for some input.

Ever since high school I have been saying I eventually want to become an electrical lineman. I was applying everywhere I could to get a foot in the door to work my way up from the groundman position. 

I had tried out being a groundman a couple months ago. I moved out to Tennessee and it turned out to be a bust. I was stuck in a trailer with 5 others and couldn’t pull through the month I was supposed to work with them. They didn’t work for a company, it was redneck to say the least. 
I had problems with the amount of privacy I received &amp; the amount of work I had to do without proper training. I Never got paid for the little work I did for them either. 

Fast forward to now and I was hired in as a CDL driver by a delivery company  that seems to do pretty well.  I could work an honest living here -I don’t hate it. Been working there under a month. Room for growth. 

Last week while at work I got a call from a prestigious lineman company in my area and they want to have me come in and check the place out. 
I am confident that this company has much more structure than the lineman crew I was in with last. I would be properly trained and actually get paid.

I am really torn on what to do. 
I plan to go in and scope the lineman company out to see if it’s a better fit than the last crew I worked with. Maybe talk to some workers there to see how they like it and what their responsibilities are within the company, 
However there are a couple factors keeping from jumping ship from my current job. 

I want to be loyal to my Delivery company, I don’t hate it there. They put me on pretty quick and have been nothing but good to me the short time I’ve worked there. I feel like a dick for even considering leaving as they’ve just put me on and bought me uniforms that are still coming in the mail. 

I don’t know if I will end up hating being a groundman once again. Taking a crap in peace is very important to me!! having some alone time is up there as well and I got neither of those things while working as a groundman. 

I’m torn between being comfortable at my current place - or being a dick by jumping ship for an opportunity to maybe make a lot more cash in the long run. No doubt the delivery company won’t take me back after me ditching them so quick.

219,"    Hello! I am a 24 yr. old female who has been dealing with heart palpitations for the last four years. Most of that time it has not been a huge problem. I do know for alot of people it is completely normal and nothing to worry about. Through most of the years I would just have one or two skipped heat beats or flutters a week. Maybe less. 
    The last month has been kinda rough though... My heart has been skipping beats/fluttering between 20-40 times a day. I ended up going to my doctor and she has taken me seriously (thankfully) and has gotten me a heart monitor patch (zio) to watch what it will be doing for the next two weeks. Though she told me it was probably premature beating of ethier my lower heart channel or my upper one. Pvc I think is what she said? 
    I have anxiety here and there but as of late I haven't had any emotional anxiety. I'm not sure if maybe it's manifesting physically? As I know alot of the times your body feels the anxiety before you do (in some cases for some people). And really nothing has changed for me. I drink coffee maybe 4 out of 7 days and it's usually only a few sips as I am very sensitive to caffeine. Though I haven't been drinking it while having this patch on me so it can be as accurate as possibly. 
  ** What I wanted to ask here was if anyone else here has day to day heart palpitations and how they deal with it?  Obviously most of you are probably not doctor's. But I would just like the comfort of talking to others about it because I haven't found anyone around me with this problem.
   I'm hoping this mini heart monitor will help get to the bottom of things and my doctor can give some suggestions. But I just started my first two weeks and it's going to be some time till they can evaluate the results. It's just so annoying and uncomfortable. I'd love to find ways to ease it. Thanks ♥️",13Sep2020,1
220,"I'm 21yo, virgin and never had a gf. In case anyone thinks I'm a creep or something: I don't have any big problems regarding self esteem, I don't hate myself, I have things to do in life, I have hobbies and passions, I have some friends, etc etc. I only felt the urge to ask a girl out once in highschool but I got rejected, and then proceeded to never try that out again. It's not a problem of low confidence, I just don't work like that, I learned that it's best for me to get to know people well before trying something like that again (if I'm seeking a relationship). I never used any dating apps because I wouldn't fit in, I don't even take pictures.

The thing is: lately I've been feeling lonely and I've been craving sex like real bad, to the point of considering all the effort around dating apps just to bang someone. I don't like this version of myself, this desperate one. I've always been the hopeless romantic type (no wonder i'm a virgin lmao), but lately I couldn't help but be a complete horndog, and I don't like that. I even exchange nude pics with random girls online now and then just to have a peek of the real thing. Yea, it's sad.

Now, the problem. for the past three years I have been sitting in the back of the classroom saying absolutely nothing and understanding nothing, it seems like everything the teacher says goes straight through me. I haven’t done any work in the class for these past years, and I feel I can no longer understand the language (mainly reading and writing).

239,"Typically I'm an introvert that doesn't bother much with being social, especially in a work setting, but one of my coworkers that I used to be very close to has suddenly started to exclude me from everything without anything I can think of to prompt it.

My shift at work consists of around 4 people including myself. I used to be very close to my team lead but as she's gotten closer with our other coworkers it's as if she's actively trying to make me feel left out while becoming more buddy buddy with them. She jokes with them and sends them messages but she's stopped doing the same with me. On break she'll show everyone at the break table things on her phone but only avoid showing me. If I send her things my messages get ignored unless it's about work. Everyone is active in group chat but I was never invited to join, they've also stopped inviting me out to places. She will also bring coffee for the whole shift except me. Not that I care about the coffee, but it's so awkward watching her hand out drinks to everyone on the shift while I'm just standing there pretending like I'm still everyone else's equal. 

Other than this she still talks to me normally when it has to do with work related things, so it doesn't seem like she's upset with me over anything, it's just like my significance to her as anything other than a subordinate has vanished. It wouldn't hurt so much if we weren't practically best friends before.

I've tried reaching out to her and my other coworkers. I've tried to make plans but get consistently flaked out on the day of. Whenever I offer coffee or food my offers get declined. On a few occasions I've brought in things only for no one to want any of it anyway. I just don't understand what is wrong with me.

I guess I'm looking for advice on how to cope. I've tried to mend the relationship and I continue to try to reach out more to my other coworkers, but otherwise it seems I will never be apart of this group again. Seeing everyone walking to each other's station and laughing like they're all best friends while I'm the only one being ignored is starting to affect my work performance. I get so depressed it's hard to think and it hurts for the entire day, even when I'm at home and away from it all. I just want to do my job and be able to ignore how badly people ignore me. Our shift is still the most productive and we all still work very well together as a team, it's just they do it while laughing and smiling with one another and I'm no longer a part of that, though I try to be.

Anyway sorry for going on so much. If you read all this then thank you very much. I figure without a lot of context this post just looks like I'm being a whiny baby, maybe I still am, but it doesn't erase how much it hurts.

I feel like alienating myself even more but I also feel like that will make the problem worse. I stick around just to avoid making things even more awkward and with the hope that one day I'll be seen as normal again. I try very hard to focus on my work, remain friendly to everyone, and not care, but deep down it's messing with my head like crazy. 

Tldr: I used to be very close with my coworkers, now I'm the only one who is treated differently and actively left out of everything. I just want to do my job without constantly feeling devastated over blatant alienation.",13Sep2020,1

242,"To tell a long story short one of my closest friend groups is leaving me feeling very decisive in general,especially one friend in particular. Before I continue on let me elaborate on the details of this group , in total their is six of us,five boys,one girl. We all are the same age and almost all of us go to the same high school. We come from somewhat diverse backgrounds and talk almost everyday. To an extent we all fill certain rolls within this group,personally I am likely the most academically advance and most of the people if not all of them regard me as “the smart one.” In general apparently I am also thought of as “wise”. While I don’t entirely agree with this assessment I try to be helpful and offer what I can in terms of support. If per say someone is struggling with a history assessment I will try to help them,if someone is having a moral dilemma I try to help them. Recently over these past few months however something has personally been affecting me. One of the people in the group,let’s call him Kyle,has been causing me and the group significant conflict.

   Kyles behavior is honestly very strange to say the least. One of our activities that we partake the most in is video games since we can all participate and in general it tends to be fun,that is when Kyle isn’t playing. I don’t want to totally discredit the man,he can be fun and honestly on the surface this may seem trivial however given recent events gaming is one of the only ways we can connect and he frankly ruining it. If he loses he goes on long tangents of insults and derogatory comments directed as his opponent,he will claim the game is pivoted against him and that it’s all “bullshit”. We don’t even play really competitive games,mostly just Minecraft and some other widely available games,despite this he will literally violently threaten others just because he lost. If all he was doing was raging on games this wouldn’t be much of an issue however his rampant behavior goes far beyond that. In general he is extremely polarizing and hypocritical,if he isn’t having a good time intentionally or not he will make it so nobody can have a good time. He is constantly complaining about how supposedly sensitive liberals are and how no one can take a joke yet when someone teases or mocks him in the slightest he reacts with aggression and hostility. He has gone as far as removing people from our group chat and outright refusing to speak to them over petty disagreements. Furthermore while I don’t desire to make this very political I must include my disdain for his views. He is extremely transphobic,possibly racist and claims that “I am almost always telling the truth of the matter,if you don’t like it then you can’t deal with reality.” The few times he does change his beliefs he acts like he never thought otherwise and will outright deny that he ever held different notions. In summary Kyle is generally toxic,possibly racist and extremely transphobic,hates socialism and has decreed any socialists to be “gay f##s”. The worst part is that not only is this the tip of the iceberg in terms of his behavior but how he handles it when people call him out. He will either simply sit their and admit his problems,say he will %100 work on getting better and then proceed to do absolutely nothing or he will make it into a long drawn out argument in which he will alienate the entire group and play the victim. I have talked to everyone behind closed doors about these problems and they agree they are horrific and we need to do something however no one knows what to really do. As much as I hate this behavior we are some of his only friends and honestly I don’t know if everyone would be totally up for kicking him out.",13Sep2020,1

247,"To sum it up, my neighbors parent was living with them. The parent kept parking in front of (mine and my significant others) house. Some days the neighbors parent would park in a way that my SO could also park there. Other days , the parent would park 2 inches differently, causing my SO to park down the street and walk home at night. I understand I’m not the owner of the street but one day I asked them if the parent could park in same area everyday so my SO could also park in front of our house. The neighbor told me the parent had bad legs and needed to be there. I explained that I didn’t want them to move , just move up a couple inches like other days. It got weird.

They told me their parent would pull behind their house and they would park down the street and walk. I said “ that’s not what I’m asking, most days they park a couple inches up, that’s all I am asking for” and they just kept saying don’t worry about it. Again I know I am not the owner of the street, I am just asking if the parent moved up a few inches, we all could park there. 

The parent has moved out and now the neighbors are very cold to us. We used to talk and everything. Now they come outside and won’t look our way. I’m confused on how to approach this. If at all.

248,"Hello,

So I'm a Sophomore in college now (19M, Zoom university) and I have this question about physical affection. Basically I come from a small town and I've had the same large(15 people?) co-ed friend group for quite some time and they're all super physically affectionate and I hug my people pretty much every time I see them. My family never did this with me (they are pretty cold to be quite honest) so my ground rules for physical affection just got set in the last \~4 years.

Then I went to college and formed a new somewhat large(10 people?) co-ed friend group. After about 3-4 months of knowing them I felt kinda comfortable and as I was walking one of the girls home (dorm across campus) I asked if I she was okay with hugs and she suddenly got super flustered and was like ""no I'm tired"" and practically ran up the stairs and I was like gee okay guess no hugs for her then. But the issue is that all the girls of the group have their own group chat and I guess they talked (no idea what they said) so now whenever I mention how I'm a hugger to any of them or ask them what they think is normal in terms of physical affection between friends they get really weird and squirmy and I just think to myself ""okay I should just stop talking about this or trying"" and so now I'm in an awkward zone.

Basically I wanna know: was that scenario just a fluke and it's kinda normal to hug friends who are into it, or is it just not chill at all and I should stop all the hug proceedings forever

\*Disclaimer\*

I am away from school right now and due to covid I don't plan on hugging anyone anytime soon so I'm just trying to figure this out for the distant future when there's no more virus.

TL;DR: girls in my friend group think I'm weird because I asked one if I could hug her, is it me or is it them?

i can feel myself getting dangerously close to my breaking point and i know because I've been the before. i have been clean from selfharming for about two months maybe and i am trying so hard not to shut down. when i shut down I sleep all day. lately I've been having anxiety and panic attacks several times a day, I can't stop crying, I've been very emotional and high strung... I can't sleep at night and I have been needing like twelve hours of sleep to feel somewhat rested. Whenever i try to ""relax"" i have anxiety attacks because i cant stop think about all the work im missing. my depressed state and anxiousness is amplified because i put so much value on my academics because its the only thing im good at 

please, idk what i should do im so scared. I cant get therapy because of the price and i dont want to bother my parents. They also believe i make everything up when it comes to my mental health so im waiting until im 18 in december to hopefully seek some options.

idk how to not essentially self combust. each day I feel myself getting closer and closer to doing something to myself just to breathe again and I have no one in my life to go to so how can I self soothe but also not waste time. i have never been so overwhelmed in my entire life. i am having an attack right now as I type this :( even if you don't gave advice, kind words would be so appreciated. i really hunger for validation but i dont get a lot of it verbally so that would help too. thanks for even reading this, sorry if this is stupid but i have no one to talk to",13Sep2020,1
253,"I actually posted on AmItheAsshole because the literal thought on my mind was WIBTA but turns out it wasn't the place so I guess here is more suitable? Anyway,

I've been fostering sick cats back to health during my college years then helping them get adopted or if they're capable of taking care of themselves, free them again. 2 years ago found a stray kitten eyes terribly infected so were practically blind, took him in, managed to save one eye but because he was a regular tabby with one eye blind, nobody wanted him. He was way too trusting to humans (and animals as well) also winter was around the corner so I couldn't bring myself to leave him to streets again.

The thing is, he is the sweetest ball of fur and a terrible nightmare at the same time. Absolutely loves cuddling, demands to lay on my arm and hug me when he's sleepy, pretty vocal that we can hold up conversations and really friendly with anything that's alive. But also way too hyperactive (really the first time I adressed a cat like that) gets bored way too easily thus destroys me and the house until I let him out. This was fine when I was in college because my neigborhood had safe backyards so I could let him out and when I called out to him he would dash back to me anyway. But now I'm finished with the college, back to my parents house and I don't have the luxury to let him out at all. He protests this way too strongly and I'm a mess. No matter how much I play with him, it's not enough. My other cat is not enough. He started destroying even my wallpaper out of frustration and at night once he slept enough he searches for the heaviest object to push down so he can give me a heart attack in my sleep. (also meowing nonstop, continuing to push down the other things he can find) I'm a doctor now, will soon start my 24 hour shifts in ER and already have sleeping problems so his extra effort to destroy my sleep will sooner or later affect me. The only possible solution I can find is to let him out to my grandmother's backyard but she lives a little far from us and would never let him in so he'd have to be a full time outdoor cat. If I do this I'll visit him daily for his food etc and will still bring him to the vet for his appointments but there's no guarantee that he'll stay there and I really really love him so.. I'm at loss. His behaviour is terrible when he's bored but other than that he's fine. I've tried so many different things these past 2 years but couldn't manage to find a solution so yeah, even though I don't want to, even though he's not happy with staying at home 24/7, would it be an asshole move if I were to let him out permanently on my grandmother's place since he was more or less an indoor cat before?",13Sep2020,1
254,"Yesterday, I joined Pinterest for the first time, just downloaded it and made an account. Then I was messaged by someone out of nowhere and I responded. It started normal with them speaking very bad english. 

Then it slowly turned to him asking my age after asking if I had a boyfriend. He told me he was 20 and then I told him I’m 13. 

That’s when he started asking me if I masterbate, then roleplaying touching my private and asking if I wanted to see his genitals. I said no and asked him to stop.

I don’t know why I didn’t block him and end the conversation, but I let it go on until I just told him please don’t message me anymore and blocked him. I took screenshots of everything and posted those and got a lot of attention on there, lots of support and love from them. 

I still have those screenshots but I need to know if there’s any online support groups on like discord or something.",13Sep2020,1
255,"Summary of my issue.  
Alright so i have reach a point where my reliable friends that i could hang out with most of the time have either moved an hour away (not a major problem but gas a killer) and the other has either to many friends and i am low on the priority list, to lazy to do much, or to down to act the same way he did before the year 2020. So overall i am needing a new friend thats a bit closer.

If you want to know more about the 2 friends in detail read here:

1. Moved an hour away: Me and this friend has known each other since elementary school and he is the 1 of the only friends i regularly talk to and see from those years. all of his and mine intrest match up so this friendship isn't ending any time soon just because of an hr move. we can find days to hang out just the drive and how late we want to hang can be a little ify. other than that no problems here.
2. Down/Lazy/To many friends/older friend: So as you can see this friend has quite a bit of issues. i met this friend in college but there is a 15-20 year difference in age here. he has kids, was in the military, and doesn't need to work for various reasons (he gets enough money to live bachelor style and provide for the kids well enough). every other week he doesn't have the kids not that them being there is much of an issue (there are nights were we will go out even though he has the kids). they are roughly middle school going on to high school age range so they can be self sufficient as well. Me and this friend have a good number of similar interest. where me and this friend differ is eating habits and physical activity. I eat shit and don't go outside. he goes to the gym and tries to eat healthy. the issue with this friend is that lately he has been saying he is to busy, has a headache and doesn't want to hang out, or already made plans with another friend. there has also been times in the past where i make plans to hang out with him in advance and he cancels or leaves mid way though because another friend wants to hang out with him. this is how i know im pretty low on the priority list. I am always the one calling him to hang out never the other way around. if i honestly stopped talking him and showing up im pretty sure he wouldn't even check in. Me and him were also in the meetup group but ever since covid 19 he hasn't been wanting to go to it because he is afraid that everything will shut down again and it will just piss him off if he gets used to normalcy again. with all of this i am pretty much done with trying to make this friendship last and just leave it in the state its in.

Other activites i have:  
\- I do work and have co workers but none of them i see hanging out with outside of work.  
\- I have a Long distance relationship that won't be ending any time soon. the goal here is to eventually have this gapped closed but finishing school is a priority here. (Other side of the country long).  
\- I do play D&amp;D online with a group ive been with quiet awhile so its not that i don't have another activity its just i want a face to face friendship.  
\- I am part of a meetup group but past the meetup itself the people there don't quiet match what i am looking for in a decent friend.

New friend finding:  
This is where i need help. I have pretty much decided i need another friend to fill a gap of it just replace friend 2 all together.  
\- Looking at meetup groups or other groups online i have already done and just not that many to join.  
\- If going to a socially active bar was an option i would but i would also be there holding a soda sticking out like a sore thumb trying to figure out who to talk to that wont get so drunk that they will have their mind still intact. (I am ok with other people drinking reasonably. past that and the friendship probably wont last).  
\- Their interest should involve Board Games, Video Games, Anime, Board Games, D&amp;D, Board Games, and you see the point here.  
\- I am hoping they will at least be free once or twice a week.  
\- They have a place we can hang out at or at least ok with going to the board game cafe/bar i go to for meetups.

With that being said you might see why its hard to find a friend. I don't know about you but i don't know of many ways trying to meet a local board game nerd especially during covid 19... also i am in an area right now where wildfires are burning everything to the ground so added bonus there. Please if you have any suggestions ill take them. i just need to get out of my house and be social about once a week. board game meet up is every other week so even if this friend is only free every other week that would work.",13Sep2020,1
257,"I know this is kind of weird but I sometimes feel envious of my professors, particularly the tenured, middle aged ones, who went to college in the 80s and who have children and partners with equally interesting lives, who eat lunch with their colleagues in the department common room laughing and bonding over their passion for their literature (it’s an English department). I realize hard they worked to get there, and also acknowledge that they have their own struggles that I do not see. But I’m obviously never going to get there and sometimes it’s enough to make me want to hang myself because I’m so embarrassed that I at one point thought I was as good (potentially) as then. 

Whenever I’m around them at school I always just end up feeling vastly inferior to them, and also somehow so envious of them, so much so that it is almost embarrassing to be around them or look up to them. It’s like showing your poem to your favorite poet, or playing a song on the guitar in front of Van Halen. I know I should use it as an opportunity for growth but my stupid ego gets in the way. 

For instance, my favorite professor, whom I admire so much, whose job and life I’d love to emulate is just so much better than me, spent his college years working hard, winning prestigious awards and also having fun, dating, experimenting with drugs, rebelling against authority, making funny movies with his friends, going to nightclubs and drag shows, playing in a punk rock band and befriending more than a couple now-famous authors, artists, filmmakers. 

In contrast to him, I have spent most of my college years so far in my dorm room sleeping, crying, pacing or daydreaming; or in the library, into the late hours of the night, lost in some fantasy or delusion, studying and obsessing. But I’m not smart enough to make up for the fact that I’m awkward, friendless, insecure, overly impressionable, overly earnest, that I care too much, turn everything in late, have no social life and soak up every scrap of attention or praise I get from my professors like some kind of stray dog following them around. It’s really quite pathetic, from their point of view, my behavior. I can see it clearly now.

I should really stop feeling sorry for myself. I know I’m not that bad. I’m just not that great either. I’m ordinary. He’s extraordinary. They’re (my professors) all pretty extraordinary. It’s ok. I wanted to be extraordinary but I didn’t put in the work and it’s just not in the stars now. It’s ok. I’m taking myself too seriously.",13Sep2020,1
258,"I’m 23 years, fresh out of college, and I have no idea what to do with my life. Over the past few month I decided to move in with my Aunt in New Jersey from VA to study for the GRE. I was surprised to find out that I got pretty decent scores! Despite this, I have this grey cloud hanging over my head. I have no idea what do next and my family is constantly wanting me to rush into something. This is the biggest reason why I’m still in Jersey. My family here is very understanding, but I still get in my own head. It feels like once you get that diploma it’s time to put your big boy/girl pants on. Some people already have the pants on! I feel like mine are in the laundry room and I’m deciding which detergent to use. 

My options are find a job and eventually get funding to go to grad school OR go ahead and try to get into grad school. I’m an advertising major so most schools and jobs want to see my portfolio more than anything. If I’m being honest, I don’t have anything jaw dropping to put on my portfolio. I’ve been polishing a bunch of projects from school and my internship, but so far I haven’t heard from anyone. I know it’s not going to happen over night, but it’s hard to stay positive when your grandparents are calling everyone saying, “oh my god, he needs help! He doesn’t know what he wants to do in life! He should know!” Like, dude, I’m 23 and the world is literally burning. You expect me to figure it out in like a month?

Another thing is I’m extremely lonely. I love my family here, but I miss my friends and my sister. Maybe it’s just because we’ve all been quarantined for so long, but I’m starting to feel very alone here. I figure Philly (which is like a 20 min drive) will have so much opportunity, but so far I haven’t gotten a single thing. I’m starting to doubt it’s even worth it. Back home there’s even less opportunity, but god damn at least I have my friends and sister. The only thing is I hate living with Dad. He’s only ever made me more anxious about situations like this. 
This was more of a rant than I was expecting, but I wanted to get all the details down.

POSITIVE NOTE: there’s a dog here! AND I have gone from 50mg to 25mg nicotine over the summer and plan on quitting completely soon! Woo!",13Sep2020,2
259,"This sounds dumb 

Okay so I have always been close to girls And they kind of felt like a special little home to me at a young age. I never had an issue with boys I was friends with them but that was it. Well at the age of 7 I had a childhood trauma that caused me to be a bit more uncomfortable around guys. 
I got called a lesbian in middle school because I was quite fond of females and only hung out with girls. I went through a severe rejection of liking girls at all because it spread to my family. 

My mom has always wanted grandkids and at a young age I always thought that if I got married to a man I would be happy (even if I knew I wasn’t) and my parents would be proud. That and I have a pretty homophobic family (especially towards the trans community) even though my mom says she’s bi. 

Anyway, I could never see myself with a man sexually or romantically. I tried dating a guy and even when we “tried” kissing I felt weirdly grossed out and felt something was wrong. 

So I know this is a bit of a long post but I’m confused tbh. Because I mentioned this issue to a close friend and she said I’m not ACTUALLY attracted to women but rather just seeing it as a Convenience due to trauma that or I have “penis envy”

262,"Hi everyone, so I made an account because I can’t talk to anyone about this and I’m a reddit reader and thought this might be the best place.. I’m a 24-year-old female and I think I may have been sexually abused when I was little and repressed it. Any advice or people with similar circumstances would be appreciated. So here it goes:

When I was younger, probably about 4 or 5, I would get recurrent UTIs and yeast infections. From what I understand, no one ever knew why. Fast forward to age 9 or 10, I did something awful and I’ve felt guilty about it every day since. My brothers who were younger than me were all hanging out in the living room And I asked if I could show them something. Mind you, we were all clothed and I did not take off any or touch anyone. But I did straddle them and just rocked back and forth for a few seconds and said “this is what adults do to feel good”. I got no satisfaction from it or anything, I just thought I was showing them something. Nothing else happened then or after that. I’m really not a sicko- but I’ve always thought I must have been for doing that. But now I realize I should not have known that’s “what adults do to feel good” at that age. I grew up in a catholic home and didn’t watch anything inappropriate, so I doubt it was from tv exposure or anything like that. Fast forward to 2014. I’m 18 and meet a guy who is now my husband. I had never done anything sexual before him, just making out. I never felt comfortable doing anything other than that, I didn’t even like having boyfriends- but it just felt right and natural with him. Even though it felt right, for the next 6 month after or during sex I would cry. It was for no reason.. I wasn’t sad, didn’t regret it, I mean I loved him yes, but not enough to just straight up cry. So thinking about that now, paired with the previously mentioned things... I’ve been wondering if maybe I was abused, or molested. I truly, truly hope not. But I can’t speak of this without crying and I feel like if it didn’t happen, then I wouldn’t be so upset. Also, I have a history of suppressing things. My cousin who I spent 5 days a week with died when I was 12 and I can’t remember any memories before her funeral. Not a single one. So, yeah. Can anyone help me out here? :(",13Sep2020,3
263,"Hi! First time poster here, I could really use some advice.

I [F/22] have a friend (we’ll call him Steve [M19]) that has feelings for me, I’ve been in a relationship for a year and half with the man I swear I’m going to Marry. Steve doesn’t respect my relationship at all. He’s going around telling all my other friends that “he has feelings for me.” And “it’s all about the waiting game.” As in waiting for my relationship to end. I opened up to him about some very personal things (that I now regret but I can’t change the past) and I’m scared that he will tell our mutual friends. I never gave off the impression that my relationship was rocky or potentially going to end in the near future. 
I feel like he attempted to gaslight and manipulate me a couple of times, maybe he’s always been this way and I’m just realizing it now? I know I need to end this friendship but I’m not entirely sure how to do it. 

TLDR; friend is being a manipulative little shit and I need advice on how to cut him out of my life for good.

266,"I had my first part time job at the age of 15. It was pretty shitty cause my manager who was a 60+ year old karen would constantly berate me for not doing a good job. When reality is she only put in half the effort to teach me how to operate the store that i was working in (i was a sales assistant). i really tried my best by asking for help but everytime help was recieved it was accompanied by her talking shit about me with my other colleagues behind my back. It sucked sooo much as it was my first part time job and i experienced such shitty people in my workplace(but one guy was cool tho). It was a horrible experienced in general. But now that i am turning 18 this year i am thinking of getting another part time job but i am afraid things may go south real quickly.

Other things that happened during my first part time job. 
-Promised 1 hour break during my shift was cut short to 20 mins
-Manager constantly changing my shift.(I could be on my way to work and get a call from my manager saying i am going to be doing night shift when the previous day she said i would be doing morning shift)( i lived a good 1 hour from my workplace and public transport is not cheap if u are traveling back and forth for 6 days a week)

I need advice on how should i overcome this fear that i have or how can i minimise these things from happening if i get another part time job

269,"This has happened to me quite frequently the past year or so. It happens to me at work, at home, and out in public although not as much as at home. I end up scaring people without meaning to. I remember the first instance of this was when I was on my way to work a couple of months ago. I went around the corner and someone who was also turning the corner (that was a glass panel) saw me and screamed. I remember being confused but writing it off as being one weird contained incident but recently, there’s been multiple occasions like this. I remember this one incident that stood out to me where I was making cereal and my boyfriend’s mom walks into the kitchen and screams which in turn frightens me. She told me I scared her and that she thought I was the “Japanese ghost girl from the ring”. I was upset but faked it off as being just a silly incident. Now I’m living with my boyfriend’s Grandmother and there will be so many times where I’m washing dishes or walking out of the restroom and I end up freaking her out. And I know it’s because of how I look. Even one of her dogs will bark at me repeatedly making me feel worse. And then I think about that one time in high school where this kid said how he could never date an Asian girl because having long, black hair reminds him of the grudge. I personally love my long, black hair but I feel demonized. I’ve been told in the past by my uncle that I come in and out of the shadows like a ninja? I can disappear from any scene and I feel like I have a non-existent presence. I’m never noticed?

273,"I (19 m) just completely demolished my relationship with my partner (20m) by relapsing, and I couldn’t feel worse. 

Me and P met in middle school, I was the scrawny kid whom everyone picked on because my family sucked so bad the whole town knew us. P was a year ahead of me, and just moved here the year before, but rumor spreads fast when you have 7 siblings and 2 step siblings that are all pretty terrible and weird. P stood by me the very first day we met, kids were picking on me on the bus, calling me crack baby and f*g, chicken boy (I never understood that one). P was the only one who talked back to them. We were inseparable after that, when his dad got angry, we would go to the woods and stay in our treehouse. Sometimes my mom forgot to buy groceries so he would bring me food to school almost every day. We came out to each other coincidentally on the same day. He’s my love. 

My mother was an alcoholic, father a drug addict, it was pretty much inevitable that at least a few of us were gonna be pretty screwed up. My first addiction was cigarettes, I started smoking at age 12, Next was alcohol, age 13, I drank every morning and every night, 14 I started smoking weed, I never had a problem with it, but it all went downhill pretty fast. At 16 I dropped out, using heroin and cocaine all day, stealing to support my habits, selling to support my habits, but P stood by me, never enabling and always supporting, he always tried to push me towards rehab, I never went. Finally, I overdosed on pills on my brothers birthday. P was there, he was the only one who noticed something wrong and rushed me to the hospital, the rest is a painful story but long story short I was clean for 3 years, me and P talked about dating after I got out of the hospital, and he agreed if I stayed clean for 5 years. We moved in together after he graduated and lived happily ever after for a second. 

The other day I went to go visit my shitty fucking family. My shitty fucking brother gave me a coming home “gift”, three perc 30s and a bottle of vodka. I freaked out and tried to give them back, told him I didn’t need this and didn’t want it. He sat it on the table for 2 hours “just in case I change my mind” and I finally broke. I took the pills and within 20 minutes I realized what I did and called P, begging him to pick me up (we live an hour away, I couldn’t even walk let alone drive). He came in 30 minutes flat, drove me right home, told me to pack a bag and get out. I’ve been staying in a motel for the past week or so, trying to sort my thoughts out, trying to figure anything I could do to get him back. I’ve been racking my brain trying to think of any way I could redeem myself. I know I broke him, but I can’t get through this without him. He’s the love of my life and all I care about. What do I do?

Hello all, it's getting very frustrating trying to help my brother out. We have a tough family to be around, they're very judgemental and angry, I am very guilty of anger myself but I try to manage myself because I know my feelings can be unreasonable sometimes and my reactions very irrational.

Now back to my brother, because of this I try to be there for him, I try to understand but I just cannot. It's little things like him really, really not understanding WHY he gets scolded for spending entire days playing video games or phone games or getting introuble for not doing his only 2 chores daily (which just btw are vacuuming 2 rooms and taking out the trash). In my eyes these are very reasonable things to get introuble for. Those chores can be completed in 30 minutes or even less so why not just get them out of the way? As for the endless gaming I understand why that shouldn't be the only thing he does daily. However, he sees no issue. He tells me this and I try to explain how they're such simple things so he should just DO them.

He gets very angry, he's gone as far as saying that i should just shut up because at the end of the day he blocks out my little ""speeches"" to him. I don't know how else to get through to him, I've tried talking to him, letting him vent, I've even tried setting up a rewards system for him so that doing what he's supposed to be doing will allow him to earn some money. He outright said he didn't care to change his behavior so I shouldn't even try.

It's not just the chores and the video games. He constantly talks back and even trys to yell at his elders like they should listen to him. He constantly torments our little sister and says he's ""just playing"". He always makes it clear to me how he hates ""everyone in the family except me"" (though he lashes out at me too he is more open and talks to me about what he's mad at) when I try to rationalize why he gets introuble he gets angry at me. He gives little to no effort to school. He always asks for things but can't quite grasp an understanding as to why some things (extra money, electronic devices, expensive toys and such) should be earned, obviously not ALWAYS but he makes no effort to work hard for something considered more on the expensive side every once in a while (we're not very wealthy).

And most recently he lashed out on me because I told him he was smart and capable of so much more than he thinks. He asked me how I would feel if someone told me they believed i could be better than I am, I told him I would be glad because they actually believe in me and because I personally believe that there is always room to improve ourselves. He yelled at me and told me that I couldn't do better, that he didn't believe I could do any better than I am now, thay one hurt but I walked away from it.

I don't really know what to do anymore or how to approach him and try to be there for him because he's always upset and angry if he doesn't just get his way.

Hi, lately I was friends with a girl I really liked but she ended up telling me that she has to figure out stuff then tell me.. then proceeded to block me.. I don't know if it's block or not.. I no longer can see her profile picture and I don't think it's a good idea to text her again.

I posted about this before and I got advice from you guys(on reddit) , that I need to meet new people, a thing that I started doing.. 

And here is the problem

Up until I met that girl I was an introvert and I really didn't care much about human interactions and never had any problem with spending time alone..
However after meeting her I really enjoyed sharing time with her, I enjoyed talking to her about all the lame stuff that I considered exciting.. Such as what I did in that day, or how I felt towards that thing and random things in general..

Now after she left I feel extremely lonely..
And I can no longer enjoy doing stuff alone. 
It just feels odd if you have no one to share it with. 

So lately, following advice I got from here, I tried and I'm still trying to replace her (to have someone to talk to about stuff, or do stuff with)
So here is what I did 

I volunteered to help a hospital dealing with Corona patients (if I die it will be for a noble cause, and it's not like anyone would miss me anyway) and I try to engage with my coworkers as much as I can. 


The thing is, I still feel stranger, like an unwanted guest .. Whenever I'm there I try to have nice conversations, it work sometimes other times it just end up being awkward silence.. 
It's not like I don't know stuff (heck I spent most of my life as a book loving introvert) and I do try my best to be interested in them as a people but something is missing. 
If I did not go and talk to a person, he/She will not spend effort to communicate with me. 

Same thing with people I know on phone.. If I don't engage in conversations no one will try to ask about me.. 


I just don't understand what I am doing wrong.. 

I just don't want to be lonely again. 
And I can't really enjoy doing stuff alone anymore",13Sep2020,1

296,"I’m (37m) INTJ, I don’t pretend or say I’m smart. People tell me that. Only because when coworkers or classmates(I just graduated college) ask a question I usually answer it. Whether I was asked or not. I try not to do the latter. I don’t want to come off as pretentious. With accomplishments and what not. So I don’t mention it. Just say I read a lot. Mostly true.  

I realize I get put off by most people. Especially the more ignorant they are. I can’t have a regular conversation. It would always be one sided. Either I’m just letting them talk or they can’t follow what I want to talk about. 

My mother says I don’t have friends because I think everyone is too stupid for me. In a sense that’s true. If they get too ignorant I can’t deal with them. In my 20s I would do something all dumb people hate but I like. It’s when people correct a person who is wrong. But only if they’re correct, with some evidence. I like to improve my thinking and never debate unless I know 90% of the subject. I’m a firm believer in never argue with an idiot. They don’t care about facts. My mother isn’t intelligent by any means. Barely can read, high school dropout. My father took care of her, so she didn’t really ever have a job after 19.

But she is a talker and likes to feel superior. I had numerous slaps for correcting her. But she has a lot of friends. Most below average people do. From what I have noticed.

In my 20s I really was an ass about it. I was a Supply ship 500 ton Captain at 20. Which wasn’t common at all and still isn’t. The people I worked with were on the level of borderline flat earther ignorance. As well as having mild racist tendencies. The level you don’t have respect for. You don’t care what they think. So I never gained a work friendship. I would usually request or they would request a transfer. The years passed and I would just stay silent and listen and agree just to avoid confrontation but then you get labeled as the weird quiet guy. Or as many of my gfs would say, 

“They think you’re judging them.” How? “Oh by the way you talk.” Apparently, when I do speak. I don’t use enough slang and use big words. Like apparently.  It’s a double edge sword. 

Dating is not really an issue, it's just I was a captain for over 15 years before I changed careers (Process operator) and no one particularly wants to date someone who's gone 9 months out of the year with very little communication during that time offshore. I actually still talk with a few of them. But you can’t be that close with your exes if you don’t have kids together. It’s not healthy. But most women don't really like dating a guy who has no friends. Particularly guys nearly 40.

Another issue is my hobbies. I like something but not the way others do. Meaning people with hobbies go full throttle. This is hard to explain. People will like a hobby and things connected to it. As in, I like goth culture. Maybe I’ll chill at a goth club because I like the music or a burlesque show is going on. But in no way you would look at me and think oh yeah he’s goth. I like outdoor stuff like hiking and camping and even do some mild doomsday prep. I like reading or watching the subject. I don’t hunt or fish or anything that’s connected with that culture. There’s more but the gist is. I can’t hang out with any of those groups because I’m the poster boy for culture tourist. I enjoy learning aspects of cultures and subcultures. But people are very territorial especially now with the whole cultural appropriation. Even though I’m very respectful of other cultures.

IMO I feel that’s just a new form of segregation. Keeping people out based on their race and whatnot. But anyway. It’s difficult for me to relate to people and hangout when you just like one or two things they are really deep into. They get offended or I lose interest because I only like a few things. It’s rough sometimes.

Sorry for the tangent. I want to know if others can relate? Did you do something to overcome it? I always hear, just agree with them and smile. I literally learned how to fake a smile. The trick is you have to slightly squint your eyes. Makes it look genuine. But after a while you’re seen as the quiet weird guy who is judging them.",13Sep2020,3

I was laying in bed watching a tv show and I adjusted my blanket and literally one foot away from my head a spider crawled out of a fold and I swear was making a beeline for my head.

303,"Hi, I am 17 years old and a Senior in high school. I am not working at the moment because my parents are afraid of me catching COVID-19, so I don't have a budget saved up. I want to pursue a career in Occupational Therapy really bad, I have a 4.6 GPA and have never struggled in science courses. A while back when I was a sophomore I was offered by my guidance counselor to take courses at a local trading school nearby and pick up a trade. I was gravitated towards becoming a medical assistant or an EMT, but my mom told me no. I kept persisting, telling her that I wanted to do it because I love taking care of people and learning about science, but she kept telling me that I needed a job that involved math. She told me that careers in math are the only ones that will land me a job and give me money. I kept telling her again and again that I am horrible at math and don't want to do that, and she kept arguing. She would wake me up at 4 a.m and suggest more careers involving math. Eventually, I don't know what happened, but I got exhausted and gave up. I signed up for a 2-year course in accounting and absolutely hate it. Not only do I find it extremely boring, but I don't understand it either. Like I said earlier, math is not exactly my strong suit, and I certainly do not have a passion for it. It is probably one of the biggest regrets of my life thus far, and I don't want to make that mistake again. I have looked into Occupational Therapy and became instantly interested.

313,"Sorry for the long post, but this story has several months worth of story to recap.

Way back in April, I was on Disboard looking for new servers to join. One sounded pretty funny: a server about people who are legitimately convinced that they are anime characters in real life, so I joined it to see what was up and maybe get a quick laugh. It turned out it wasn't a server with people, but rather a server with *person.* Just one guy alone who was really surprised and happy when I joined, as he wasn't expecting anyone to actually be interested in that server's niche. I thought this guy was a lonely, pitiful fellow and felt bad that I basically joined just to laugh at him, so I decided to play nice with him instead. After talking with him for a while, he revealed that he wasn't so lonely after all, but was actually in charge of a much larger server for these ""IRL anime characters,"" one with hundreds of people, including several minors as young as 13. It seemed harmless enough at first, just people with some really weird beliefs and coping mechanisms for whatever was going on in their lives. But the longer I stuck around, the more I began to see the wretchedness behind the scenes.

This guy, we'll call him A from now on, almost seemed like a cult leader for this stuff. He would always provide answers for people and help them ""find themselves,"" and it lead to him having many orbiters who would believe everything he said, some of which were young teenagers. I also saw glimpses of what I would later realize was A's extremely toxic mental instability.

After a few months, I gained A's trust enough that he invited me to yet another server: the one he only offered to his closest ""friends."" Most of them were his most devoted orbiters who would always reply to him, lick up everything he says, and be quick to defend him whenever he didn't like something. It was *here* that I finally saw A in his full ugly light. 

A was really hesitant to give me access to the adult channels even though he knew I was adult, and when I finally convinced him to, I knew why. He posted NSFW images of children and young women being *very* violently sexually exploited, we're talking blood, guts, dismemberment. Granted, they were just drawings, not real people, but it was still sickening to see. He would gush about his fantasies involving these things and boasted about his collection of these images, especially his collection of one 14-year-old character he liked in particular (fun fact, I made an alt account posing as this character and he immediately was very... enamored with me). He was also extremely emotionally manipulative and abusive to the orbiters in this server, including the minors. He would rant every day about something that upset him or he would ask for help, and there were many times where he would go off on the people responding trying to help him, to extremely hurtful, nasty degrees that made me wonder why they wouldn't just leave. And the answer to that is simply that he had those people whipped. Mind controlled. Emotionally dependent. 

Despite how sickened I was, I did try to help A. I tried to convince him to seek therapy, I tried to help him realize how abusive he was being to his so-called friends. He was having none of it, sometimes going into psychological meltdowns because he didn't like what he was hearing. Eventually I got so tired of A that I left his servers, and thankfully, I was able to convince some of his close orbiters break from his control and leave as well. But many of them are still there, some still teenagers, and there are hundreds in his large server and more joining every day.

What should I do here? I'm not sure if I should expose him publicly so that the entire community of these anime people know to stay away or if I should subtly report him and hope he gets banned. I'm worried that if I just report him, it won't stop him, since he has multiple accounts and can always make more. But I'm also worried that if I expose him, he won't take it well and do something stupid like killing himself or someone else. Like I said, the guy is *extremely* unstable.

I have plenty of screenshot evidence of the things I've described here, and I still have inside sources that keep me updated from time to time. He hasn't physically hurt anyone yet as far as I know, but seeing how horrifically this guy treated the people closest to him, and how obsessive he was about his child gore fantasies, it just doesn't sit right with me knowing that he's basically acting as a cult leader to impressionable, vulnerable children and adults.",13Sep2020,6

315,"I tried acid for the first time 2 months ago, 175ug tab. It was pretty cool but also terrifying because I ego deathed, besides the lingering trauma I have from my experience, My biggest mistake was going back after and doing research about the drug and it’s effects, because I learned that acid flashbacks exist. 

Now, I am an extremely paranoid person and I knew that even finding out about this was gonna trigger the immediate “oh shit what if I get one”. For some reason I am terrified at the idea of having an acid flashback. I’ve never had a definitive one except for this one time 4 weeks later when I ate a really strong edible and got hella slight visuals and auditory hallucinations which is expected for someone who just ate a strong edible and has tried acid before, but my biggest fear is getting one out of no where. 

Sometimes when I start overthinking I start seeing what I think might be a flashback because the letters on my phone feel a bit wobbly but I know this is all in my head, it’s all just psychosomatic symptoms and I know they fucking are but my brain is constantly on self destruct and avoids all rationalization. Anytime I hear about schizophrenia or any mental illness I start having an anxiety attack at the thought of possibly having it despite there being no history of it in my family.

I live in an apartment full of people who i can’t relate to and i seem to shape shift and change so they “approve” of me and i fit in with them.

319,"i’ve had mental health issues since about 6th grade. my self harm started then but not bad at all, light scratches. 7th grade was fine but 8th grade is when it got worse. i also started recognizing more and more symptoms of anxiety/adhd during these times. the first time i told my mom about my anxiety she asked if i wanted to talk to somebody but ironically i was too anxious to say yes. she brought it up with my doctor and they both chalked it up to my phone/politics. ( i had cried the other day about something political) i decided enough was enough and i asked my
mom to get tested for adhd. she simply said that she would put screen time on my phone (which i quickly got around) and said that she was sure i didn’t have it even though she points out symptoms on the daily. i don’t know what else to do. i don’t feel comfortable asking my dad for whatever reason, i don’t know what to do. i feel so trapped by dependency but i can’t deal with this anymore. it’s breaking me",13Sep2020,1

324,"I have several mental illnesses myself. I’ve had several failed suicide attempts. I’ve moved to another part of my country and am doing a bit better. I’ve had a hard time fitting in at my new job. 

I made a good friend at work. Despite not being able to make much of a connection with most people there, I made a good one. 

She soon began telling me that she cannot cope with work stress and her life in general. Before I know it, she met with the boss and is taking a month off to focus on her mental health. 

I told her I’ll always be there for her and I talk to her most days telling her about what goes on at work (we work with kids, so nothing that should add to her stress. Just keeping her in the loop with the kids pretty much.) 

She messages and said that her husband and her fought and he left her. She is suicidal and says she doesn’t know what to do. She is afraid if she is alone that she will hurt herself. I immediately told her I’m going out that way. She lives close to my work whereas I live about 2 hours away, so it actually works out well if I can stay the night with her and keep her company. 

The problem is that despite being in her situation, I have no idea what I’m going to say once I get there. I’m not wise and all I have is a strong desire for her to get better. She is already seeing mental health experts. Please don’t post suicide hotlines because they are pretty trash here really. My country doesn’t deal with mental illness well. 

I am just looking for some general do’s and dont’s when dealing with a suicidal person. It’s pretty time sensitive and I really appreciate the help",13Sep2020,2

326,"TLDR; Feeling burnt out from this 2 year old, extremely close friendship. I do everything for him and help in every way, but I am often met with excuses, anger when I mention it and no form of reciprocation at all.

I (16M) have been feeling burnt out from my friendship with my (17M) best friend. We have been close friends for about two years and at one point, we were almost inseparable. We had a bond where we could tell each other everything, always talked and hung out and supported each other through everything.

Recently, in the past few months, this has completely changed. I am always the one to initiate conversation and check on him to make sure he’s doing good and do whatever I can to make sure his life is the best it can be. I don’t do anything expecting the same back from others, but I always made sure he had something to eat and a place to stay, financially supported his family and bought them groceries when they were in a rough spot, gave him rides to anywhere he wanted and bought him things that he wanted such as clothes and shoes, games, things for his sports, concert tickets and anything that would help him.

Recently, he got a job and I have given him rides and paid for Lyft’s when I was not able to and gave him money to go out to eat after work so I knew he would not go to bed hungry. Because of his new job, I have also been doing all his schoolwork on top of mine, which is 16 classes I have to work on in total.

For months now, I feel like our conversations go nowhere and I have to be the one to put in the work and continue it. If he knows I am feeling down or I tell him, he doesn’t acknowledge it much or doesn’t bother to check in and I find myself relying on mostly everything on other people. Whenever I suggest we hang out, I get told that “It’s for the best that we don’t hang out” and that “he’s tired”, and that “we don’t have anything to do” which is completely understandable, but I see him make time for all his other friends and constantly mention how bored he is. A lot of what I know from his life, is told to me by other people or by him days or weeks later. Whenever I am feeling down and have no energy to talk, I get told that “I ghosted him”.

He thanks me for what I do for him, but I feel like our friendship is just empty promises and is maintained on the fact I would do anything for him. He is constantly asking me for favors and since I hold him dearly, I agree to everything and end up stressed out and when I tell him I’m struggling, he tells me “it’s okay, you do it all so easy, and I just feel trapped.

A lot of the times when I try talking about him on how things he does affects me or me talking about a problem with the friendship we have, I found myself to be met with an angry reaction and constant excuses. He is constantly making everything in his life negative and blames the world for everything that happens to him, and I don’t want to end the friendship because we have so many mutual friends, our families know each other and it would just become a really uncomfortable situation for me, but I feel trapped and everyday I feel more burnt out from this friendship and not even being able to get a text or any sort of reciprocation.

Please give me your honest opinions on what I should do next, as sometimes I feel like I’m overreacting. A lot of people have left his life for his constant negativity and I feel bad for even thinking about doing so, but I am giving all of myself for absolutely nothing. Thank you Reddit :) .",13Sep2020,3
327,Hello reddit. So I would go to my cousins house pretty often and every time i go there we don’t talk to each other and and theres 5 people there and we just don’t talk and if we do it only small talk so i want to ask Reddit for some advice or how to start a conversation.

329,So it's 12:52am &amp; my bf is out in the living room drinking with his brother and sisters I'm in our room I think he thinks I'm asleep. I heard his conversation with his brother he brought up his ex. Like we have a year together now why is he even bringing her up he's told me he wasn't hung up on any of his exs I don't know what to feel if I should let it go or confront him. He's never done this not that I know of so I'm really confused does he miss her? want her? I did also hear it was his ex from Highschool so that left me wondering a lot. What would you do?,13Sep2020,2
332," I guess this is obvious considering the state of things in the world, but I've completely lost touch with myself in the past year, maybe longer. I'm a 27 y/o male, in US.

I'd say this probably started after I finished college, I found a great, loving, supportive gal, and after some hard work and self improvement, I came to have a somewhat decent job at a hospital as a IV pharm tech. I felt that I was getting better and felt happy with my progress. Although, after a year at the job I found myself complacent, I was bored. I had practically memorized and almost perfected most things at my job. This all happened in 4 or so years.

All the while I put my social life on hold. I was convinced that if I could block out most people that might invite negativity in my life, that I would be better off. I kept contact with specific friends that I've know for the longest time and that I love. I thought this was fine for the most part, but what ended up happening is I never went out, and was practically a shut-in, minus the time my gf and I would see her friends or we would go out for something like dates and stuff. 

Fast forward to June this year my gf was accepted to med school and we moved out mid month to the opposite end of the state, leaving family, friends, and familiar places behind. I was perfectly happy with this because my gf has always supported me and I will always support her. I mean nothing was really holding me back either, I felt it was a good time for a transformation to occur in our lives so it was exciting. 

Now I'm here, in a better apartment, with my cats and my lady, rarely going out because of covid, having an internal breakdown because I left my perfectly fine job with people I knew and a location I could literally know off the back of my head.

I love being in this new location don't get me wrong, but I get a portion of my happiness from being with people. I've always denied this but I flourish when I'm in groups, it's when my personality shines and allows me to be successful and be confident. I've really trained myself to not need to do this as much as I used to, but it's come to the point that I can't ignore my feeling of emptiness or isolation.

I know no one in this new town. I only go out for food/groceries or maybe the occasional nature hike. I feel like I've almost become antisocial in a way as I'm almost nervous to even give a quick hello to a passerby in worry that I'll look/sound stupid.  I come home and I distract myself with games or anime, or try to help my gf study. I try to stream since it's something that I've always thought matched my personality but it feels empty and I'm inexperienced. I've started looking for jobs from my previous profession because my savings are narrowing... and know that I can't make a living off streaming for a long time, but I haven't gotten any replies in the past 3 months that I've been here now. 

The stimulus check that I was hoping to get and give me a bit more time to figure stuff out seems like a long shot now, and I feel like shit for hoping for it so hard.

My gf got quite a bit of loan money/scholarships from her school and is practically paying for everything minus a couple dinners and groceries sometimes and it makes me feel like I'm weighing her down. I feel like I've lost all the confidence that I once had and I feel like it's all my fault. I'm trying to make up for all this but all I've really be able to do is doordash time to time. I can talk about everything with my gf, but I can't bring myself to admit that I'm scared and I don't know what I'm doing or what I should do. 

I don't know what to do with my life anymore and all I can think to do right now is make money where I can but it all isn't as much as I used to save. 

Am I overreacting? Is this stuff a non-issue? What can I realistically do with the problems that are going on in the world. I keep thinking maybe I can venture off and find a new profession since I have the time but I lack the confidence to do so and feel that each venture is just a waste of time and effort. 

This is my first serious post on reddit on a throwaway account and I'm sure reading this post will be a headache because I'm just typing as I go.. I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to post this and if you know of a better place I should go then please tell me.

333,"So around 2 months ago, I made a post on this subreddit saying: 
So I was on a subreddit where you can make new friends and I met this guy. We texted each other quite a fair bit for 3 weeks and I thought it was going great. And due to me being easily attached to people, I kinda enjoyed texting him. However, he started to text me less and less and eventually, we stopped. I got over him (as friends) and I was moving on with life and honestly, i didn't want to text any other people anymore due to this 'issue'. So the last time we texted each other, I hit him up but he didn't seem to want to text me. I told myself that if the next day, he didn't text me, I wouldn't hit him up anymore cause it was pretty clear that he would rather text 'the chicks' (his words, not mine). Well, he didn't text me! Today, however, he hit me up! But I'm honestly kind of sick of being friends with someone who seems uninterested in me and would rather 'talk to the chicks'. Should I reply him and continue being friends with him?

Someone told me to not be friends with him so I didn't reply him. It's been almost 2 months and I finally texted him yesterday explaining why I stopped being friends with him. He replied saying that the reason why he wasn't initiating conversations was that a close relative got sick and had little time left to live. He had found out about it just before we starting talking. He said that another reason was because he realised that he liked me and it hurt him to talk to me as he couldn't see me as anything more than a lover. However, he said that those feeling had sort of moved and he treasured our friendship. I do have a liking towards him. However, he lives across the world.

Of course we talked for the night and it was pretty awkward in my opinion. He then said that he recently broke up with someone that was using him and it kinda hurt me because during the 2 months that I wasn't talking to him, he had managed to find someone to date while I was still hung up over him. The best part was that he said that the only things he remembered about me was my name and where I'm from. I was shocked to say the least. It really hurts to talk to him now and I don't know if I should continue being friends with him but I don't want to ghost him again. What should I do?",13Sep2020,1

We used to talk all day everyday and chill everyday. Now he’s acting weird tho me and him haven’t chilled for a month he always makes excuses like he’s busy and this was out of nowhere too. He knows I like him too.

So I try to approach him in a friend way afain and he still won’t treat me like one of the guys even tho I want him to why’s that?

343,"throwaway, for reasons. 

So my parents got a divorce two years ago for reasons I thought I knew but turned out that I did not. I thought it was something small, that my mum just couldn't cope with my dad doing nothing when it comes to cleaning and stuff but that was not the reason. I'll get to that. They left peacefully and without a fight. Atleast they said. Nobody cheated, I know that.

With the divorce some time ago, things are getting weird now. My dad, which is the reason, turned out to be gay. Like, I don't have something against that, but still sort of weird. Not only that but he has got a boyfriend already, which is a bit messy because he is pretty young and not native. Can't even speak our language. My mum told me that she is not going to get a man again, but rn im not so sure. She hangs out with a random guy she met on facebook or something and writes with a guy often and stuff. I don't really see a problem with any of that, if they get friends or whatever. 

It's just... they are still my parents and i'm 15 so I do realize what's happening. I think it's really weird and disturbing and don't want to see it happening. It seems like they are dating and both my mum and my dad, which I couldn't do without, are getting friends that live far away, in case of my dad even abroad. And they both want to meet and I'm like... can't you just stop and live your life, you've got 3 children? But I accept what they do, but deep inside I am really worried and feel weird by that. 

I expect this to be a bit confusing, i'm sorry for that lol.

How do I stop thinking it's a bad thing that my parents are meeting people again?

345,"Hey guys, so as title says, I just turned 18 years old a couple months ago and I feel like the time is running out.

A bit of my background, just finished first year of  college at a pretty good school in Computer Science, doing my first internship being a website developer from home, pretty chill job.

I feel like if I continue in Computer Science, I will probably end up in a good spot with a comfortable lifestyle, as I do not find it so difficult and it pays pretty well. 

However, I don't really enjoy working in this domain, but I don't want to switch majors as I feel it is a pretty valuable skill. The thing is I see most people peaking in their early 20's and I will graduate when I'll be 21 years old.

I feel like I'll be wasting my life and will not accomplish anything before it's too late. Currently, I play video games and piano, which I consider myself pretty good at both, but do not see as an option for a career.

I also stopped fapping and mindlessly browsing the hub everyday to avoid wasting time, and am planning to cut time from gaming and youtube/reddit (the only social media that I use) to have more time to myself.

As an introvert and doing remote learning it's not particularly easy to meet people. The only place I go to outside of my home is work and I want to change that. I've been stuck at home drawing and stuff but I'd much rather go out and have fun on my own.

349,"We’re going to preface this by acknowledging that I am incredibly drunk (legal where I’m from) but enough is enough.

It all starts back in highschool. I’ve always been told I’m very pretty but as a tall and curvy girl who was friends with all the popular super beautiful, skinny girls I developed a lot of self hatred and decided I just wasn’t attractive enough to date guys at my highschool. So I didn’t. Now, in my second year of college, I finally have gained enough self confidence to start going on dates and allowing myself to get rid of my anxiety and acknowledge that I’m cute as hell. 

The only problem? My roommate, one of my best friends from highschool. She is incredibly insecure but  also super skinny and undeniably pretty, as well as much more experienced than I. Every time I make my interest known in a guy she flirts with them, almost always resulting in her going home with them. I was never too concerned about it but it’s gotten to the point that she has slept with every guy friend that I have ever admitted attraction to. I’m not one for random hookups but at this point every guy I’ve liked throughout college has slept with her or has their sights set in her particularly thanks to her flirting. I want to try to assert myself but I still definitely have a bit of an inferiority complex left over from the highschool days and just in general guys are alway more attracted to her. (For example tonight she said the first guy to beat her at pong got to take her home and created a bit of a frenzy)
At this point after being quarantined for months all I want is to FUCK but I can’t because she has laid claim on every guy that is in our bubble. Even if I tried to infringe on that they have feeling for her. I also back off every time she shows interest because I feel like that’s just the right thing to do idk. I would also like to add that she is completely aware about my current situation and that I am I to these guys

I know this is a bit venty but I guess if you people can provide anything I’m asking for 1. How can I improve my confidence and get over the issues I have with thinking I’m so much worse than my friends and 2. Am I offside about being pissed at this?

351,"First thing: I’m a young man on the autism spectrum. I live in supported housing, and have funding that covers me OK. I have extremely limited interests, and gaming is my thing, so unfortunately it’s not as helpful as it could be.

354,"We've been friends for years. We'd make little kung fun action shorts. Him vs any stunt people we could muster. Always produced by a woman. She was basically the only woman on set for 90% of our shoots. Unfortunately, finding stuntwomen became a more difficult task than I had anticipated. And our crew was basically just my male roommate on the camera and my producer.  Our budgets ranged from 200 dollars--1,000. Real big budget shit...

Anyways, he blocked me on everything. When I finally blew him up on enough fake accounts, he emailed me. 

He told me that Hollywood is a lie. It's run by pedofiles. That I'm only helping that system continue to run. He mentioned a friend of his who was offered a movie. ""He turned down a project because they told him he had to accept pedofilia or else he couldn't make the film"". 


He then went on to state that I cornered a woman multiple times on our little short film sets, asking them to go on a date with me. This is untrue. I'm in complete shock. A recurring theme amongst our past conversations were that we needed to find more stuntwomen because we could only find men. So our shorts ended up just being a couple of dudes who wanted to do a favor to him. It legitimately doesn't make any sense. I cannot think of a single person who would even say such a lie. Yet he says there are multiple. I really don't know where this is coming from. All of the crew members I've ever had still follow me on social media and check in periodically.  And that includes the females. Why? Because they've all been friends. They do a favor for me. I do one for them. Filmmaker homies. I'm just so confused. If there were actually allegations, wouldn't they have told the producer instead of an actor? 

He also said that he was offered a film, but he didn't want to do it, so he threw my name in the ring.  ""I know you think I wouldn't support you, but I do. I threw your name out there. They didn't want to because of your behavior on BLANK SHORT FILM.""  Here's the thing. The short he mentioned...My crew was my friends and we all worked together again afterwards on other projects. And still do. 

He then went on to accuse me of lying about my sexuality (I'm pansexual) because he's never seen me swipe for men on Tinder (I'm in the closet. Few people know. I'm not about to openly swipe for dudes).  


I'm at a loss for words. I don't know what happened with my friend. He had mentioned that he had mental disorders, but he never mentioned which ones when asked. Maybe he's having a breakdown? I don't know what to do. Do I call him? Do I wait it out? He said he's moving out of state soon. I'd like to see him before that. 


What do I do? I'm completely shocked.",13Sep2020,1
355,"I’m just really upset and confused.

On Friday night my brother in laws girlfriend and I spent the evening drinking together as my partner and BIL are away on holiday together. They had broken up for a while this year and during this time my BIL was texting numerous girls and even met up with two of them (one for casual sex and the other just for a meet up). This shouldn’t have happened anyway, during this time our country was under a strict lockdown.

His girlfriend and I were talking about these girls and his flings with them as she knew about them. He had told her about him being on tinder during their break and she was okay with that.

Turns out he had only told his girlfriend that he had met up with just 1 of the girls and that the other girl in question (the casual hookup) he had never met her at all. 

By this point I’d accidentally admitted that he had met her. She starts getting upset and wants to confront him about why he had lied to her.

During this whole time, I’ve been staying with my in laws. Me and my partner are saving for a mortgage. 

Yesterday, my BIL had gotten into a phone argument with his girlfriend because she tried to confront him. I asked her not to because it would be better in person and might sever my relationship with my partner and his family might end up hating me. 

BIL had suspicions that his mum had said something so he begins blowing up her phone in anger accusing her. Makes her upset and then realised it must’ve been me. My MIL and BIL are then telling me “why did you tell her this?” “They never met”. 

Meanwhile I call my partner in tears and he’s telling me “oh, they did more than just meet” and that he’s “on my side”. As much as I want my BIL to come clean, I know he won’t. How can i feel less guilty about this whole situation? I thought of just moving out but then, knowing the family, they’d see this as a sign of guilt. I really didn’t mean to create this rift. If this man was just honest from the start then maybe this crap wouldn’t come to bite him on his ass 😞",13Sep2020,2

360,"Hey guys and girls

So I've been hooking up with this guy for quite some time now and we have already had sex a couple of times. We are both 18 and are just having fun.

Last night tho we were watching a movie at my plase and it was a boring one imo it was Jackie Brown but it's not really the point of this post. 

So we both were kinda bored so I slowly start to make out with him and put his hand under my shirt. We were both wearing some casual clothes. I was in yoga pants and a crop top and he was in sweatpants and a tshirt. So now that we started making out I see his erection growing in his pants and I sit on his lap. Facing away from him first so he gets a good view of my ass and can kiss my neck too because I love that.

Now I start to grind a bit on him and I feel his penis pressing against my ass and him kissing my neck and grabbing my boobs so I am really turned on too so I turn around so I'm facing him. We start to really make out and he grabs my ass, slaps it and I start to grind against him very hard. So we both start to moan a bit and then it happened.

I felt his erection go soft and he says that he is so sorry that this happened and that his very embarrased gets up and leaves. 

So this brings me here I thought it was super hot that he came in his pants it made me feel very empowered and sexy. 

But now idk what I should tell him or text him that he doesn't feel bad any ideas?",13Sep2020,2

Apps such a Grindr, some hetero dating sites, kik, and some meetup app I can’t remember the name of. I’ve always felt like he was shady and secretive. Never liked the guy. 

Some backstory: he claims to have been a virgin before he met my mom and that she was his first (he was 44 when they got married so I always it hard to believe). My mom has shared with me that their romantic/sexual relationship is non existent and has been for most of their marriage. But she’s still very attached to him and I know this would absolutely shatter her. She’s had such bad experiences with men in the past, every single one has been a complete asshole and I’ve witnessed it first hand. I just can’t stand to see it happen again. They’ve been married for 6 years now and I don’t see them breaking up even despite this revelation. 

I know that despite her heartbreak, she will forgive him and he doesn’t deserve that. I don’t know whether to tell her or to just hold in this terrible secret to protect her feelings. She’s more fragile than your average person. She just really doesn’t deserve this, she’s way too good for him  and doesn’t realize her self worth. She does everything for him... cooks, cleans and is the sole provider (financially) of the house. She basically slaves away and gets nothing in return for it.

When i told him my age i assumed he would stop talking to me but he didn’t. i fet kinda cool that i was talking to some attractive older guy . I had a small crush on him that faded away when i found out he had a gf but despite that he would constantly ask to hang out with me and i told him that it was weird that he wanted to hang out with me because he had a gf at the time. We continued talking regularly into 2020 and he broke up with his gf and he was sending me mixed signals by imagining scenarios where we would hang out/ go to shows and saying ""itd be romantic"" i thought i was reading into it too much. I opened up to him about my insecurities and i thought he would understand that i wasn’t ready to meet him in person but after a week he asked again to hang out. I soft blocked him on insta i thought that the was the end of that but he messaged me asking what he did wrong and i told him that i wasn’t comfortable with the flirting and he said that he didn’t mean to come across that way and that he only saw me as a friend. I continued talking to him. So fast forward to july we were on ft and he said that he had a date but if that fell through he would take me instead i was kinda offended lmao at being the second option and i blocked him. I had a close internet friend that i considered my best friend but at the time we were going through a rough patch because i wasn’t communicating with because i was going through a depressive episode and was isolating myself. So it turns out that he messaged her asking her to let me know that he didn’t know what he did but was sorry if he did anything to offend me. She asked him if he liked me and he said that he was attracted to me but knew i was underage so he was going to wait till i turned 19.  i was still 17 on the cusp of being 18. The more i thought about it the more creeped out i get because he was a grown-ass man talking to 16-17 year old. i thought i was mature but i realized that i was only a kid.  I told my friend that i had the suspicion and i thought that was grooming. For context around that time a lot of musicians in my scene were getting exposed for inappropriate behavior, misconduct, and grooming underage girls. I brought up those concerns because despite this i didnt want to risk his career as an artist and she said something really passive aggressive and took his side kinda i was in a really fragile state of mind at the time and i ended my friendship with her we left things open but right now i kinda miss her but my pride is getting in the way of messaging her or idek if i should.

My friend (17f) liked this guy in her math class last year. Unfortunately, she moved two states away so she wasn't able to tell the guy she liked him. Before she left however, she gave him her snapchat info....and he hasn't added her back yet.

10 months later, she is still posting stuff about how she misses him and keeps asking advice on how to date him. She hasn't seen him in nearly a year, and she knew him for only half a year. Maybe it's because I'm an emotionally stunted bitch but I just feel like in 10 months, if the guy hasn't added you back....maybe it's time to give up.

And I'd lie if I said her posts aren't getting creepy. She took all the pictures she had of him and compiled them into a minute long video...I don't think he even noticed she took those pictures of him. I know people secretly take pictures of people they find cute, but I just feel making a montage of them is going a little too far.

I just feel like the guy isn't giving her the attention she deserves and she should drop him and move on. Or maybe I'm wrong and true love will prevail? I was just hoping this feeling would die and she'd find someone else but she is fixated on him.

383,"I've been having a tough time with friendships lately. One of (who I used to consider) my good friends that I met through my previous job (1.5yrs, recently quit) ghosted me completely, removing our connections across all platforms of social media. I have reached out to her twice in the past month expressing well wishes, a good luck for the start of a new semester, letting her know I miss her, all with no response. We were quite close and always showed so much gratitude/appreciation for one another. No obvious conflict has occured recently or in the past that would lead a rational person to think they should end a friendship.. on another note, one of my best friends for over 3 years and I went on a trip together recently with our S/Os. There was tension between us the entire time, which is difficult to pinpoint exactly how it started. Instead of being a coupleS trip (emphasis on the plural coupleS), it moreso turned out to be a couple trip for her and her boy friend. During our week long vacation, I noticed behavior that was unlike her, including heavier drug usage/borderline abuse which I believe altered her mood and emotions, causing the trip to be more stressful/worrisome than fun in return.

In essence, I'm navigating through a new chapter of life by starting grad school and not having a job anymore so I may focus on academics, but I have been feeling out of touch with those that were once most important to me. I am feeling like I was never as important in return to them as they were to me, and it is quite a disappointing feeling to experience and come to terms with. Disclaimer: i have sought objective opinions from my roommates and other friends of mine to gain insight on whether I am the one causing problems/friction, therefore, wondering if I should have an inward look on the treatment of my friends. They all reassure me that I am a great friend, while also expressing confusion by their recent behaviors. I feel very alone, as if the people I used to enjoy interacting with the most do not care as much about me anymore. What's really bothering me though is being ghosted by a girl I really admired and loved as a close friend. Is this a normal experience to go through in your 20s, and how do you make it out on top? I'm just a bit disheartened and sad, but I want to instead keep a positive mindset while navigating through this time period of my life.

Reposting with more info and my other one didn’t get any responses 

I (F18) was very good friends with this guy(M20) for a year and a half, and he openly admitted to making sexual advances when i was over and not stopping (and he was the only person to know that my ex partner had raped me.)
I stopped being his friend last November after he admitted over text to being manipulative and leading me to think we were in a relationship for sexual acts. I left it at that I was in love with him and couldn’t be his friend. This was in November and he has tried reaching out a few times to which I didn’t really respond as I started dating my partner in December. 

A friend told me and showed me a voice recording of him explaining why he did things to us (our friend group.) 
He admitted to a lot, but revoked access as it was a voice recording shared over Google Drive. 

He said that I asked him for nudes and started the exchange, when everyone else knows that he was begging me for nudes with my face in them so it could “help” more because he “cared about me”. He had actually asked initially, because a month after me and a previous partner (that assaulted me) had broken up, I had met him as I was in a new school and had no luck making friends. I was 16 at the time and he was 18. He took me on a “test date” and later asked me for nudes because it would help me get over my ex, he said. So I did, and any time I started losing interest or talking to another guy he would flirt, tell me it made him upset and that he thought we were talking? But any time I addressed it he beat around the bush.  I dropped him after he kept groping me at his house where he lived alone, and I was scared and eventually caved after saying I didn’t know if it was a good idea enough times. It was all in a kind way, it hurt me but I couldn’t be with him because I asked what was going on and he said he didn’t know if he could date me. Mind that this is the same guy who wouldn’t let me talk about or talk to another guy, and I was scared and stuck because he was the only friend I had and the only person who knew my previous partner had hurt me. 


What is a good way to legally tell him to fuck off? He admitted to being manipulative, rapey, and just gross. I don’t know if I have screenshots but I’m tired of this. On top of that, before I lived with my partner he admitted to walking around my house, and when my partner and I first started dating and I was no longer in contact, my partner had to walk me to my house because we would see him around very, very late. My parents knew but we didn’t have cameras so we don’t have any evidence, and now I live with my boyfriend and my parents live out of state so legally i don’t know for sure if I could even do anything legally. I think it’s merely a case of me being stupid and being taken advantage of, but how can I tell him to stop and be insulting but legal???",13Sep2020,3

He's quite a friendly person to talk to but he can get a little bit annoying sometimes like when he just interrupts you when you're in the middle of saying something or not give you a bit of space when you want it. I don't know if that's the reason why they treat him badly but I think he's an innocent person and he tries but he just struggles sometimes. It makes him so sad when no one wants to be in a group with him or even sit with him in class.

He's always been bullied and now that he's in high school it's just getting harder and they're just getting nastier. Sometimes they call him names and sometimes they throw his bag. They interrupt and say things when he's trying to present work to the class. He tries to stick up for himself verbally but they never listen. He's not very socially skilled so that doesn't help either.

It's not usually direct bullying, just subtle little things so it makes it hard for him to report names to the teachers. He doesn't even know any of their names anyway. Everyone's just rude towards him because he's a bit different and he doesn't play any sport and he's a bit of a geek. 

We've tried to come up with a strategy to help him cope with it but it just gets to him so bad and he wants to drop out of school because of it. We've tried talking to the school counsellors and talking and to teachers but talking's just not doing anything but what else is there apart from just talking.

I just want to go there and find the ones that are treating him like this and choke slam each and every one of them but all I can do is tell him that we're gonna go and talk to more people and get them to to talk to other people.

Math: Planning a tourist trip with strict guidelines. Must stay in 4 hotels, travel over 3000km and have to visit 4 tourist locations. Must calculate fuel prices, food prices, the time spent at each location and make comparisons between flight prices or car prices.

Social: An 800+ word essay, powerpoint presentation and speech.

Science: Fill out a research book, create a fake habitat, write a speech and create a powerpoint.

It's just really driving me crazy. I finished most of them with only social and science left but I just don't have the motivation or time.  I just don't know anymore.

When I was around the age of 6, my mom and dad separated and divorced. Soon after, my mother got a boyfriend. I am 14 years old now. He has become a father figure to me and my family and we all love him. Sometimes well cuddle while watching movies, but it was just normal. But then he started to touch me inappropriately, and even when I pushed his hands away he wouldn’t stop, he kissed me for much longer then is appropriate, and I just can’t feel comfortable alone with him anymore. Tonight my parents were lightly drinking, and we were watching movies. Then my mom and sister went to bed, and it was just us two. I’m trying to watch the movie but then he hugs me inappropriately putting his hands near my crotch, and groping me. Anwd I kept pushing him away with but he wouldn’t stop. I can’t be loud and shout at him because my family is asleep. Luckily the movie was ending, so I got up as soon as the credits started rolling and tried to get him to bed. Then he said ‘it hurts to want something you can’t have’ then he went to bed. I think he means me. I felt sick to my stomach. I still feel sick now. I’m so terrified he’ll do something to me. But I’m terrified that if I tell my mom, I’ll ruin the family. My mother and him haven’t been on the best terms right now and I’m afraid this will push her into kicking him out. But if he gets kicked out, we won’t have enough money to support ourselves. It’ll ruin us and everything we have.

School is starting soon, and with Covid, I’ll be able to keep my distance. I’m hoping that will be enough to stop him. That has to be enough to stop him because I don’t have anything else to.

421,"Some backstory and context; 

So, i live in a 5 person flatshare, which of course can get very messy at times and that ok.
One flatmate however, let's call him Roger, is disgusting.

Roger has just got back from a long trip, he sat down in the living room for an hour or so and then exlaimed that he hasnt washed in a week and now needs to take a bath. Fair enough.. i guess.

After he gets out, i use the toilet (which only me and him share) and peer over into the bath to see a literal carpet of body hair covering the entire surface of the bath, this however, is not unusual, i ask him to clean this sort of thing up and he complies ( if not slowly).

Today though, through my wall which is against the bathroom me and my gf heard classic signs of Roger using the toilet (give it 15 minutes after) and noticed that he flushed, opened the window and then left the room..

He didn't  wash his hands!? 

I was pretty sure this was the case when he had a piss and have noticed only one water sound (again my wall has the water pipes from the bathroom in it, so you can hear when someone uses the tap/shower/flush) .. but, to not flush after a dump? Jesus man.

So here is the question:

How do i ask him to wash his hands without  accusing him and without shaming him in front of the other flatmates etc?

TLDR;
Flatmate has a poo and doesn't  wash his hands afterwards, how can i bring this up politely?",13Sep2020,2

It’s my biggest fear to make him uncomfortable in that aspect so I keep my mouth shut about it and it’s causing me to not talk to him often at all anymore.

427,"Hi!

Don't care so much about anonymity I just really need some advice here!

I moved in with my best friend and her son and for the first two months, I was doing childcare. For the first month, she had me not pay rent - but she also didn't pay me for the time with her son. For the second month, she was paying me $90 a week to watch her son full time while I was still paying $650 in rent. (while making \~$400 for child care). I didn't realize how contingent buying a home for her was upon me. It almost seems like she wouldn't have / could not have done it without me. I do not have any of my furniture anywhere in the house, I cannot have my blender on the counter because it is ""too big"".

She is massively organized and cleanly, and while I am clean like a normal 25-year-old young woman, I could really feel I was messing up her flow.

For context, I have struggled with depression but was recently diagnosed with Autism. I deeply struggle with communication and advocating for myself, especially as a young woman, but I am learning. I am wondering if she has been taking advantage of me. I told her I realized I just need to live alone, and I offered to pay out the rest of my lease or 60 days' notice - she will not accept either or talk about it. She is being strange about me wanting to move out, which makes me feel like this is contingent on free child care/someone she can manipulate specifically rooming in the house? I am suspicious about how this has gone down and am wondering what I can do - I highly doubt the friendship is salvageable. Obviously I feel terrible.

Am I being over-dramatic, hyper-paranoid? This feels wrong.

But I backed off because I knew buddy wanted her. Well fast forward 7 months down the road and I showed up to her dad's for her graduation party. All my friends walked off to go smoke and she was there with buddies little brother. We started talking and she was mentioning things about how her mom is crazy and doing drugs, which I relate to, she started crying, and then went on to say how her boyfriend(my friend) doesn't do anything and she has to constantly clean after him as well as pay for some of his stuff. I went home later that night and she texted me saying that I didn't have to leave and thanked me for coming. The next day she started talking to me about some stuff with her mom and her living situation which ended up turning into how her boyfriend was hanging out with one of our friends, and how she wanted to hang out with both of us that day. From time to time around this period of time shed ask if she could come by to see my dog, which would of also included her boyfriend. Well whatever. A month later she texts me out of no where and asks if she can talk to me and told me I can't tell anyone about it. She goes on to tell me about how her boyfriend isn't doing anything, she cleans up after him, and pays for his stuff. She said she loves him but all his bad habits we're making her want to move to her dad's. I gave her advice and she talked about how she likes talking to me about things because I keep it ""real"" and that she likes that trait about me. Well she continued this conversation with sending me screenshots of their conversation about how she's moving out and she was telling me ""this is it"" and also sent me screenshots of messages she had with her stepmom talking about she doesn't even know if she's happy with him anymore. She continued to text me all day about the whole thing until ultimately they patched the problem up then she kind've kept her answers short until I stopped responding. I'm pretty sure my friend has no idea that we were texting at all in general and everytime when we all hang out she seems to have tension towards her boyfriend as well as saying my name more than normal, teasing me, asks me for help, and from time to time I catch her starring at me but I don't reciprocate.

435,"My dad used to work out of city, he was home for about one weekend in a month at most. My mother had a miscarriage when I was 7 and she became really depressed after that. She used to have episodes of distress where she didn't want to be around anyone and I was usually locked up in my room. Those years were terrible, I had no friends at school because my uniform was never ironed, my shoes were not polished, my hair were always messy. I had no one to talk to at home because my mother became distant from friends and relatives .

It might be because of this or because I was naturally an angry kid but I became really rude to everyone. When I was 8 or 9 I tried hitting a classmate with a metal geometry box, I verbally abused my teacher. I was suspended from school, my mother locked me in my room for an entire week. I used to be pissed off at everything and everyone. My father changed my school shortly after and I just became a recluse and didn't talk to anyone.

About 2 years after changing school my mother found the courage to join a local woman church club and it helped her alot. I started participating in sports. I played volleyball and soccer. The other kids didn't like me because I was rude but they tolerated me. I really enjoyed playing, one of my coach later suggested to practice my tone and be polite,he even told my parents to send me to a child psychiatrist because I didn't talk to anyone unless it was to insult them. I started working on my behavior and trying to improve. 

I was 14 when my little sister was born, my parents were happy. And then when I was 19, I moved to a university away from my city. I was really happy here, no one knew I used to go for therapy.. People thought I was nice, I made several friends, joined the soccer team. I have been living away from my family for about 2 years in the hostel only coming home for 2 to 3 weeks at most. 

During this outbreak our university closed and I came back home for 6 months. It felt weird, I felt like a stranger after being away for so long. I got really jealous of how much love my sister gets from both my parents. When i came back I used to play monopoly and ludo with her but now I just get angry whenever I play with her. This anger might partly be because I don't have friends of my age in my town, I haven't played soccer in 6 months.. I have been exercising but it's not the same.

437,"Hey everyone, not urgent but just an enquiry.

I'm 15 at the end of october and I'm looking to upgrade to a bigger bed. I currently have a single cabin bed (which we modified to be 2m high) which I'm sick of climbing up and down especially in a morning when I get up at 6,  aswell as always waking up with sore elbows or knees/feet from where I have whacked the wall. Also gets pretty frustrating when the duvet falls off the bed and you have to climb to get it back in the middle of the night. My room doesn't have a wardrobe so i have been looking at a gas lift queen bed (second hand and in good condition for $50) to get the extra storage space. 

I have drawn a full scale drawing with measurements and it all fits nicely and how I imagined. The only issue is convincing my dad. ( My mum agrees that it would fit and have enough storage.) 

The main points my dad puts forward are: 

● You dont have enough storage now so how is a bigger bed going to help (reminder that I don't currently have anything stored under my bed)
● He didn't have a bed other than a single until he was 18 and went to college
● I will have to adjust when I go to university as I most likely won't have a queen ( which I acknowledge and am totally okay with)


Also side note:
The bed would come out of money received as a gift for my birthday. We have a brand new queen mattress from the previous owner of the house that is okay to use, and a few queen duvets in the cupboard, so would only need to purchase covers and sheets (again not a problem)

441,"I’m completely heartbroken and sad. My favorite dog I’ve ever had bit our friendly neighbor in the face on Friday and I’m still saddened by the entire situation. 

Some background, our dog is seven and has never even as much growled at a human, let alone snapped or bit. He’s had his face and ears pulled on by toddlers and is considered the friendliest dog by our friends and family members. He weighs about 60 pounds but considers himself a lap dog and loves laying on people and being with people. 

First, the neighbor is OK. Sadly the bite did break skin, they went to the doctor immediately and the doctors used surgical glue for the wound. We’re going to pay for any medical expenses and the neighbor is in good spirits, although understandably shook a little bit. We’re good friends with these people so there’s no concerns of being sued or anything like that, and like I said we’ll be able to cover any medical expenses. 

The neighbor has seen/played with our dog before, not a lot but the two weren’t strangers. The dog was sitting on a chair and the neighbor got down at eye-level and was baby-talking the dog, and moving his face closer to his face (possibly for a kiss?). That’s when our dog growled, bit, and retreated upstairs with its tail between his legs. It all happened so fast and out of nowhere. Our dog knew he messed up and acted tired/upset/sad the rest of the night (we locked him in his cage for about two hours after the incident while we tended to our neighbor and took some time to ourself to be shocked). 

I know you’re not supposed to get in a dog’s face, although dozens and dozens of people have with our dog, there’s absolutely no excuse for his aggressive behavior and everyone in the room was completely floored by what took place. 

So, I guess my advice is what do I do? That dog was my best friend and now I’m kinda disgusted to look at him. I feel weird around him and things just don’t feel normal. My heartbreaks for my neighbor. I’ve been bitten by dogs in the past and that stuff sticks with you and even if you’re a big time animal lover like myself it’s always in the back of your mind when you’re around a new pet. It can be traumatic and it will be for my neighbor. 

I can’t believe I’m typing this but for the first time in seven years I just don’t want to be around my dog. Will that ever change? Do we consider putting him down or giving him away? I will never let that dog around someone besides my wife and I again after what he did to our neighbor, and that just kills me knowing anytime we have company over we’ll have to lock him away. The neighborhood kids can’t walk him or play with him anymore. Everything just changed in one incredibly bizarre in weird moment and I go from thinking this dog is my best friend and greatest animal on the planet to just not caring if he’s even around anymore. I hate this feeling and could really just use any advice possible. Again, he’s never been remotely hostile to anyone before, but this was a gnarly bite. The neighbor was so close to his jaw that the dog didn’t even really lunch, just opened his mouth and bit. Ugh, it’s a site and sound that’ll stay with me forever. I’m so thankful it wasn’t worse but still incredibly sad. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",13Sep2020,1

444,"I have a ""friend"" I met on reddit that frequently texts me whenever he's in distress and needs comfort/support. Other than that, we don't really talk much. I've recently grown annoyed by playing a psychotherapist role for him, especially after he didn't even bother to listen to me vent when I was obviously in distress. Instead, he just jumped to problem solving- aka telling me to move out (as if moving out is a thing you can decide in a day and be done with it tomorrow). My current situation simply doesn't allow me to do that, so all I can do is simply put up with it the best I can. I was hoping my ""friend"" would at least show interest into listening to me vent a bit (as I always did for him), but he didn't even bother asking what's wrong.

452,"Hello Guys,

I have been working as a marketing manger of a Ecom company in India for the past 1yr10months. This is my first job after my undergrad in management. I earn roughly 800usd per month here. The company is a blooming Unicorn startup and is planing an IPO yearly parts of next year. 

Last week I received a Job offer from my relatives in Accra,Ghana to come work for them there. They own a wholesale steel rods and sheets company there. The Job is very similar to what I am doing here and the destination is also Marketing manager. They are going to pay me 900 usd plus all expenses covered, everything from rent to bills to food to travel cost. But they would need me to come and work for a minimum of 2 years. The company is very small and has only about 15-20 employees. 

I am currently 21 years old and would like to peruse my MBA after 3-4 years. 

Right now I am very confused about whether to take the job or not. 


The thing is that it will be a completely new experience for me and I would get to explore and totally different market. And a completely different industry. But on the other hand if I take the job, I’ll be stuck doing the same thing for 2 years without the option to shift my job as I would be working in a completely new place with my relatives. Whereas I feel here in India I might have a slight chance of exploring new jobs at other companies or maybe after a few months or so get a better designation in the same company. 


I am even concerned about the lifestyle I might have there in Ghana as everyone I would be working with will at least be 10-20 years older than me. And since I’ll be working with the company in the outskirts of the capital, I might now find a lot of opportunities to get to know other people. 


One thing that also concerns me is that when I do appear for my MBA interviews, which would make a bigger impact, working at the same destination in a completely different market and industry or trying to get a better destination in the same or similar company where I have already been working for almost two years.

457,"Hi all, 

I would love some advice on my current situation at the moment from someone other than my mum (I think advice from objective minds might help)! 

In February this year my partners mother was diagnosed with lung cancer. At this current time, she is receiving palliative care, and we do not know how long we have left to spend with her. Relevantly, MIL is a smoker. 

In May this year my partner and I moved interstate to be back closer with both our families. We have been living with my parents while our house has been undergoing renovations.

In late June this year, we welcomed our beautiful baby  into the world. The first month was very difficult, we had very different parenting styles (I am much more “go with the flow” and I suppose “attached”). I feel my partner was very stressed about me, baby and mum and as we were both very tired this resulted in lots and lots of arguments. 

2.5 months on, we are still arguing. I am finding that my partners drinking is becoming more and more, he stays up very late each night drinking. Lately, he has been coming into the bedroom at early hours waking baby up. He falls asleep straight away leaving me to deal with an irritable baby. I have asked him to please stop, come to bed early or sleep on the couch multiple times to no avail.

Today, our little one was very irritable. I am worried something is wrong so I am a bit on edge and am still angry from the night before when he woke the baby up in the early morning so I did snap at him and told him to stop doing it. He has walked out and I haven’t heard from him since. 

I fully acknowledge that my hands are not clean. I do get angry and I do snap. However sometimes I feel I am justified as I dont get to sit around And drink/smoke to all hours without a care for anything, why should he? But I know that he is stressed so I mostly just let it go, it isn’t worth the argument. 

So- How can I communicate with my partner who is Clearly in a rough spot at the moment (very unwell mum, newborn responsibilities and probably uncomfortable living with my parents and isn’t able to go anywhere due to Covid restrictions) that I’m a bit upset at what he’s doing? I want to be supportive of him but the drinking, staying up and waking the baby, not helping as much with the baby as he could and the smoking (esp seeing what smoking has done to his mum) are making me very upset at him.",13Sep2020,1

459,"Hello

I live in a gated neighborhood. Everyone of my neighbors has gardens, but they are avergae big. 

A few weeks ago there was a horse sound to be head in the neighborhood. I had never heard if before in my 20myears of living here. My mom went to check it out and saw a horse in a horse moving car thing (excuse my english but those things you put horses in that you then attach to your car and drive around with). That was around noon. It was still standing in it in the evening. We had heard the sounds from Saturday on, checked on Sunday. 

It was gone on Monday when I went to check again.

Just now, as I was smoking my joint on my terrace, I hear the horse again. The first time I thought I hallucinated it but I’m certain it is there.

Should I go check? Today is crazy hot, sunny day, barely any clounds. The kind of hot that’s *hot* in the shade. If the horse is there, in the car thing, what do I do? Is that even allowed to keep in a horse in that thing in the sun for long periods of time? The reason I mentioned garden soze is because those neighbors do **NOT** have a garden fit for a horse and idk where it came from. 

They are also really rude people, the type of elderly couple that has lost all their joy in life and the only thing left for them to thrive on is call the police on a group of kids ‘making to much noise while using the public football field’ or the neighbors throwing a ‘loud party that continued past 23h’ - and loud here usually means you can hear feint sounds of people chattering if you lean out of your window.

i was perfectly okay with her ending our relationship because she felt betrayed and she basically cut me off and the guy because she was really angry. it was completely understandable. 

i’ve tried many times to reach out to her but she never really seemed to care about what i have to say. eventually she reached out to me through a mutual friend and said she needed time on her own because she felt that my apology wasn’t genuine. i gave her space and time because i was trying to be completely understanding of her feelings. 

around three months ago, my friend tells me that she reached out to the guy and now they’re friends again. 

i’m kind of upset about the whole thing because even though we were friends, he was just as much to blame as i was. i don’t understand why she forgave him more easily than she did me.

466,"Right now I work as a call in, in a daycare/kindergarten and I absolutely love working with the babies and toddlers, specifically ages 1-4. It gives me SO much energy, and time flies by. I can really have an 8 hour long shift where I’ve run around after toddlers, tickled babies, broken up fights, caught clumsy kids from falling off chairs and changed gross diapers all day and STILL be ready for another 5 hours. It’s fulfilling. I love when the kids come running in the morning, yelling my name and hugging me. Or when the shy babies’ faces light up when they see me enter the room, even though they don’t know me very well and would usually be fuzzy.

At all my other work places I’ve been so drained that I’ve sometimes cried on my way home. Not because something happened but just because I was so so tired. Now I jump up on my bike, ride home and do something productive afterwards.

Problem is that it’s a good pay right now because I’m 20 and still live at home. In 5 years time? Shitty pay and bad work conditions/benefits.

480,"Me and my now ex girlfriend met two and a half years ago, and lived together for most of that. We made an amazing team, I love her dearly. Our relationship was not perfect and we had a rocky start, but we always seemed to push through. Her family is amazing and my family loves her. 
Her reason for breaking up is that she doesn’t feel we are compatible, which a small part of me always felt the same from our rocky beginning. I had my doubts about our relationship, but I love her and I was pushing forward.
Yesterday I helped her pack all of her things and move out, and it was surprisingly therapeutic. We talked, packed, cried, packed some more, talked, cried, packed and so on for most of the day. Both of us felt it was very healing to be talking through our feelings together in a constructive way. We talked about all of our happy memories together and the things we appreciate about eachother. 
She did tell me she believes I am perfect, and I told her the same. We agreed we are just not perfect *for* eachother but are perfect for someone. 
We both have our issues, which we both acknowledge and take responsibility for. 
She is insistent that it was no singular action from me that led her to break it off, it was just how she felt or the lack of her feelings, and I do believe her. 


Even though this split up is healthy, not toxic and slightly mutual...both of us are a bit of a mess.
After living with your best friend for the better half of two years, suddenly not having them around is a strange feeling. 
If I had to experience a breakup, this is how I would have wanted it to be. But it’s not perfect, thats why I am here. 
I have lost 5lbs since Friday afternoon(I haven’t been able to bring myself to eat more than a slice of pizza) and I just feel dead inside, as well as haven’t been able to sleep in my empty bed. My life feels like someone hit the pause button. I have ups and downs, usually on my downs I’ll call my mom or hang out with my dad, but i have this pain that just lingers in my chest. When I’m feeling down, I have been trying to remind myself of the ways I agree with her decision and to keep telling myself that my heart isn’t the only one that’s broken, and that her decision is best for both of us. 
I have never cried this hard in all of my life. 

*I had these feelings deep in my gut that maybe her and I wouldn’t work out, and part of me knew it was coming to an end...this was just a lot sooner than I would have thought. But in a way, that’s better...because it ended before we could ‘hate’ eachother or develop any resentment.*

487,"Hey people its my first post here as i hsve posted the same to other subreddit I'm waiting from there as well , i felt lost and in need of some advice, so here i am!
So me(m22) and my gf(23) have been together for about 8 months, it's going well, we've been going on vacation together and doing staff together (i really really adore her), we have chemistry , of course there's been some arguments, but all in a healthy environment , she likes to communicate about many things in our relationship good and bad , and that is where i need advice. I don't mind communicating about our relationship (especially with her) but I don't take initiative and most of the time she is the one who starts expressing her feelings about a situation and so the conversation starts , me as a personal I'm not that expressive , even in situations that need to be talked i either ignore them or change the subject , i know that this is a very bad thing for a relationship not having a communication or not expressing yourself and i really want to change that about me because I think it will change me as a person and i wanna do better for my gf as i don't want her to feel as i dont want to express my feelings or my thoughts towards her.
For example yesterday we had a conversation and she replied to something i said (I think; 'yes yes keep eating so you get fatter and i eat you) and she expressed herself saying that it gets boring that i say the same things over and over , i was a lil hurt but mostly shocked by the sincerity of her words, i understood that she may feel that way BUT i answered very passive aggressively (like 'yeah alright talk to you tomorrow bye')  and she got very angry and i don't blame her by looking at the situation right now , saying that i didnt want to talk about the situation that troubles her and after I thought about it and wanted to talk she said that if she didn't mention it we would never talk about it , which it may be true i dont know. Anyway we talked the day after and told her that i don't to be like that and i want to change how i express my feelings and take initiative on some situations ,we had this conversation some times in the past and ive told her the same that i want ro communicate with her? express my feelings and take initiative on situations but as it seems i didn't have much progress although i thought i had and i want to change. So after all this information i just need advice on what to do, me, as a shy , akward and introvert person in a relationship with a person that i love and adore , i just want to improve on how i express my feelings my thoughts and to take better initiative on this relationship because the other half deserves as much , any thoughts?",13Sep2020,1
488,"admiring him etc.

I noticed it when she sent me a link to something on her twitter while we were FaceTiming. I didn’t care and just made fun of her for it. We laughed, and she said it was ok because it’s just a celebrity. I laughed and said “Ok, so I’ll post a picture of some female celebrity” and she said “NOOOO, Nooo” laughing, and then seemed kinda sad about me saying I was going to post pictures of some celebrity woman. So I just said uh huh and laughed a bit and we moved on from that.

It didn’t bother me, and that kind of stuff never has, until I was in the shower after we got off the phone. It came to mind and just seemed a bit immature. I’ve never thought of that kind of thing like that before, but for some reason her doing that was really a turnoff. She’s 22 and I’m 27 now, so maybe that’s where it’s coming from?

I don’t feel like it’s jealousy, I’ve had girlfriends who I’ve been closer to and more invested in talk about their celebrity crush and it never got to me. I’m thinking it was the sharing it on social media that just seemed juvenile. But I hate to think of it that way.

Or maybe it was the fact that she got bothered about the thought of me doing it, while she’s actually doing it.

490,"Hello

To start with TL/DR - toxic team I hired tells boss a bunch of lies and exaggerations about me, get me demoted, and continue to gossip. Should I approach management or the team on the floor directly or let it go?

Details: I work in an industry that's both booming right now but also has a high turnover rate. I've been with the company almost 10 years and have the most seniority of any employee in my position, and more seniority than most in my building. I was promoted to department lead a little over 2 years ago when ours moved. Within 6 months of that promotion and no real management experience, we had almost a complete department turnover (due to being purchased by corporate) and I hired a whole new staff.

After that there were issues of gossip and bullying on the floor, I thought though over time they were largely fixed. I personally began to suffer severe burnout, I know I wasn't performing my job as I should be, and questioned stepping down numerous times but didn't want to ""ruin my career"" and stall any further advancement.

Out of nowhere my boss sat me down with no prior warning that there were problems, told me a bunch of problems the team was ""globally "" having with me (that I know were linked to 3 specific individuals who are the main culprits of bullying and gossip) and that were largely flat out lies. Such as me yelling at people who are the nicest employees (I've never yelled at a coworker in my entire working life), me calling people fucking idiots to their face, things like that. No chance was given for me to defend myself, these lies were outright believed without even talking to me as the whole point of the meeting was to demote me. My boss even admitted these issues would likely not be occurring with our old team.

Overall I agreed it was the right choice for me personally and we did have a long discussion about that, I completely owned up to the downfalls I felt were real and I was having, but the way it happened was very off-putting.

Long story short that was over a year ago and I feel things have been much better. We've had a complete management turnover and I've voiced to new management how frustrating and hurtful the whole experience was. I believe in voicing concerns and then moving on. The team has been getting along much better as well. 

I've been experiencing extreme burnout again so am currently on a 2 week vacation to clear my head. I noticed a work email about gossip not being tolerated on the floor so it must have been getting bad again.

Had dinner with a coworker the other night and learned that a few works ago some people were spreading lies about me again. Completely absurd, that myself and 2 others were ganging up and bullying our receptionists, of all things. I know I was in a very negative headspace but never would I ever bully a coworker, especially our receptionists who are all amazing and have hard jobs. I can't even think of any recent instance where maybe I was in a bad mood and got innapropriately short with anyone. 

My goal when going back to work is to start with a fresh and positive attitude.

Sorry for the long ramble, but my question is - should I ignore this incident since its largely stopped and just try to start ""fresh"" When I go back with a clean slate and positive attitude? Should I approach my boss now, who is always very supportive of me, and vent my frustrations with ongoing lies that have largely cost me my job position in the past? Especially since punishment for these employees has been largely non-existant. Or since I have an idea of the team members but not definitive proof, should I just say something directly on the floor such as ""I've heard such and such, if I have made people feel like I am being innapropriate or rude to them I apologize as that is never my intention, but also I am very tired of hearing gossip about myself that is both untrue, detrimental to my job, and extremely hurtful to myself""? (Side note its a small team, at most 4 members on the floor at any given time.)

EDIT TO ADD: My boss directly above me is well aware of the behavior of these employees and agrees they can't be trusted as far as they can be thrown. Unfortunately upper administration is going through some upheavals so things are not handled as best as they can be at times. Also we're suffering national staffing shortages and they are skilled at their job, so I think a lot is allowed to slide out of desperation.

I do not fear retribution from management at all. I know that even if they hear about this, they wouldn't believe it. My bigger frustration is not fear of getting in trouble for this, but anger at my coworkers.

As to why I stay at this job, I have built my whole career here. I love the job, love the majority of my coworkers, and take great pride in the work we do. I'm well compensated for my job and likely would not find a better paying position. I also realize everywhere has drama.",13Sep2020,1
491,"I've been in a low mental health state for a while and am coming out of it slowly. My parents want to help by showing me what my life could be like out of high school and to strive for.

My mum suggested maybe trying to be a mental health nurse and going to uni for that seeing as i'm familar in the topic and it involves biology. I think it's something that i would like to do. I care about others mental health and want to help them any way i can but i'm hesitant, i'm scared i'll get stuck doing something i hate and won't be able to get out.

But over the months he has shown me that he doesn't really trust me and thinks I'm lying all the time even though I really don't like lying, suck at lying and don't do it. He always accuses me of cheating or making out with people when he isn't there or talking to other guys behind his back. I don't do any of that. I know people cheated on him before and maybe that's why he's acting that way but because I have seen so many people say things like ""if they accuse you of it for no reason they're probably projecting, if they're overly jealous they are probably cheating"" etc etc and it has been worrying me a lot. Once I asked him if he would ever cheat and he got really mad (he has some anger issues) and says he feels betrayed just by me asking that.

505,"It's pretty complicated, so I'm just gonna try and keep it to one thing. 

My girlfriend and I have had a very rocky relationship, but we've both agreed to improve for one another. She agreed to try to control her anger, and I agreed to be less sensitive. 

My girlfriend has a long history of getting extremely confrontational over very small things. She can't let trolls go, she has to feed them. When I tell her they're just trolls and that she's just making them worse by responding, she says ""I don't care"", or ""Someone needs to tell them off"". She also gets upset with me if I don't speak up. 

We play a game together quite frequently. It's a MOBA, so obviously gotta work together or doomed to fail. 

I occasionally make bad judgements during the matches, and she gets upset. I made a judgement call to help her get a buff, and she started getting very upset because I had inadvertently led the opposing team right into that buff with us, resulting in us both getting killed. 

Now, criticism is fine. Constructive criticism is fine. But my girlfriend has a very bad habit of picking at things, making you feel small and really stupid for making decisions. She gets loud, aggressive, and mean. It's a long distance relationship, so when I see her in person, she's considerably nicer and less aggro. 
When I made that mistake, she had already criticised me for jumping into the fight a couple of other times. Rather than just saying ""you probably shouldn't have done that"" or ""ouch, bad move"" or something, she jumps straight to ""why would you do that? What's wrong with you? You really shouldn't have done that, that was really stupid"", she piles the negativity on, keeps harping at you. She does it with other players, but always through text chat. With me, it's through voice. 

I usually don't say much, I just apologise, say I'll do better, and try to follow through. This time, I'd already kind of had enough of her harping on me, because she spent 30 seconds getting angry at me, and when I tried to tell her I was just trying to help, she said ""you should've known I was just trying to get it sneakily, I didn't need your help"". No.matter what I said, she kept dismissing it, kept calling it excuses and making me feel small. 

So I called her out. I told her ""can you just relax. It's just a game. It's just a game. There's no reason for you to get so angry."" I raised my voice a bit (I didn't shout, I just raised it so that I was speaking over her - I know this really doesn't help.anyone, but I tried very hard to apologise. She just wasn't having it. 

She got upset, said ""fine, I'm done"" and then left the game, my teammate surrendered, and so did I. 

I've had issues like this before. Most times she only talks to me again when I apologise. But I refused to do so, I told her very nicely that I wanted her to think about how she would feel if I spoke to her that way. I told her good night, that I loved her, and that I was there if she wanted to talk. She didn't respond. I sent her a number of messages today, mostly checking in because she's had some issues recently where she's felt like I've been somehow distant (we spend hours together, pretty much our entire evenings are spent together, 5 or 6 hours). She didn't respond to a single one. The only time she sent me a message was when I tried to call her. She sent me a single message back ""I'm busy"".

Not sure what I do here. I've tried quite a few things to change things. But it seems like every time I confront her, she flips it on me, says I'm too sensitive, that if I make mistakes, she's gonna call me out on them, that I need to be willing to accept her. 

TL; Dr: I think I simply stood up to my girlfriend for telling me off during a game, but now she won't speak. I don't want to apologise, because I feel as though I'd be just letting her know it's okay to walk over me. What do I do?",13Sep2020,2
506,"Hi all, first time posting here. 

I’m 25M. My ex-girlfriend and I were together for 4 years, for the second half of high school and 2 years after. We broke up right before I turned 20 and we haven’t talked since, with the exception of one quick conversation on my 20th about 3 weeks after we broke up. It’s been over 5 years now.

Her mom and my mom met each other through us, and remained friends after we broke up. My mom told me a few years ago when ex’s mom was diagnosed with cancer, and just shared with me a few days ago that she passed away. 

I wasn’t planning on saying anything but for some reason my conscience is nudging me to send a nice message of condolences. But I keep going back and forth. 

Here are some reasons why I feel I shouldn’t: As stated before, I haven’t really spoken to ex since we broke up. The breakup was pretty rough, unilaterally initiated by me, and caught her off guard. Looking back I could have handled it way better and it hurt her a lot. I don’t know if I’m someone she wants to hear from at all. I’m also in a happy relationship of several years now and I know it would probably make my girlfriend uncomfortable for me to reach out to ex, even if just to offer my sympathies. Neither of us are really the type to stay friends with previous romantic partners and I totally get where my gf is coming from not being completely comfortable with it. 

Here’s why I feel like maybe I should: Her mom really was one of the kindest , most joyful people I’ve ever met. We interacted quite a lot given that ex and I both lived with our parents most of the time we were together. I saw her mom pretty much any time I visited and she was never anything but over-the-top kind and welcoming to me. I also kind of feel like if my mom passed away I’d appreciate sentiments from anyone talking about how she impacted them, even if that was a person I hadn’t expected to hear from/who my last interaction with them didn’t go well. 

What would you do, Reddit? Write a nice message and send it off with no expectations, or leave it be and move on? Like I said my conscience is kind of nudging me to say something but I don’t want to do anything that would make ex-gf feel worse, or that would make current gf uncomfortable. 

Thanks in advance.",13Sep2020,1

She’s used like 20 numbers to get him to be with her again, and eventually she stopped contacting him. She made accusations such as he assaulted her, he abused her, and this guy is a gentle giant. 

5 years later, he’s been with me for two years. He has never hurt me, or anything. We were on a trip together and he told me she tried to contact him again, claiming someone told her that he beats me (which isn’t true at all). She contacted me and said “you need to get away from him, he hurts people. He assaulted me and he’s going to do the same to you. Someone told me he beats you. You need to leave it’s not worth it.” I blocked her immediately and then he proceeded to talk to her on his account. I was there and she kept saying things like “you have my clothes.

It is impossible for my mind to form an honest narrative because two contradictory opinions seem true at the same time. I have no idea what's happening and is there a way I can help fix my friendship? It is the best thing in my life.",13Sep2020,1
526,"I want to be 100% clear about something right away. Leaving him is not an option. I’m also not proposing to him. 

I’m the one that makes the money in our relationship. We have been together 2 and 1/2 years and his sister had only been with her boyfriend for a year and a half and is two years younger. She just get engaged two days ago... and I’m not going to lie, I cried for two days when I found out mostly because there have definitely been times I thought it was coming but I was left disappointed and frustrated. I am,of course, very happy for his sister and her boyfriend but I want that for my boyfriend and I. When I brought it up to my boyfriend and said something along the lines of “that should be us” he said, “I’m sorry. you know I really want to but I can’t afford stuff right now” which I totally get. 

I do not know if I believe in throwing a huge party. The idea of getting married has always been attractive to me but having a wedding has always given me so much anxiety. Walking down the isle to a big crowd scares me, I don’t have any friends to be in my wedding party... just my sister and my boyfriends sister (embarrassing, I know), I don’t like to dance and neither does my boyfriend, the money part of it scares me. 

At the same time, I have this huge fear that I’ll regret having a small wedding and I have the worst FOMO. This is the only thing tying me to the idea  of a big wedding. That and the photographs, the fact that my boyfriend wants a big wedding and the fact that his mom has said she doesn’t think people who have small weddings last (I think sometimes that’s true but I think other factors come into play). 

I’m the past my mom used to freak out when I used to joke about eloping but I think my parents have kind of  jumped on my side a little more. My mom has said that traditionally weddings didn’t used to be this huge to do and that the idea of having a big wedding is fairly recent so that shouldn’t be the reason millennials do not get married. My dad has never been against it. When I used to jokingly (but seriously) tell my dad I was going to elope he used to laugh and say “well I’m fine with that! You are a smart girl”. 

So how do I suggests a small wedding. At this point he could propose to me with a ring pop and I’d say yes.",13Sep2020,1
527,"Throwaway because it's kinda personal. So I'm a 22M and I met my first ever best friend (also M but a couple years younger than me) almost ten years ago. We grew up together and were very close, ours was kinda like a bromance, to the point that I literally suffered and panicked when he was away for a few days. I think he's the only person I've ever truly loved. We were just friends (he's not into guys) but I couldn't stay away from him and he was the same, at least at first. Some of our common friends warned me that he might be gay because he was too attached to me, but I slowly realized the gay guy was me all along. He basically helped me coming out, so at some point he knew I was into guys and didn't really give a shit.

A few years ago, after he moved out and I graduated, our relationship kinda cooled down. Long story short, it's been three years since I last saw him. I still followed him for some time on social media, and he's changed a lot since we drifted apart. He's not the same person, he has a different group of friends, he's athletic, social and drives a damn scooter. Exactly the opposite from that awkward, chubby and solitary kid I knew and was sooo in love with. This caused me severe anxiety attacks and a feeling of unworthiness that went on for years, I tried filling it with other guys but I failed because I was still thinking about him. These last few years have been atrocious, I hated myself for losing a friend AND a person I love. It's like I suffered twice as much as I was supposed to. At some point I even pretended he was dead as a coping strategy.

Fast forward to now, I'm mostly over it, or so I thought, but a few days ago my two current closest friends, who also knew him and recently got in touch, decided to invite him out with us TONIGHT. They mostly did it because I kinda told them I would have liked to confess my feelings to him, which was such a stupid thing to say in hindsight. Yes I'm an idiot. Now I'm panicking because we exchanged a few messages and I'm afraid i might not be over him afterall. My heart skips a beat every time I receive a message from him. And I hate myself for still feeling that way.

I don't know how to play this. Do I confess my feelings to him tonight? Do I just enjoy the night and pretend nothing is happening? Do I confess and then buy fake papers and move to the north pole to start a new life?",13Sep2020,2

531,"Ok so things are honestly getting very scary right now. There have been too many unusual things happening for it all to be a coincidence and yet it could all just be weird timing idk. So a few weeks ago, my parents got into a big fight with our neighbor about land and them always being in our backyard when they themselves go crazy when any one of us just barely crosses the boundary for their property. The incident occurred when the neighbor came to our front door at night telling my parents how tired they were of having to remind us of their boundary and how when my parents inquired about getting a fence for ourselves, they got mad, assuming we wouldn’t go through the necessary regulations when doing that and that we’d build it on their side. My parents got even madder and told them to mind their business about the topic and to get off our doorstep. I wasn’t there for the entire thing but basically it turned into a screaming match and ended with both my parents cussing them out, them telling us to just make sure we have our papers in order(basically a version of go back to your country), my dad telling them that he’d “fuck them up”, and them retreating back to their house. Next day, my dad is out cutting the lawn and he and I both notice that a lot more cars than usual are pulling into our neighborhood only to turn back around and drive off. Our house is in the type of neighborhood that it’s pretty small so it’s not abnormal that cars do that. But in this one day, 8 or 9 (that we know of) did the same thing and in such a short time frame. They would come in, slow down on their way out in front of our house,  and then drive away. Later before finishing up the lawn, my dad turned his car around so that his license plate wouldn’t be facing the street because I think me and him were thinking the same thing. Another thing I noticed was that my neighbor kind of very much kept to themselves after everything. I know that it won’t seem like anything special but I’m home more often than anyone else and they are a lot of the time, within their fence messing with their dogs, maintaining their lawn, or messing with their truck. After the fight, I didn’t see them for weeks outside. I guess that’s not completely crazy especially with the things that were said but it just stuck out to me that they seemingly didn’t do any of the normal things they usually do that I know of. And now last night, my parents call to me, asking if I was expecting anybody to come over and it’s because someone for an extended amount of time was out in front shining their headlights on our house. We couldn’t see who or even what kind of vehicle it was. It went on so long and late, my parents ended up going to bed instead of waiting it out until they left but they were still worried. Nobody went outside to check it out and it was all very weird hearing about in the morning. If it wasn’t clear, I think my neighbor is behind the car things. I don’t think it’s them personally but maybe they have friends who would be willing to do crazy shit for them??  We are not aware of any special information about our neighbor like crime history, their past career, etc. We are a BLACK family and with the way the country is right now, the police are not a realistic option for us so please. Any advice or if anyone recognizes the car thing as a scare tactic, I guess, please lmk. I’m thinking we need to research our state’s gun laws tbh but I wanted to tell this just in case there are other precautions that can be taken.",13Sep2020,2

Me and that ex stayed friends after we broke up, and a month ago he started saying me, my bff, and him should all hang out.
 At first things were normal, but I noticed he was flirting with her. Basically when he started doing that I talked to both of them, and told them that if they would be together, it would hurt me.
They both said that there's nothing like that going on and she (my bff) said that she would never do that to me.
Well on her birthday they traveled together, I was supposed to go too but he (ex) said that ""there isn't enough room in the car"" so I couldn't go.
Now they're fucking dating. All of our mutual friends knew before me. She (bff) said that ""she thinks he might be into her"" and asked me if I'm okay with it.
I already told both of them I'm not, they promised they wouldn't do it. But they did, and they hid it.

I love her so much, but I'm so pissed and honestly hurt that I can't be around her, or him. I don't want our friendship to end but I don't know how to speak to her without remembering the situation and getting mad.

544,"Since day one, this women has been so caddy and impolite to me. She dated my boyfriend’s brother on and off for 6 years. They recently reconciled following a one year break. I met the family at about the same time she reentered the family dynamic. 

From the get go, she’s been belittling and condescending, talking down to me and dismissing what I say. In conversations, she won’t even look me in the eye or if I say something, she will literally stop listening and have a conversation with someone else. If I say something about a member of the family, she’s quick to correct me on my view or experience and in this weird power move exert her authority or sort of prove she knows the family better than I. Or at least that’s how it comes off. I have no idea what her intentions are. 

We were discussing politics with the family and the conversation got heated. My boyfriends cousin (42/m) is pretty closed minded and said some outlandish and offensive things. I stood my ground and got worked up. We weren’t disrespectful to one another but we did get loud. But regardless, we broke the tension with laughs and it wasnt a negative experience at all. Well, my bf’s brothers gf left the conversation and started crying. I approached her to ask what was going on and if I did something to hurt her. I really wasn’t expecting her to say “yes” because this cousin was saying some really hurtful things that I know she’s sensitive about and has strong feelings about. She said yes. I was the source of her emotions because she didn’t like the way that I was talking to this cousin about politics. She felt I needed to come from a place of calm and educating. 

I apologized for getting worked up. I explained that I feel very strongly about these issues but I hear what she says and appreciate her saying something because I never would have known otherwise. She obviously wasn’t having my apology and seemed thrown off by my response. Then she told me to stop apologizing. 

I fully recognize the best way to change minds is with respectful discourse. However that wasn’t the venue to do this and regardless of what I say, this cousin isn’t going to listen to his cousins new gf and say “I’ll go ahead and change my 36 years of political views because this woman told me so.”

I left crying because I am exhausted at trying to get this woman to like me. I don’t understand why I was the target of her emotions when this cousin was practically saying that women shouldn’t have the same rights as men. Why didn’t she get upset at him?? I care about my partners family and their perspective of me. I’m afraid that I’m going to be labeled as this person whose rude to my bf’s brother’s gf. I’m afraid of how this relationship will affect my relationship with my partner’s family. 

I don’t get it. I’m trying so hard to get her to like me but I also don’t want to put myself in a position to be just disrespected in every interaction. 

Is there something I’m not seeing?? Help me understand.",13Sep2020,1
545,"He was my best friend all throughout high school, the most uplifting, funny guy you've ever met. However, due to several personal issues piling up on him he slipped into a really terrible depression. He is now unable to talk, except to quietly whisper one word answers to questions that have an obvious answer. He will usually not do what you tell him to (unless his dad is there and tells him to - he usually only listens to his dad). He can't look you in the eye, and he has a permanently depressed look on his face. He is also very tense and seems to have a lot of anxiety. I've tried to communicate with him through writing, but even that he can't do. 

So the problem is that he is legally an adult and physically healthy, so the parents are of the impression that they cannot simply take him to a doctor because he will not consent to that. He doesn't want help. He works out with his dad, goes on runs with me, he is even learning to code and play guitar. But clearly, it can't go on like this. Not only is it extremely concerning how he can't talk and is obviously in a horrible place emotionally, but his father can't do anything anymore because he has to be with my friend 24/7 since he is the only one that can get him to do things.

They have tried to take him to a therapist, but he won't talk to one. He is taking low dosage SSRIs as of right now - Prozac, since about two weeks. It has not made a visible difference yet. ",13Sep2020,1

We were talking some time by chat, we get along very well since the nearly start. He asked me to do a call or video-call with him one day of the next week and I accepted, but I'm pretty insecure about it. As I said before I'm from Spain, so English is not my first language and to be honest I'm not good with English at all, especially when it comes to listening or speaking. It's really hard for me understand a native speaker when is talking because I'm not used to it and also it's really hard for me trying to talk fluently and pronunciate well.

553,"Quick backstory: My youngest brother has low-functioning Down Syndrome and Autism as well as clubfoot (meaning he has trouble walking due to curviture in the bone structure of his feet). He is 10 years old, but, due to his health issues, has a mental capacity equivalent to that of an infant

We recently moved into a larger apartment in the same complex, meaning we are now on the second floor. Every time my younger brother walks, it sounds like a thudding noise due to his clubfoot. We have tried teaching and correcting his walking behavior, but  we have found it impossible due to the way his feet naturally curve in as well as the down syndrome making it hard to convey the importance of walking quietly. 

The night we move in, the woman in question knocks on our door asking if we can quiet him up. We explain his situation, and she leaves. Now, considering he is 10yo, he is in school, meaning he is asleep by 9:30pm and wakes up around 8am. 

Yesterday, I found out she has officially filed a noise complaint claiming he is stomping and running around at all hours of the night (impossible considering his bedtime and the fact that he has sleep medication).

556,"I was 14 when my dad's favourite youngest sister gave birth to her first daughter. The second one followed suit a couple of years later. It was the first time I had seen my father cry actual tears. My dad was super close with his family like a group of best friends. He had 6 siblings and every Tuesday he was over at his middle sister's house to chat. Every Saturday he would go see his mom and inbetween those times he would go to monthly group family events. We always got invited to weddings, Christmas parties, etc. and my dad never turned them down.

When I was 16 my dad unexpectedly died out of nowhere. No one saw it coming. I remember seeing my two youngest cousins walk up to me for a hug as you do when everyone is walking out of a funeral and they were crying. Not tantrum crying, but actual pain of losing someone special crying.

After my dad died it's like his family wrote me off out of nowhere. I was no longer invited to parties or anything. I honestly have not said a word to my grandmother since I was 16. She's 87 now and when I try to phone her she doesn't answer. I tried to add my dad's youngest sister on Facebook when I had one years ago, but she never accepted and I don't know why.

I can see my cousins are now grown up and in college. They have private Instagram accounts which for some reason they won't add me on. I was only able to follow one of my cousin's profiles because it wasn't private and she just posts music on there  but hasn't recently.

560," I owe someone money and it's killing me.  


I used to take guitar lessons from a local teacher. Where live in a third world country, and I paid 50 US dollars a month upfront for weekly lessons. I could have paid per lesson, but it'd have been more expensive.  


I took lessons with her for about 4 years. At the start of this year I had a lesson for which I didn't pay, which has happened before in rare events but then I just paid later, keeping with the weekly meetings. This year however, I didn't, because soon after that I got very busy and I postponed resuming the lessons, the covid strike and I stopped going for months.  


So essentially, I owe this person the equivalent of 15 US dollars.  


Now here's why this is a problem:  
(1) I don't like owing money, I want to pay back.  
(2) If I call only to say I want to pay that, after such a long time, it will seem very insecure, awkward, and strange, and she VERY likely say it doesn't matter. But as long as I don't, she probably remembers me as the guy who owes her money.  
(3) I want to take lessons again, but with different teaches who lives more close to my home and plays the music style I want to learn, but I feel obligated to going back my old teacher because of the money I owe to her.  


These are probably all my options:  


(1) Call her and ask to pay her back.  
(2) Go and take lessons with her, even though I do not want to take lessons with her anymore.  
(3) Take lessons with her for a month, pay the debt, and the switch to the new teacher.  
(4) Do nothing.  


What should I do and why? Do I have other options?",13Sep2020,3

I don't know how to tell my mom that I don't want to go because the last time I said that I thought it was good that we went later durin the one week break so I would have a chance to do stuff with my friends. She had a breakdown and started to cry and scream that she didn't want to live if we wouldn't go.



How should I go about this?



Edit: my dad is cool with letting me stay but my mom thinks that the idea of staying home comes from him and she doesn't want me to discuss this with him because they will start big fights.",13Sep2020,0
564,"My friend who we will call Sofia cause I don't want to name drop in case her parents go looking is being neglected and abused for being a ""whore"". She lives in Kentucky and is a minor but the person she is dating is the same age but in another country. I have met them and they are legit, I know how to tell people if they are faking or not. He has given his personal information to her and they both are trustworthy. Most of her life she has lived with her biological dad, but just this year living with a stepmother. Her stepmom seemed very sweet but had small flaws like calling her weak for crying and not being good emotional support. Her father on the other hand is a crazy person, he has said he would kill people if it wasn't illegal and has laughed at my friend's trauma for ""not being that bad"". For the sake of everyone being on the right page, my friend has been through physical abuse with her biological mother. She has also been sexually assaulted countless times and her mother is a crazy feminist! Well, ""Sofia"" recently started a new relationship with a guy who lives in another country, her stepmom was very happy for her and thought nothing of it. She let them meet her boyfriend and see him so she could verify that this was in fact was a real person. Fast forward a month later and they start getting sexually intimate, Sofia is 16 and her boyfriend is also 16. Kentucky law says 16 for consent law but I am not sure how the sexual activity for minors works... Well another month passes and one-day shes offline on discord, I thought maybe she is busy but a week passes, and I start to worry. She then told us she was grounded but I didn't know the full story until I read her twitter... She writes "" S/o to my stepmom for giving me a beer to drink while I talked to my dad lol. S/o to her changing her mind and saying I’m not allowed to visit and she won’t talk to me ever again lol. S/o to her for telling me it’s my decision but insulting and mocking me everyday lol."" I got pissed off reading this, as any friend would. The last bit of the thread reads "" S/o to my dad who calls me a whore lol. S/o to my dad who barely talks to me anyways and now only talks to me to insult me or my mom lol. S/o s/o""   
I am honestly scared for her, she has no other close family for her. I live in Texas so it's kinda far and I am living with my dad so I cannot even try to take her in. She got caught sexting and is now being neglected and verbally emotionally abused for this? Like her parents don't understand the morals of being a teenager, which again she can't have sex if her significant other is in another state!   
I know this is a weird request but does anyone have any advice to help her get out of the situation? She has no family in her state because they live in Missouri and her biological mother is crazy while her grandma still sees good her dad. Could she run away and maybe get help somehow? I want to help guide her out but she has no phone right now but only twitter to contact me. Please please give advice I am so worried...

566,"I love my family and I’m grateful for them but they’re also just so incredibly toxic to my well being. I can’t wait to leave home. 

I’m literally typing this as my dad cooks us breakfast. They can be loving but 

I don’t know what it feels like to have a normal family that’s not emotionally abusive and toxic


They’re always projecting their insecurities and worries on to me. I’m 21 and they don’t want me driving, dating, bike riding, taking the dog out for a walk, or any basic human right. It’s insane how over protective they are. My sister and I are both in our 20s and they still track us on this life360app. 

My dad is literally psycho and has an awful temper. He’s always having outburst and it’s literally like a fucking toddler having a temper tantrum. 

I think he has some serious issues. He’s only cool when he’s all fucked up on a Friday night. That’s the only time I ever wanna talk to him. And even then he’s too drunk he barely makes any sense and won’t remember the conversation the next day anyways. 

He is also such an asshole and is so negative and pessimistic. It’s taxing being around him for more than 5 minutes, let alone the last 21 years of my life. He’s always judging other people and can’t go one minute without complaining/ranting about something. We can’t even go to dinner as a family without him complaining about something. You can’t even watch TV for 2 minutes without him complaining. 

 It’s unbearable to listen to. He comes home from work and complains rest of the day, repeating himself over and over and over and beats a dead horse. If someone or something is bothering him ITS ALL HE TALKS ABOUT. 

He’s impossible to please. I’ve given up. He’s always gonna complain and judge no matter what I do. 


I feel like all this stuff has really fucked with my brain over the years. It’s taken a toll on me over the years. 

I can’t wait to get the fuck out of this house and live my own life without them trying to micromanage everything. 

But I also can’t help but feel guilty. I can’t imagine keeping contact with my dad after I move out and I feel so bad about it.

The guilt is gonna eat me alive whether I keep contact with him or not.",13Sep2020,1
567,So that happened and I feel little to no worth anymore. I still love him but I feel like it would happen again since he said he didnt want to tell me out of fear of loosing me. Yet he kept them the day after he drank going into the evening and if I didnt find out nothing would have been brought up. Is there anything i can do to make things better?,13Sep2020,1
568,"Yeah so last night I smoked weed for the first time at a friends house. I hit it once and didn’t feel anything so I hit it again. I noticed my arms started feeling really strange and then I started feeling dizzy. I was calm at first but then I got horribly exhausted and slowly became less and less able to move. Then it got really bad, I thought I could still think straight but that changed and I essentially completely lost control of what I was thinking about. 

I closed my eyes and saw images of random shit. I remember seeing like spinning pliers and pool tables that turned into hearts. I was there for two hours but honestly is just felt like I lost my mind for 10-20 minutes. Does this happen to people that smoke for the first time? Did I hit it too hard? Was there something wrong with the weed?

This was easily one of the most terrifying experiences I’ve had in a long time. I just want some answers. Oh and I threw up like 7 times or so.",13Sep2020,1
569,"I have been single for my whole life. For some reason, I can't get my mind off finding someone who I can be in a relationship with. I may or may not have depression I haven't been diagnosed by my therapist yet. But I do feel sad about it all the time. My self-esteem is low after being bullied most of my life all the way up to high school. I was always told I was ugly or just bullied and messed with in elementary and middle school. I stopped getting bullied in high school but the damage was already done. My self-esteem was good during 9th grade and I didn't really care for relationships, I thought they were cringe or something I don't remember my reasons. But later on, my closer friends started dating and I got an up-close look as to what relationships were like. And they seemed fun. I wanted to cuddle and I wanted to have a close dynamic like with a girl like my friends did.  This became one of the things that was a priority. My goal for 10th grade was to at least have a date to homecoming. I didn't get a date. I think I asked 4 people and they all said no. I did get told by one girl that she would go with me, only for her to say she couldn't go a week before and she went with another guy. And that was a blow lemme tell you. I couldn't figure out why she would go with me and then lie just to go with someone else. I kinda stopped talking to her but my esteem was just in the dumps because the one goal I had wasn't met.  I think up to now I've taken a liking of like 4 or 5 different girls. like 3 over quarantine. All of them didn't think of me how I thought of them. And at this point, I'm just wanting to know what's wrong with me.  Maybe I'm ugly. Maybe it's my personality. I've posted many am I ugly posts on Reddit so you can check those out.  This is my self-assessment I know for a fact I'm a nice guy. Not like the ones who you see on r/niceguys I'm just a genuinely nice person to everyone. Not just girls I'll do anything for someone to be happy or feel better and I care about everyone. I know I'm not owed anything and I don't think that way thankfully. I also can tell I'm very negative. Probably a good reason why some girls may not like me. My self-esteem literally makes me bring myself down every day and I always open up to whoever I'm talking too, no matter if it's the girl I like now or just my best friends. I also know I probably get attached too easily. I always talk to girls with the intention of having a new friend. And most of the time I end up liking them :\\.  I can't get the idea of finding someone out of my head. Some of my friends kinda mess with me for not having a gf and it's annoying. My siblings talk about me for not having one yet. My mom always asks me why I don't have one. I guess one reason for wanting one is to have all of that stop. But really I just want to share all of those experiences and feel loved and love someone the way they do me. Some of my friends have been telling me that it's not worth it because of how I overthink things and how relationships take up a bunch of effort and I'd be better off focusing on school which is probably true. Can anyone please convince me that I don't need a gf. Rereading this it's all over the place. So sorry about that. Please take the time to read it and I'd love your advice.",13Sep2020,1
570,"From the very beginning my husband and I have always had issues. We married in our twenties him some what older by five years. He has always been pretty selfish and myself I am overly selfless also a problem. I expect people that are supposed to love and care about me to do the same. Well long and behold the two did not mesh, so I couldn’t take the selfishness anymore. I would cry every night and think maybe I am honestly over reacting. 



Anyhow no matter how much I try to just make it work I always ended up really sad and emotionally exhausted. So I left moved back home and for three months I was healing and moving on I was actually alright most days without him. Well we ended up meeting up one day to exchange gifts I even gave my ring back. He wanted to keep it he said, and said he did not want a divorce. I wasn’t amused I knew exactly where we both stood it would never work. Well it’s like the devils fate brought us back together. 




When the person who was supposed to take me to Surgery canceled. He was the only choice and I have to say he was willing. He took me made sure I was okay he still went to work the same day but again I already assumed that. Well boom he didn’t want me to leave I was also enjoying the time spent with one another. Well a month goes by and I feel the same shitty way I once felt previously. Nothing mattered to him and what I also needed ever. It hurts feeling like you do not feel cared for by someone you want to care about you. 



He promised me he would take me on a date to make things right well part of it. Well we took my dog to the park and he seen random people playing basketball he wanted to go play I said sure. Here two hours later 8pm he’s sweaty, I’m tired my dog is so ready to go home. I’m not going to lie I was mad and felt again the selfish man is here once again well he never really left I suppose. So he apologized, took me home and promised me next week. So in the mean time I went and bought him a new Basketball so he could play when he has time off. 




Well folks if you have followed along this far next week well that’s today’s you already guess that though you sneaky advicers you. We went shopping for something he needed and of course I was willing to go. The item was large so he asked to use my car because the seats go down. Not a problem. Well we go to put it in the car and no lie he’s no help he looks at me and goes please help. I did and I used all my muscles I had to shove it in my car. So I’m hot and frustrated and embarrassed while other men are watching me put this heavy shit in my car. 




We both get in the car and he asked why are you mad...usually I keep my thought to myself but honestly I said exactly how I felt. “I wanted you to do the heavy lifting not me” he was really offended by that and just said fuck you nothing out of the ordinary really. And told me not to talk to him and that he doesn’t want me anymore and he doesn’t want me speaking to him. And I said of course you would do anything to not having to take me on a date and keep your promise. And he said yeah. So once again I’m going to Outback by myself because I’m all dressed up and ready. Advice was I wrong should I have not said anything?",13Sep2020,2
572,"I’m 23 years old and on paper I have everything going for me. I’m getting my degree, great friends, I’m very happy with myself and my life and I have an amazing family and support network. 

My first job as a support worker was brilliant, absolutely loved everyone I worked with and the job itself and I felt like a part of the furniture. I was so confident in my abilities and I was very self assured. I didn’t need reassurance from people, I knew what I was doing and everyone was supportive. 

Then I left and got a job elsewhere, same role and I was essentially bullied by an older female who would scream and shout at me even a few weeks into the job because she was stressed. She was above me and the person I worked the closest with. I completely withdrew, was crying and upset all of the time and felt like a complete outcast, an alien, sometimes a piece of sh!t on the floor. I never stood up for myself, my skin got a little thicker but my confidence got up and left quickly. 

Now I’m working in a big city nightclub and initially I loved everyone there, the job is boring but I just wanted to experience something new. There’s a woman there who ignores me and essentially makes me do the shitty jobs. No matter how nice I am and ask her questions about herself, compliment her I get 0 back. She is level with me but as the new person I feel I have to submit. 

I used to be so bubbly, vibrant, happy, self assured and such experiences have really changed me. I overthink everything, I desire reassurance, I beat myself up over the tiniest of things like getting orders wrong or smashing glasses. I am truly my own worst enemy. All I do is seek approval from others and worry what they think of me and this is what I’ve become. I just want to love myself again. I don’t know if I can carry on with this job, I am so anxious all of the time and it’s killing me, am I even capable of holding a job anymore without having a meltdown? 

What can I do to shake myself from this? Any advice would so be appreciated right now, really feel like I’m sinking. Otherwise thank you for listening to my rant ❤️",13Sep2020,1

I'm currently in college and the job I had as a server felt like it was holding me back as it had a 30 minute commute and the management was not the best. 

I'm very much a free-spirited person and I felt like it was my time to go, plus I'm in quarantine for another week so they didn't have me on the schedule anyway. Thought it would be an easy breakaway. Wrong.

My boss (the district manager) called me today and I told him I had told my (store) manager that I wasn't going to work there any longer. 

He chewed me out, saying he needed me and that he could work me whenever I needed etc etc. I said I think I just needed to move on, but that I might come back next summer when I'm living close by again (I'm in a dorm right now.) He said they really frown upon rehires, blah blah blah. 

He was really angry and short with me and it kind of hurt my feelings. Should I feel bad, or should I just live my life and move on? I enjoyed the job, but the management was awful... It's a chain, so maybe I could just move to a different store? I'm really not sure how to feel right now.

I am in 2.5 year relationship and I am a bit concerned about my libido. The thing is: after some days of sexual abstinence I am thinking about it constantly.
It is strange tho, because when I am in normal sexual circumstances I also tend to notice other women and their good look, but when I am not sexually active for some time I desire my partner only and other women don't count.

My biggest concern is: after going back to normal I lose some maniac-like interest in my partner and I am more of a loner tho presence of my SO around doesn't bother me.

One of them are engaged to that girl they dated.

Today is where we had the problem. She texted me and said she walked to a breakfast place. I joked and said that she probably walked only a mile to then eat like 1000 calories haha ya know? I think she got a little offended and said that was rude and I said I was sorry. But then she said that everyone’s calorie intake is different (basically said that everyone has a different metabolism) which obviously is true) what my problem with that is that there are guidelines that fit most of our population for a reason. Since a inactive and slightly overweight female will most likely be in a lower calorie range. 
Anyway that’s what we were arguing about. I know she’s not a special case where things would be very difficult for her. But I wanna be telling her the truth as a friend. She thinks that walking a mile everyday is going to have her losing weight. And I know she doesn’t think about what’s she eating and what’s actually good for you. I think she’s going about it the wrong way. So should I continue being honest or just drop it and sorta just ignore what she’s saying? I wanna be a good friend to her:)",13Sep2020,1
589,"Hi, so I'll keep this as short as I can.

My gf had trauma as a child. I'm supporting as best I can, she is not yet up for counselling.

This was not an issue when we weren't serious, but as we've really developed our relationship and deepened our love it's causing an issue. 

One way it comes out is during sex as she approaches orgasm she will sometimes (often at times) have memories bubble up. They are extremely traumatic, and we will have to stop. She will then cry for a while, and obviously we'll be finished, usually for the day. This didn't happen when we were hookup buddies, it's happened more as she's fallen in love with me. 

We've got much better at recognising what happens, and communicating that it's time to stop, but she did try to push through to begin with, and told me to continue which led to her having a panic attack, and depression for a week the first time.

Obviously I'm supporting her as best I can, and I've said if she ever wants to talk I'm there for her, but if she doesn't that's ok too.

So the advice I need is how to get my head right. I am really struggling to orgasm as we tended to cum together, and having her suddenly remember childhood abuse and literally see me as her abuser for a few seconds before she realises where she is messes with both our heads, and in my case means I'm finding it much harder to orgasm, as even when she's fine I'm worrying it might hit her at any time. 

I'm fine with not cumming and stopping for her, but it's bothering my gf, she's feeling that I find her less attractive, as I'm struggling to orgasm or keep an erection because I'm really not comfortable with causing her to panic. She doesn't deserve this, as she's gorgeous and I'm totally in love. 

So how do i set that aside in my head, and be able to orgasm, so I can make her feel like the beautiful sexy woman she is, whilst remaining sensitive to her need to stop sometimes before things get horrible for her. And yes, she does view my orgasm as one measure of how attractive she is. She's said this explicitly in the past.

590,"My brother, let's name him X, is on instagram.*sigh* Well, I gave him a shout out on my story a few days ago and wanted to know which of my followers followed him.
So, I asked him ""did (name of a person) follow you?"" 
X said that no one with that name followed him so I asked him to check again. He checked and repeated his previous statement. 
This is where the trouble began. I asked X to give me the phone (which was my mother's. He uses my mother's phone) so that I could check.
I took the phone and went to the activity tab where I scrolled to the last but couldn't find the name.
But what I found was....kinda shocking.
A new notification loaded that said ""Abc liked your comment on their post: Fuck her up""
And lo and behold on the side was a small icon with a picture of a naked anime girl there. 
I didn't know what to do so I just handed him back the phone. But the thing's been eating me since.
It's not new as he was once caught watching nude dragon ball z pictures as an 8 year old and scolded by me and my mother.
I'm worried it's going to affect him badly.
Should I scold him yet again? I haven't said a word to him yet.

595,"Hey, 

I'm M25.

My childhood was horrible( as far as I could remember).

This was partly down to my parent's own unresolved childhood issues. 

My mum was married off at 18, and wasn't much educated, neither had individuality as was brought up in a strong patriarchal setup.

On the other hand, my father had abandonment issues wherein he felt his parents failed to give him a good upbringing and life.

This ended up being a lethal combination of two individuals coming together and raising a child at a time when they were neither psychological nor financially ready to have a kid.

And thus I was born. 


I was beaten on multiple occasions be ages 7 to 14 by both of my parents, never at the same time though.

Publicly humiliated in front of my grandparents, uncles &amp; aunt as well as cousins alike.

I was sent to bad schools and was made to feel as if it was a big favour on me that we were ""doing all they can"" to give me a good life.

I grew up to be nerdy, with low self esteem, social anxiety and what not.


But since last couple years, my parents' approach has changed. 

It seems as if they have started to realise the mistakes they have committed, simultaneously doting more on me and looking after me financially in these times of turmoil.

So a part of me wants to forgive them and start off with a clean slate. 

While the other believes that institutional deprivation at an early age cannot be compensated for with an equal or more amount of investment on their part, may it be emotionally, financially or otherwise.

I live in a nation where accessing therapy is not entirely possible.

I feel inadequate, underconfident and at times suicidal.
But I know I'm strong enough to fight through this.


What should be the way forward fro me in life now!?",13Sep2020,1

So I (16F) met R (17FTM) online because we both share a pretty obscure interest. At first everything was fine, we called often and I noticed some minor lovebombing (basically saying I love you early and often). Later R started being sort of petty, passive aggressive, and rude. I brushed it off because he is autistic and has lots of trauma/other mental illnesses, and maybe he didn’t know that what he was doing is considered rude. We’re both also in a groupchat with another person, H (16FTM) who messaged me concerned that R was annoyed with/hated him, and I reassured him that R was just like that. But, within the past couple of days it started to get worse. First, I sent a picture of my outfit to the groupchat, and R straight up said “Oh you’re so brave with that outfit”, which is a pretty common way to make a snide remark about someone. Then, I tried to start a conversation in the groupchat, and R said, “Shut up I don’t care.” Like those exact words. 

I’m conflicted because I really like being friends with him, and I feel like I won’t be able to find anyone else with that interest. And when they’re not being rude I really enjoy talking to them. R also struggles with addiction and other mental problems and I don’t want to make him feel worse about himself. But those comments are starting to wear on me. 

Is R toxic, and if so, what should I do about it?",13Sep2020,1
603,"I don't know where to start. Weird feelings are flowing through my body and I don't know how to sort them out and constantly I'm thinking that something is wrong with me. I can't say how I feel or what I feel. But I don't feel happy or somewhat decent.

I just feel like something went wrong. I used to watch porn and masturbate, even grind myself on couch before masturbating since I was 8-9 I guess. I was always shy and passive and couldn't really talk to girls and didn't have any female friends throughout my primary school. Also, my sister was a teenager while I was just starting to become one and my mom and she were always arguing and my mom used to tell me stuff like ,,Don't get a gf, you will only have problems., and so on. Through those years (13-17) I went through lot of stress and many parent fights and heard and seen some things I wish I never did. It was very bad and I had shitty confidence too.

Now I grew as a self-conscious teen without many friends and am constantly overthinking stupid things I did while being horny and can't stop judging myself. Instead of having fun and being thought-free teen, I was most of the time stressed and stuff, watched fetish porn and felt weirdly.

I used to masturbate to very weird things and got off on humiliating fetishes and even some gore, bullying videos (probably because the humiliation was real and it made it more exciting. I know it's morally wrong but please don't judge me) and zoo videos (don't judge me pls, I will never do it again). Also, I, sadly, masturbated to sister's panties once and touched some close family member's feet with my p**is because I was into foot/shoe fetish and now I deeply regret it. I used to sext a lot and sent many nudes of which some of them got exposed (I know nobody I ever know and will get to know will see them, but the fact that I did it makes me feel fucking dumb.)

I never had girlfriend and I just feel so lost because of all those thoughts, regrets and things. I had to get this off of my mind and I don't know what to do. Every morning I wake up, these thoughts appear on my mind and I can't fight them.

I feel like I fucked up my future sexual life and present life. I don't know what to do. Also, I'm on acne meds.

I don't know how to face these thoughts and how to sort them out. It all happened in last 3-4 years.. Also I have seen my mom during parent fight threatening that she would do something with the knife.. won't go much in details, but it's sort of traumatic I guess, even though that it happened year ago.

Whenever I see random girl I like, these thoughts rush through my mind and make me feel unworthy. 
Some girls are even interested in me, but I don't really feel interested in them, maybe because of porn and those developed fetishes. Idk I just feel like I'm fucked and weird.

I am scared that I will never be able to confess love to someone and to feel being loved.
Even though my parents love me, I'm sure they do, I just feel like something went wrong with me.

610,"My mom is a very superstitious woman. I've suffered from depression and fatigue my entire life. In order to find a solution to this, my aunt went and talked to three psychics that do tobacco readings. Both of them told me that I was surrounded by negative influences that would lead me to my death. Mainly, my best friends. It's a very weird long story but the psychic knew things she possibly couldn't have and basically my mom forbid me from never speaking to them again. That situation scarred me for life and I probably would have taken my life if I didn't reach out to my friend again. My mom then told me that she would leave it all in my hands because after all I am an adult. 

That is until my aunt consulted another psychic and he told her the same thing. Except this time he warned her about two of my best friends. She told my mom that I had to cut ties off with them or I'd die. One of my friends is a Norse Pagan and when she saw a picture of my friend burning sage with Antler horns she almost cried and said that what she was doing was ""Satanic"" and that she had gone down a dark path. She does ceremonies and wears traditional Norse Pagan gear and my mom flipped her shit and called her a Satanist.

I'm an Autistic woman that still lives with her parents and can't afford to take care of herself but I am an adult and I have the right to make my own choices. They are the only two people I talk to and they're the light of my life. My mom threatened to take away all forms of electronics from me if I didn't cut off contact within a week because she was afraid I would die. 


I had to start going to therapy after the first incident because of how traumatized I was and I don't think I could go through this again. My mental health is already fragile and I have depression. My mom told me not to tell my therapist the truth and I haven't. But I feel like I will have to tell her everything if this keeps going on because I have no one to help me in this. 

Honestly this week has been a lot for me. My mom got into a fight with my brother a couple of days ago. A physical fight. And it raised my stress levels. She apologized but then brings this up. Im freaking out and I don't know what to do. I'm so stressed out I'm about to start crying...

612,"Am I Heartless for moving out of my parents home?

I’m 29 F, I’m ready to be on my own, I’m a decade passed what most people find their way! I’ve tried to explain to my parents that I want my own apartment and they get so defensive and say I feel it’s unbearable to live with them? Or that a lot of people live with their parents with out any issues.

1. I feel like I’m not like everyone else and I have the right to choose what I want for my life

In my opinion they still treat me like a child they call me after work to see what time I’ll be home, they had a location tracker on my phone at one point and time and when I said I wanted it off they flipped out.

For Example: My mother called me last night I work 3-11 but my time can run over depending on circumstances a patient fall or having to be sent out to the hospital so I must do paperwork and documentation before I leave. I’ve explained this on numerous occasions!! So 1130 exactly she called my phone to ask where I was and how much longer will it be before I get home ? ?

I Responded finishing up I’ll let you know, side convo with the oncoming shift I didn’t finish until about 12, she calls back asks where are you ?  
I tell her that I’m walking to my car. 
She asks to stay on the phone until I get in the car I comply, 
She tells me to lock my doors and pull off ( my car does this automatically) but I don’t want confrontation so I say ok. 
She says you haven’t pulled off , 
I say yes I have 
at this point I’m highly annoyed 
she says how did you pull off that fast ??? 
How is that possible... 
I feel like this is pointless to argue about... so she says why are you staying to work so late letting your job “Use” you??? 
I say I’m getting paid .... 
she says I’m being disrespectful AND MONEY ISNT EVERYTHING!  
so I’m like I will see you at home. 
She continued to yell saying I’m being disrespectful. 

So recently I’ve hinted that I’ve been looking for an apartment.  I’ve actually found one they want me to move in by October 1st, prior to this my parents asked me to stay until March 2021 until my father’s pension kicks in. They need my help financially. When I told her I was looking she said I was being selfish when I know they need help and why can’t I stay it’s only 6 more months!! But I really want to go now.. and help as much as I can.

When I trade my lease back in they also want me to take on a car that they can’t afford the note on anymore, I really want to refinance my lease and I don’t want to take on or trade in their remaining balance on my new car... but I don’t want to be told I’m selfish. But they feel because they co signed for my lease which I never missed one payment on! That I should help them in return! 



Our initial agreement when I graduated last year(2019)  and started making more money was $700/month that has quickly grown to $1000-1500 a month! I’m constantly reminded what’s the big deal you don’t have any bills but a car note and insurance why can’t you give us more! Or we hate to ask you for anything ! Or why are you questioning where the money is going ?

So long story short they want me to stay until March, my apartment is ready I just have to set up utilities it’s 695 a month with discounts! I feel like should finish what I started with getting my own place and help them as much as possible and they can figure out the rest!

613,"Throwaway account. I’m a guy in college who’s shy so I’ve never had a girlfriend. I’ve known this girl for a couple years. She’s so pretty! She’s more outgoing than me but still a little awkward. She’s about 5’3” and has a small build overall which is good because I’m a small guy at 5’8”.

618,"Hello, I wanted to share an odd experience that I’ve had multiple times, mostly when I was in my mid-teens (12-14/15 years old; I am currently 25), that I’ve not been able to find any advice on elsewhere. It has confused me for many years and I haven’t been able to make sense of it.

So one day I felt an odd sensation in my lower throat area, and less than a minute after that sensation, I was essentially unable to breath. I then began to feel something come up my throat and, out of instinct, I put my hand in my mouth to try to pull it out. I ran into the bathroom and, as I started pulling, a thin black intestine-like tube started to come out. I keep pulling and pulling for what seemed like at least a minute (it reminded me of when clowns pull those lines of scarfs out of their mouth and it just keeps going) and finally the sensation went away and I threw this long tube in the toilet. I was in a sort of shock, having no idea what just happened. But I was half scared to death but also mostly relieved because I could finally breath again and that weird sensation was gone.

This happened at least 3-4 times over the next year or so and every time it would seemingly happen out of nowhere. I had no idea what was going on or what was causing it, but I didn’t say anything to anyone. About a few years ago I started really thinking back on it because I still had no idea what that tube-like thing was or what had caused it to happen. But, thinking back on it, I started to doubt if it was actually real and if I had just dreamt it or something. I couldn’t think of a reasonable explanation and the only possibility (at least in my mind) was that the tube-like thing was either some part of my intestine or some kind of internal organ. In either case, I would’ve been in serious medical danger or have some sort of server lingering side effects, neither of which I had.

There are a few reasons why I am hesitant to assign these experiences to dreams. Firstly, I hardly ever remember any of my dreams, and I don’t remember much from my childhood, let alone dreams that I had then. Secondly, it felt so real, and it even feels real thinking about it now. This could be the one exception to these two points and it could very well have been dreams, but I just really don’t know. I’ve tried looking up similar experiences online and haven’t found anything even remotely similar. So, that’s what drove me to write up my experience and see if anyone could provide some insight about it because it still disturbs me to this day and I truly have no idea what to think about it.",13Sep2020,3

625,"TLDR: would it be weird if I reached out to a girl I never really talked to to thank her for asking me to dance at prom 10 years ago? 

 Backstory 
Im a bit of a rambler, so I'll try to keep it short, but please bear with me. So I'm going to be a little discreet because I'm pretty sure the person I'm talking about uses reddit frequently. Little background on me, I was kind of one of the weird kids in high school. Not a lot of friends,  people made jokes at my expense occasionally, girls avoided me, etc etc. Senior prom 2010 rolls around,  and of course couldn't find a date. Ended up going with the handful of friends i did have. Near the end, a shy, awkward girl in my class came up to me and asked for a dance. It was actually really nice. She seemed to really want to be dancing with me. I danced with a really nice popular girl earlier, but that felt like she did it out of pity. This felt different. I never  said or did anything about it because I was afraid of what other people would say about us, cause peer pressure (which I feel really bad about now)
10 years later and I still remember that moment when I'm feeling down, and it makes me feel really good about myself.  Like, someone seemed to like me for me at a time when most of my classmates seemed to be the opposite. I really want to reach out to her and tell her how nice of a moment that was and how good it made me feel about myself, but I don't want to do so in a way that comes off creepy or like I have ulterior motives. That and, we never really even talked to each other before or after that, so I dont even know if it would be a good idea to say anything after all this time.

these same people are preaching saying that bullying is not okay and mental health is something serious. every time i speak up they make me feel like i'm wrong when in fact im not. you cant call yourself a good person when you bullying someone into depression for being gay. you can't call yourself a good person when you instigating and side with the person who hates gays and making things worse. you can't call yourself a good person when you befriend someone on purpose just to instigate.  

every time i speak people say im negative and toxic but there behavior saids alot about them. i never bullied anyone into depression. i never befriended people to hurt them. i accept people as they are. i wasn't born to hurt others. that's not who i am. should i close my mouth and not say anything? i notice everytime i speak up and say something people dont like it. they dont like honesty. they dont accept what they did wrong. instead they blame the victim.",13Sep2020,1
632,The past few 8 hour shifts I’ve worked I got my lunch but not a break. I work at a grocery store and I’m a minor (17m). Is there anything I can do? Customer service just gets snappy when you ask for a break or lunch.,13Sep2020,2
633,"Seems odd from the title, but basically, my (26F) brother (21M) lives we me and has been living with me for a year now. I bought my first home last year, and he's been living in it with me ever since he moved back to our home state. I had made it known to him since I graduated college (2016) that he was welcome to move in with me to get away from our abusive mother, and as a parentified child it made the most sense that he would be willing to live with me out of everyone else.

It was made clear to him that he is to live with me temporarily until he can get on his own two feet. I work from home, so until he can buy a car he drives mine to his part-time job (he's required to work if he's going to live in my house). In saving for a car and apartment, he is not yet required to pay rent or utilities.

Here's the issue. He is not a terrible housemate, nor is he disrespectful of my house or myself. HOWEVER, it has become clear to me that along with not truly saving money during the past year, he is only just now interested in purchasing a car- which I always made known to him that I would help him with. He has no true direction in life, as he dropped out of college before moving here and has no idea what he wants to do with himself career-wise. Outside of work, he plays video games and makes music with his friends. I try to expose him to different hobbies and interests, but nothing seems to stick and he doesn't even want to go to trade school as I've offered to pay for it. At this rate, it's hard for me to determine how to help in launch into proper adulthood when he has no real drive or motivation for me to go on. Teaching him basic life skills has also been a task I've taken up (i.e. budgeting, cooking, time management, etc.), and it seems to be 50/50 on how much is actually soaking in.

I don't mind helping him get to where he needs to be, but frankly I'm over being a parent and I'm not willing to take care of a grown man, family or not. I myself am childfree and I am content with being free and alone, and that in itself stems from the fact that I had basically no childhood because our narcissist mother couldn't be bothered to raise her own kids, leaving me to raise her son and basically have no life or freedom of my own until I literally left them to go to college. He needs to get a full-time job, a car, and an apartment sometime within the next two years, and I'm struggling with how help him to accomplish this.

I am thinking of opening a joint bank account that requires both signatures for withdrawals, but both can deposit money freely. The plan is that I can match any money he puts in the account by the end of each month, and he can use the funds for the car and later apartment. Is this a good idea? Is there any other way I can ensure his success? Am I taking too much of the burden here?",13Sep2020,1

635,"I'm 28 yrs old and literally do nothing in my life. I'm broke and fully dependant on my family, unfortunately, and that what makes me sad the most😞. I have no skills, talents or hobbies. I've tried a lot of things like:

​

1) Applying 5 times for a scholarship but got nothing.

2) Applying for jobs in banks and schools

3) I've tried PTC/GPT and survey sites (I don't say that they didn't work for me but it took me more than a year to make a 100$. unfortunately, people who live in a developing country like me don't make much from those kind of sites that's why they didn't work for me and yeah I was disappointed and hopeless to the point I tried something like that and wasted my time but sometimes nothing comes for free and we have to pay something to get another).

​

​

4) l've also tried sites like upwork and fiverr. I made proposals and gigs. I offered to do work for free and already did, BUT failed as well.

​

5) I've tried to make websites and YouTube channels (not at the same time ofc). I bought domains with the money I made from PTC/GPT and survey sites. I prepared the sites but none of them saw the light.

​

As for the YouTube channels, I prepared an educational content but didn't record it. I even bought a recorder, a mic and a

graphics tablet to help me make the content (ofc I got them on sale and they weren't the best stuff out there but I was telling myself someday when I get some money I will buy better stuff to improve the quality of my channel(s) and someday never comes. Like the websites, those channels never saw the light).

​

​

Because I'm broke, I literally tried to do every single thing by myself like:

\* Designing logos for the websites and YouTube channels.

\* Editing coding for the websites (although I'm not a programmer, I surfed the sites that teach programming, found some codes and tried to edit the free templates to make them look better.)

\* I'm not a writer but tried to write content for the websites I made BUT I failed.

​

Although I faild to make those websites and channels, I learned some basic about making websites and YouTube channels, hosting services, marketing, advertising, programming language and so.

​

​

I'v tried to take some courses to learn something from scratch in the hope that it will help me to get a job or at least to improve myself, BUT I always stop learning after a few days. Some of those courses are:

​

1) Marketing

2) Nutrition

3) programming

4) graphic design

5) entrepreneurship

6) Chinese Language

7) there are others but I'm lazy to list them. In addition, There're other courses I wanted to enroll in but I didn't because I'm afraid to stop after a few days like I did with the previous ones.

​

side note 1: I enrolled in these courses via free learning MOOCs. I also have a coursera account (with a financial aid)

and can enroll in some courses for free.

​

side note 2: I'm interested in languages especially Korean Language. I learned it by myself I got a TOPIK certificate level 2 and then reached pre-intermediate level and then stopped. I also tried to learn languages like Spanish, Italian, Japanese, German and Thai but I always stop after learning alphabet and some basics.

​

​

​

Things I figured out that I do a lot but I don't know how to fix them.

1) I never run out of ideas but when I get an idea I always feel super excited and then super confused and hopeless. Because I tend to analyze those ideas to the point I create excuses and persuade myself that I can't do them.

​

2) when I do something I always want to make it perfect but I fail and quit.

​

3) I always feel that I need to learn something orm scratch in order to make a living or get a better life. I also feel that I want to learn a loooooot of different things and I'm always stuck between following a passion or following money.

My dream job changes every single day. when I see successful people do something good I don't feel jealousy. I just feel that I want to do like them and be successful like them. I always want to be like those people who work in fields like business, nutrition, medicine, computer science and psychology. Maybe I'm interested in nutrition and medicine because I want to improve my eating habits and have a healthy lifestyle.

I'm interested in psychology because it helps me to understand myself and understand people around me and I'm interested in business and computer science because I want to have money and don't want to be dependent on my family (btw I know life is the topic and money is the tool and I'm not that kind of people who do things only for money, I always try to find a value in everything I do. I'm conscientious person and don't like to use people in order to make money).

​

These are the most things I did in the last 7 yrs and I'm afraid to live like that for the rest of my life. I want to do something. I don't want to die as nobody.

​

I tried to figure out what's the wrong with me through taking online career tests and personality tests but nothing happened. I've tried to read books and articles in the hope that I will find a solution but I found nothing I only feel motivated for a short time. Unfortunately, I started to feel bored to finish a whole book or an article because I know they are not helpful anymore.

However, I'm an optimist and have a faith that tomorrow will be better. I don't know when or how but I believe so.

​

​

what should I do please help me😖.

636,"I don't have any friends I can hang out with. My only friend is a year below me and because of covid she's on a different lunch than me. 

I witnessed a violent outburst on Friday at lunch and now I'm really scared to be alone at lunch tomorrow because I have previous trauma with violence. 

A few girls from my class follow me on Instagram so I asked on my story if there was anyone I could hang out with. They all saw it but ignored it. My best friend (she lives in a different country) said they're all idiots and I shouldn't worry about it and my mom just shrugged. I do not know what to do or who to go too. I'm 15F

637,"Basically I got stupid at one point and racked up a lot of credit card debt. Yes I was stupid but it's not that bad, or at least not as bad as it could be. I have about $680 of debt on my one credit card and then like $780 on another.

I earned $500 the other week from selling something to a guy(I am in school so I am not making much money and also the whole covid thing makes it hard to work) and I have like $240 in my savings. Should I just take the $500 I earned and pay the credit card now to eliminate a lot of the debt? I feel like I should just because it's probably not good to have all of that on my credit line.

I plan to try and use the $500 to pay off most of the one credit card I have, and then save the $200 that I have and start doing something like Instacart to make money. I just don't know if I should like wipe my bank account of the $500 or slowly pay it off?",13Sep2020,1

The thing is, I've recently been doing a lot of thinking, and I've realized that I like her quite a lot and wish that there would be potential for she and I to explore more together somewhere down the line when she's over the breakup.

But, I'll most likely just forever sit on this attraction, because I'd be shocked if she ever felt the same and I'd rather not lose her as a friend by pursuing it. But I just feel really terrible all around. I feel terrible because he considered me a friend, has expressed the interest in staying in touch with me, and now here I am having feelings for ""his"" girl.

641,"I live in a duplex so we share a small front porch with our neighbors. We have only lived here for 4 months now. 

At first, we started smelling urine outside the front door. We just sort of thought it was their dog...but then the dog died and the urine smell only got stronger. Now it’s to the point where the entire porch reeks and is *covered* with flies. Also the porch is tainted a reddish color in front of their door. (It’s a cement porch btw)

We haven’t been able to catch them in the act, really, either. Once we were awake around 5:30am and took our dogs out potty and there was soapy water on the porch but it didn’t smell like urine so I’m not sure if that was related or not. 

Also, we have a ring doorbell and haven’t been able to catch it on that either but the way it’s positioned it’s very likely they are able to do it without catching it on camera.

We know that there is an older lady (70-80ish), a man (in his 50s), a lady (anywhere between 30-45) and a man (25-35) that live there. We are unsure of their relations except we know the two men are father/son. 

It’s embarrassing when people come over because it smells so bad outside, and it’s annoying to smell it everytime we go outside, and I’m not sure if it’s safe for our dogs either. 

What can we do? Should we just try and clean it and not say anything? Should we say something? Get our leasing company involved? We really don’t want to do anything to strain the relationship between us but it’s getting annoying/disgusting.",13Sep2020,3
642,"Every single time something goes wrong, my dad loves to blame it on others. He takes zero responsibility for his actions, and he somehow makes everything someone else's fault, and he can always find someone to accuse. When he gets angry, he gets really confrontational and scary, and he yells really loud. The worst part is that he gets himself into the problems.

For example, the toilet in our house is constantly broken. It doesn't flush properly unless you spend about 20 minutes plumbing it, and it always smells bad. The truth is that my dad uses the bathroom way too much. He makes a mess in there, and he doesn't bother to flush at all. He fills the toilet bowel with his waste products, and he uses a lot of toilet paper that he just wads up. He also throws snack wrappers and soda cans in the toilet. I don't how creepy some people can be. Yet when someone says that the toilet won't flush properly, my dad says that ""you're not trying hard enough"". He's the one who clogs the toilet. It's his own fault. I don't even know what's going on his head.

He eats a lot of snacks as well. He spends several hours a day watching TV, and he eats a lot of snacks, such as M&amp;M's, chocolate, Pringles, oreos, and other junk food. He leaves crumbs everywhere, and sometimes he spills soda or beer on the couch. And this attracts ants. Every time there's ants in the house, my dad says that my siblings and I leave trash everywhere. We keep our rooms very clean, and we vacuum the house regularly. It's my dad who makes a mess when he eats.

The other thing is that he never shows an ounce of respect to others. Every single time we eat dinner, my dad puts his feet on the table and eats with his hands. He spills food on the table, on his clothes, on his body, on the floor, and literally everywhere. He constantly grabs food from other people's plates to eat, and he hogs all the good food for himself. When he has leftovers, he just throws it in the trash can. It's so wasteful to do that. 

He walks around the house wearing nothing but an underwear. He says it helps him cool off, but it's so gross when he does that. He has a huge potbelly, lots of armpit hair, gross thighs, and the most embarrassing thing is that he has three breasts. He doesn't try to hide that shameful fact at all, and when he goes out to get the mail or something, he just goes in his underwear, and all the neighbors laugh their heads off at him.

Sometimes when he goes to the neighborhood dumpster, he wears only an underwear. People stare at him and giggle at him and whisper about him, and he doesn't seem to care. I've asked him countless times to put a shirt on for modesty sake, but he still likes to go around shirtless. That's not okay, especially when he has 3 nipples.

My dad is really scary as well. He constantly storms up and down the stairs when he is angry, screaming profanity the whole time. He punches the wall and kicks doors, and he also burps and farts really loud. When he lectures people, he always speaks really loudly and aggressively, he constantly lets out stinky burps and farts, his eyes get really bulgy, his face turns pinkish red, his belly bulges in and out, and he usually screams for about 3 hours. After he berates everyone in the house, he continues running up and down the stairs while bellowing at the top of his lungs. I'm so scared of him.",13Sep2020,0
643,"There’s a summary/TL;DR at the bottom For what its worth I’m a male college grad in my mid 20’s.

Around February, before Covid-19 hit hard, I was in the process of joining the USCG. My recruiter was in the works of getting me into MEPS for my medical. There was a delay for me getting my paper work for my metal plates in my wrist(no issues with my wrist). While waiting I received a job offer to become a police officer. I spoke with my recruiter and decided to withdraw from the process.

THEN COVID-19 HAPPENED. My process for police was then delayed, everything got locked down, and the riots with police happened. I had a lot more time to think over my life options and where I want to go from here. I want to join the military, more specifically the USCG, before I become a police officer. I now know for sure I want to join (the USCG) but will they still take me or at least hear me out?

648,"For context im a highschooler learning how to drive. Ive been making decent progress in my driving skills, at least i thought i was until my last lesson. Throughout the lesson my dad gave me critiques on my driving that started small like relax your shoulders to make it less jerky which makes sense as he is instructing me. Later in the lesson i went through a intersection (turning left) i guess a little too fast and my dad was shouting at me to slow down. Unfortunately i only started slowing down after i made it through. After making it through the intersection i then asked why because in my mind i made it through what seemed to me fairly safely and i had wanted to go a little fast as i was turning onto the free way. I hadn't meant for it to be combatory, i just wanted an answer so i could improve. He then takes this the wrong way and goes on a couple minute lecture about how i never listen to him. I think whatever because i know he is stressed out about other stuff and i continue on with my driving although i was understandably a little irritated by it. 

Later in the lesson i have to do a lane change i look over my shoulder and change lanes. He then tells me that i should be looking over my shoulder whenever i do a lane change and i respond factually that i did. He then i guess relatively briefly blows up about my attitude  towards him and how its unacceptable. I ask how i should have responded because i did in fact do that and he said i needed to fix my tone. Near the end of the lesson my dad starts shouting at me to stop. I dont react immediately as it takes a moment to register but i do in fact stop. There is a cross walk in front of me (in a round about) and i hadnt seen a pedestrian standing on the very shoulder waiting to cross from the other side. My dad again starts lecturing me about not listening to him and i forget exactly why but i eased my foot off the break. It could have been because i didnt see the pedestrian or i was just simply distracted by my dad lecturing but obviously it ensued more shouting from my dad and i stoped almost immediately. He then goes on to lecture me and i just feel like crap so and thinking i want to go home. After i get home i disapear into my bedroom and i guess i got a little emotional as i sometimes do over relatively small things but convinced myself that this was just a one time thing that was caused by stress.

Now flash forward to today and my dad tells me he wont take me driving. I get a little irritated and yell at him because well if im a bad driver the only way im going to get better is through more lessons. He says he wont take me out again until i promise to listen to his instruction, which i respond that i do listen i just am not good at responding immediately when he tells me to do something. As im focusing on the road. He tells me its inexcusable and he wont endanger his car, other people and his insurance. He looked like he wanted me to say something but i cant promise something i cant promise. And maybe im just not suited to drive. So now hes gone with my brother on his lesson and i guess im permanently unable to have driving lessons. So what should i do?",13Sep2020,2
649,"This is my first time posting here but I think I'm going through some sort of breakdown and don't know what to do. I have no one to turn to about my frustrations. Today I started an intense 2 week preparation for my Geology degree before officially starting next month. I never learned Chemistry in School (it wasn't available in our school) and now before starting I have to do learn a the basics. This year everything is through Zoom sjd it's truly fucking AWFUL. The professor was cut off multiple times, the internet in my building is good sometimes and horrible othertimes. I never know what's going to happen. So I missed a lot of the important stuff she said including advice on how for the upcoming weeks. I was a little stressed because she said dhe has no time to go through it again and that she is in a hurry but she also assured everyone that she will record the lectures and upload them to the cloud. But here I am trying to fo through everything and she hasn't uploaded anything!!!! It's 21:00 here and I can't find her Email anywhere to beg her for it. She's going to run through everything again tomorrow and I'll be behind!! I'm already at a disadvantage because I never learned Chemistry as opposed to everyone else who wanted to brush up on their high school knowledge. I want to fo well so bad eve ln though I'm tired as hell and very sad and frustrated. I was willing to go through 5 hours of the recording. My life is shit and the universe is out to get me!!!!

650,"Hi guys!  So like the title says, I tend to have some trouble focusing during conversations and I also think I have some mild memory problems.

For example, sometimes people tell me that I did/said x thing but I have no memory of it, or sometimes I'll be walking with random objects in my hand and I don't remember picking them up? Sometimes I feel like I'm 100% sure that someone did a particular thing only to learn that that never happened or something else happened and I'm remembering it wrong. Also, my friends say I zone out a lot :(

I know this stuff happens to everyone, but I'm pretty sure it happens a lot more often to me. In my family, I'm kind of the absent-minded/head-in-the-clouds person.

So, I used to get into trouble a lot for losing things (because I would forget where I had kept objects, or thought I kept them someplace and I actually hadn't), and for forgetting to do chores and things like that. For the last few weeks though, I feel like this kind of thing has been happening a lot more often, and it's making me suspect that my family has been using me as a scapegoat and blaming it on me whenever they mess up. Like if we're cooking and they forget to switch off the microwave or something, they'll say that they told me to do it and _I_ forgot, or if something goes missing they say they'd given the thing to me and that I must have lost it. I really do feel like they're lying, but I can't be sure because I don't feel like I can trust my memory

It's really scary because I think this is all making me feel super resentful towards them, and I don't even know if it's justified :( What do I doo ?",13Sep2020,1

652," I don't know if this is the right subreddit to ask on, but I am struggling to find a career path that works with my disability. I would love to work in the health or mental health fields and/or with children. I really want a job where I can help people. Currently, I am attending community college to get a transfer degree in Psychology, but I want to figure out what I'm going to do after college sooner rather than later so I know if I need to change majors.

I have a lot of physical limitations with my disabilities, and that rules out a lot of jobs I am interested in or feel I would be good at. For example, I would love to be a nurse, but it's too physically demanding. I would love to be a therapist, but I don't know how I'd get health insurance as a therapist.

I cannot stand for long periods of time and I cannot lift over 20 pounds. I need to get a job that offers health insurance because it is unlikely I will be able to get health insurance otherwise. I also have chronic pain and chronic fatigue, but the first three have been the biggest obstacles in finding a field to go into.

Are there any types of jobs out there where I can help people even with these limitations? While I would prefer to work with people, I am okay with the idea of a desk job as long as the work is fulfilling.

I would prefer a job that I can do with a bachelor's or associate's degree, but if I have to, I am willing to pursue a Master's degree.

657,"Ever since quarantine I realize how emotional I am. My (20f) emotions has effected my job and school environment where my face is beat red and I cant hold back my tears anywhere I go. My mother is quite annoyed by how emotional I become over every little thing and I want to control it better. My constant crying has been a burden to my migraine condition and my creativity flow as an artist as well. For example, my advisor was frustrated when I told her I wanted to transfer and she told me I was a waste of financial aid and how too great this college is to leave and abruptly, began to cry in an entire mess and felt like such as idiot for crying in front of her. I raised my voice to her in frustration too. At my job I didn't complete a task correctly and felt so bad, I was crying about it that entire day. If critiqued for my artwork, I get depressed or extremely angry at myself for not seeing it. When my mother disciples me or if we are in a disagreement, I cry for too many nights and get angry with violent thoughts. I lose too much sleep overthinking everything. My grades have never dropped from an A, and I can't imagine how I will be if that ever happens. I was diagnosed for manic depression but I don't believe it, it's just an exhausting rollercoaster every day. 

Brutal honest advice is greatly appreciated!! :)",13Sep2020,1

660,"....a few years ago I had been getting harassed by a group of people who had gone as far as to not only dox me and anyone around me, but also made an appearance at my place of work. They had me doing rather bad things as I was stupid enough/manipulated enough to do so....one of which being various tattoos with their usernames or things regarding them. And I honestly regret letting my mental state get as bad as it did. It bothers me every single time that I see them anywhere on my body. There is someone I want to be with, but I’m extremely terrified that the moment they’re seen, that things will go bad. Especially given one of the things essentially being designed as a brand. I don’t want to be seen as insane or freak people out. But I’m scared to even have these things be seen. And I don’t have the money to cover them up. If something does happen to get to where these things are seen....how do I even go about explaining it without freaking the person out?

661,"Ok, so... my s.o. is a hard worker and has had a full time job for a couple months. I had been looking for work since March and wasn't getting anything. I went to visit my bro then came home and suddenly had an interview. On the same day, my s.o. gets me an interview at their workplace. (They had pushed me to apply there for a while.) I ended up getting accepted for both jobs. 

It works out because one job is flexible and asked for weekend availability. The second job (with my s.o.) is non flexible, full time, and the pay is about $5 higher. And I've been wanting to move out for some time. So I feel like things are comin together and I'll finally be able to bulk up those savings! 

Well..... suddenly my s.o. is very angry. 

They tell me that working hard is their thing, and I should stick with my first job. Making coffee, and being cute. They don't like that my pay was slightly higher. They want their own ""professional space"". I won't dwell on the fact that they told me to apply in the first place... turns out they also didn't expect me to get the job, only wanted to boost my morale or something. Furthermore, my s.o. has a nasty habit of getting angry at little things. Sometimes angry at me for something someone else did. Like... taking it out on me, ya know? So that has caused me to be less compassionate towards this weird job issue. 

So right now, my partner and I ( going on 2 years ) are taking a break from each other, over this issue. They're telling me to quit for their sake. And I would then make about half the income if I do quit. And I know money isn't more important than love, but this money was gonna go towards us living together... and going on trips together. And it seems I'm the only one able to actually SAVE money. Their extra money goes straight to their hobby. 

What should I do? I think it's unreasonable to ask me to quit a job I want. This person is a good person, they care, they are willing to share anything else with me, just not the work space. I know deep down, that if I quit, I could not be with this person anymore. If I don't quit, maybe they'll get over it but maybe they won't. I didn't even plan to have this job for much more than 6 months-a year. It's not like it's my dream job. But still... it's not my s.o.'s dream gig either! 

I'm clueless right now. 

The only reason they had that I could agree with is the fact that our time together would be horribly limited. Maybe one to two full days a week that we could spend together. And that's only if they don't use that time for their hobby. During the week, they would work when I'm off, is work when they're off. So it's true, we wouldn't have a lot of time together. Should I quit because of that? 

Should I quit the person? 

Does anyone have some wisdom on the matter?

Has anyone been through something like this? 

I'm stuck.

663,"Soo I met up w someone from an app last week and when they asked about whether I have a job i panicked. Basically I've just been pretty depressed this summer, and while I did apply to several at first when I didn't get any replies that made me feel worse so I kinda gave up. I justified it to myself that my mom is immunocompromised so I didn't want to risk anything anyways (living at home since my college campus closed in the spring) but. Anyways my bff had a shitty boss and just quite her job so I basically inserted myself into that explanation and told them I'm looking rn. I was embarrassed at the truth and wasn't sure if I'd see them again, but the rest of the date went really well and we're still texting. I hate lying and feel shitty abt it so.... Do I text them?

And he keep telling me that he's giving me the same advice and I'm not listening and that I need to learn to relax and let go of the past. But I can't! It's harder than rocket science. Every date I would always mention my insecurities. And it made me wonder how annoying I am and how he hasn't left me yet. He is really supportive during my   episodes.

I’m getting to a point where she won’t listen to reason when we’ve told her that we’re not going anywhere and we still love her. She’s starting to call up family members / relatives she hasn’t spoken too in years and tell them about her 10 year plan ( it’s a suicide plan - if she’s not where she wants to be at that point then she’s killing herself).

Over that time she displayed high levels of interest and it was pretty obvious she was into me a lot i.e. she liked me more than i liked her (I just wanted to take things slow). After the 3rd date we had sex. We then spoke on the phone the day after about something very deep she went through in a previous relationship (10 years ago) - awful to hear tbh and she said during our convo ""I can understand if you want out as you said you've dealt with girls who have been through this before"". She also said, ""i'd love to see you again"". I then didn't speak to her for about 4 days (I've been very much like that from the beginning)...i called her on the 4th day and we spoke for about 20 mins...all sounded good on the phone...said she's been thinking about me and was going to reach out. She then said at the end of the call ""I thought i scared you away because of what i told you""...I said ""no...of course not, but we will need to speak about that, if that's ok when i see you in person""...I said i'd message her later....i contacted her 2 days later and tried to arranged to meet up....she ignored my request for a date (question) and just said ""she's heard great things about the place I've suggested"" and that was that....i just sent a polite voicenote, just saying she should ""no worries, just reachout to me whenever""

Most days I wake up I want to die but I could never bring myself to do it. I don’t feel worthy of love or relationships. I broke up with the person who said all that but it still haunts me.

My ex has since apologized and we hang out because I don’t have any family or friends where I live. I’m happy to have social interaction but it’s hard for me because they want more. I don’t know how to say that the idea of someone even touching me makes me sick to my stomach. I have to be under the influence of something just to have it happen.

While she has (and is currently being) a good person to my kids and myself she seems to have a drinking problem. Both her parents are recovering alcoholics (father been sober for 2 years, mother 2 months). She is the sweetest and most loving person ever when sober, but she doesn’t understand when she’s had too much and when she does it’s a problem... 

One instance she made a giant scene at her nieces birthday and had to have the whole family try and control her. Another she threw a drink on me at a concert (for talking to a friend) and tried to drive home drunk. Just the past weekend punched me in the groin after I refused to go to bed while I was watching sports with her brother. When she does these things she “blacks out” and can’t remember what happened the next day.

I feel partly responsible because I will buy the alcohol but when I suggest we cut down on the booze she will sometimes agree but then continue.

685,"Recently, my best friend abruptly ended our relationship of several years. We were very close, and for years, he was my only reason to wake up in the morning. I'm isolated and very socially anxious, so he was the only person I really ever spoke to and felt understood by. 

We used to be 'somewhat' romantically involved. I had feelings for him and he never steered me away from those feelings and often told me he felt the same and that he felt an attraction to me.
My mental health was already declining when we slept together several months ago and only after having me do many sexual favors for him and spending a lot of money on him, he decided he no longer had any romantic interest in me. 

He is no longer in my life, and he has moved far past me - he is dating someone now, and his friends used alternate accounts to harass me (for reasons I'm not fully sure of).

My mental health has been poor my whole life and has only worsened as I've aged, but this incident and this year in general has made me worried. I frequently think about hurting myself and while I believe I'm too cowardly to kill myself, it's rare a minute passes where I don't think about how death would make it so I wouldn't have to feel this way anymore. Sometimes I have violent thoughts about hurting him, even though I never would hurt anybody.

I've been on medication for depression and anxiety since I was 12. I'm worse without it, but it isn't making me feel much better either. I exercise daily and am in reasonably good physical health. 

I have little else in my life. No other friends. No money. I barely leave my home because of quarantine. I don't have the means to get a therapist.

I entered the gift card code in my account and it wasn’t enough for the product so the company sent me another which also wasn’t enough.

We have good days, but overall a lot of not so good ones too. 

It makes me really frustrated when I'm dealing with something and I don't feel like I can confide in them for a lot of things without getting a helpful answer.

It's easy for me to think of the bad times, because there have been a lot of them. And I'm feeling like they've really been outshining the good ones. 

I've been trying to show that I want to be more independent, and it was only after getting that amount of independance did I realize that that was the normal amount of independance that I should have been getting when I was growing up in high school or middle school. Because I've felt like see me as a stupid, not-smart person, and it's been enough to convince me that I wasn't smart. But then one day I realized that I am smart, and they don't understand me at all. In fact, one thing my Dad loves to do in arguments is claim that he knows me better than I know myself-which is wrong. He knows me to a degree, but could never name my favorite color or show, or what I even do in my freetime. He only knows the tip of the iceberg. 

So overall, I feel like I've reached the point where I just don't want to associate with them anymore. Because there is just so much that I hate about them (which would take a while to lay out here but feel free to ask).

I feel like because of them my confidence has been shattered over the years and everything I've dealt with mentally I've had to figure out myself-which has been a piece of hell all in itself.

Curtains are always closed since my mom doesn’t want the neighbors watching us, they only do online orders for groceries and home cooking, me and my brother (16M) were not allowed to go outside in our backyards or do anything. We were also forced into choosing online only classes instead of part time in person, which doesn’t bother me as much since I guess it’s the safest choice but I wish I’d been allowed to choose my school schedule. To be totally honest, my family wasn’t much different before this pandemic. I’m a sophomore in college but I wasn’t allowed to go outside in our backyard at any time either, and I wasn’t allowed to stay on campus for the weekends. My parents also put a tracker on my phone and forced me to go back into my dorm room each night by 5 PM. We weren’t allowed to do extracurricular activities or sports growing up either, so my brother and I have always been pale, weak, sickly, and not fat but always a little pudgy.

The first time I went outside since March was in mid August for a physical therapy appointment (I broke and dislocated a knee cap a few months prior and also broke an ankle in separate incidents, I fall down very easily) and it was the first time I really got to exercise in months. Still, my brother and I would try our best at home to find some place to run around, jump, and release our pent up energy. But we’re both very hungry and thirsty and sweating A LOT all the time, especially me. It affects me more because I’m a girl and shorter, so it’s easier to pack on pounds. I started noticing stretch marks around June, and they’ve only been getting darker and bigger. The other day I also noticed tiny ones in my buttocks area. I’ve chosen not to tell anyone because my mom keeps pointing out that I “have a belly going” and need to lose weight because I “look terrible”. I have gained weight, mostly because I’m hungry and stressed with school (I had summer classes then and didn’t get much sleep). I’m not allowed to drink soda/smoothies/tea so I haven’t been drinking anything but water and coffee for almost a year now, and almost all the food my mom makes is plant based and home made since we can’t eat junk food either, so I eat healthier than the average person. 

But I’ve only gained ten pounds. That’s what confusing me. At my height, I shouldn’t be getting stretch marks this severe from only a ten pound weight gain, and I’ve never gotten any this bad prior to this weird time. Maybe it’s still possible and I just don’t know? I keep falling down more and more often down the stairs, and my skin is cutting/bruising very easily and it feels too soft like velvet. I’m terrified of telling my mom about this because I know she’s going to put me on one of those terrible diets again (last year, she was only allowing me to eat 600-900 calories a day) and make me feel bad about the way I look. I make sure the clothes I wear cover up everything. Also, all my clothes still fit me the same and really don’t feel much tighter. I’m still the same dress size (Small-Medium, US dress size 4-6). I’m disgusted with the way I look every time I see my legs, and I’m scared they’re forever going to stay like that. 

What do I do? What do you think is causing this? Is it just the weight gain from quarantine?

Edit: spelling, realized I spelled buttocks wrong in the title lol sorry",13Sep2020,1

Okay so I (20f) have been having trouble keeping my emotions controlled for a while now. I get overly hurt or angry on tiny little things that i know are not that big a deal and then end up feeling sad and lonely by the end of it. Even while i am in that situation i know that i am just overreacting and i should just calm down but I can’t, i feel like crying and just vanishing out of existence for a little while to be alone. Some instances of this are-

1. Due to the rona sometimes me and friends played an online game and one day i asked them to play and they said they had already played a game with someone else(replaced me with a friend’s friend) which is not a big deal just a little game but i ended up so hurt and betrayed by this tiny thing feeling alone, like nobody cares about me and just ended up feeling like shit and crying all this while knowing damn well that i am totally overreacting and that realisation made me feel even worse

2. Few days ago i was talking to my bestfriend who i texted at night(around 1am)and he said he was gonna sleep and that i can call him the next day or he’ll call me when he gets time, comes the next day he doesn’t call me all day so i call him at around 10 and he says that he’s going to sleep a little early and he’ll talk to me later and i lost it, i was so mad at him and so hurt that i just never wanted to talk to him again and i ended up crying that night. He got mad at me for being hurt by such a little thing and I couldn’t even explain why i feel this way to him.

Everyday situations like this come up and i end up loosing my temper or getting butthurt on such tiny things. What do i do to built up my emotional strength? 
I feel like people would feel I’m just needy, clingy and stuff but I honestly try not to be and to not expect stuff from people but that still does bother me a lot. I know that my reactins and feelings are unnecessary and too much and that is something i completely realise but I don’t know how to stop feeling this way.

Also how do i exlain this to my family and friends without coming off as crazy or needy.",13Sep2020,1

Another kid Ik from school was invited but he has never been very nice to me for some reason. Anyway so my vest friend is completely ignoring me and just hanging out with this other kid. Should I just leave it and wait out the holiday or should I talk to him?",13Sep2020,1

702,"My best friend recently started dating this new guy. I’ve been with her when she FaceTimed him and so I got a chance to talk to him on the phone and me and him get along pretty great and make jokes with each other all the time.  

Recently I went to her house and spent a week with the both of them. Everything went great but I’ve picked up on certain things that he would do. For example I’ve caught him staring at my butt on more than one occasion. Each time he would look away and pretend he wasn’t. 

He would also playfully pick fights with me. I had just finished eating breakfast and he found best friends spray bottle and kept spraying me with water and so I chased him around the apartment with a cup of water. He also seems to take an interest in my love life. Constantly asking me who I’m talking to, what’s my type and even asking what my body count is etc (Me and best friend have a running joke to him that I’m a virgin (I’m not). He has a feeling I’m lying and constantly tries to find out how many guys I’ve slept with. 

Also we’d all be watching love island together and I was thirsting over the guys and he’d get upset and playfully hit me like he was a jealous bf or something. 

And later that night we were all goofing around and doing face masks and taking pictures and stuff together. Best friend wanted him to post a picture of us together with our masks and he made a comment and said “my friends are gonna think I’m having a threesome tonight”. Best friend was there when he said it and she didn’t address it so I thought it was best not to say anything either. 

During the week we were together her boyfriend had a court date for a speeding ticket and he asked me to come along with him for moral support (best friend had to work so she couldn’t come). 

So we’re all getting dressed. Best friend is getting ready for work and I’m getting dressed to go to court with him. I walk into the bathroom and out of the corner of my eye I see him laid out on the bed with what I think is his dick out. I’m not sure because like I said it was only out the corner of my eye. He’s saying something as if he’s trying to get my attention and I just pretend that I didn’t see anything. For reference her bathroom and bedroom are really close to each other. He can see me going into the bathroom and I can see him in the bedroom.

As were in the car together he made a comment about my “long beautiful legs” and said they were sexy. After he said that he got a phone call so I didn’t get a chance to ask him what he meant by that comment so I kinda just shrugged it off. 

Also in the car he asked me about my ideal guy. I told his muscular but I also don’t like guys that are too big  and he says “so I’m too big then huh” and seemed offended. He plays football and works out a lot and is extremely buff (like HUGE) and I laughed it off and told him “yeah for me anyway but bf likes you so that’s all that matters” so as to not offend. 

Then when we pulled into the parking lot there was an old guy in a truck who kept staring into my car (I drove). I pointed it out to him and he says “he (the old guy) must have never seen a pretty girl (referring to me) before” 

Then the day that I was supposed to leave. Best friend had just left for work and I was packing up my things. Her bf was in the bedroom and so I yelled out for him and asked him if he would help me take my things to my car. I didn’t get a response and assumed he didn’t hear me so I called his name again and he answered “yes baby”. And so I opened the door and we kinda just stared at each other. I was a little taken aback and confused that he would call me that and he kinda just smiled and laughed seeing my face.

At the time I just thought he might have confused me for my best friend but now that I’m thinking about it i think  that might not have been the case because

1. Me and best friend don’t sound anything alike 

2. We said our goodbyes very loudly when she was leaving for work and her apartment is not that big you can hear everything from every room and I’m pretty sure he heard the door shut and her leaving for work 

3.  When he realized it was me he didn’t seem embarrassed just smirked like he knew what he was doing 

I’ve been thinking about whether or not I should bring this up to best friend. The problem is he treats her really well (randomly bring her flowers the whole nine) and I don’t want to mess up a good thing for her. Plus i don’t want her to think I’m jealous and want to break them up purposely. Also I’m not sure if I’m reading too much into things and don’t want to bring it to her attention unless I’m absolutely sure. Am I reading too much into it? What should I do? 

(All parties involved are between the ages of 21-23 if that makes a difference)

Also I’m not really attracted to her boyfriend either and she knows this. She’s asked me before what I think of him (physically) and if I thought he was ugly. She said she wants an honest answer and that she wouldn’t get offended. I told her that personally I didn’t find him attractive but that it doesn’t mean he’s ugly. Also just want to add that I’ve never flirted back with him or even encouraged anything inappropriate because like I said I’m not even attracted to him.",13Sep2020,1

705,"Feel like I(25m) don't deserve anything.. 

I have a younger brother who is 9years younger than me....my parents would always celebrate his B-Day and never mine.. There would always be a celebration on his B-Day like they would invite his friends,get a cake, snacks and dinner.. I used to be the one to serve it to the guests with a heavy heart or just an expectation that they would maybe do it for me.. I was only 11/12years old and I wasn't a ""grown up"" to not expect it.. Through the years I had learnt to hate my B-Days and not expect anything out of it.. So naturally none of my friends ever did anything probably cos of the image I had projected.. 

Now I got into a relationship and for his B-Day I took him(25m) out to a hotel in the hills and everything he liked.. So I thought maybe I can expect more out of my B-Day cos I now have someone who cares about me a lot.. I have told these stories to him as well... 

Lucky me, my 25th B-Day came during covid, my first B-Day in this relationship. We couldn't even meet due to lockdown as both of us were stuck in different places .. After a couple of days I could go and meet him which I did.. And as he was really scared of catching the virus, he didn't do anything.. Neither did he put effort or do anything within the house.. 

So this is just bringing up my entire history with my B-Day and how noone has ever given a damn or made me feel special for once in my lifetime.. 
Should I just ignore that day cos it is just another day? I am feeling really insecure thinking that does noone really give a fuck about me? Am I a bad person or something and that's why no one cares about my B-Day? 

I confronted my boyfriend and he apologized a lot saying he will make up for it.. But we are in different cities now so there is basically nothing he can do right now.. I don't want to keep rubbing it on his face... Neither can I stop feeling so insecure about this.. What the fuck do I do?

708," To to start off the story I (18M) am friends with a (18F) lets call Lexi (Not real name). Lexi and I were planning on going on a overnight trip to a city about 6 hours away from our college. For the past two weeks I have been trying to plan this trip with her, but ever since I was locked up due to being exposed to a virus we have started to talk less and less to the point where it would take a few hours for her to respond each time and her responses kept on getting shorter and shorter. So I talked to a few friends who recommended that I call her since I was not able to meet in person.

Due to this I sent her messages for two days asking her to call me and that I would like to talk about the vacation and that it would be nice to hear from a friend. Each time she would respond with ""Why"" or ""Just text it to me"". My final straw was whenever she said ""Is it just us going? Cause I feel like that be a lil awkward Ngl"". Note: by then she had already said that she was 100% going and I had already paid for a hotel (nonrefundable) for both of us (which she said she was fine staying in the same room) and already made some reservations at restaurants. So I was worried that she might back out so I tried to text her, which didn't go anywhere, and then I asked if she could call me. Her response. ""Why."" After this I was mad and responded with

""Because I want to address your concerns about it being awkward, another reason is that I still have stuff I'm trying to figure out about the trip and I would like your input on it, another is that you normally respond with idc or ok and I would like some feedback that is more than one word, and I believe we should talk about this over the phone to get this straightened out. I would rather meet in person but due to my situation it's kinda hard.""

I will say that this came out harsher than I wanted it to. After I sent this she left me on read until I asked her why she left me on read. She simply responded that she was out with friends and couldn't talk atm.

After this I had left her alone for two days and I just asked if she wanted to talk over lunch tomorrow. I am afraid I just blew about $200 USD with no way of recovering it so needless to say I really want to talk, but she is making it hard. I don't know what I should do in this situation. I need help.

709,"Typing this on a throwaway account.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm a 23 yo male to give you guys context. There's a lot on my mind but I'll keep my list of problems short and sweet.

The bad stuff:

* Living at home. No car or license (working towards it).
* Working a job I have little motivation for.
* A 60 yo mother who's always overly anxious, self depreciating, and lonely--but now moreso since the pandemic. Every day she asks me a dozen questions I've already answered. Living with her is a fucking job sometimes. To give you an example, she'll forget something and joke about having dementia. That shit isn't fucking funny and I wish I could talk to her about it, but I have the feeling that the moment I do it'll literally go in one ear and out the other. I hate being around her needy ass.
* Just broke up with a girlfriend. I'm getting over it, but I still resent my mother for playing her part in it (I take responsibility for how things turned out, but I won't lie my mom has a way of needling her toxic anxiety in my life. It's a long story so I won't get into it).  
* A house that needs so many repairs and is basically located in the hood. It was my now-deceased grandmother's so there's pressure from the family to hold onto it. But seeing that it's only the mums and I living there, if I move out then it's bye bye home.
* COVID-related stresses. Can't go to the places I want, living with an older family member, etc.

Here's a list of good things in my life just so I don't sound like a whiny brat.

* I've learned to tolerate my job over the course of time. I work construction in the union making $27/hour (and that's just apprentice rates). It also toughened me up a bit.
* I have a passion for writing. I currently have a website, a blog, and a few other things that've gotten a couple hundred reads. Pursuing it my free time really helps take my mind off things and it gives me a reason to wake up in the morning. Though I'm aiming to make this my main source of income, I won't advertise my writing here since this isn't the place.
* Course living at home so expenses aren't destroying me. I have about $16,000 in savings, stocks, etc.
* I meditate and exercise when I can. It helps a lot but it's an on again off again thing.

&amp;#x200B;

I guess I'm trying to figure out what to do next. A part of me wants to get a car and move into a studio, but so many people have told me renting is a waste of money. I'm also worried that my mother's health will decline the moment I go away, despite my avoiding her I'm definitely a part of the glue keeping her from shattering into a million pieces. I cook, clean, mow the lawn, just to take some load off her. Not to say she couldn't survive but I wouldn't bet the farm on it. With all that being said I just don't find it mentally healthy to live at home anymore. 

I'm aware I'm more fortunate than most and I'm grateful when I realize that, but I suppose I need some guidance. Even some affirmation that I'm at least headed in the right direction will probably help me a ton.

‘How are you? Thanks for accepting my friend request’. 

I’m not friendly enough with him for this to be normal and I’m getting weird vibes from it. 

Do I just ignore the message and never think of it again (and perhaps delete him as a friend?) 

Or do I tell my parents about this weird behaviour?? I don’t want them to suddenly think their friend is a creep. 

It could just be innocent but I’m getting some red flags...",13Sep2020,0

The last couple weeks I’ve been having this repetitive dream that leaves me very nauseous and upset when I wake up. I can’t really understand the meaning behind it and to be honest, it scares me. When I wake up from the dream I’m left paralysed and very very disorientated, kinda like when you’re really drunk and you can’t see straight or move properly. I really can’t explain the feeling properly but when I wake up it takes me about 10 minutes to move even when I’m trying my hardest to move, even some nights I don’t even realise I’m awake yet. So the dream:

In the dream my mind is running a million miles an hour, and I mean it’s going so fast I can’t actually focus on anything at all, In the dream I get really dizzy, my limbs are moving without me controlling them and when I try and control them I kinda fall over or crash into things. I can’t have a single thought and my eyes are also speeding in circles and back and forth out of my control. When I see people or approach people (or even see my friends and family) their faces morph into other faces, sometimes very grotesque. When their faces morph sometimes they morph really fast or they morph into something that looks like it’s going to hurt my dream self. Tonight in my dream I kept approaching people and they were trying to help me slow down but then quickly they’ll turn into people trying to kill me and I have to defend myself but then they change back into people helping me. This all may sound very stupid but it’s very nightmarish for me. I’ve lost so much sleep and I feel so sleep deprived all the time because I fear going back to sleep. I think the worst part of it all is when I wake up, I feel so paralysed and helpless and I can’t move and it feels like my mind is going to explode as it feels like it’s still running a thousand miles an hour, even when awake. I really don’t know what to do, it’s happening and non-stop and it scares me. I’m sorry this post is all jumbled and probably doesn’t make any sense but I’m just so exhausted and tired after tonight’s dream and my eyes hurt. Should I go to a doctor? Is there anybody that can help? Thank you so much in advance and I apologise for such a confusing post.",13Sep2020,1
730,Pretty much what the title says. Left the stove on accidentally and woke up to smoke filled house. I ran to the kitchen and the fire was close to spreading to the shelves and counters. Thankfully I put it out by dumping water. Now everytime I try to sleep the anxiety of what couldve happened kicks in and i cant sleep because of it.

731,"About half a year ago, i met this girl that i fell in love with. She's older than me, we share the same sense of humor, and love for affection, cuddling and all that. She's adorable, in every way. I couldn't have her, cause she already was with someone, and soon we stopped talking altogether.

I've been alone for years, at this point. While i enjoy my time alone I'm beginning to realize that it's beginning to become unhealthy, spending so much time alone. So i began looking for a relationship. It's unbelievably hard for me to find anyone that i find interest in, over the span of the last 3-4 years, i've had 1 or 2 love interests, one didn't like me and one liked someone else.

When i had met the girl i talked about previously, i realized, she was everything I've ever wanted in another person, and i wanted to be with her, so bad. I was sad all the time since she just, wasn't available, she shows affection to everyone in the same way, no special treatment for the special someone she liked, she treats me as a friend, but despite her actions i always felt something more was there, she showed me kindness and affection that i had never experienced before, the kind that a boyfriend and girlfriend would share.

I was upset, when we stopped talking, and it lasted for about a month before i moved on, this was over summer, half a year later, she texts again, and at this point i thought all feelings for her were gone at this point. She had lost her contact list, and couldn't text me, she came to me first during this hard time she was facing, and low and behold, those feelings that were there oh so long ago come back.

Over the course of the last week, we talked, she revealed to me that she still had feelings for her ex, and wanted to be back with him, hell she was even willing to wait till later on in life if they happened to move in together, and if they were both still single they would date again. Her ex however doesn't show any interest in her, as that was the terms he put up, my only logical explanation was, if he really liked her still, she would date her now, instead of so long in the future, my crush even said to me that he was after another girl, i advised her to test if he was interested, suggested she stopped starting the conversations for a while and he never started them for four days (she texted him, after four days passed) in those four days she had came to my house twice, we played games, cuddled. Twice for more than half an hour each time. She treats all her friends like that and it's agonizing to think about it, that all of that mutual affection was just...friendship?

I had given subtle hints that i liked her, she didn't pick up on any, and i even constructed a story about this ""girl i liked"" when little did she know that girl was her, i just didn't refer to her directly. She said that she was tired of boys liking her and ""wanting to date her just cause they were a boy and she was a girl"" at that point i saw it was..useless. So i said that ""girl i liked?"" got with her crush and now i was left with no crush, she still doesn't know.

She's going through such a hard time and all she wants is a male friend, who didn't like her (she's tired of one's that did like her, cause she shows enough affection to mislead them to thinking that she likes them), and for her i was willing to be that male friend, despite how agonizing it is. She suggested, when she believed i had a crush on some other girl to take a break from her, and i can't, that would mean leaving her alone to cope with her sadness and loneliness. And either way, if half a year didn't diminish the feelings (in fact they're stronger than ever now) then a few days wouldn't work either.

I've been alone for a long time, i feel worse than i ever did, i want to help her, so bad...not as a friend but as her boyfriend. But i can't, and i can't make a move, or anything related until i know she likes me back, and she doesn't, she's made that much clear, she's set on her ex and i just don't know what to do. I can't stop talking to her because then i'd be leaving her alone, without anyone to talk too, cause she doesn't have any friends or anybody to speak with besides me and her ex boyfriend. And her ex boyfriend doesn't even care that much about her.

I know feel an overpowering, overwhelming sadness, i feel so powerless to change the situation, and i can't stop feeling this feeling. It's so god damn painful and it won't go away no matter what i do. So please, reddit, help me out? I need advice on how to suppress this feeling, maybe change things with this girl and help her to the best of my ability.

(I will answer any questions that need answering in order for help. I am a 15 year old male.)",13Sep2020,1
733,I know I'm a jerk because I waited this long but I wasn't sure how to tell them know I've always been really weak when it comes to them. Usually my mom and my sister brings up some excuse about how they never see us anymore and I cave or I did. However since quarantine started and since covid-19 hitting the state we live in pretty hard I haven't been around really any of my family but especially not them. They don't social distance and just last night my sister went to a bachelorette party and was riding on a party bus throughout our city. How do I tell them that I don't want to be around them because they're a danger to my daughter without making them feel bad and without burning bridges? My mom and my sister both are pretty good at manipulation and my mom has a pretty big victim complex so I'm worried that whatever I say will just be me being the bad guy and they're completely innocent. However I can't put my daughter in danger she is my number one priority I just really don't know what to do and since I am a coward I have waited until the day of to ask for help or say anything yeah it's not great.,13Sep2020,1
734,"So recently, i confessed to a girl that ive liked for quite some time now. Turns out she liked me back !!

739,"My boyfriend recently made a Discord server intended to be made huge. He wants as many people in it as he can get. He was excited to make it, so of course I was supportive. We got a good amount of people in it and started to game. It was fun and pretty damn interesting to meet and play games with a lot of new people.

Well, of course, I invited a few of my old friends. One of these friends said their friend wanted to join, so I said sure. I'd met this person before and they were pretty cool so I didn't mind.

That was until they posted a video of a kitten being burned alive in our NSFW channel.

Animal abuse is not something I take lightly. It deeply disturbs me to see these videos. They're permanently maiming/killing innocent animals because of shock value. It wasn't even just shooting the animal either, the guy literally held up a match or lighter to the cat and set it aflame. This guy purposefully doused the kitten in gasoline and set it on fire just to film a fucking video for shock value.

Anyway. My boyfriend is the owner of the server and I'm the co-owner. I brought him this video and he said, ""Well it was in the NSFW channel, so we can't do anything about it."" I was pissed off by this so I purposefully went to find the community guidelines for Discord and showed him the line saying that animal cruelty was not permitted under any circumstance. He finally let me take it down.

But wait, it gets better! Because my boyfriend later said that since animal abuse and gore is posted in big Discord servers all the time, it isn't a big deal to see ""mildly disturbing"" animal abuse videos.

Yes. Seriously.

I lost my fucking cool IMMEDIATELY. I went off on about animal abuse, even if it's heavily pixelated or the sound is off, IT IS STILL FUCKING ANIMAL ABUSE. These people make videos like this for the shock value. If it is spread around then they get what they want and they will continue to make more videos of innocent animals being killed or injured.

After my tirade he told me to stop responding, so I did. I figured a brick wall would've said the same thing if it could speak. But then he came back and said that what I was doing was petty and that I shouldn't have looked in the NSFW chat if I didn't want to see anything NSFW. Mind you, I had not seen anything REMOTELY gore related up until that point. It had just been mild porn or some stupid memes. Even then, that fucking permits animal abuse???

Ugh. What do I do, Reddit? He thinks he is in the right when I know damn sure he isn't. Nothing excuses any form of animal abuse, even if it's just a video of it happening. There's a reason that it exists and it is not okay.",13Sep2020,1
741,"So W. (19M) and me (19F)have been best friends for 3 years and have been as close as two friends could ever be. We connected on a different level, emotionally and character vise. However W. recently thought a lot about our friendship and realized all the things he loves about me and now he confessed and wants to start a relationship. He came to the conclusion that he likes me romantically and straight up told me.

I’m however not interested in a relationship with him. I don’t want to be in a relationship with anyone at all right now because I’m not ready for that stuff and nothing would change my mind. I love him as my soulmate, as my best friend but nothing more, i don’t find him attractive at all and can't imagine to do the things that a couples would do.

That's also what I kinda told him. He doesn't understand how I can not like him back, when we have this special bond and told me that he can't be friends with me anymore because it would break his heart to see me in a relationship with another person and it could get awkward.

W. wants to end the friendship and now I don’t know what to do, I don’t want to loose my best friend. Can anyone give advice?

745,"A little info about myself first, I am a freshman in College studying Computer Science....but my heart isn't in it. Everyone I know from my family, to even some of my friends has directly, or indirectly pushed me into this path because they think it's what I'm ""interested""  just because I use computers a lot.  I use it for gaming and reddit, I ain't a code monkey. 

I  expressed interest in Skilled Trades, and wanted to go that route but my parents, one who has a blue collar background and has NEVER worked in a White Collar environment tells me that I'm not interested in blue collar work, despite me being openly enthusiastic about a potential career in that field. 

I'm not really into Coding. I tried classes in High School...but I just couldn't get into it. Spending hours staring at a screen hunting down stupidly simple problems, stuff as simple as a misplaced period. That's not the ""problem solving"" I was led to believe. It's just tedious stupid work. I couldn't imagine tackling the complex monstrosities that actual Software Devs get to work on.  Hell, I don't even practice much if at all in my freetime. 

On the other hand, I've always admired those who could work on, and repair machinery. Simple, and complex from changing a bike tire, to rebuilding an engine. Working with my hands in a material setting as opposed to a virtual one. That's where my heart really is. 

It doesn't help when I hear horror stories on r/cscareerquestions about companies using elaborate screening techniques, where even people who went all in at College (Masters, Certs, Projects, the works) try and fail to get a job after hundreds of tries.  Plus the high volume of people funneling into that field has me greatly concerned for the state of the job market when I graduate.  Combined with my lack of heart in the subject, it makes me very hesitant to continue, but I feel compelled to do so because pressure from my family makes me feel like I've got nowhere else to go. 

Sure, it pays well. But what's the point if I end up actively despising what I'm doing?

755,"A job opportunity brought me from the western part of Michigan to Chicago where I've lived for 3 years. It's been a great experience, but I've started missing life back home and have come to realize that I'm not meant for big city living after all. Many people love it here for the nightlife, bars, restaurant scene, mass transit, whereas I have different desires like easy access to nature, parks, and hiking. Last year, I began to reevaluate whether I see myself staying in Chicago, as I was experiencing a lot of nostalgia and thought I'd give it a few months to pass. It still hasn't. Here's why:

I feel like city living is ""stifling"" my progression in life. I'm 27 and have always thought I'd be settled down, have a house with a yard, married and with a family by now. Everyone I know from high school and college are on their 2nd and 3rd child, whereas my life has become the complete opposite: I overpay for a tiny studio apartment, my closest friends in the city have since moved away, I have no dating prospects and slowly losing my desire to grow in my job. If I had the choice, I'd choose to be a stay-at-home mom rather than pursue a career.

I admit that this might be a case of ""grass is greener"" syndrome, but I can't help but think that I'd have an easier time achieving my ideal life elsewhere. I don't see myself affording a condo/house in the city, but I'd be able to if I were back home. I also sense that the Chicago dating scene (as with any other big city) is competitive and that I don't fit the stereotype of what city men are looking for (I'm more of an outdoors-y country girl).

Dating has been a big thing for me lately. Having just turned 27 has made me feel like time is passing me by. I just downloaded dating apps for the first time last week and went on my first date. The guy said he couldn't see himself living anywhere else than the city. My stomach dropped. I knew I'd be lying to myself if I agreed. Long story short, there was no second date.

So, here's the dilemma: As much as I want to move back home, I've been reading a lot of local Reddit threads where people constantly complain how hard it is to meet someone because they marry young there. It's very discouraging, yet odd to hear ""how bad the dating scene is"" when I've had the complete opposite experience: I've had more people approach me and strike up conversations in public back home than I've had here in Chicago (hence downloading the dating apps). I've also received more matches from guys my type while browsing the apps back home compared to Chicago. Should I just ignore these collective opinions since my experience proves otherwise, or might they have a point that I should take into consideration before making a move?

As I see it, Chicago has a large pool of prospects but I'm not sure there's a large pool of people looking for serious relationships like I am. Whereas back home, there might be a smaller pool of prospects but I feel like I'd have an easier time finding someone who also wants to settle down sooner rather than later.

I know I'm over-analyzing this and perhaps too concerned with placing this decision solely on comparing dating scenes, but I'm fearful that if I move away from Chicago, I move away from potential SO-meeting opportunities (though my experience here proves otherwise...) I would hate to move somewhere where the dating scene is even worse - especially at such a critical age in life. I'm just feeling unhappy living in Chicago and not sure how much more time I should waste pondering this decision. Thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

766,"A friend of mine is acting very erratic and I am scared

We've been friends for years. We'd make little kung fun action shorts. Him vs any stunt people we could muster. Always produced by a woman. She was basically the only woman on set for 90% of our shoots. Unfortunately, finding stuntwomen became a more difficult task than I had anticipated. And our crew was basically just my male roommate on the camera and my producer.  Our budgets ranged from 200 dollars--1,000. Real big budget shit...

Anyways, he blocked me on everything. When I finally blew him up on enough fake accounts, he emailed me. 

He told me that Hollywood is a lie. It's run by pedofiles. That I'm only helping that system continue to run. He mentioned a friend of his who was offered a movie. ""He turned down a project because they told him he had to accept pedofilia or else he couldn't make the film"". 


He then went on to state that I cornered a woman multiple times on our little short film sets, asking them to go on a date with me. This is untrue. I'm in complete shock. A recurring theme amongst our past conversations were that we needed to find more stuntwomen because we could only find men. So our shorts ended up just being a couple of dudes who wanted to do a favor to him. It legitimately doesn't make any sense. I cannot think of a single person who would even say such a lie. Yet he says there are multiple. I really don't know where this is coming from. All of the crew members I've ever had still follow me on social media and check in periodically.  And that includes the females. Why? Because they've all been friends. They do a favor for me. I do one for them. Filmmaker homies. I'm just so confused. If there were actually allegations, wouldn't they have told the producer instead of an actor? 

He mentioned a coworker of mine. She's a martial artist. She wanted to act in one of my shorts. So we built a character for her. We were all excited, including my friend. This girl is trained with swords and nunchucks. So the fight scene was going to be amazing. However, due to covid, we never did it. I only wrote a script. But he never met her.  He mentioned that she had come over, and my roommate, my neighbor, and a friend of mine that lives in a different state were making fun of him. Calling him gay. Then the woman arrived and I said ""Toxic masculinity leads you to make gay jokes"".  That...never happened.  They never met. She never came over. She's never been to my house. 

He also said that he was offered a film, but he didn't want to do it, so he threw my name in the ring.  ""I know you think I wouldn't support you, but I do. I threw your name out there. They didn't want to because of your behavior on BLANK SHORT FILM.""  Here's the thing. The short he mentioned...My crew was my friends and we all worked together again afterwards on other projects. And still do. 

He then went on to accuse me of lying about my sexuality (I'm pansexual) because he's never seen me swipe for men on Tinder (I'm in the closet. Few people know. I'm not about to openly swipe for dudes).  


I'm at a loss for words. I don't know what happened with my friend. He had mentioned that he had mental disorders, but he never mentioned which ones when asked. Maybe he's having a breakdown? In his email he mentioned he's been dipping in and out of psychosis. I don't know what to do. Do I call him? Do I wait it out? He said he's moving out of state soon. I'd like to see him before that.

767,"Well my ex (24F) has been emotionally unstable so she decided to leave me so she could get better, which I totally understand and let her be, this was about a week ago but we have been talking since (not like we used to but we have communication). So I’m not really sure I want to get back with her but I do want to give it a try. Since she left me I have tried to see her and she has been ducking me (which is understandable, but I just wanted to treat test the waters). So to get to the point there is this girl that my ex kinda doesn’t like cause she liked me at the same time as her. So my ex had her muted on Ig so i unmuted her and today she posted a picture and I liked it. No my ex says she was willing to get back with me but now there are no chances. Is it really that bad what I did? I think those are privileges (not liking other girls pictures) you get when we are in a serious relationship not if you let me go!",13Sep2020,1

This wouldn’t be at all weird to me if we hadn’t had a conversation prior to our breakup when he told me that if we were to breakup he would want to go no contact.

I haven’t heard from him in about 2 weeks however, last night I was on my phone when I noticed he was trying to facetime me and this caught me really off guard so I didn’t even pick up. I did text him a few minutes later asking if it was an accident and was met with no response? I am so confused?

774,"This is a long one, so bear with me. Also, this is my first post here. Hopefully I’m not breaking any rules. 

Anyway, I (f/29/european) have been best friends with this girl for some time now. I’d describe myself as heteroflexible but not truly bisexual as I generally swing more towards the guy side. 
She’s a free spirit and very extroverted while I live more inside my own head and am very introverted. We talk about everything and got along really well at the beginning, to the point of us talking everyday, sometimes even more than once. Recently, she broke up with her boyfriend and has been exploring and enjoying her single life, gotten a new job and apartment, so she has no time whatsoever. Then I realized she just didn’t have time for me since she kept going on dates with dudes and then meeting other friends. I told her and at that time I knew I was jealous because she didn’t have time for me. Recently that had turned into unreasonable possessiveness where I resent listening to her stories about basically anyone else she’s currently seeing and I hate the fact that she goes out with other people more than me. 

Now, To me she’s always been pretty. (Stunning eyes and face) And today I saw her and what I thought was not: “oh what a nice dress you look great.”
It was: “fuck, who the hell did she dress up for like that?” Had to keep myself from actively staring at her all the time. 
I miss her all the time and I find myself wondering what the hell is wrong with me. I don’t tell her how to live her life and I certainly never tell her listening to her sexual escapades drives me crazy. I just quietly hate everyone who comes close to her and I’m afraid of myself. I’m not sure if I simply miss being close to her as before or if I’ve developed feelings for the opposite sex. I also think other women are attractive. But none of those other women are her.

775,"Hello everyone. I hope your day is going well. I'm in the quite the pickle and could you some advice. I've recently learned that I'm addicted to dating apps and the feeling of just wanting to be wanted. Always grew up introverted and have felt awkward around people so I never had much of a dating life until I got into college (currently 24 years old with a bachelors degree in Computer Engineering).

I've wanted to be in a relationship for a long time due to my feelings of lonliness. I have friends and talk to them often, but feel like something major is missing from my life and that maybe it's a relationship with someone. I've matched with girls on tinder/bumble and had a few dates, but nothing that stuck. Same with hookups admittedly which was never my thing, but I believe I did them out of lonliness. I'm honestly just looking for some advice on how I can conquer this as I feel like I constantly download and redownload tinder hoping that something will change each time.

All criticism and advice is greatly appreciated. If you need more information to help just let me know. Thank you all so much. :)

TL;DR : Addicted to dating apps due the feeling of wanting to be wanted and not sure how to overcome it. Lonliness is a major factor in this and I need advice.",13Sep2020,1

784," As you might gather from my username, I'm a musician and I have recently discovered that a large part of trying to market yourself is dressing with style and flare. However, I have severe body issues that make me literally have a panic attack if I wear anything that isn't super baggy. I used to have a sense of style and wear anything from colorful 70s bell bottom pants to ripped jeans and a band t shirt depending on my mood, but now I dress really blah (think gray oversized tees and men's sweatpants). I really miss having fun with fashion, but I CAN NOT bring myself to dress how I used to dress because I'm scared that it might cause me to relapse into my ED and that is the last thing I can afford right now. Also, if I can prevent a panic attack, you bet your ass I will.

 If anyone can help me find a style of clothing that is still baggy and doesn't show much skin, but also looks more put together than sweat pants, I would really appreciate it. It doesn't need to be the most stylish thing on earth, just good enough to not get in the way of my music career (my style of music is indie/alternative pop if that helps)",13Sep2020,1
785,"Hi everyone. So my (31F) brother (28M) is struggling at the moment and I don't know what to say or do.

He moved out of the family home a couple of years ago and hasn't really been great since. He's always been quite ""laid back"" on the surface, but can be quite an anxious person when you get to know him. He's living with friends about 15 minutes away from the family, and he says he's happy but me and my parents aren't convinced. 

My family live not too far from a factory in town and the noises from the factory were apparently keeping him from sleeping (he works odd shifts) and making him anxious. The noises can be annoying at times but we didn't realise it was that much of an issue. The sleeping issue got to the point he went to the doctor and was given sleeping tablets and something for the anxiety 'caused by the factory noises'. Around this time, my brother's friend mentioned that his roommate was moving out, and asked if my brother wanted the room. It seemed a good idea, his friend is lovely and my brother's not ready to live alone so it made sense.

Since then it's just been one thing after another for him and it's causing the family concern. His sleeping never got better because his friend (and now roommate) lost a loved one around the time my brother moved in, and my brother stayed awake almost round the clock to be there for his friend. 

He's had so many random (and quite serious looking) accidental injuries, to the point he's had to go get checked out at hospital. He always seems to have some kind of cold or stomach bug. He very rarely visits family and when he does make plans to visit, 80% of the time he cancels on the day. There's always some excuse. 

His sleeping issues got to the point he was too tired to work, and ended up losing his job. He says he's too anxious to work because he can't sleep and is exhausted but whenever we try to contact him, he's always sleeping/trying to sleep/just waking up from a nap - so I just don't understand. 

The house they're living in is like a student house from what he describes - parties all the time, staying up all night and half the time he can't even get into his own bed because a friend of a friend is already passed out there. It's so messy that he tripped over a pile of clothes a few weeks back and fractured his ankle (although we didn't know this until much later because he didn't want to call the doctor). 

His ankle means he can't easily leave the house at the moment, in fact he's barely leaving his room. He admits he's feeling low but if we try and talk to him about it he just clams up and leaves / makes excuses to hang up the phone. 

Something isn't right with him, I'm sure, but I have no idea what to do. Our parents feel the same but also are clueless as to what more to try. Any suggestions?",13Sep2020,3
786,"So, about a week ago, I've(F, 25) had this really bad argument with my best friend(F,26). It started pretty harmlessly, we were just chatting about work (we both work in retail, me at a bookstore and her at a grocery store). Then, out of nowhere, she dropped the following bomb: 

-Oh yeah, by the way, do you remember that birthday party I went to last week? So the other two who went with me got their test results back and it turns out they were both negative, so so far only the host is COVID positive. 

I stare at her because I can't believe she actually went to that party with a fuckton of people she didn't even knew, which I had told her was a bad idea before. So I asked her

-You say the others, is your test result not back yet?

-Oh no, I did not go to get tested. I feel like all the negativity in the media would get on my mood if I actually took it seriously and got tested. As long as I do not get a fever and the doctor sends me to the hospital I won't worry about COVID. 

I couldn't believe that she actually said that, especially since apparently the host of the party had such a severe case she actually had to be rushed to the er. Now since I know my friend and I know she takes off her mask whenever she can, especially a work where wearing it is only mandatory when she is not behind the glass panel in front of the cash register, I asked her if she is at least self quarantining. She gave me an amused look and told me that no, no way would she do that. She would die of boredom alone at home. We live in a country where this is not a problem, you know. If you call in sick for two weeks they can't fire you and have to pay you so no excuses there, it really only is about her getting bored at home.

At that point, I was pretty pissed already. I told her that she should at least wear her mask more often then at work because she gets in contact with so many people at the store, to which she replied that no, if she has to wear that thing non stop the whole day she will go crazy, it is too uncomfortable and she can't breathe.

At that point, I lost it. In my family heart diseases are not that uncommon and I have more than one relative (my dad included) who is at high risk of dying should they contract the virus and my great-aunt actually died of it (which my friend didn't knew so I can't really hold that against her). We as a family have had to take care of all of them as good as we could and make sure they have as little exposure to other people who could contract the virus as possible. But not everyone has a family like that that can help and those people have to rely on everyone else doing their best to prevent that shit from spreading. Her telling me that she did not want to be cautious because it makes her feel down was  (at least for me) her telling me that she did not care if people like my dad died as long as she felt good and that really hurt me. And I told her that but she wasn't really willing to accept my point of view so I told her I think she is very irresponsible and left the conversation at that. 

We haven't spoken since, it's been over a week and it is really getting on my mood. I still think I was right (or at least not entirely wrong) but I am willing to swallow my pride and just take the first step towards her. I just don' know how. We didn't really call each other names or anything, the worst thing I said was that she is being irresponsible with the lives of other people, but to be frank, we've never had an argument like this one before. In all those years we've known each other we've never been not talking or texting for days. So I don't really know how to handle the situation now, what can I say to make up for it?",13Sep2020,1

793,"I used to have a lot of friends but I don't anymore. I finally got a girlfriend who I love more than anything else in the world and she lives me too and she makes me crazy happy.
I am terrible at studying and I absolutely suck at math and science and any other subject you throw at me.

I used to study for 2 minutes and ace tests but something happened and last year even when I studied a lot and confidently wrote stuff like chemistry exams I couldn't understand where the answers I wrote even went wrong and I completely lost motivation to study science anymore and after a few more exams where I got 15/20, 12/20 and me getting fucking shocked I just gave up. I play games and im fucking tired of it. I try making youtube videos but something or the other goes wrong and I have to start over again every time and after hours of recording my videos just don't serm good enough.

I sit and fucking watch youtube videos all day and I don't fucking know what else to do.

I'm in my senior year and next year I need to choose what I should major in. 

I hate the idea of being a doctor it's gross for me.
I am terrible at math so no engineering.
I try learning coding and I wanna become something like a programmer but jezuz fuck me in the ass therr is so much to learn and so many people out there who are already like fucking gods.
And also a cs major needs good math.

I don't have any one other than my girlfriend to talk to about this. She always tries to just say it's ok and I'll eventually find something I can do but idk...

I always thought if I failed at life I would just kill myself and take the easy way out because you know... Five seconds of pain killing yourself is less than struggling on the streets.

I come from like a higher middle class family like you could say like right between the line of rich and middle class.

Everyone in my fucking family gets fucking 100/100 from my mom's side and my dad's side.

I'm not kidding, from gold medals and state number one's my cousin's have it all. We are the weakest in our entire family. My sister is in college now and she actually got decently good marks and I'm sitting here  not knowing what to do for the upcoming exams tomorrow and day after and so on. Right now I'm managing because these teachers keep sending the question paper to us.

The sad part is even with the question paper. I literally. Can't. Remember. Anything.

I swear I cry during my after school classes for math everytime she gives a simple arithmetic progression sum and I can't do it properly. 

Everyone in my class can do the sums with the steps written out fast than I can search the question and copy it in my book.

It hurts every time I try my best and I can't get the answer right to thr simplest and stupidest of questions and I know it's stupid and I understand everything but I just can't get it right.

Now it's not like I practice a lot or anything because I just gave up I literally can't with this anymore.
I used to be so good at studying and I used to come like top five in my class every single time and after high school and especially ninth grade the first time I saw science answer sheet and the marks I got that shit fucking broke me. I used to teach the teachers science and everyone would ask me questions and shit. Now I don't even have more than like four friends and only one talks to me who is my gf.

I don't know what I'm still typing but I just don't think I can go anywhere in life and there is only a few more months to pick majors.

I always wanted to start a business or something but I'm good at absolutely nothing. Maybe pc building and trouble shooting and all that jazz but so are 10 bajillion other people.

My parents probably won't support me after sometime as they always favour my sister and my mom literally doesn't like me for God fucking knows why.

She doesn't like that I have my opinions and I'm not superstitious like her and the fact that I don't believe random whatsapp forwards and Facebook facts and always talk about science and the fact that I came out as an atheist.

I go and hug her and tell her to smile and ask her why she is sad and try to help her and try to talk to her or call her into my room to show some cool stuff but she just doesn't give a shit about it.

She dances with my sister for bts songs when she calls her and is always in her room and fully supports her and she basically also gets everything and anything because like two years ago she almost died of some stupid stomach infection or some crap.

My dad also acts like he likes me and I love them both and they both do so much for me but just when im happy and excited for some random reason I'll hear my mom shouting and my dad talking about how big of a failure I am and I sit I cry in my room with no one to talk to. My mom doesn't like anything my dad does for me and I always have to fight and argue for weeks if I want the most simplest things I'm interested in.

My dad had told me multiple times that he is cutting down on talking to me during fights and u know what? I totally see it. I don't know why and I don't what I did.

I sit in my room crying all day and depressed
While my sister broke his hand and it led to a plastic surgery for his finger. He still walks to her room with a smile as my sister slams the door on his face. My dad hasn't been to my sister's room in probably months. She always shouts at him and she gets to call my mom a bitch with zero consequences. She gets to break her phone and get it replaced with zero questions.

My father asked me many times if I wanna leavr the house and go to a boarding school and he seems completely ok with the idea of never seeing me again.

I don't do anything and try to help out and I talk to my dad a lot and make him pop corn everytime I make some, make fries every other day, randomly come and hug him during his work and ask him what's up and it fucking hurts everytime I hear them shout or say something through the door and the loom he gives me everytime I walk past him and the disappointment in his face is out of the world.


They are supportive.... Kinda mostly idk it's complicated.


I'm a stupid teenager who has mood swings all the time and I don't know what to do in life as I basically suck at everything I've tried and every one of my friends have already started going to engineering coaching or programs for lawyers for something while I'm struggling here to learn one concept in my second language and social science and math.

800,"Hey all,

Since early April I’ve been having issues with the way my roommate lets his gf be in our apartment. To preface, my roommate and I never sat down to discuss personal boundaries with our SO’s. Hindsight, that was my mistake. My roommate and I have lived together through college and this is the first stretch of time that we both have had SO’s, so I expected things to go a lot more smoothly than planned.

Since early April, his SO would spend on average 5 nights a week at our place. They would subsequently set up shop in the living room for most of the next day, from 9am to nearly 11pm. At first I thought it was a little annoying but I had a decent setup in my room, so I thought it wasn’t a big deal.

Fast-forward to June, I walk into the living room to see her in the living room chatting with two random strangers with no roommate in sight. I was a little shocked considering that I was in an area that was hit pretty hard by the virus, and in hindsight I should’ve told her in that moment that she’s overstepping some boundaries. Luckily nothing like that has happened since, but on several occasions it’s been made clear that she was in the apartment while my roommate and I weren’t there. 

I texted my roommate in June over this, making sure we’re doing our best to actually share our shared spaces and to do our best with social-distancing. His response to paraphrase was “if you wanted more time in the living room you could’ve just asked”. Which 1) wasn’t the point of the text and 2) shouldn’t have to be the case even if I did want time in the living room. All the furniture and TV in the living room were bought by me, and that’s a shitty thing for me to hang over his head so I didn’t. 

Ever since then, it’s kinda been a culmination of little things that have built into just an annoying issue. She’ll take showers every time she’s over and doesn’t clean up loose hair so there’s just a small animal sitting in our shower corner. She’ll take it upon herself to do all the dishes even though that in itself is something she shouldn’t be doing nor expected to do. She’ll rearrange and reorganize the cabinets in our kitchen so I have play scavenger hunt for my cooking pans. She’ll get her boyfriend to text me that the litter box for my cat smells and needs cleaned out and subsequently list the negative health concerns of not cleaning out the litter box, even though it’s something I’ve been managing pretty well. The only reason she’s smelled it is because she would only do laundry at our place, which is where the litter box is located.

Last week, I texted my roommate giving him a heads up that my gf and I would be having a movie night in the living room at 7 so if they were in the living room they’d have time to clear out. We got home late due to traffic around 7:30 to find them in the living room, and as we walked in my roommate’s gf started to pout about having to clear out. Like holy shit, you’re 22 and don’t even live here.

I know that my rationale is littered with pettiness, but at this point I’m a little fed up with them. It’s like they act like they’re living in their own apartment and I’m just the unwanted roommate that makes an occasional appearance. Any advice on what I should do? Should I text my roommate/his SO, or even both?

To add some clarification, she used to live in an apartment before moving back in with her parents last month. I’m just afraid that the trend is only going to continue with how things are going. And to clarify, my gf only spends about a night per week at our place.",13Sep2020,1
803,"In June we went to Ashley to buy some furniture for our new house. We found a couple things and got financing to pay for it. They told us a date everythong would be delivered in about a month, but that date came and they changed it again to another month later. A few weeks after they call us again to tell us there actually is no definite ship time and they have no clue when our furntiure will get to us. 

So we do what anyone wouldve done if they bought something they arent getting, and we told our sales rep to cancel everything. He says sure but our bed and bedframe can still be delivered that wrekend and he'll take care of the rest. The mattress comes but not the frame. Sales rep says frame will be delivered in two weeks. A few days before we text him to confirm its even still coming, and he calla and says no it isnt, and that he never even cancelled our order, and that he doesnt care because hes quitting because we ruined his job by cancelling.

What on earth? We called the manager and he told us he'll ""see what he can do"" and we havent heard back since.

What steps should be taken to resolve this?",13Sep2020,1

now, when i see any gay guys in a relationship, friends, social media mutuals, even celebrities, i have a complete mood switch and just feel awful about myself. like i’ve unfollowed these people, backed out of friendships etc, even come between some of these couples because i can’t help myself? like i cant fathom others having what i have never had? then that makes me feel worse about myself and i spiral. 

i just wanted some advice on how to overcome this sense of jealousy, or just some insight as to why i feel like this? i feel like i’ve been rejected so many times that i don’t feel like i’ll ever be happy or in a relationship and it saddens me to see others happy. i also have massive insecurities and anxiety (don’t we all though), especially about my appearance (my body, my wonky face, my voice, interests etc), and i feel like my jealousy is just making it worse? idk what to do, pls help me xx",13Sep2020,1
808,"My husband (23M) and I (22F) are separated. In the state of North Carolina, you must be separated for a year before you are allowed to finalize a divorce. 

He is in the military, so we paid the mortgage with his money and the rest of the bills with mine. (I work as well.) I am also a full time college student (6 courses) in my junior year of university. This really screws me over because 1. We bought a home together and 2. I’ve got three dogs that are ALL “Pitt bull” criteria and make it hard for me to find a place to live. I can’t stay in the home we bought because we are 50/50 on it, and I can’t refinance it in my own name. If he doesn’t want to keep it, then when the year is up I have to sell the house and we split whatever we make 50/50. Said by the courts. 

Even if I could find a place to stay, I don’t make enough money to support myself and my pets. If I picked up a second job, there would be no caring for my pets and it would defeat the purpose of me getting the second job in the first place. This set of events has caused me to fall behind immensely in school (I’ve had to pick up more hours because of all this at work.)

So it’s coming down to the wire and I have no savings account and thousands in debt from all of this. (Namely the ex who was so irresponsible with money and left me to pay hundreds in bills while he ate out a bought drinks and spent money on whatever he wanted.) I have the option of moving back in with my parents but I can’t bring my dogs and my bird (I’ve had a large parrot for years now.) so I need to find a place that could care for my pets until I got on my feet. Or that could help me finically with a living situation. I really don’t know. There are so many aspects to this that I’m not sure where to start. Dropping out of school isn’t really an option because I’m going on a GI bill passed from my dad which has a time limit, and I’ve already had to take one break due to my epilepsy and one break due to my (ex)husbands military orders forcing us to PCS. I keep looking at my pets and absolutely breaking down at the thought of abandoning them. 

TL:DR; I have a time frame to find another place to live, I have $0 to my name and I can’t afford my pets and need a place for them to go where I won’t lose them forever.",13Sep2020,1

I have decided recently that I want to be more social which, to me, means being more open to going to social events and keeping in contact with old friends. I really want to expand my social circle and I think the best place to start is by strengthening relationships that I already have.

Some people that I've thought about reconnecting with are an old pen pal that I haven't spoken with in about a year and friends that I went to study abroad with and with whom I used to be pretty close.

I also want to strengthen my relationship with my cousins. I have always wanted a sister so I could share the things that are going on in my life with (not gonna do this with my brothers because that's just weird to do with another guy to me haha), but recently I realized that I should just try to develop this with my female cousins since we are about the same age and we used to be really close anyway.

I'm just not sure how to reach out to them without it being weird. Some of my old friends reach out to check on me occasionally and I want to reciprocate, but they live so far away so it's not like we could even make plans in person. I guess I just want to ask about their lives without prying too much, and I want to get to the point where I have a few people I can confide in and hang out with when we are in the same area.",13Sep2020,1

812,"Hey there.

To put it in short, whenever I watch a new series, I'll fixate on a certain character and change my personality to be the exact same as theirs. Same mannerisms, demeanour, etc.

Obviously, this is weird. Very weird, but I can't stop myself.

I'll fixate on them for extended periods of time and mainly fixate on characters with similar personalities to me, or what was mine, and change it up to exactly match theirs, but it's still a change, and I'm gradually starting to rely on these characters for my sense of identity.

Even worse, if I can't nail their personality or start to switch to another character, I get extremely annoyed at myself and feel like I'm betraying that character and my love for the source material, only making me desperately fixate on acting like them more.

How can I put an end to this? I know why I do it; acting like a beloved character I find cool almost makes me forget about my pitiful self-esteem, but it's not healthy, it's weird, off-putting and something I can't nor want to do forever.",13Sep2020,1

830,"Hello I am an African American Male in USA. Age 27. I usually maintain a shiny or calm disposition in the workforce wherever I work. That way, I can appear trusted to not come off as a stereotypical angry animal that most strangers come to expect. That said, the last few jobs I worked haven't worked in my favor. And while I've been laughed at by the police in reporting these, I can't help but feel I could've somehow prepared better for my own survival.
Here are some examples:

I used to work for a Flatbush Food Co Op in Brooklyn. The supervisor by name of Sam is a 70year old Iraqi war veteran of some sort, and works the dairy section of the store. I was to work/help him. However most questions asked of him would be met with insults, yelling and attitude loud enough to get the attention of my manager. On multiple occasions Sam would put his hands on me. My manager would tell me that if I continue tomake him look bad I would get fired. I eventually left after reporting this to HR, who went back on their cameras, deleted the footage of these assaults and told me they couldn't find proof. Witnesses stayed silent, etc.
The employees there are aware of Sam's history, but I don't know what I could've done to get proper treatment there. 

Second Job: I worked as a barback at a bar in Brooklyn. There was a technical issue with our water not heating up fast enough. Moments later, the bosses husband runs in. Snaps his finger at me multiple times like a dog, not calling me by name other than ""You! C'mere!"". He asks me what I asked his wife(Boss) I bring up my phone to reference our conversation, but he didn't want to see it and kept yelling. I chose to take on a neutral stance in my face while maintaining eye contact. I figure if I stay silent and let him yell he will eventually calm down. Later my bartender got annoyed with me for not telling him I texted the boss. ""We're on the same team, what did you do?"" I no longer work there due to COVID-19.

Third Job: I worked as another barback for a speakeasy styled bar in Brooklyn. One of the bartenders I work along is a junkie, and cannot maintain composure without some drug(cigarettes, weed, alcohol). I usually abstain from drinking at work to avoid issues with inventory inconsistencies. I've noted this man drinks, samples and brings his own cans in and out of the workplace. One night he starts smoking weed on his break. A customer gets a little too drunk gets an attitude to not being served fast enough and leaves after making a comment about my race. My bartender confronts me about not serving the customer in a timely manner. I explain to him he shouldn't be getting high at work and get cut early(bartenders discretion). I speak to the manager, tell him about my issues with the bartender himself including the drinking, weed, etc. (We have a immediate termination policy on these) and get told that my coworker and I may just take issue with one another because we ""are alike"". I permanently lose my shift on that day(1/2) and haven't worked there since COVID. The bartender now works there and at the other bar I used to work for.

If there any questions, please feel free to ask. My goal is to learn from these so that I may have the mental strength necessary to maintain my job, but also develop skills needed to avoid being blamed for things I perceived to be out of my control. I wanted to be honest, but I'm not sure what that means anymore and am willing to read any books on manipulation or lying if there any available.",13Sep2020,1

833,"I feel like I'm in a terribly messy situation and I'm at a complete loss here. I'm on mobile so I'm sorry if things aren't perfect, and I'm sorry if this is long. I've lurked on here for a while debating if I should post this or not, but I think its time. TL:DR at bottom. 
 
A bit of Backstory:
My (25f) bf (23) and I started dating almost three years ago. We had both just gotten out of messy relationships and weren't looking for anything serious, just to kind of have fun after some disastrous (mentally and physically) years. That is, until I had gotten pregnant, 4 months in. It was a complete shock because I was told I would need serious medical intervention if I ever even hoped to be a mother, and even then, my chances were low. Yes, I was shocked and scared, but mostly I was excited that my dreams of being a mom could come true! Problem is, is that neither of us had had a chance to heal from our previous relationships and really take good care of our mental health. 
 
We moved in to an apartment together right after we found out. We both wanted to try and make it work for our daughter, but we immediately started having communication issues. [To try and maintain some anonymity I'll be a bit vague on some things.] He was into some (mildly) illegal and (fairly) dangerous activities that I had asked him to either cut down on or stop all together (not drugs). Find an outlet that isn't illegal that he could still enjoy. I wanted him to do it so our daughter didn't grow up without a father/ so we could avoid legal trouble. This has led to multiple breakdowns, lies and manipulations. During this we were going through therapy together where the therapist had told him to grow up and be responsible for the new life we were bringing into the world. I never left because I thought couples therapy was helping, I thought it was getting better. 
 
By the time my daughter was born, he did cut down almost completely on his illegal activities, but getting rid of that outlet caused new problems. It allowed his depression to show itself and his anxiety to take over completely. This caused other major communication issues. Any time I'd bring up something he even remotely didn't like he would either shut down completely, get extremely angry, or he would leave. He'd always say things like ""I don't want to be like my dad, I want to be there for our daughter"" and then I'd have to beg him to put his phone down and spend time with her, then he would just go off the rails and do one of the aforementioned things. He does things to alienate me from himself and other people, like planning a date and then going to hang out with a friend or picking up a shift at work just to get away. It got to the point that I never saw him until 10 at night and he'd be ready to go to bed by then. Once in a while I'd try to bring up how i was feeling alienated and lonely and like he wasn't attracted to me anymore, and he would just get mad at me, and say I was manipulating him because I'd only bring it up late at night (the only time I'd ever see him). I'd try making friends, but he'd just start flirting with my girl friends or he would make accusations that my guy friends liked me more than a friend and guilted me into not being their friends anymore. I see the red flags, don't get me wrong, but it never seems like he is doing these things on purpose. It's like his depression and anxiety and anger towards his past are running his life completely. 
 
After having my daughter I ended up with severe PPD. I couldn't work, because daycare is too expensive, couldn't make friends, and felt so alone and worthless... so I tried to kill myself. I felt that everything that was happening was my fault.. I ended up in a mental hospital for a week and since then I have been doing a tremendous amount of work on myself and am in a MUCH better place mentally. My actions caused us to have some much needed conversations and make some changes. He is now in independent therapy trying to work on his depression and anxiety, he is actively trying... sometimes. He'll do really good for a while and then give up. He's never had anyone there for him. He's been abused, kicked around and treated very poorly his entire life, and I know its something he needs to work through, and I've see that he can, just sometimes it doesn't seem like he wants to. I would like to see him heal, I'd like to be there for him, I'd like him to feel like someone is in his corner, but its starting to undo the progress I've made. 
 
I'm constantly trying to make myself better mentally for our daughter, but I'm getting to the point where I'm finding it extremely hard to hold on. Like I said, I see ALL the red flags, but I'm scared. If I leave he will probably take his own life. I want our daughter to have a good relationship with a healthy happy daddy.... its not constantly bad. We do have some really good times together, but when he hits his lows its EXTREMELY low. How can I be there without jeopardizing my mental health? Even if we aren't in a relationship I have to be there for him, for our daughter... 

TL:DR- Things are really rocky in my relationship, but we are both finally working on ourselves. His lows are really really low, but despite everything I want SOMEONE to be there for him. I just don't know how to be there without jeopardizing my own mental health, and the mental health of my daughter.",13Sep2020,1

835,"Just wanted to know if other people experience this too or if anyone has a suggestion (already went to a psychologist but she told me I don't fit any pathology and should try to work out each issue individually if they really bother me).
I feel like my emotional processing is screwed in some way. I never had crushes, I don't love my parents or anyone at all (I don't hate either), I don't feel attraction to other people (this makes making out very boring and the other person unsatisfied with my lack of desire), I didn't cry or felt sad when my grandpa died and I liked him, I don't get moved by disasters and sad stories, I don't feel sad for people suffering, but as strange as this sounds, I ABSOLUTELY RANDOMLY, can feel emotive for people surpassing difficulties (like children winning over cancer, or elderly being happy even with the many conditions common in old age). I was like this even before I became an internet addict, which I am not anymore since I barely get more than 3 hours of internet , playing no games and not using social media, so I doubt I has *only* to do with how internet messes with your brain.
Not only this but every day seems isolated. I get to the end of the day and the start of the day seems so far, the day before seems like last year, I feel apathetic all day every day, nothing motivates me (which is why its hard af to study, especially my university course is PBL based so we have to teach ourselves every single thing).
One more extra thing is that I have to be mindful willingly of other people, if not I live like everyone is a character, a NPC, someone that is not a person but just has the appearance and the responses of one; because I can't connect with others properly and automatically, people seem much more plain, with no personality I can feel, although I can describe them by matching actions and tendencies with other people with similar actions and tendencies.

Idk if this post will recieve any responses but I seriously hope it does, I feel lost, so damn lost, like life has no meaning and I'm living it wrong (not because of the lack of meaning but because I don't experience the same as anyone I know).",13Sep2020,0

I find it hard to be myself because even I just find myself off putting. So I'm left just to not be myself and sort of stay quiet.",13Sep2020,1

They asked me to sub monday to wednesday, but i said no unless they pay me time and a half for those hours. I'm currently only listed for 20hrs a week at that place. The secretary told me it went against company policy and that she just wanted a yes or no. I told her no. Was this a bad move? With my last job I let them push me around and ended up getting the shitty end of the stick too often, did I over compensate here?

839,"My little brother is 10 (11 in 2 months) and likes to play Minecraft online. He plays bedwars, but often gets mad whenever he loses or his team doesn't listen to him. When this happen, he usually starts talking to himself about how bad the players are, or screams when he wins. This wasn't a problem at first, but lately it's been getting so loud that I can hear it from downstairs. Even when I closed his door to block some of the sound, I still can hear his desk and chair move whenever he loses.   


Ever since he's gotten a new laptop, he's been addicted to playing Minecraft Bedwars. When lunch is ready to eat, he always tells me or my mom to wait 1 more minute. But in reality, it's often around 10-20 minutes. I've told him many times that it's just a game and it doesn't matter if you lose, but I don't think he's taking me seriously. My mom has threatened to take his laptop away, but she never follows up on it because that's when he automatically comes down to eat. 

When my mom leaves for work, I'm left alone with him. I'm supposed to always remind my brother to take a break every hour, but he always tells me: ""HOLD ON, I'M IN A GAME"" when I remind him. At this point, I don't even bother saying it because he never wants to take a break. Keep in mind that this game is literally Minecraft, which isn't even a competitive game to start.   


Any advice I can use to teach my brother to be more quiet when he's playing and taking breaks? Or is this just normal behavior for people for people who play minecraft bedwars.",13Sep2020,1

843,"I have a friend that about three months ago I started spending more time with (over discord because rona and all). We just kinda started hanging out more out of the blue, but since then we’ve gotten pretty personal with each other.

My problem starts with me starting to take a liking to them. I don’t want to like this person, not because they’re a bad person, just because they like someone else and I know that they don’t see me that way. 

I asked a mutual friend about my situation, and he said that he faced a similar problem and he fixed it by distancing himself from the person he liked. Which, on paper sounds easy enough, and would probably work. But the situation with the person of interest, is that they’ve confided in me that they’re scared of losing friends because they’ve lost a lot over the past year or so. They also told me that they absolutely hate being alone because they start thinking about really dark thoughts. (In their words: the awful things I want to do with my body and having close ones, like family or friends, die. Those kinda thoughts)

So knowing that, I cannot distance myself being the only person that hangs out with them on the daily. Its so bad to the point were I was in a call with them at work (I work night shift so Im able to do that) and I told them its gonna get really busy and I may need to leave call. I then brought up that alternatively, I could stay in call, without offering much conversation because I would be busy, and they agreed in a heartbeat.

As far as relationship goes, we’re both looking for the same thing, but again, they have someone they like. They’ve also had experience with relationships in the past whilst I haven’t.

My options are basically as follows; 
-don’t do anything, and have the feeling naw at me forever 
-tell them about how I feel, and possibly make them rethink our friendship 
-distance myself and feed into their awful thoughts 

They’ve gone through a lot recently, and I’ve been there for them, trying my best to either help or distract, whatever they needed at the time. I went so far as to go to the person they like and tell them to spend time with them (they both wanted to spend time with each other, the person they liked offered to voice chat while the person I like declined, but told me in pm’s that they shouldn’t of declined as it would help them). I just don’t want to add on to the load by telling them how I feel.

If anyone has an idea as to what else I could do, or some rationalization of my current options, that would be helpful.",13Sep2020,1
844,"TL;DR: Skip to ""The question:""

Background Info:

Due to traditional/religious reasons, I have a very strict mom. I've never been to a friend's bday party, never gotten a friend's phone number, no social media, no game chats, no friend requests in games, and other very specific rules. Because I was pretty much sheltered my whole life, I never was exposed to why she did this. This resulted in me starting to make secret emails, play games in secret, chat with friends on weird websites like wattpad, etc. at 10 and it was all behind my mom's back. Now, I understand that I was in the wrong. 10 yos should not be watching horror anime and talk with 27 yos on Maid Cafe game chats, but I was an idiot. Now I'll be turning 13 soon and I'll be legally allowed to do half of that stuff (play games for 12+, watch 12+ anime, and have an email of my own) but my mom doesn't agree. She says I'm pretty much to follow her rules until I turn 18. No moving out until I get and get married kind of policies, if you know what I mean. But I've been thinking a lot about it. Family or friends? Are my friends really that important to me? Is it worth the guilt and risks to keep this up? My paranoia is so bad I have nightmares where I accidentally say my email out loud or my autocorrect shows a username that doesn't line up with me having no social media. It's so bad I woke up once thinking that I lost all technology privileges because of my misbehavior (which is what will happen if I get caught).

What I have done:

I took the first step last month by deleting my instagram and not using my secret email (until now). My instagram was only for the messaging feature and the email for unrestricted youtube mode. So I never was actually doing horrible things like drugs, vape, ""pics"", etc. 

The bad:

I still miss having that freedom to know I can text my bestie good morning. I miss seeing the memes we'd share. It was amazing thinking I could finally have my friends with me even if I move away. I've lost many friends and it was refreshing not being afraid of moving away. Another thing is I have a complicated relationship with my friends now. They don't understand that I'm not so willing to break rules for them as much as I used to. I also feel like I don't really care about them anymore. I've found my passion is writing and studying psychology. I rather read a book than chat with them now. They all are childish an are a bad influence on me (I don't want to get into details on that one...) I rather play Arknights, Azur Lane, and Fate/GO when I'm 13 than in secret and risk getting in trouble. (I should probably not play Azur Lane since I'm a straight girl, but it's a fun time killer.) 

The good:

I feel so much less guilt. I no longer get the nightmares. I don't need to be afraid every single time my mom does a ""check up"" or anything. I've spent more time with my family, I'll be allowed to watch and enjoy watching anime and playing games for 12+ very soon. So the need for my secret email is lowered by that. I also learned that the friends I have are not really that... you know, just not something I'll die without. I'm learning about myself too. I feel like a good girl for the first time in my life. I have almost everything my mom wants now. Religious, polite, patient, honest, and most importantly, integrity.   


The question:

I have 3 options and I need help choosing.

A) Stop breaking these rules once and for all and do as I like when I'm 18.

B) Wait until I'm legally allowed to make my own email and use instagram chat at 13.

C) Screw it, do as I like and risk it for the biscuit.",13Sep2020,2

850,"I am a 22 year old male. Growing up I always struggled talking to women because I was a very insecure kid which led continued throughout high school. I was very overweight and I was really embarrassed to talk to girls because I was afraid of being judged. 

From junior to senior year, I started dieting, started working out and slimmed down a lot and began getting some confidence. In my senior year I found out this girl liked me and we started talking and at first I found it scary but she allowed me to become very comfortable with myself and talking to her came so easily. We started dating in 2016 and dated until last week. Everything in the relationship was amazing until these past 9 months where she switched up on me and it started to feel like I was bothering her for her time. Turns out, She started to see a “friend” often and my gut feeling knew it was more than that. Sure enough I was correct. 

I’m not ready to be in a relationship as I have a lot of work to do on myself. This experience crushed me. One thing I do want to do though, open up. I want to experience talking to a variety of people before I date, and honestly, I want to take a while to be single anyways. But I think to myself, will I still have difficulty talking to women, even to have as friends? Does anyone have advice on how to overcome this fear? I feel my insecurities taking over again.

851,"Okay, here's the situation. I (13f) am friends with a girl over the internet (13f), who btw we show faces, and have shared social media accounts, so I know she's not a creepy old man. I was having a bad day yesterday and the whole gc vents to each other a lot so I sent a snap venting about it (""I hate school, I hate it here, I hate my life, I hate people, I just hate it all.""). So my friend sent me a tiktok with a promo code for a free groovebook custom photobook and a photo of her credit card (which is empty but the promo code made the thing free so that's fine) to cheer me up. I think my other friends in the gc are using it too btw. I saved the photos I wanted from google, downloaded the groovebook app and uploaded the photos. Then I put in the shipping info and everything. After that I added her card information from the photo of the back of the card. It signs you up for a subscription which is one book every month. The promo code made the first month free, hence the first book being free. I'm gonna wait until the book gets here in like 16 days and then cancel my subscription. So these are the two things I need advice on: 1. Can I get in legal trouble for this? Like is this fraud and is it really all that bad? and 2. My mom knows I don't have a card and she'd probably be mad if she knew about this, plus its not even under my name so I'd have to explain it to her which I can't.

853,"There’s this girl I had classes with in middle school. We go to the same high school too but completely different classes. And we know who each other are but don’t talk with one another. Anyways, what sparked my interest in her was when a while back, we followed each other on instagram, and I’d start seeing what she posted. Well, when I’d see them I started realizing how cute she was as I didn’t see her like that back in middle school. To be honest, she’s a girl who really fits what I find attractive in a girls looks. This was last year, 10th grade, so I told my two close friends about it, asking if I should hit her up or not. They said I should if I really did think she was pretty, but my friend said I should wait till Valentine’s day so he does it with a girl too. So about a week later it was Valentine’s day, we were walking home when we asked each girl if they’d be our Valentines through ig. We didn’t expect much, we mainly did it just to see where it went. Later, she texted back, “aww i’m sorry but i can’t 🥺”. I was a bit bummed out but it was whatever. I jokingly responded back, “well maybe next year then” and she responded, “hopefully”. And now recently I’ve been having dreams about her. Just last night I had one where we met up to hang out and we were just having a good time.

854,"tldr; My family buys too much stuff, how do I move out as soon as possible.

Currently 13 in school. 6 years ago my parents got divorced and I live with my mother and my sister (16). It's a two bedroom apartment and I sleep on the couch. Unfortunately almost everyone in my immediate family is essentially hoarder, and we usually go to several thrift stores and yard sales every week.

There's very little empty room in the house, with almost every area filled with clothes or various other useless items. It's become quite embarrassing as I have to do video calls for school. We have all the clothes a person could need and yet more are purchased.

Essentially everything in my life has paused due to covid-19. We live close to my grandma and visit her almost daily, so my mother doesn't want to risk anyone getting the virus. Today, however, my mother and sister decided to go to a garage sale.

855,"This story about my life situation includes a high school scandal about rape, past incidents, and rumors, my difficulty to think before acting and speaking, my difficulty to take things seriously in serious situations, etc.

The realization of my life situation with the conditions and problems with it hit me and hit me hard. This realization came through the form of a scandal, a scandal about me being accused of wanting to rape and pump someone full of cum. The background of this scandal can be found on this Reddit post below that I posted on Saturday two days after the incident which was on a Thursday (3-4/9/20 EST.)

Post generally explaining scandal: https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/imkj4k/everyone_in_my_grade_thinks_i_want_to_rape_someone/

On the day after the incident (Friday), I was harassed multiple times but most wouldn't see me due to me being in the school office for the latter 2/3 of the school day. During this time I was writing an incident report which eventually spanned to be over 9-pages long. This can also be attributed to me to delay and gift me as much time as possible to avoid going into class to face further harassment. By the end of the day, some students were waiting outside for me to confront me but I managed to barely flee and escape through the car park exit. I later confronted one of them on the text and while conversing emotion got the better of him and he proceeded to block me.

Throughout the weekend I remained stressed and anxious about the whole incident which has by now escalated to a scandal. The severity of the scandal impacted me heavily when I was informed by my brother that his whole class which is an entire grade below me informed him of me ""wanting to rape someone"". I talked with a senior student who we've been on good terms since I entered high school advised me on many things. Such as laying low, avoid attention, zero confrontation with others about the scandal, reassurances of peace in the long-run, etc. This curbed my stress and anxiety somewhat but a large part remained in me. However, after implementing his advice into my school life, life got significantly easier with reduced harassment. However, harassment remained.

From the start of the School week on Monday till now things have been relatively the same with an easing of tensions. I have been forced to stay silent in almost every class I attend, I cannot enter many areas of my school due to fear of extreme harassment due to me now taking the initiative entering ""enemy"" turf, etc. I have lost a severe amount of good friendships and acquaintances with only the closest of friends staying by my side and some others. I have been working closely with the school staff on this scandal but it appears that their range of action is limited in a situation like this. After multiple emails and talks with students, they have said that those from the group who confronted me about my wishful rape allegations have no hard feelings towards me and have accepted that some form of misunderstanding may have taken place. Even after saying this, a friend told me that the guy who started the scandal with the “assumed” misread of the message was talking bad behind my back with a couple of his friends. I have thought about taking legal action but after discussions with certain people and advice, I realized that it would go nowhere. I cannot move schools due to financial reasons and my wish to be in one high school my whole high school life. According to many, people are still talking about my scandal and it is still spreading among the grades quickly. I just want to live a normal high school life but with this, it seems impossible. I am aware that high school is just one insignificant part of my life but I would like to have fond memories of my high school times.

This does not fit well at all to my past reputation, incidents, and rumors. Many people even before this have thought of me as a pervert due to rumors about me throwing objects under girls to take a peak up their skirt, rumors about me watching girls change through windows at school camps, and many more of which I don't even know about but only know the existence of through others. This again does not fit well for my reputation of being a loudmouth in a tactless manner. I have said many, many things which I regret and am sure to have hurt many. For example, I have called a girl a man and wrote a song with lyrics about how she is transgender and gave them to her. I did apologize to her about this earlier in the year but according to a certain someone she seems to have forgotten or simply doesn't care/won't take an apology. With my previous rumors, my annoying tactless behavior as a loudmouth I was and still am a generally disliked person to many.

I wished to change this, I only came into realization of my faults and problems late last year and have tried and been going through years worth of social development and learning and developing these social developments in the span of months. The girl in the scandal was assisting me in developing my social skills and development. I still however found it very, very difficult. I don't like pointing fingers and I don't blame anyone but if I had to I would do it on my dad. my parents have been separated for a couple of years now but are currently in the middle of a divorce which has had delays due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.

I can see much of my problematic behavior in my dad and when I told him about it and he responded somewhere along the lines of ""You probably got it from me"". I asked where he got his behavior from and he said his uncles who would joke around too much. I have seen my uncles and it made so much sense to me and how the behavior ran through the generations. My dad's uncle's jokes usually have a somewhat sexual nature to them and this may attribute to my slight ""pervertedness"". I can see my dad as a dimmed version of my uncles' problematic jokey behavior and me as a dimmer version of my dad. I struggle and face difficulty in being serious at the right moments and when in the right moments for jokes I often go too far, sometimes way too far. For example, when a girl who was a friend of mine mentioned she hates the word 'rape'. I proceeded to ask if she got raped herself. I then quickly apologize after realizing what I just said.

I wished and still wish for my social skills, behavior, and development to be fixed and improved. I am an ambivert and my social skills are odd, I often wonder if practicing by socializing more with people can help me with social development and skills. I honestly don't know how to explain my social skills and behavior to most people. But I am well-skilled in first impressions usually filled with charisma and confidence but I usually ruin the new relationship with time through my behavior and actions. I can tell by the way they treat me comparing from the first weeks to recent times. Most don't take me seriously anymore, even with all my flaws and tactlessness in my speaking I deep down have always been or at least wanted to be nice and moral and many see that in me. But a lot of what I do in ""dick"" moves usually ruins that. I can always try staying silent but that usually doesn't work as I love socializing in social situations and I can't help myself but I also love spending time by myself when alone, this often makes me need to push myself when I agreed to go out in normal circumstances. I just wish to be respected again by people, not just from school but by everyone. For this social behavior section, I face these usual scenarios from everywhere even by my family, friends outside of school, etc. I am looked down upon being annoying, weird, a tactless loudmouth, etc. However, I believe I had improved ever since I started initiating development since my realization of my negative social behavior late last year.

In conclusion, I just wish for my life to be normal socially, free from stress and anxiety from these rumors and this scandal. With the additions of respect from the people around me, the development of mature social skills and behavior, the absence of my awkwardness and weirdness, and the reconciliation of those I have had bad blood with in the past, and most importantly for this scandal to end without the need for police, legal actions, and violence as a large portion of the school is learning about it and are also now learning about my past interactions such as when I wrote a song about a girl being a man. What do you, people of Reddit, think about my story? What actions do you suggest I take? Is there anything you would like to tell me? Whether it be advice, learning material, etc? Anyways, thank you for taking your time to read my story, it's kind of long but I hope you can bear with me just knowing people are reading and hearing about my struggle makes me feel like there is light at the end of the tunnel, that I am not alone. Thank you :)",13Sep2020,1
856,"Sorry this is a long one..

I’m sure it’s not just me that gets in these moods where all you feel like is a failure. Like nothing in life has meaning and the feeling  of worthlessness is overwhelming. One minute I’ll be completely fine then all of a sudden something I’m my brain just clicks and boom I’m depressed. As time goes on it gets worse and worse and sometimes it lasts days or weeks..

I am currently, and what makes me feel this way most often is my self worth and self accomplishment. I just recently turned 24 years old (M). To some it may see like “ oh you’re so young!” But to me I feel old like I’m running out of time. 

I say this all because ever since high school I have felt like a failure or an f up. In high school I moved around a lot and had a lot of family problems. I was kicked out multiple times and didn’t ever feel like I belonged anywhere. I did poorly in high school barely passing classes. I honestly don’t even know how I got my diploma. I miraculously only “failed” my senior year and had to take summer school to graduate. Which thankfully was only a month or two after everyone else. As a lot of my “friends” all went off to colleges and trade schools I attempted college. I obviously didn’t have any scholarship opportunities. 
I drove down to my local community college and signed up. I was completely lost in the whole process. I have NO CLUE what I wanted to do! All I knew was I came from a low income family that struggled to get by and I didn’t want to be like my parents. So logically to me I only was interested now high paying jobs after my degree. I was looking at jobs that I felt I could do, but I never though would I be happy doing it. I only looked at the income. Well my first semester came around and college was HARD! I think it was so hard because I didn’t learn ANYTHING in high school. I was dumb quite frankly. I knew I was undereducated compared to most of my peers. I was discouraged but I tried my hardest to get by. 
Unfortunately things happened back at home and life got in the way. I had to drop some of my classes. Second semester rolled around and my home life didn’t get any better. Now I was trying to live on my own while going to school and holding a job. It was hard, especially for someone that had to work twice has hard as his peers because he was lacking basic knowledge. I was bouncing from major to major. I must have changed majors 5 maybe more times. I remember my advisor telling me “just choose something already.” In my second semester I tried to take more classes. I passed a few and dropped a few more. 
Third semester and I dropped classes and felt completely hopeless. I had no clue what I was doing. I was in debt, had no job, no house, I was living in a trailer in the front of my parents house. The neighbors called the cops because it was illegal to live in a trailer out front of a house in my community “odd but okay.” So I didn’t know where to go from here. I started getting into the crown with the wrong people. Drinking, smoking, and doing other bad things. 
I eventually knew I didn’t want to go down this road. I spoke with my parents and I told them I’m joining the military. So I did. My father thought it was a bad idea but my mom was all for it. I must have been 22 at this point and still nothing to show for my life. I must have had $200 to my name. Well basic training went by and then I went into active duty. My first assignment was overseas so I said goodbye to everything I knew and flew to a foreign country to “start a new life” I will say I had fun in the begin with traveling and learning my job. Then as I got my accustomed here people started being very toxic. 

Long story short I don’t hangout with anyone anymore. It’s just myself everyday all day. I thought well some time has gone by. I’m 24 now, maybe I should try and go back to college. I was SO hyped to go back! I had created this goal and was ecstatic to accomplish it! I spoke with an advisor again and told him “I want to study construction management.” I know for a fact this is something I’d enjoy because it’s in the same industry that I have a job for in the military and I enjoy what I do. I thought why not get paid more in something I like and that I’m familiar with. So I signed up for classes. I only signed up for two classes, Economics and College Algebra. The advisor I spoke with said I would be 49% done with my AA if I finished these classes. I was excited even more. I though I could finish these classes and get my degree by the age of 26. Then I get out of the military use my GI bill and go to school full time and get my BA in two year and start a career at 28. 

I was a little upset and felt kinda sh$tty because I’m so old... but I really started feeling like a complete failure and my depression started setting in heavily when I got a month into my classes and realized I took on too much work. Not that the classes are hard per day but I’m dumb. College algebra was the hardest math I’ve taken so far and I couldn’t complete it in the time given. I understood economics well and grasped the class well. But math I spend roughly 30 hours a week studying. Taking tutor sessions. Reviewing the material. Taking practice tests, extra homework, and hours of doing the same problems over and over and over. Yet here I am 30 hours of studying and multiple tutor sessions later and my test 1 came up. I don’t understand what I’m doing still and I take the practice test 4 times. I couldn’t get over 71%.. I call my professor and tell her my struggles. She tells me I might have to drop the class. The cycle continues and I feel worse and worse. 
Since I started college years later now I still have to drop classes because I’m too dumb to complete it. I feel like a failure and a loser. If I drop this class I’m out on academic probation and I don’t think I get accepted for tuition assistance anymore and I have to pay for classes out of pocket. So I’m stuck in this vicious cycle of depression thinking my life is a complete fuck up and I won’t amount to anything..",13Sep2020,1
858,"I keep getting this feeling that I should end my life, for no reason. I'm not sad or anything but just have this urge to just blow my head off with a shot gun. I just don't know why it's happening and don't know what to do about it",13Sep2020,1
859,"Okay so, this is kind of a long story but I don’t know what to do anymore and I really need some advice. Sorry for any mistakes or anything like that, but I have to write this via my phone. 

My little sister is 15 and doesn’t want to go to school anymore. But there’s a bit lore to it than just that. First things first: We're from Germany and the school system is a bit different here. She’s currently attending class 9 at a German Gymnasium so the lessons are more demanding and she has got quite a lot to do and to learn in order to get her Abitur. However there is a possibility for her to leave school after the 10th class and start an apprenticeship. 
But even this possibility doesn’t seem to motivate her to continue as she simply can’t go to school. Even the thought of going makes her want to cry. 

School has been stressing her out since the beginning of the year. She had kind of a breakdown at one of her dancing competitions. She loved and still loves dancing but the rehearsals have been quite stressful for hear and started to cause issues like headaches and constant exhaustion. After she kind of broke down at one of her dancing events she got sick now often and thus missed school more often. 

Then corona came and there haven’t been any kind of lessons. Her teachers only provided her and the other students with tons of material and she was supposed to work through it on her own, which didn’t work out. She basically missed nearly half a school year. Now that she has to attend the lessons at school again she’s getting anxious again and simply doesn’t want to go. I don’t think that she just doesn’t want to because she’s lazy, but there seems to be a more problematic issue. It seems like she has depressive episodes, where she’s just in bed on her phone all day long. She can’t motivate herself to do anything and can get very moody. Her room often looks like a mess. We went to see a doctor last week and she also said, that it seems like she has developed some kind of school phobia and a kind of depression. She has an appointment to see a psychotherapist at the 23rd of September now. That’s good, but she still doesn’t want to go to school and she already has soooo much stuff to catch up and it will become nearly impossible to make up for that if she doesn’t attend school for at least a whole week. 

 My parents don’t really care. They don’t seem to understand that psychological issues are quite a serious matter and that my sister is in serious need for help. I don’t think it’s just 'a phase' and I am so afraid that she will develop a heavy depression. I just want to help her so, so bad. It’s breaking my heart to see her like that. Does anybody have some advice for me? What can I do? What can she do? I would be incredibly thankful for any help or piece of advice.",13Sep2020,2

863,"Hi guys,

I woke up late this morning after being at a party. When I woke up my mum showed me this notification she got on Facebook from a page called ""Security Inbox"". It isn't a Facebook feature, it is a page, sorta like a company Facebook page. Anyway, it had thousands of posts with older people saying they had to give account details or be deactivated. I told her it was spam and likely hackers, I'll report it, delete the notification and you can get on with your day.

Nope - she had already given them the account details. 

This is the third time she's done this - first time was her email, second time was another spam account on Facebook. It always ends the same. She tells me she's done this, I explain calmly that what she did was the equivalent of handing her house keys to a stranger, she starts crying saying it's not her fault and she didn't do anything and that I should fix it. I tell her it is her fault, fix it and tell her not to do it again.

This time though, I have had to change the account details 7 times. All accessed from different parts of the world. From England, to America, to Indonesia, etc. I've reported the issue to Facebook but how far that gets us is debatable, they did Jack shit the last time. 

How can I prevent the continuing access to my mum's account because I am honestly running out of passwords? How can I get it through to my mum the gravity of what's she's done, because she thinks crying wolf and feigning innocence will make it go away? I am moving away in a few days so with the stress of that and now this, I have no idea how long my patience will last.

Please help.",13Sep2020,2

As an alternative, I could buy it in-person at BestBuy tomorrow and be using it ASAP. Doing this however means I won't get airpods.

865,"My best friend recently started dating this new guy. I’ve been with her when she FaceTimed him and so I got a chance to talk to him on the phone and me and him get along pretty great and make jokes with each other all the time.  

Recently I went to her house and spent a week with the both of them. Everything went great but I’ve picked up on certain things that he would do. For example I’ve caught him staring at my butt on more than one occasion. Each time he would look away and pretend he wasn’t. 

He would also playfully pick fights with me. I had just finished eating breakfast and he found best friends spray bottle and kept spraying me with water and so I chased him around the apartment with a cup of water. He also seems to take an interest in my love life. Constantly asking me who I’m talking to, what’s my type and even asking what my body count is etc (Me and best friend have a running joke to him that I’m a virgin (I’m not). He has a feeling I’m lying and constantly tries to find out how many guys I’ve slept with. 

Also we’d all be watching love island together and I was thirsting over the guys and he’d get upset and playfully hit me like he was a jealous bf or something. 

And later that night we were all goofing around and doing face masks and taking pictures and stuff together. Best friend wanted him to post a picture of us together with our masks and he made a comment and said “my friends are gonna think I’m having a threesome tonight”. Best friend was there when he said it and she didn’t address it so I thought it was best not to say anything either. 

During the week we were together her boyfriend had a court date for a speeding ticket and he asked me to come along with him for moral support (best friend had to work so she couldn’t come). 

So we’re all getting dressed. Best friend is getting ready for work and I’m getting dressed to go to court with him. I walk into the bathroom and out of the corner of my eye I see him laid out on the bed with what I think is his dick out. I’m not sure because like I said it was only out the corner of my eye. He’s saying something as if he’s trying to get my attention and I just pretend that I didn’t see anything. For reference her bathroom and bedroom are really close to each other. He can see me going into the bathroom and I can see him in the bedroom.

As were in the car together he made a comment about my “long beautiful legs” and said they were sexy. After he said that he got a phone call so I didn’t get a chance to ask him what he meant by that comment so I kinda just shrugged it off. 

Also in the car he asked me about my ideal guy. I told his muscular but I also don’t like guys that are too big  and he says “so I’m too big then huh” and seemed offended. He plays football and works out a lot and is extremely buff (like HUGE) and I laughed it off and told him “yeah for me anyway but bf likes you so that’s all that matters” so as to not offend. 

Then when we pulled into the parking lot there was an old guy in a truck who kept staring into my car (I drove). I pointed it out to him and he says “he (the old guy) must have never seen a pretty girl (referring to me) before” 

Then the day that I was supposed to leave. Best friend had just left for work and I was packing up my things. Her bf was in the bedroom and so I yelled out for him and asked him if he would help me take my things to my car. I didn’t get a response and assumed he didn’t hear me so I called his name again and he answered “yes baby”. And so I opened the door and we kinda just stared at each other. I was a little taken aback and confused that he would call me that and he kinda just smiled and laughed seeing my face.

At the time I just thought he might have confused me for my best friend but now that I’m thinking about it i think  that might not have been the case because

1. Me and best friend don’t sound anything alike 

2. We said our goodbyes very loudly when she was leaving for work and her apartment is not that big you can hear everything from every room and I’m pretty sure he heard the door shut and her leaving for work 

3.  When he realized it was me he didn’t seem embarrassed just smirked like he knew what he was doing 

I’ve been thinking about whether or not I should bring this up to best friend. The problem is he treats her really well (randomly bring her flowers the whole nine) and I don’t want to mess up a good thing for her. Plus i don’t want her to think I’m jealous and want to break them up purposely. Also I’m not sure if I’m reading too much into things and don’t want to bring it to her attention unless I’m absolutely sure. Am I reading too much into it? What should I do? 

(All parties involved are between the ages of 21-23 if that makes a difference)

Also I’m not really attracted to her boyfriend either and she knows this. She’s asked me before what I think of him (physically) and if I thought he was ugly. She said she wants an honest answer and that she wouldn’t get offended. I told her that personally I didn’t find him attractive but that it doesn’t mean he’s ugly. Also just want to add that I’ve never flirted back with him or even encouraged anything inappropriate because like I said I’m not even attracted to him.",13Sep2020,1
867,So I'm moving into my uni house and am thinking how I am gonna split the bills as one guy has gone earlier on the 5th of September. The other 4 of us are coming on the 18th-20th weekend.

868,"Ok, so, I don't even know how to begin. I'm 20 so am past like 1/4th of life and for over a year I had this feeling of wasted time then the worst thing struck me that I have no one in this wreck I call life I could even speak to about this. I never had any kind of friends, just colleagues, I just went to school/college for these 6-8hrs, came back home, did my chores, and sat in my room till I could fall asleep. The concept of hobby or interest is completely foreign for me, never did any sports or played on instruments, each proposition of exploring my capabilities I refused due to fear of being embarrassed and judged. I never achieved anything, I don't have any memories, all I can remember are the empty walls of my room that only changed colors once or twice. You might ask: how the hell you have 0 memories, you must've had some kind of experiences, well you are correct but 99% of them are from time spent at school or the way back.  Each school trip I stuck close to the teachers, always tried to avoid being photographed, and during that time when everyone else was buying some shitty souvenirs I just sat calmly in the bus or at the bench waiting cos I sweated at the thought of showing interest in something that others wouldn't find interesting and buying it. I'm ashamed and furious at me cos I feel like I've just wasted the only time of my life that I could do anything, explore everything, and become anyone I would like to. I""m never going to have that much free time or have the possibility to be an innocent child and just be myself. Whenever I look at teenagers I just wish that I could revert time. The other thing is that I'm afraid of the life that will come after I graduate, I'm completely unprepared to live on my own, whenever I go to the store I'm sweating cos I think that ppl judge my choice of a fucking mineral water or when am paying I always fear that am looking stupid and furiously squeeze my fists in pockets. The same goes for any normal activity in public like walking or driving a car. When I stop at the lights I always turn off the speakers so no one hears what am listening to. Whenever there is an option to buy something online I'll choose it even if it costs more cos I want to avoid being exposed to judgment. Then I technically don't have family, sister is living with her husband - they are expecting a child + never had any kind of relationship with her, she was the typical teenage rebel, I just saw her when we left for school and at the dinner. Father never had time for me ( was too ""tired"" or ""busy"" ), had many lovers, and has not lived with us ( me and mother ) for over 8 years, at the same time he never apologized or even said he's sorry. Grandparents are dead and mother is like, we live in a status quo, we just share a few words if we have to and that's all. All of it is just so fucking fucked up am just tired of it all, I never had like a specific thought: I'm going to jump from that building or am going to take 12mg of fentanyl and just kill myself cos I don't want to burden others with the feeling that they didn't know or didn't help me or why would I do that, are they a bad ppl, etc but I don't mind if I die in a car crash or smth. I just feel like my existence has no sense, can do nothing about it, no one cares about me but I care enough about others so I don't want to bother them with my life. Idk why should I even bother you, strangers on the internet, with this, there is plenty of ppl that have much harder lives and flourish when I am just being oversensitive and looking for easy attention.",13Sep2020,1

876,"Let me just say this has really put the nail in the coffin of the shittiest month of my life. 

My friend, Lucy (fake name), has recently come out and accused my other friend, James (fake name), of sexual assault. It happened just over 5 years ago, when she was 16 and he was 15.

She never went into detail about what happened, but what I gather is that either through sexual coercion or assault, they had sex. Lucy believes she was pressured into it. They were both drunk at the time and it happened at a party we were all attending.

James can be a little sleazy, I’ve known him since I was 5. Proper ‘womaniser’ and a flirt, even as a kid. Hands down, he can be a douchebag and not see past a girl’s appearance. But after 16 years of knowing him, I also know he is incredibly kind-hearted and has always been a brother to me. I recently described him like Jaskier/Dandelion from the Witcher, where he is just completely in love with every woman he meets and jumps from one to another. Not out of malicious intent, but just out of sheer puppy-dog romance. Never in a million years would I think he would sexually assault someone. 

Lucy, on the other hand, I’ve known since I was 12. She’s historically had a shitty home life, lots of mental health issues, trouble in relationships and is very edgy. Everyone knows she is a drama queen and a compulsive liar, she’s made up some crazy lies in the past. But at the same time, she’s also a flirt and kind-hearted just like James. They’re clones of each other. But, again, despite her issues, I hope she wouldn’t make up a lie about being sexually assaulted. 

I’ve been raped, coerced, and sexually assaulted thanks to a shitty ex-boyfriend. I thought he was a kind, perfect, angelic guy that would never do any wrong. So, my judgment isn’t great. But I know exactly how painful it is and horrible the experience is. I know the guilt, shame, confusion, and all of those other ugly emotions that come with it. I nearly hanged myself because of it. It took me a years to tell people and I still haven’t told my family despite it being nearly 4 years ago now. I can’t imagine being friends with anyone who inflicts that amount of pain on anyone.

I just don’t know what to think or who to believe. I love them both dearly, I’ve known them both for a long time. It would break my heart to have to cut ties with either of them.

I don’t know if I don’t want to believe her, or can’t believe her, and I know it sounds awful but right now I’m struggling to take her side. Really, I just want to bury my head in the sand and pretend it’s not happening.

Regardless, I’ve been supporting her as I know it’s more painful alone. She doesn’t know I’m skeptical. James has no idea he’s even been accused. Nobody else who was at the party or is friends with either of them has any other information.

I’m not sure what advice people will be able to muster, but even if it is just reassurance or sharing a similar experience, I’d really appreciate it. I’m going to go and sleep on it, fingers crossed I wake up and it’s all been some horrible nightmare.",13Sep2020,1

hello this is my first post im a 15 yo girl and i need some help

878,"I forget names so easily. Even with people I have talked to in multiple conversations. It makes me feel terrible. It's like my brain can't relate names to people. However, I remember faces quite detailed. 

This is such an anxiety provoking problem of mines. I get scared about forgetting someone I want to befriend's name and not being able to find out. Like having someone ask who that person I was talking to was, but not being able to answer them. 

I remember in high school someone was so hurt that I forgot their name. I felt terrible. I even have nightmares of forgetting names and feeling like a douche bag. 

I am 20 years old. Forgetting names seems to run in my family. I remember how My mom, dad, and myself all forgot our neighbors names. It was somewhat amusing but also quite an awakening that something about my genetics is probably why I can't remember names.

I even gone as far as frantically writing names of  people I spoke with and then sketching their face. However, this isn't the most effective way as I do not always have pencil and paper with me. Plus, if anyone finds my journal of that they probably think I'm a psychopath planning to get my victims xD.

Well some years back I was homeless been homeless for 5 yrs long story but well I was staying at a homeless shelter which I hated it was infested with beg bugs really bad plus you have to be in by 10 pm or get locked out . Ect well I was coming back I walk inside this old black lady very nice I liked her better then the idiots there . Well she calls me into the office saying I got a note for you . Then she begins to tell me after she gives me a sticky note with a number on it . Telling me my mother called and wanted me to call her . Well she told me to go outside and call her well I did . Well it wasn’t even my mother it was some old black lady you ever seen holes the movie if you have remember the black witch lady how her voice was well it was sorta like that type of voice . Well she answers I’m like who is this ? She wouldn’t tell me . She was like are you alright is everything on ? Well who tf is this now so it started creeping me out she some how knew my name that I was at that shelter . I do not know who and how or why . Well she keeps asking if I’m alright well it creeped me out plus I have paranoia. So I get upset asking and demanding her to tell me who tf she was and ect . Still didn’t tell me so I’m like your not my mother I don’t know who you are don’t call me again then hung up . Well

Like I said it creeped me out to this very day I never knew who she was or how she knew I was there or even knew my name . I started thinking maybe she was like a guardian angel or something because I can’t explain it . She was concern for me but I was an asshole can’t blame me .

883,"So a few weeks ago I got an email from amazon about an order that I never placed. It was for two sets of AirPod pros, to be sent to some random address in Wisconsin (which I unfortunately never wrote down and now I can’t find.) Immediately I checked all my bank accounts, nothing was wrong there and I changed all my passwords. So I was like... okay? I checked the payment method used and it was in the form of a gift card balance, I probably only had 5 cents left on there so immediately I knew it was some sort of scam. My next step was to contact amazon. The guy basically told me to enable 2 step authentication and change my passwords. I was like well yeah thanks. He also cancelled the order so the package never got sent out, and told me the money would go back to my account. I asked what I should do with it and he was like well hopefully someone somewhere contacts them about it but at the moment there was nothing else to do. So my dilemma now is that I have a balance of $500 worth of gift cards on my account. I’ve tried seeing where it came from but I can’t find any information. I feel like a criminal lol and I’ve considered spending the money, as bad as that is but I’m just wondering what I should do? I tried to contact support with the same question and they said they would get back to me but I haven’t heard anything. I’d also like to mention that my account is a student account, so it’s not my personal email and I don’t use that email for anything else. I’m thinking it could be from a virus on my computer or something but if that was the case why not just take money from my bank or credit card account?

A is now coming at me and spreading more rumors about me and T and i can’t take it anymore. the year prior, another person (who i still don’t know) was spreading rumors that i was a slut and did all this stuff with guys from my old school (all false) and my “friends” never told me who it was or offered to defend me. i am so fucking done with the bullshit. i’m probably just being selfish but i rly wish my friends would maybe help me more? i know this is childish and stupid but i feel really hurt that everyone hates me and yea my 4 months of no self harm ended today bc i can’t take it anymore.

886,"So I am a guy and I have always considered my self straight and will continue to do so. I do have anxiety and I overthink and have irrational thoughts so having a crisis on my identity is a big enough issue already but my mind makes it worse. I am still young (16) and am a virgin. I like women and their feminine qualities. I have never second guessed my sexuality. But someone that I knew a while back turned out to be gay. Dude was as straight as a line and it came as a shock. I started to think, what if that happens to me? I think I have this weird fear of being gay. I have nothing against the LGBT community but I think when it comes to my sexuality I fear being gay. It's weird I know. I guess due to societal standards and the need to label yourself. Judgmental society and their merciless standards. Crazy to think what life was like 50-100 years ago when society wasn't very progressive, if at all. Back to the point. I like women, when I am horny and watch porn I get real turned on by women and always have been. Being absolutely, absolutely honest with myself, trying to not be in denial at all, and I can't stress this enough, the thought of same sex has crossed my mind, I guess just due to me questioning myself and the fact that I am a virgin and have never had sex. It crosses my mind out of curiosity of the unknown but I don't want to ever do that. Does that make me gay? Before I questioned my self, I could admit a good looking guy was, well good looking, without having any sexual thoughts. When I am just not overthinking it at all, and I just let my thoughts and feelings do as they please, I know that I am straight. I get turned on by girls and have weird tingling feelings that I can't describe when I see some beautiful girl. Or at least I think I felt like this before I started to question myself. Doesn't happen for guys. I can admit they are good looking but nothing more. I guess recently I just have been doubting my judgement on my sexuality, due to me questioning myself, and the questions usually start with a ""what if?"" Like what if I am gay"" What if I become gay? etc.... And recently I guess I try to prove to myself that I am not gay which I know I am not and go on instagram and look at a bunch of hot chicks but I don't know what I feel any more, I don't know if I am overthinking it and trying to use my mind and not my heart or what. I don't know what I am supposed to feel. Like what does being straight feel like? I thought I knew it but what if I didn't. I look at these hot chicks and forget what I used to think. **Like am I supposed to be horny when I see them? Am I supposed to get a certain feeling in my heart when I look at girls???** I am confused and doubting myself and my judgement. I wish I didn't ever question my sexuality, just because it was simple and I didn't have this self doubt sticking out like a sore thumb whenever I look at girls. I used to just look at them and admire them and think damn, she's hot asf or wish I could sleep with her etc... But now every time I look at a girl the self doubt creeps into my judgment and clouds it. **What do I do??? I know it's not good to label yourself but is there anyway I can truly become confident in what I feel? And how do I get this self doubt out of my head and go back to the way it used to be?**",13Sep2020,1

893,"I’ll try to keep it short. For context my brother is a teenager. My brother has had Reddit for awhile now and I have always known of his account. I have always checked his profile to see what he was up to, see what subreddits he posted/commented on and talk about it with him, in a friendly way (for instance: “hey is subreddit x any good?? I noticed you posted on there”) Before it was him mostly commenting on gaming subreddits, stuff like that. Nothing bad or personal. 

However recently (let’s say a week) he’s been posting comments on new subreddits (nothing harmful, stuff like r/teenagers, teensmeetteens etc) but it’s personal stuff. He’s mentioned some of his high school experiences, and made comments that I know he wouldn’t want me to see. Again, it’s not *bad stuff* it’s just personal. I feel like I’m intruding his privacy by going through his account, and I should give him some space.

Recently, my parents and sister have been getting on my ass about it. We're stuck in quarantine and they're just constantly telling me to be quieter. Which is totally understandable. But naturally I'm embarrassed about it and I feel bad about being loud, which they take as me being pissed off about them telling me. Which isn't the case at all. 

Every time I look up solutions/why I talk so loud, the internet tells me I may have a hearing problem (I don't) and to listen more. Which is great and I always try to listen and pay attention to a conversation. But this doesn't necessarily help me stop being loud. Can I get some solutions/methods to help me break this 'habit'?

For the record he gave me a bunch of tools that definitely made up for the damage, cash was not an option so I took what I could and did well.

My regret is that I barely watch tv. I've been dealing with some personal issues and trying to get out and about more and just fill my time as productively and socially as I can.

903,"So I have worked with my then coworker, now boss for 2 years. She's a lovely person, very religious, and is getting married in October. 

Last year before COVID she gave myself and another close coworker verbal invitations to the wedding. We were both excited to go and be with her on her big day. 

COVID kind of threw a big question mark over the day, however, and over many heated months, they have finally confirmed that they will have the wedding with 30 guests. Myself and coworker amongst them along with our spouses.

Ever since the lockdown, I have been very afraid for my husband, who is a teacher. He's scheduled to start working full time again tomorrow in classrooms. (I want to be clear, if he had decided to simply stop working we would not be able to afford the flat we're in. Quitting was not an option)

He's already taught summer school to a few students online and to 3 in-person which had to be cancelled after a student caught COVID. He also taught a few kids privately and had one kid come to him on Friday saying he had COVID whilst he was teaching him but hadn't said anything ""because he'd already paid for the sessions to retake his exams."" 

So after fuming over this kid's money-hungry parents we both went to get tested yesterday (50€ per person) and we're both still negative. 

A little before all this unfurled, my boss texted me to confirm if I would be going to the wedding.

I love my boss but I am worried that if I confirm I'm going to risk everyone at the wedding health if my husband does get sick and we don't know. We can't shell out 50€ every day for both of us. I'm lucky, I get to work from home, but he doesn't. 

This is a bit of a sprawling mess of an advice post I know. 

Tomorrow I have a meeting with my boss. It's to do with monthly audit stuff but we usually shoot the shit and I know the wedding thing is going to come up. Do I tell her my fears? I've read so many stories about marriages and funerals this year being a godamn Chernobyl for this fucking virus.",13Sep2020,1

She is dead set on breaking up before college and staying friends, but I really don't want that. Of course, if she really wants to I'll agree and try to stay close with her. Here's the thing. Should we just break up now? I really don't want to go into my senior year just broken up, with a lot of my friends (a lot of them are 1 year older) and biggest support system (my girlfriend) gone. I feel like if we broke up now, we would have time to give each other space then come back to each other as friends later in the year. It would give me time getting used to being single, instead of wallowing my senior year.

One side of me is nagging on this, but another side of me has a feeling we may try to date during her first semester of college. I just don't want to end it badly and I don't know if we can do distance.

Another part of me just wants to enjoy this year and make really awesome memories with her, then break it off cleanly. I know I'm going to be really upset if we do break up, so I don't want to have this incredible year then make it harder on myself. What's your two cents?",13Sep2020,2

And now I am wondering what I should do about this. I could 1. Report this and request refund from Airbnb, or 2. Sweep this under a rug. I see advantages from both. 

Reporting this guy would protect other people from the same thing happening to them; the downside is that he may hold grudge on me and may try to retaliate in the future (he knows my school, my number and my name. I think this is a genuine risk).

Not reporting would leave me with an ace in the hole in case he want to take revenge on me, since in that case I have something I can negotiate with, namely that I could report to Airbnb and make him lose a source of income.

929,"Hi Reddit.

I really don't know where else to turn right now. I'm gonna do the best I can to explain the situation.

My friend, who we'll call Nick (17 M) and I (21 M) met in college last year and very, very quickly became very good friends. It didn't take long until I realised his girlfriend was very controlling and manipulative.

A few examples:

Once lock down ended (here in the UK), Nick asked me if we could meet up as we haven't seen each other in months (of course following social distancing, etc). I asked him to travel down to where I live (about a two hour bus ride to my house from his, including waiting for buses and walking for a while) and he said his girlfriend wouldn't let him travel that far.

Nick, myself &amp; our other friend drove to McDonald's in our free period the other day, since we're back at college now. I recorded a quick video of us all and put it on my Snapchat story. His girlfriend saw it and proceeds to ring him and force him to stay on the phone for the entire time until we get back to college.

The final example is when Nick met my girlfriend (who I've been with for two years) they added each other on Snapchat, as you do when you meet a new friend. A few weeks later he told me he had to delete her because his girlfriend ""didn't like it"".

It may not seem like much but it's slowly ruining our friendship. He's just messaged me and told me he's deleting all of his social media to ""focus on college"" which I know is BS considering him &amp; I have the best grades in our entire course and finish assignments and papers within a week at best. He doesn't need to focus, we both find the work extremely easy. (Sorry if that came off as vein. I just really needed to make that point).

I genuinely don't know what to do. I've spoken to him about this in the past and he just gets annoyed and tells me she isn't controlling and she has reasons to be ""paranoid"".

One day I met him and our other friend and had a few beers and he told me his girlfriend would break up with him if she found out. I said ""that's rediculous"" and he said ""wouldn't *name of my girlfriend* be mad at you?"" and I told him ""considering drinking alcohol is a perfectly normal thing to do, no."" he then asks me what I'd do if she started controlling me and I told him ""I'd end the relationship. I've been in  a controlling relationship and it was hell. I wouldn't do it again no mater how much I love *my girlfriends name*""

Anyway, I'm seeing him tomorrow at college and I really don't know what to do or even say. I'm a little annoyed at him, considering he's lied to me about why he's deleting social media and the fact he won't listen to me when I try to talk to him about this. However he is my best friend and I personally understand controlling relationships are difficult, especially when you love the girl. I just really don't know what to do or where else to turn.

Yesterday he came home upset. His school has signs up that say “black lives matter”. They have that for every single race except white. They even have a “women’s lives matter”. 

He asked his teacher why there was no sign for white peoples lives mattering. She told him that it’s because white people are racist. She also said that every non white person has been treated unfairly and should be given advantages that white people cannot have. 

Now I am a realist. I am going to assume that my son misinterpreted what she was saying, at least until I have a chance to meet with her next week and ask her about it directly. 

Is it okay that our schools are pushing these complex topics on children? 

Also, what should I be telling him? We have always taught tolerance and inclusion, but how do I explain him being excluded in his own school? How do I explain people telling him that he had advantages that his non white classmates didn’t when it’s simply untrue?",13Sep2020,1
947,"For the past 10+ years, my social life and self-esteem have gone in cycles. I got bullied a lot in middle school and it kind of messed up how I saw myself + caused a lot of anxiety - to the point where I started deciding that other people saw me as a weirdo from the start, and it’s never quite left me (even as countless people have proved that to not be true). When I went to college, it took me 2+ years to finally break out and become the sociable, friendly person I always wanted to be, but after that, I was the happiest I’d been in a long time. 

Now, I’m 3 years out of college, and since graduation, I’ve gone back into a cycle. I’ll make friends, we’ll hang out all the time, then something awkward happens or slows down and suddenly, it’s been months since I’ve seen - or in some cases, even talked - to anyone outside of family. Then we’ll finally reconnect, hang out, then silence from either side, and it all starts over again. 

I’m in a cycle again right now, and it feels like the last straw. I’m tired of it. I’m tired of being this way and want to get better, but worried I’m too comfortable being solo to do it. Has anyone else ever felt like this and if so, how did you get out of it?

949,"So this is going to sound a bit weird. But something happened yesterday and I’m not sure if I should be worried or if it was nothing. I 26 [F] live alone in a small town and on a quiet one way street. The house I live in is owned by the company I work for and I think they’ve had it for at least 5-10 years. So, to the story. Last night I was sound asleep when I suddenly woke up to a lot of banging noises. First I freaked out because I thought someone was inside my house. I honestly don’t know how I dared to get out of bed,  but I exited my bedroom (while keeping all the lights off) to investigate the sounds. That’s when I heard that the knocking were coming from my front door. The knocks were loud and fast paced, like open hand type of knocks. I have no idea how long they were knocking before I woke up,  but I think it went on for maybe 2-3 minutes after I woke up. After the knocking stopped I could hear footsteps going around the house into my backyard. I have large windows from my living room into my backyard and could see two young men, maybe 22, walk past the windows. Since they just walked past I first thought they had just knocked on the wrong house and were leaving, but then one of them turned around and started looking inside my living room window. I know he couldn’t see me standing there because it was very dark inside and I was still quite far from him. The two men then went back to the front door without knocking this time, and eventually left. That is all that happened. So yeh, my question is if I should be worried about this thing that happened or is it likely that there is an innocent explanation like they mistook the house for someone else’s? Ps I called the police and they obviously can’t do anything, but said they would log it. Edit: just want to add that I would really like to know what you think their behaviour could have meant. If it was all a misunderstanding and they were simply at the wrong house or if they maybe had something worse in mind? Something like this has never happened to me before and I just don’t know what to make of it.",13Sep2020,5

956,"I'm a 21 year old living in Australia. I finished high school in 2016, worked worked in retail part time through school, and full time straight after graduating. I moved to a new city almost 2 years ago, getting into a well paying government job about a year into the move.
I hate this job. I hate the culture of public servants here, I hate the people I'm surrounded by, and quite honestly couldn't care less about the work (the person I work directly to being the exception, they are wonderful but don't balance out everyone else around me). I applied on a whim and somehow just ended up here. I am aware of how incredibly fortunate I am to have such a stable well paying job in a COVID world, but it's seriously at a cost to my mental health - waking up every morning is actually painful, and I come home every day angry, irritable, or upset. 
I also hate living in this city- my friends all live in another city on the coast, that I absolutely love (I wish I just moved there to begin with). It's miserable here, there's nothing to do, and the few friends I've made here honestly aren't great for my mental health either (they stuff they do when they hang out just honestly isnt the sort of stuff I want to be doing with my life, they're lovely but unhealthy for me).
I live with my partner here and they hate it here too, and is sticking around in this city just for me - they can move with his job (I am so grateful for them for sticking around and feel so guilty they're still here)  
Why am I still here in this city, in this job? I'm a 21 year old with no actual qualifications or experience outside of retail and my current job. I have no idea what I want to do with my life otherwise and leaving will probably mean going back into retail in an incredibly unpredictable environment. Moving cities would almost definitely improve my mental state, but would likely come at a great cost to my financial situation. My current job provides opportunities to move around in the department, which might improve things, but honestly I just don't enjoy the culture or working in an office, and the city I'm currently in is really the only place I can have this job. 
I dont know what is the right thing to do. It feels immature and ungrateful to leave such a good job, but I feel like I need to start doing things right by myself. I have no idea what I would do for work otherwise however. Studying is an option but again, in a current COVID environment that feels like an unwise decision.

969,"My [22f] now ex boyfriend [23m] broke up with me completely out of the blue over FaceTime last week (just two days before my birthday and virtual university graduation, what great timing).  We would have been together 4 years next month, I did not see it coming and had absolutely no idea he wasn’t happy, he didn’t say or do anything to even hint that he was unhappy beforehand.  

Before the call/during the call he never said he wanted to talk about something important or that he had something particular to say, I thought it would be a normal FaceTime chat as I had no reason to assume otherwise (we have both been living at home, about 3 hours away from each other, since March and mainly talked through messaging but FT’ed around twice a month).  He blurted it out, he started a normal sentence and ended it saying “I’ve decided to break up with you”.  I was just in shock I think, I honestly don’t even clearly remember anything he said after that, but he did not give me any kind of clear explanation and he acted really cold and unemotional on the call.  
We had never had any problems or issues in our relationship, of course we disagreed about things from time to time but we had never even had a ‘proper’ argument or anything, we have always got along well and we had a great relationship.  Or so I thought anyway. 

In July he mentioned two things that he felt made him question our relationship’s long term viability, we talked through them and agreed we could work together through some things.  We discussed those things at least three times since he brought them up and each time he reassured me that they were not big concerns for him now, that they weren’t a big deal for him and basically said that they were just idle thoughts he had about our long, long term future, not about our current short-medium term future.  Because of this I assumed the matter was closed and didn’t think anything of it.  He visited me two weeks ago and we got on really well and everything felt really good between us, that was the last time we discussed that topic and he reassured me things were good and I believed him.  Now after what’s happened I can only assume he straight up lied and in fact those issues were actually big, immediate problems for him and he probably had been just testing the waters back then to see how I’d react to it.  

This was the first relationship for both of us, neither of us had ever dated anyone before we met.  So I’ve never been through any kind of breakup before. 

As you can probably imagine, this week has been really hard.  I just don’t understand what happened.  If he was unhappy and wanted to move on, I can accept that, but the way he broke up with me was so harsh and heartless.  

I wish he would have just said something and let me down a little more slowly, instead of just pulling the rug from under me so brutally.  I just wish he had given me the chance to listen to his side and to hear what I would say.  I cannot understand why he didn’t say anything, why he didn’t tell me how he was feeling, why he just made such a big decision and really thought that was the best way to go about telling me.  I feel like I didn’t actually know him, I truly did not think he would/could ever treat anyone like this.  I have spoken to him via text twice since then and from what he’s said (despite his insistence that he did think of me) it’s clear that he made the decision thinking only about himself and didn’t actually consider how it would affect me.
I’m honestly devastated.  I’m so confused and hurt and lost and emotional and I don’t even know anymore.  I cannot believe that after such a lovely relationship he would just kick me out of his life in two seconds flat like I’m something he’s just gotten bored of having around the place.  He was a big part of my life so it’s been hard adjusting to the sudden loss of his presence in my life.

I have a small circle of good friends and my family have been so supportive but I don’t have a huge support system.  I obviously have deleted his number, removed him from social media, gotten rid of gifts and cards he’s given me and I will not be contacting him again.

I’m not working atm.  I’ve been trying to keep busy by looking for a job, reading, going for walks, talking to and meeting up with friends, studying, helping out around the house, watching YouTube and Netflix, playing with makeup, doing things on my birthday/graduation etc.

How do I move on?  Do I just have to wait for time to heal things?  How I can come to accept that I’ll probably never know his true reasoning for this?  What can I do for myself?  
I have been writing out my thoughts and feelings everyday, and kinda looking into journaling - can anyone recommend websites or YouTube videos or anything that would help me start that?  Any good book or Netflix recommendations?

I recently scheduled a 3 month long trip with young Americans for liberty, I ended up having too cancel today. Came home from a five day trip too baby sit my aunt's house. A swarm of flies had magically appeared in my kitchen, the living room had dog shit all over the floor, laundry room had a pile of my mom's laundry that was taller than me, all of the dishes are just fucking gone, and my mom had been eating fucking crescent rolls for 4 days. When asked, the two living cumstains gave a myriad of excuses. ""I was busy"", ""I thought you'd take care of it"", "" I wasn't asked too."". 

My mom has asked and begged for months for the two of them too be better. They've just ignored her. 

And here's the kicker, if I take a single day too relax or focus on my room I'm "" a freeloading slacker"". Even though I'm the single person keeping the house from looking terrible.

So yeah, this my life, a constant cycle of being relied on and not being good enough. This has sent me into a whirlwind of depression and repressed anger.",13Sep2020,2
974,"I work at a family owned greenhouse (4 years) and quite a few of our customers are older people, so in the store building, a COVID mask rule is enforced. If you can't wear a mask (or won't...), you can call in and pay, or have an employee do the transaction for you while you wait outside (where you don't *have* to wear a mask). Accommodating, no? We ask all customers inside to wear their masks, and to wear them *completely**, over their mouth and nose*. 

Today, an older couple walked in not wearing masks, so I politely asked them to put on a mask, and to wear it completely. Chaos ensued when she claimed it would make her have an asthma attack, and I told her we could do the transaction over the phone and contactless... (they wanted a delivery, so they honestly didn't even need to come in.) Long story short, they started yelling about the governor, mask mandates, and ultimately they called me a ""f\*\*\*ing N\*zi"" and caused a scene. I called to the Owner of the store to the front for support, and he basically defended the customer, and left me to work with them... 

Afterwards, in the day, my boss, the Owner came up and told me that I should have not caused such a scene with those customers. This really shook me and I left my shift almost in complete tears. Over the last 4 years, I've struggled with this family owned company, and not feeling supported by the owners and managers, and this *really* hit me today. 

There is supposed to be a big staff party in two days and I was planning on going, and put together an outfit, but now (just like times in the past) I don't feel supported by my boss... to me he not only let a customer call me a n\*zi, but he allowed it un-reprimanded... it really hurt me.

So I guess the big question is, should I still go to this work party?

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR ::  My boss let customer call me a n\*zi, then walked away. I don't feel supported by him. Should I still go to the staff party?",13Sep2020,2
975,"Pretty as soon as I graduated from H.S. at 18 I moved out of my childhood home and have been taking care of myself ever since. My childhood was bleh... my dad raised me (with my twin brother and older sister) and he was a hoarder and introvert. As such, I learned to not make friends with neighbors or invite people over since my dad was very much against anyone seeing the awful state of our house. So, when I moved out I wasn’t sure how to create friendships with the people that lived around me. 

Now I’m 30, married, raising my a 2 year old son, and we’re moving to a new apartment at the end of the month. I’d like to break the cycle I’ve had of keeping entirely to myself and being anxious about befriending my neighbors. My husband isn’t a lot of help because he’s pretty introverted and doesn’t mind it if we don’t know or interact with our neighbors. I’ve always been an extrovert but this one particular thing is a bit scary to me. I’d love to make friends with people in the new complex when we move in but I feel unsure about how to go about it. I know it may seem like a dumb question... maybe I just need validation that offering cookies or dropping off a simple gift would be a good idea? One stupid obstacle I have is that I have SEVERE resting bitch face (my face is very angular and my eyebrows make me look like I’m always severely pissed off or on a mission). Many people have told me I look intimidating and thought I’d be a huge bitch but after they get to know me they find out I’m pretty chill. As a woman it’s not the worst thing in the world to have a cold, “don’t even try to talk to me or I might kill you” kind of demeanor (I’ve scared off plenty of creeps throughout the years..) but when it comes to making friends the major RBF doesn’t help lmao

What do you think, Reddit? If you saw a new family moving into your apartment complex what are some good ways for them to interact with/befriend you?",13Sep2020,1
977,"I was cleaning my toilet, somehow my dumbass thought it would be a great idea to mix bleach and ammonia based cleaners. I put the bleach shit in, then the ammonia, and then remembered what a ridiculous idea that was. Put my shirt over my face, flushed the toilet, opened the windows, turned on the fan and closed the door. Should I do anything else? How long until I can go back in there?",13Sep2020,2
978,"I've been digitizing home videos, and there is a clip from when my mother was pregnant with me, and smoke can be seen floating in front of the camera. 

There is a grill nearby i think, but i feel like this looks like cigarette smoke. 

Should I confront her?

Not sure it matters but im a 28 year old man.",13Sep2020,1
