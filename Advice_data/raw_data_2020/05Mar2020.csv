0,"We met 8 years ago in an online game in which we gotten really close for around 2 years. We stopped talking after. Started talking again around 6 months ago in which we are closer than ever now. We can’t really go on dates or meet as it’s a long distance friendship, we might meet in 6 months from now though. I have feelings for them, and it feels bad not confessing about them knowing most people don’t accept online relationships. I myself know online relationships don’t last, but I may have hope in this one at least i can confess my feelings. Should I go ahead and tell them about what I feel or it would just ruin the friendship? If anyone been in my situation you may tell me what’s your experience with it.",05Mar2020,1
1,"I'm a white guy and for literally my entire life, I have had a strong preference for Asian girls. Even as a little kid, all of my crushes were on Asian girls. I've never even dated or had sex with a non-Asian girl before.

Is this wrong? It makes me feel a bit racist.  I don't have anything against women who aren't Asian and I have a lot of female friends who are not Asian. I'm just sexually attracted to Asian girls 99% of the time. There have been a few exceptions, but even those girls had some Asian looking features.",05Mar2020,1
2," **Would love an outside opinion on this situation! Thanks for reading.** 

My husband and I moved to Dallas, TX from Ohio in September ‘19. We moved because his mom needed us near by as she was frail and needed help. She ended up dying unexpectedly the day we closed on our new house in Dallas. Plain and simple- I do not like living in Texas. The crime and violence is honestly shocking to me. The schools are bad. And most importantly, we are completely isolated here. We do not have any family and only 1 or 2 not close friends here. My husband and I want to start a family this year, but it would be hard for me to raise a baby completely on my own with no family or friends to share in our joy. We are planning to move back to Ohio. My entire family is in Ohio and we have so many great friends there. My brother has 4 kids and I want to be around to be an aunt. My husband doesn’t like it in Ohio because the taxes are higher (so he makes about $10k less) and the climate is cold but he’s willing to tough it out for me.   

  

Moving would financially cripple us for at least a year or two. The problem is that if we move we have to move now. My husband is a government employee with a position that only allows transfers during extreme personal hardships. We have a window we can back out now and move back to Ohio before he finishes training here. Once he finishes training we’re stuck here for at least 5+ years. So we either move in the next two months and go into a lot of debt or we’re stuck. We will lose money on the house and moving across the country is not cheap even if we sell a lot of things. And things like getting out of contracts here, registering the cars again, etc. We took out a loan for a downpayment on this house wee still paying on as well. We would have to live with my parents in Ohio until our house sold. The other huge thing is we would have to cancel our dream honeymoon in May. We were going to spend two weeks in Europe which just isn’t doable if we move. Are we being stupid moving back to Ohio? I believe being happy is more important than money. But we’re a young couple, 26 and 33. We just got married. We make $200k+ a year combined. Do we make this decision to set our lives back and leave? We would have to rent for a while and not own and watch spending. Or do we tough it out and live a great life but alone and unhappy in Texas? What would you do? It just feels like a rash decision since we have to make this choice so quickly. But I know it’s not. We’re both confused. Going into debt over this just sucks.",05Mar2020,1
3,"So I started a new job that requires me to wear a tie everyday and I feel super uncomfortable. I’ve always been a super casual dresser so now having to tuck my shirt in and wear a tie everyday is a big change. I feel like it’s always tight, so I loosen it, but then it looks unneat so I tighten it again. 

I love where I work except for the dress code,  but I can’t imagine going through this five days a week for however many years.

Any ideas?",05Mar2020,1

I like management, i would want to do either project management or some sort of business management. I have saved about 60k. No idea where to invest. Im at a point in life where i am extremely lost. I hate my school and program it made me not want to be an engineer. I am asking for advice from people for what they would do in my situation. I have a girlfriend and am in a serious relationship. We are going to be living together soon. I want a good career path to provide for my future family. I work very hard and have been working very hard.

8,Hi I'm a uni student (21F) and I was studying my dream course Bachelors of secondary education. But once I started uni I found it very difficult to cope especially because of the different standards and modes of teaching compared to high school. I was too anxious to ask for help and I lost all motivation. I started skipping classes and not doing any assignments. Also halfway through the year I got really sick. I was in and out of hospital for a month with kidney problems. Add that on top and I basically lost my will to live. I screwed up real bad. I let this go on for 2 years to a point where I at the point of being expelled. About  a month ago I finally told my parents and they were obvs disappointed and mad. I also started to look for other pathways and courses. And today I just received an offer for another course in education. This pathway will take me longer to reach my dream career. How do I keep myself motivated so I don't screw up again.,05Mar2020,1
9,"So I met this girl on reddit and we have been sexting for a couple of months through snap. I've been clear to her that I don't want a relationship through snapchat and that I'm not giving up sex in real life. Note that the whole time she's been possessive and kinda entitled. Past week she'd been annoyed that I 'ignore' her multiple snaps a day and asks me if I've seen other people, and I'm like yeah. Then she goes completely bonkers and threatens to leak my nudes (with face) on Twitter stating the country I live in, first name and snapchat username and email. She's acting exactly like the psycho she sounds like, denying that she's blackmailing me, getting angry over me mentioning that what she's doing is illegal and saying that I deserve this for 'breaking her beart' and ignoring her. She is basically threatening to leak her library and the info I stated through Twitter. Also she mentioned she would maybe share it to some people for them to expose them, which sounds even scarier to me.

I'm wondering how worried I should be about people I know personally to be exposed to this content and what I should do.",05Mar2020,1

12,"Hi. I'll be attending college in a few months and I'm really not sure what to do. My name is infuriatingly common, and growing up I have always hated it and hated having to be known as [Name] A. as opposed to people just knowing ME. It also got to the point where someone would say my name, and I'd turn around but they weren't talking to me (awkward). Needless to say, I stopped turning around.

I've chosen a name I like: Morgan. However, I'm not exactly sure how common it is. In my college directory (my class hasn't been added) there are only two (one will graduate before I enter). Not only am I worried about sharing it overwhelmingly again, I'm also worried it will feel like I'm a con artist. It feels like I'll be lying to potential new friends. Not to mention, I'm known to the staff as my given name, so I'm worried they'll ask questions. 

What should I go by at functions? What do I do if my dad is with me? Is Morgan even right for me? How do I make it feel real? It doesn't really go with my surname but I don't want to ""betray"" my family...",05Mar2020,1
13,"So when I first got with my boyfriend he had everything going for him, he was in his second year of uni and had a part time job. However after failing a few of his exams he got withdrawn from his course within the first few months of our relationship. I supported tirelessly with trying to help him find ways he could get back into uni somehow doing all the emails, phone calls, attending meetings etc. To no joy. So there was a good 5 months where he wasn’t working. I’m in uni myself doing a masters in social work and worked part time at a pub. He was literally doing nothing all day. A few months on he did get a job in a Matalan warehouse for a few months but it was only a contract which ran out over Christmas this year. It’s now March and he still hasn’t found a job. I’m on my second social work placement working Monday-Friday 9-5 with no pay and then I work of a Saturday for a small wage for myself. It’s angering me that I’m working so hard while he’s not even trying to make an effort to find a job. He has reapplied for uni but doesn’t find out until May and I can’t even see him having a job until then. If this was me I would definitely have a job by now, where there’s a will there’s a way and it’s quite clear he’s got no will. Another frustrating thing is it’s like he’s not acknowledging my frustration or where I’m coming from? He may be depressed which I get but I feel like he needs to grow up and start being an adult. We’re 22 years of age and I’m soon to be a qualified social worker and I’m worried that he’s just going to carry on living like this because I’ll have a fairly good wage coming in. I love him a lot but I feel like he’s just got no ambition or drive at the minute and I’m literally having to apply for jobs for him and I feel like I’m baby sitting him. I don’t know I just needed to rant.",05Mar2020,1
14,"So my friend and I are taking an intro philosophy course and we were accused of plagiarism. The professor said that our papers looked very similar to each other, and our writing styles are similar. We take notes on what he says in class, and we have shared these notes with each other. The paper was basically just taking what he says in class, compressing it, and putting it into our own words. I shared my outline for my essay with my friend, so we did have almost identical structure as far as paragraph number and the topics in each paragraph. We didn’t copy each other’s papers, but we did have access to them. 

We were confronted today separately and both said that we had access to each other’s notes, but not each other’s papers (which is false but we both said the same thing). We also told him we discussed what information we would include in the essays so he knows that we had the same ideas for the paragraphs, and he had no problem with that. He said he needed to think it over and decide what to do about it. Can we get in serious trouble for this? Has anyone been in a similar situation? I know the risks for plagiarism is expulsion, but does this situation seriously constitute plagiarism when we actually didn’t copy each other’s work?",05Mar2020,1

When I look around me I see that everyone is motivated in one way or another.
   When it comes to me , the mere thought of having the ability to reach a certain goal or finish a certain task makes me procracinate.
   I don't remember ever being motivated to do anything that I did, and the stuff the I was obligated to do I did them at the last moment so that I can move on the the next step of life. Which makes the rest of my days really boring.
   I feel like I have all I need to attain/achieve anything, but my lack of motivation is pulling me and I've succumbed to it lately in the form smoking.

The walls are pretty much just plywood, but I noticed it looked like some water seeped in multiple places, and made some water stains down the wall. Not necessarily mold though, but I notice in another spot there is another leak, and like a 10×10 spot of white mold. Also, he says he always has a fan going in his attic because it gets very damp in there, so I wouldne surprised if there was some mold in there as well. So, he doesnt seem to be worried, but he has 3 cats, and I know mold isnt healthy to breath in. I'm essentially just worried about the cats. They all look very healthy, and he seems to take good care of them. Would it be wrong of me to not bother him more about fixing the leaks, and stuff, or would I look like an asshole.

29,"Hey guys so basically, me and my lifelong friend(we are 16 years old) and I got in a pretty big fight.




Basically we were both in this friend group from 8th grade to Freshman year where we all made fun of each other. He couldn’t take it and during the beginning of sophomore year he left it due to a fight with our friend and our friends girlfriend. My lifelong friend also took his girlfriend (who we are all close with) with him sorta but not all the way. Me and another friend have been trying to convince them for the last year that they’re changed.





He always said no, and I eventually stopped around Sept of 2019, the split up of him and the group was in like early ‘18. We’ve always been cool even during this. 




Recently (the last two weekends) he’s hung out with us (with his girlfriend) on his OWN ACCORD. He didn’t ask to be invited he just came with his girlfriend twice and was friendly with the entire group BOTH TIMES.



Seeing that he’s hanging out with us again, I added him to the crew’s group chat. He then flips out saying “I’m not friends with yous it’s over it’s been over stop trying to get me to be friends with them” and leaves. 





I DM him basically asking what his deal with, and he tells me that I’m a bad friend for trying to get him to rejoin the group, and that he doesn’t need friends all he needs is his girlfriend and family.





He then says I’m manipulative for trying to convince him to be friends with everyone again and that “just because it’s sunshine and rainbows for [me] that it’s just ‘fine for everyone else’ .” Even though thru the whole year and a half long argument I sided with him?? I literally never even said he was in the wrong.

30,"I can't count how many hours I must have wasted over the past 4 years of my like looking into jobs or articles about finding jobs, careers etc, for anything other than the thing I had been studying until recently. 

Last semester was the final straw and I dropped out of the civil engineering program I had been studying in. I don't really know what to do now with starting to get a job or figuring out a new career path.

It's been nearly 3 months and my parents are just desperate for me to find something and stick to it and go through, but I wouldn't be in this mess in the first place if I didnt convince myself I could do CE until I discovered I absolutely couldn't, and I'm afraid the same thing will happen with anything else I try. I think that's also why the career and aptitude testers scare me. What if the option I decide to pursue is wrong again?

It should be noted STEM has always been emphasized which is why things like ""oh but I'm really interested in video editing, and do it all the time"" were not legitimately considered, but now that I can I don't know if I should and where to start. How do I distinguish what I have as actual skills  and what should remain hobbies? For what it's worth, I feel I'm stronger on the creative side than I am STEM which has made college difficult thus far because, again, it's not something I've been encouraged to follow or give credence to. 

I keep bouncing around from all kinds of jobs and ideas I'd like to pursue and I'm the type of person who reads one of those ""17 underrated jobs"" posts and comes out conflicted with several ideas about jobs that ""I think I'd be fine working as a career.""

My goals in life are simple: work a job I don't hate, live comfortably and most importantly be able to live independently eventually (preferrably sooner ofc.)

I think I can safely say things that require sitting in front of a screen/in an office for long periods, and mulling over something repeatedly, like editing or coding, I could find myself doing if I just dont know which jobs this applies to aside from those.

As well as the only job I've really had so far was an intern at a park for psrks and rec, which I can say I did honestly enjoy and could reasonably do. (I just wish local positions were open right now or I'd be applying for that.)

My fiancee just started showing symptoms of the flu last night and today he left work early and has been sleeping for the last 4 hours. I just worked a 10.5 hour day along with our kid with me at my team meeting for the last hour.

Why am I like this?

I'm curious if it's because of an event I went through when I was about 6 or 7. I had been at my friend's birthday party and he had gotten a slip &amp; slide. The next day, we had asked his dad if we could use it and he said maybe (this was always meant as a yes when talking to my mom so I assumed it was the same thing). So we had set it up in the backyard and when we came in to look at instructions, his father came upstairs and saw the slide in the backyard. He smacked his kid in the mouth and told him to go to the room, and then yelled/cursed at me for a couple minutes until I was bawling. Then my mom arrived and yelled/swore at him for awhile too.

From this event, is this why I struggle talking to authority? But it's selective authority, I guess. It's not like that with my mom, former teachers, etc. But I was like that with my principal in high school.

39,"Soo this is a wierd post and I know it may sound like it could be made up but I swear it wasn't.

I had a house party for my 18th two weeks ago and invited quite a few people and someone brought a plus one and I've never met him before but I trusted he'd be alright (never was I more wrong). The house party went to chaos and someone was turning on the gas on the oven and I couldn't figure sour who it was and he was the only one to give the explanation to why people do that (apparently you can light cigarettes from it, that's what he told us) and since he is the only one who said why people do it makes me kinda suspicious that he done it, so he seemed a bit shady and we all kinda stayed weary of him. 

Then I found out today he was getting a bit close with another one of my friends and they went to my bedroom and they had sex, IN MY BED!!!!!. he told his friends and they told me as if it's nothing and as if it's funny, probably is funny to others but since it was my bed and my friend I just feel let down. What do I do, I want to message them but don't know exactly what to say since I don't want to start an argument just want to say something about it and let them know they shouldn't of done that (is that a good idea?) I don't know what to say to her and I don't even know the other guy so can't get his side of the story. What do I do",05Mar2020,1

I have recently been dabbling into bdsm with a man I’ll call John. John and I have know each other for about a year. He’s a barber client of mine. The past two months have been a lot more hot and heavy sexually and we talked about the whole dynamic. I called him daddy and he called me baby. We talked about a safe word. We talked about a lot and I thought we had an understanding and were building trust... 
Long story short two weeks ago he attacked me for the first time. We had discussed “consensual non-consent”. The first time he came into my home and attempted to rape. I used the safe word and he still wouldn’t stop even tho he couldn’t get hard he still threw me around and bruised me up. 
Last night is my real concern. He came over to my house even when I asked him not too. He ripped me out of my clothes and held me down in different places in my house as I screamed, cried, hit, bit, used the safe word.. he still look me. Idk what to do. I sickly want to talk to him. Is that normal? To want to keep in contact with abusers? Should I call the cops? Do I have enough to press charges? Should I press charges?? I am so numb and confused.

42,"Sorry this was typed from my phone

Hey everyone I dont know what to do anymore, I just feel super confused I have this friend who is my best friend and has been for 10 years we text almost everyday and weekly have 3-5 hour conversations.

Me and him used to have a I like/love you dynamic for a long time I always knew he had trouble feeling emotions.

But recently he told me he doesn't feel emotions at all he doesn't feel hatred or affection nothing is bad or good. The only way he feels anything is if he is drinking, doing drugs, or very excited/dangerous behavior (notice he never has been into hardcore drugs he regularly indulges in pot and I he has done coke a number of times).

I felt crushed and asked him does that mean he never loved me and he said that because of how close we used to be that he thought it was love. I'm confused because even though he said that he is still very affectionate with me and says he enjoys doing affectionate things. Like he calls me cute pet names wants to kiss, hold my hand, cuddle. I feel like weird. I still love him so much.

We are kinda friends with benefits because I have to have a very strong emotional bond to be intimate with someone.He told me he doesn't mind just hanging out and not being intimate, because he said he enjoys being around me and the bond we share.

That confuses me even more! He keeps giving me mixed signals I'm so confused he is 26 and im 24. I've had a very hard life to the point that I dont ever fully trust anyone I met after me being homeless as a teen. I try so hard to make connections with people but I always break down and can't handle it.   He is a kind soul to me he has never yelled at me or being purposefully malicious thats a big thing for me, everyone in my life except him has purposefully hurt me even almost ever member of my family, my peers, and all my other past friends.

He makes me feel safe and he doesn't judge me and is always there for me but my family says he is just using me....I don't think thats true...is it?",05Mar2020,1

I want to learn guitar, bass, drums, and maybe keyboard but I already feel dwarfed in time, and skill to be good slot even take them into a position and maybe a career.

There are so many people younger than me already fully talented and ready to maybe take that skill professionally. 

I would love to make music my major in college but I just feel like I neither have the skill nor will to take that risk if it goes south. I’m just sticking to psychology.

46,"Hello, so this is my first time posting something on reddit. I just wanted to get some advice on something that is a bit more trivial compared with the other problems in this community, but it's a nagging feeling that has been dragging me down for a while now. I hope you all don't mind me asking for some help!

As you can judge from the title of this post, it is because I have two very close friends that I love very dearly. However, these last couple of months, I think we have been experiencing the typical struggles that a three way friendship experiences. I'll call the two other girls Cherry and Violet. To give some context, I've been friends with Cherry for over a little over four years now while it's only been two years since I've met Violet. 

Violet and Cherry have many similar interests and often study together because they both want to pursue the same field, while I want to study the classics and other liberal arts. They talk a lot more with each other than they talk with me, and I just can't help but feel left out and a little depressed. 

The worst part is, I know that the two of them would be horrified to hear that I feel so sad because of their unintentional actions. But, it's just so frustrating because I want to hang out with them but they just seem like a better match for each other than I am with either of them.

I hang out with Cherry a lot one-on-one but Violet and I hardly hang out with just the two of us. I think this is definitely a factor in these feelings. However, I don't think Violet personally wants to get closer with me in the sense that she already has other friends she prefers over me.

I guess, long story short, I just feel so lonely and sad knowing that Violet and Cherry can get along so well without me even being there I don't see the point of me even hanging out with them.

I honestly can't tell who I am more jealous of: Violet, who connects better with Cherry, or Cherry, who gets to spend more time with Violet.

Do you guys have any advice as to how I should approach this? Am I overthinking? Should I try to hang out with just Violet? I just love those two so much I don't want to lose them.

(If you read through all of this, thank you for wasting your time on my very *very* trivial issue lolol)",05Mar2020,1

I have the incredibly rare opportunity to have 2 weeks off work. I will be between jobs and I'm hoping to make the most of my days off. I have no money, so an exotic vacation is totally out of the question.

What are some things you would do with that time?",05Mar2020,2
50,"This will be a little long to get all the information out. Also, I'm on mobile so sorry for any formatting issues.


So 2 summers ago, my dad attempted to take his life. He had quit his job in a fit of rage the day prior. He had messaged my mom while she was at work, left a note, and left the house. My mom was a wreck so my youngest sister had to call me at work for me to come home. They called us when they got him to the hospital. My mom was in no position to be emotional support for anyone there so I took over that part. I never cried or seemed effected by it at all so I wonder if I already disconnected from my dad then. I just went through the motions.


After coming home, my mom always stepped lightly around him, worried anything could upset him. He didn't attempt to find another job but my mom wouldn't say anything. His only job was working summers at the local golf course up until this winter. He worked for a friend of his for a couple of months. He wasn't bringing much cash home so my mom suspected he was getting paid on the side so he could keep it without her noticing. I should mention that our family has always been on the line of being homeless since he likes to spend any money we have. My mom has hidden money from him but there's only so much you can hide without it being suspicious.


Anyway, I was talking to my mom recently because she had done our taxes but was waiting for my dad's friend to get his tax forms to him. She told me that the friend had written my dad down as a hired contractor so they wouldn't have to pay in on him. This is going to cause my mom to pay in which she really doesn't have the means to. She hadn't even been going into the doctor if she is sick because she can't afford to. I asked her if my dad was going to stay friends with this guy after he screwed them over and apparently my dad is already talking about going to work for this guy again.


After all these things, and more that I haven't listed, I don't love him anymore. I want to move out and I make enough money to, but even after watching the area for months for a decent house or apartment in my range, nothing has been listed. I don't know what to do and if anyone has any sort of advice, I would greatly appreciate it.",05Mar2020,1
51,"So, I (24F) feel like backstory is needed. I am a child of immigrant parents who finally purchased their own house after 17 years. My dad had his own repair shop and my mom was a nurse and had a little store in our home country. They gave it up and immigrated to the US to give me and my brother a better education. 

I ended up pursuing a nursing career (guess my ethnicity) lol. And my mom insists that I stay home ""to save money"", but I think it's mostly because that's our home country's cultural norm - to stay at home until you're married. 

My parents are somewhat strict and even though I am 24, never ask them for money, pay for my own tuition and bills, AND pay for the family's phone plan, I still get anxious when I stay out too late (most likely childhood trauma) and only spend the night somewhere else for special occasions. My mom or dad also sometimes wait for me to get home which leads me to feel guilty when I do stay out. I have a boyfriend of 5 years and we have nowhere to spend time together in my house so we always end up at his or just out- which then leads to anxiety of not being at home. All of this basically just makes me want to move out. My boyfriend and I have been dreaming of moving in together and having a space for ourselves. (He is also currently still living at home since he wants to move in with me but has none of the anxiety or guilt that I have)

&amp;#x200B;

So here comes the part I need help in deciding. My dad is very handy and is in the process of finishing our basement. It's very nice and would have a private entrance. My mom is pushing me to rent it out. They want to rent it out for $900/month but would rent it out to me for $500/month. I would still have to pay the family phone plan, so it would essentially be $800/month for a 1 bedroom, 1 bath in the suburbs. My dad would use the extra money as payments for a new car since my dad's mini van is over 10 years old and my mom's jeep is \~30. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm currently looking at luxury apartments near the city where it's $2.4K for a 2 bedroom, 1 bath in which I would share a room with my boyfriend and would have one of my best friends as a roommate. It's in a gated area and there are great views of NYC, a gym, a pool and other great amenities. It's also near the PATH where I can have easier access to hospitals in the city.

I want to help out my parents. But I also feel like my ""real life"" won't start until I move out. I need some wisdom to help me decide what to do!",05Mar2020,1

56,"I've been wanting to be a personal trainer for a while now to make money. So starting January I got a study guide for certification which my new gym manager has helped me with and recommended it to me since I told him I had financial troubles and was unable to afford expensive certification. I just passed the exam last night and I'm now a certified personal trainer and I have been CPR certified as well as of early last month. Then today, I went to the gym and I ran into the gym manager and I told him that I passed the exam and he was glad to hear and said congrats! He asked if I still have a job and I said no.  Suddenly, he said we should chat soon, I have a job interview already next week Tuesday which was much quicker than I expected. 

So that sounds great. However, what's been bothering me is the fact I have a job gap. I also think he misunderstood thinking I had a part-time job since I told him I only had one and was interested in becoming a personal trainer in the beginning when I first met him early fall last year. 

I haven't really had a job for 3 years. I just turned 28 years old 2 weeks ago. I have a lot of personal goals. I'm very ambitious and hardworking. I graduated from RIT summer of 2016 in 3D Digital Design / Game Design (I also make video games on the side and hoping to start my own indie business to make extra money and get a job in the gaming industry someday). However, right after I graduated from college, my dad got sick and found out he had stage 4 colon cancer. Now, my parents are all I got. So he got sick really fast and lost so much weight (he was a skinny guy, to begin with. It was so brutal and traumatic. My mom and I were so desperate to save him and he died 9 months later after diagnosis. So I was deeply traumatized by watching my dad whom I was very close to died in front of me unexpectedly. I actually never thought he was going to die, I was in denial that any of it was happening. So he died 3 years ago now. 

So I had to take time off and I was flailing and lost with no direction. Then I got into a bad relationship with a girl that took up a lot of my time and then I got really sick shortly with mono and after I started recovering. My mom started to fall apart. Again, it's just me and my mom. I have tried to start making my own game and portfolio to find a job in the gaming industry and was going to start becoming a personal trainer but I couldn't afford any certification study guide and I didn't know anything about the certification that my gym manager told me that I have now. I'm very thankful for his guidance and help. 

Then in 2018, my mom was falling apart. She doesn't get any help and I can only help her so much. We had to move out of the house because we can't afford it and she doesn't have a job. She also hated the house. So she bought a new house that is much smaller but needs a lot of work and so does the other house. My parents were hoarders especially my dad. He had 2 extra-large storage units filled with stuff from the bottom to top that we had to empty and sell whatever was not needed or wanted. We have been moving for over a year now. We still own both houses. We are almost done. I plan on helping her 4 days a week. She got movers coming later this month to help her. She's also in a relationship with some guy that is holding her back. He's nice but also really selfish. She also has panic disorder so there have been times where she didn't want me to get a job until we finish moving but I was like I need a job.  She has also said stuff like she wants to die and I was terrified to get a job because what if something happens to her and I'm not home. So the summer of 2019, I got a job at GNC part-time. It was great for the first month but then my first boss quit her job and then I got this asshole boss who made my life miserable and he cut my hours to almost nothing and I just quit with no notice which I know that was unprofessional but I was almost suicidal at that point and I was also not eating, losing weight. So that summer I started seeing a therapist and she has helped me a lot and saved me. I still see her every few weeks now and she's been very kind and helpful.  I have gained my weight back, I'm healthier than before. I'm finally better mentally. I have finally accepted that my dad is dead. My PTSD is cured for the most part. I'm happier than before. I'm now trying to fix my life and be very successful. I want to help my mom whenever I can. She is not doing great though but I'm getting to her see a therapist as well. Her friends have been helping a little bit.

I'm also hearing impaired. It was also very difficult to find a part-time job that didn't involve customer services. That was another reason I just quit unexpectedly at GNC because my boss would call me instead of text me when I have told him that it would be so much easier to text me due to my hearing impairment and he would just tell me to ""try harder to listen"". I have already been bullied by teachers and students in middle school and high school due to hearing impairment and I actually had to sue my school district because of this. I wasn't going to let a grown man bully me at this point. He had an iPhone and was perfectly capable of texting. He would text during the job. My mental health and well being is more important than some shitty job making $200 a month. I'm also on disability and SSI for now. My mom doesn't have a job either but she can't due to moving and everything else.

**So to sum it up and explain why I'm very nervous about my job interview(s):**

* I have a job gap due to many personal circumstances
* I quit my previous job unprofessional due to poor management and I was a bit suicidal.
* I've been moving for over a year due to my parents being hoarders and tons of home renovations. My mom is also flailing now and has severe panic disorder. We have no help and our family won't help us. 
* My previous jobs were during college but they were only a week or two contract jobs making video games or movies as a group while we get paid. So it doesn't look impressive on a resume.

My therapist thinks I should just be honest and explain that I needed to take time off and that a lot of bad things happened. Maybe don't mention that I worked on GNC or do, not sure? 

I know that my personal trainer manager is a nice guy and one of the guys at a different branch of the same gym told me that he is pretty understanding and even said he would give me a recommendation. 

**Any advice?** **How do I tackle this issue? How do I approach the interview?** What should my resume look like? I don't want the interviewer to think I'm just irresponsible or lazy. I'm very ambitious and hardworking. Honest and reliable. I just had some bad years that hit me really hard.",05Mar2020,1

Yet I still don’t have any friends, I just can’t be bothered to put any effort into building relationships with people.

When confronted he simply says that it's his house and he can do whatever But the smoke enter mine too as we are directly above through the balcony

This guy smokes at odd times too At 11pm. To 4am is his time

Which wake everyone here up and we go about close all windows and balcony doors switching on all exhaust fans We had to do this every other night

How do I handle this situation?

Can't keep the balcony doors closed at night cuz it's summer and we have no air conditioning

Can't go to the police to resolve cuz they are stupid and corrupt (I already met the area head constable for id verification,he obviously bought the posting)

Told him and his family members directly No use (The old guy smokes around his granddaughter)

Told the apartment owners association about this ,no use

Building manager also asked this guy not to smoke on the balcony

I have friends who smoke but no one uses unfiltered horrible smelling ones

It's just awful to wake up to cigarette smoke

76,"My[F] brother and I are 10 years apart, we have different dads but his dad has raised me since I was 4 and my bio dad has always been out of the picture. My brother is a sophomore in high school right now. Our age gap isn’t the only way we’re different, it seems we’re opposites in a lot of ways. 

He has ADHD which has made school a very difficult challenge; no surprise, he hates school. I grew up with little to no struggles in school and loved learning. I am artistic, studied art in college; he has trouble with dexterity and motor skills so art is of no interest. I enjoy alternative/rock/metal music (think 2000s emo music and 2010s Warped Tour); he likes main stream rap. I’m very communicative and emotive; he’s pretty quiet, not very talkative.

His only significant interest is soccer, he plays it every weekend and knows stats and teams, it’s a huge passion of his.

The closer he gets to young adult age, the more I itch to want to connect, at all. My mom struggled a lot to get pregnant with him and when he finally came he was my whole world. The older he’s gotten, the less I feel I can relate to him. I left it alone for a while because I simply didn’t know what to do. But he’s almost 18 and I wish our relationship was better. It’s not bad ? But he doesn’t call me when he’s struggling or happy; when I try to reach out it’s 1-2 word sentences. My mom tells me she talks about me a lot and that he asks questions all the time.

I just want us to be able to have a relationship, especially with our parents getting older and him leaving the nest soon. If anyone has any advice, I’d really appreciate it.",05Mar2020,1
77,"Basically, I’m planning to study for the LSAT either way, but if I move in with my parents I wouldn’t pay rent and could devote a lot more time to studying and getting a better score.  Otherwise, I would work 40hrs a week in this okay paying job ($17 an hour) but that is physically exhausting to me. I only have the energy to study on the weekends. If I lived with my parents I could study everyday. It costs me $200 to break my lease on my apartment, and I have a decent nest egg with minimal monthly expenses (no student loans, only car insurance and health insurance totaling $300 a month). 

My only real issue is that I was living with my parents for the better part of last year (not really living, I left my stuff there and backpacked through South America for the most part). About four months ago I decided to move 3,000 miles away to a brand new city where I want to eventually study at the University under their law  program. 

I want to give myself time to get a good score; I have good grades but have test anxiety toward any type of “standardized test”. I feel that technically I would give myself a better chance to study if I move in with my parents, but see myself as a failure if I do so again.

So, recently my boyfriend has been putting a lot of energy into this one person he met online. They have many mental illnesses, they self harm and have breakdowns a lot and text my boyfriend/call him about their problems a lot.

My boyfriend can barely deal with me. I just got out of an inpatient facility and when I got out he told me he didn't have the mental energy to help me. 5 days later after telling me that, he is once again helping this person he has known for only a few months. We have been together for over 5 years.

We had to pay for their meals. He has driven them to their house or from their house to somewhere else (they live 40 miles away from us). We have paid for the gas back and forth and they haven't contributed much. Our car has been slowly deteriorating and meeting up with this friend has taken a toll on our car, yet, he doesnt seem to care too much.

I feel uncomfortable with the amount of effort he has put into their new friendship, especially because they seem really unstable and they remind me of a friend I had in the past that my boyfriend helped me seperate from. (She was super toxic and bad for my mental health.) I have tried telling my boyfriend that they seemed unstable and a bit toxic to his mental health but he does not want to listen to me. He tells me how he is their only friend, only support, etc. He tells me he wants to help them, but helping someone with their mental illness is not his job.

Basically, just under a year ago I [f24] gave my cat to my auntie to look after for me. I had got the cat when I was renting with my now ex and when we split up we agreed I would keep the cat. My parents refused to allow her to live with us due to my aggressive dog and fear for her safety so I asked my auntie who had always had cats. She happily obliged. 

The agreement was that she would long term foster until I was in a position to have her back. I decided to go away for a year as its something I'd always wanted to do but my ex wasnt interested and she agreed to continue looking after her - I had said i was prepared to find someone else to look after her! 

Shes now been living with my auntie for a year and itll be another year at least till I'm financially able to have her back, so she will have lived with her for 2 years (maybe more). I have always made it clear I wanted her back but my auntie and uncle and cousins have become very attached. 

She is very well cared for with my auntie, loved a lot and is spoilt by her and her family. So I have no concerns about her welfare. However, it appears that I may now not get her back because they will be heartbroken. My auntie says that if I still really want her back I of course can but that itll be hard on her and my cat.

Im also obviously thinking about the stress if could cause my cat by taking her to a new home and back with me after all that time.

I want her back, I am heartbroken at the thought of not ever having her back and havent stopped crying since the discussion with my auntie earlier but I also understand her side.

So, Do I take her back after her living with them for 2 years? Or do I just let them keep her and visit as often as I can? (They only live 20 mins from me)",05Mar2020,1

My profressor is a very sarcastic kinda person and while I don't think she actually meant to cause me harm, I was left in a very bad mental state after she made her comment. 

Things started because I am too slow to grasp the material and she gives us very little time to practice (she usually gives us 3-5 minutes to do the problems). Lately, she's been noticing that I never do the problems on time and that I don't understand anything she teaches us. Because of this, I think, she's been constantly asking me for the answers. Usually when the timer runs out, she goes row by row choosing students to do the problems in front of the class and when she chooses me, I never have the answer. So, today this shit happened again and after the third time of her asking me and me not being able to do the problem, she, in front of the whole class, told me that the next time I don't give an answer she was going to kick me out of the class. 

The whole class went silent then, and I was stunned. She smiled at me and mumbled ""not that I would"" after no one said anything and carried on. I'm a very socially anxious person and I'm so stressed about this class that the comment made me tear up. I had to leave the class because I was just so embarrassed and people noticed my distress.

I ended up saying that I didn't think we could be friends, at least right now, because I was hurt by how she ended it (doing it at work, not talking with me about her having thoughts of ending the relationship, etc.)

anyway, I tried to text her the next day about meeting up in person to talk about what happened, and she blocked me. This was three weeks ago. I have not talked to her since.

102,"Was playing games in my living room and heard a moan from next door loud enough that I could hear it clearly through the game audio with headphones on. The wall behind me is shared between my apartment and the one next door.

Got up to investigate, and unfortunately my walls are paper thin so I could pretty much hear the whole thing, but what was odd was that there seemed to be a man's voice that sounded like he was on the phone with someone.

I listened in closer, and from what I could tell this guy who was on the phone (was talking to someone with speakerphone) wasn't involved in the activities I could also hear.

I have been living here for 6 months now, and I can confidently say that I have met every single one of my neighbours in my hallway (5 different suites) but I have never even SEEN a person from this suite.

After a minute more of listening, I heard the man on the phone hang up and begin to unlock his door, so I pretended like I was going to get my mail (it's on the first floor I'm on third) and headed out to catch a glimpse of him.

This guy looked pretty sleazy, and let me tell you there are already some sketchy people living in my apartment building. Leather coat, greased back hair, and really rough face. I said a quick hello and he basically just nodded at me.

There are two doors in my hallway and once he was out the other one I quickly returned to my apartment, where I STILL heard the noise coming from next door, basically confirming that he was not the other party involved. 

10 minutes later I heard the hallway door open, so I looked through my peephole and saw the man returning with a strange woman who I had never seen before as well, and nobody had left or entered the apartment since he left. Quickly grabbed my coat again, walked by as they were entering the apartment, lady said hello to me while the guy was already inside, from what I saw there was very little furniture and it seemed pretty messy. She also had taken her shoes off before entering but that could be irrelevant I don't know.

Not 100% sure but believe I heard some more ""activities"" going on after the other woman entered the suite. Essentially just wondering, am I going crazy or are my ""neighbours"" running a brothel?

103,"I have a friend that I really messed up with, specifically I outed him by complete accident, I apologized and we were ”good”, but I continue to feel really bad about it even now. He still would talk to me, but was not quite as friendly as he used to be and didn’t show as much care or start as many conversations with me. Perhaps I let the friendship get awkward? Simply, this is confusing me. I am so bad at communicating how I feel. Not to mention , it doesnt help that an old close friend of his that also screwed up (but VERY majorly) was taking all his time at one point and I couldn’t strike up many conversations with him. This old friend of his would also crap talk me behind my back and I’m afraid that is influencing how my friend feels about me

I kept feeling more and more guilty about this whole situation and we’ve had interactions where I feel he doesn’t even want me around. He is the type that is very emotionally intelligent so when I stopped to wait for him to walk with him to the bus loop and strived for conversation, and he asked me “do you even take the bus?”, I started wondering if he was questioning spending time with me, or why I was spending time with him. One time, I invited him to the carnival so we could catch up because I did feel that disconnection between us! He did not come or go out of his way to. His excuse was “I have homework.” I always say things like “OMG it’s been too long since we’ve talked!” Even told him, “I miss you!” He used to tell me he loved me , would invite me to things, actually put in effort.  But we kept drifting apart, now we’re hardly talking. I feel I am the only one trying to make the friendship work. I start up conversations, try to get his attention. I just have never told him how I feel directly about everything . Should I ? What do I do?

Drinking water is so painful too (not as much as food) but I hate unwanted pain more than anything so I gave up on water as well. (My inconsistent fever DOES NOT help for my hydration). Also, all painkillers stopped working on me. With no food, I took like 1500mg of ibuprofen. Did not do a goddamn thing!

He did whatever he could to ignore me and to act like I didn't count and wasn't important. He would refuse to look at me in meetings and talk to me as if I was a worthy person. I was a top contributor and he never complimented me on my work, and always acted like everything I was doing was forgettable.

107,"Not even sure if this is the right place to post this.

Everything is going downhill. Or maybe it isn't. My life has been wonderful. I have the best parents in the world, I always had friends and my childhood memories feel like they were dipped in sunlight. For most of my teenage years so far I had a group of great friends, we drank but not too much, we had many adventures and life was very great. I maintained an amazing relationship with my parents. I travelled to many places. At 17 I decided I wanted to go to medical school and maybe be a surgeon or pathologist. I love science. I worked very hard in high school and found such a passion for learning as well as what I was learning. I got into a cool science program, even though I wasn't a huge fan of the university (the location, the size - too small town-ey, too small, I love big cities like the one I grew up in). Didn't think it was a big deal.

Move in day arrived. I was excited to make more friends than I had back home. Even though I was satisfied with my life thus far, I always wished I had a few more friends. So this seemed like a new beginning. I tried, hard. And I don't know what happened, but nobody seemed to like me. I had never thought of myself as an unlikable person, or ugly, or unworthy of love or attention. But these thoughts surprised me as they began creeping into my head. What was wrong with me? Every time I tried to talk to someone I got this strange vibe, like they didn't want me there. They seemed like nice people, watching them reminded me of myself and my old friends back home. But something about me didn't seem to sit right with anybody. Except one girl, who I still remains my friend now. I am fortunate and grateful for at least one.

My classes went well. I kept getting my 80's. But something was a miss. I didn't feel like I did back in high school, my love for going to school everyday was missing. I found myself thinking negative things. I didn't like the university, or the place it was located. Something about this place seems wrong, like I inherently don't belong here.

After winter break my dad dropped me back off in my dorm room. As soon as he left I starting sobbing and I didn't stop for days. My eyes would not stop tearing up, I had to hide it in class. I had to tell my friend it was why I couldn't bear to hang out with her. The thought of spending 4 years of my life in this wretched place was too much to feel. I felt like days of my life were slipping away and being wasted like sand through my fingers. The life I loved so much. Finally, I decided to apply to transfer. As soon as i did, the tears stopped coming.

But I don't know if I will get into the school I so desperately want to go to. My marks are good, but it's a sought after school with high admission averages. I'd say my chances are 50/50. I won't hear back until this June. For now I have the rest of the semester to wait.

I was motivated. I wanted my average to be as high as possible for this application. So I started trying harder. I felt a little more like I had in high school. I do love studying and seeing it pay off. I am getting 90's now. Which is one of the positive things.

But I still don't like this place. I have never felt like this in my life. Thinking of my childhood, or my years from 12-17, immediately makes me cry. Thinking of home or anything from the past conjures a horrible, nauseating emotion. Of course the relentless tears fall as I write this. I cry for at least an hour each day. I have never cried so much in my life, not even as a baby, and never such guttural, violent sobs that cannot be controlled. I look forward to sleeping because there isn't a chance to think of what I had before I came here. I've never had a run in with mental health in the past. But this keeps getting worse. The more days drag on the more I don't feel like myself. It feels like I am acting as though it's still the old me in my head, but something is missing. I feel like I can stare at the wall for the rest of eternity and not feel anything, no boredom, so urge to reach for my phone, no need to itch or shift. Just like I can put my body on pause, or it's defaulted to pause, if I don't move it. I walked to lab the other day in one of those states and nothing seemed quite real, I noticed I was digging my fingernails into my palms and people were looking at me because I wasn't consciously controlling my facial expression. Everything just felt weird. More and more things feel weird. I feel like I'm going crazy and I don't know what to do. I can still go to class, study, get high marks, socialize, get out of bed, shower and everything else I always hear depressed people complain about. I eat well, I exercise, I dress well. Everything is normal... but it's not. I can't quite explain it if that's not clear already.

I'm getting more concerned because it's starting to feel like somethings gotta give. I keep picturing myself screaming or having some kind of breakdown. It's starting to feel like crying isn't cutting it. I am agitated but I don't know why. If there's some object like a pen or clothespin on my desk sometimes I throw it hard as I can against the wall. When I look in the mirror it feels different, like I am making eye contact. I don't know. I have this agonizing feeling like life has changed forever.

It kind of has. Even if I go home, I get into the new university, things are much different. One friend got addicted to drugs, one moved away, one became my ex boyfriend. All I really have left of that life are my parents and my city. Perhaps I am grieving and holding out hope for a period of my life that's over. What if I continue to feel like this once I get home? What if I don't get into the other university and I continue to feel like this once I come back to this one? I am terrified and I don't know how to stop what is happening to me.",05Mar2020,1
108,"Okay i’m a 20 year old girl and i live in canada and i’m starting to get desperate. I moved in to this apartment in September, and from the start I knew the landlord ( an old couple) was a little wierd, but I was excited to move in and I figured it would be okay because you very rarely have to see a landlord anyway. 

When we moved in, the landlord had said that they had previous trouble with young people making an absolute mess of their apartment, and they asked if they could come by and do like a check and if needed fix up anything that wasn’t in order. I agreed because i know it’s their space so i could understand that they wouldn’t want it destroyed. 


But it’s gotten intense, it feels like everyday he comes in and sticks a note somewhere in my apartment?? Which is really freaking me out because it feels like they’re constantly just coming in here. These notes include things like saying i’m not aloud to close the blinds/curtains, and since i moved in they’ve been coming in frequently and any sort of mess they leave a nasty letter taped up somewhere in my apartment. 

Just this morning was the tipping point, they’ve been getting stricter and stricter with these checks. Beforehand I scrub and make sure the entire apartment is spotless out of respect, which includes laundry and dishes. But today I forgot to wash a single! pan after cooking, and they found me and left me the nastiest note saying me not cleaning dishes after doing them is unacceptable behaviour. 

I live with my boyfriend and these notes are ALWAYS directed to me, not him and the husband landlord is kind of creepy to me. And i honestly just feel freaked out because i have to live here for 3 more months and I feel kind of violated, and anxious because I feel like every time I come home I have to check around my apartment and i’ve begun expecting a nasty sticky note or letter spun at me. It’s gotten exponentially worse since my boyfriend has started being gone a lot, he’s an engineering student so he’s either always out of school or out of the province. 

I work 50 hour weeks in a clinic and when i come home i make sure everything is clean and tidy and it’s never enough and i just feel exasperated and i can’t deal with this ridiculous aggressiveness from people who i pay to rent a space from. I know that i can’t break a lease without consequences, but does anyone know what i should do here? My lease ends in May

110,"This girl and I were friends for 11 years, we had some fights throughout the 11 years and she was the one who broke off our friendship twice. She apologized and asked if we could be friends again. This was around when we were sophomores and seniors in highschool. 

Honestly our friendship was something else when it was good, but something changed when she went off to college. She started acting entitled, like she was powered over everyone. She stopped talking to me for months straight and then would come back like nothing happened and acted like everything was ok. And then she would do it again. She also only talked about herself and when I’d bring up my problems she would get mad at me saying hers are worse or say “ok and?” She became a very toxic friend. I’m one of those people who really search for good friends, like if you’re not in for a meaningful friendship then I’m going to get hurt. I can admit I’m a sensitive person when it comes to the ones I care about. And I cared for her a lot, she was like my sister. 

Here’s where she did something hurtful, I’ve been dating my boyfriend for 6 years. The first 1 and a half of our relationship he was basically emotionally cheating on me with a girl. This completely wrecked me, my depression and anxiety spiraled because of it and my trust was broken. My boyfriend and I talked it out and are 99% better. I’ve forgiven him but I’m still getting back my trust and I still have a fire burning inside of my hate for this girl. I know my boyfriend kept it going but this girl was trying to rip us apart. She wanted my boyfriend and flirted with him right in front of me while also being nice to me. I know her and her friends also bullied me behind my back. My friend knew all of this, she helped me out through it and helped me out when I was hurting over this.

The final straw for our friendship though was a couple of months ago was my birthday. And I haven’t heard from her in weeks, she basically stopped telling me about her life. I sent her a text saying she either needs to start hanging out with me once a month because it was December at the time. I haven’t seen her since September, and we live 10 minutes away from eachother. Or she needs to just end the friendship because it felt like she wasn’t my friend anymore with how little I knew about her. She only said “you’ll know if I didn’t want to be your friend”. I said whatever and then my birthday rolls around, i hung out with her for 4 hours. She was the only one who talked. She only talked about how her new friends with benefits. After that I was done, I told her I have respect and still care for her but there’s no friendship anymore. 

She didn’t say anything back to that, and a few weeks later...she’s hanging out with the girl who tried to get with my boyfriend. Which ended up hurting me BADLY. This girl who I had the decency to say I still care about her and respect her. Went and hung out with the girl who tried to date my boyfriend while I was right in front of my face. And from the looks of it they’re now best friends and liking eachothers posts online. 

This is messing with me so bad, I want to text her and ask her why? I’ve been having nightmares about her being friends with this girl and them bullying me. It’s almost every night I have a dream about my ex friend and I. Sometimes it’s that, sometimes it’s us being friends again. But the dreams won’t stop and she’s friends with the girl who tried to break my bf and I apart and I want to ask her why so badly. How do I process this because my brain is grieving right now. How do I get over this??",05Mar2020,1

He’s also studying psychology while working a full time job. He’s a 40 year old single male. We haven’t actually met outside of the summer job, as I’ve been too nervous to meet up.

114,I’m 17/f and have been dating a guy for almost ten months now and everything has been pretty good except I started to feel that he and his female best friend were getting super close. We’re all in a mutual friend group and they were best friends before we started dating but it got to a point where I was starting to feel uncomfortable and insecure as they would always be tickling and touching each other and texting constantly. The issue first came up back in December when I discussed my concern with a friend but things started getting out of control because the girl best friend found out about my worries but refused to change her actions and said my insecurities were not her concern. I ended up apologizing to her for causing conflict and then blamed myself for being insecure in the first place. She replied by saying how she would never cross any boundaries and felt hurt that her friendliness was being misinterpreted and I thought we cleared the air and things could return to normal. However she soon stopped talking to me completely but continued to be super friendly with my boyfriend and I started to feel more frustrated. We used to be good friends but I feel that she never considered me an actual friend and just enjoys my boyfriend’s attention. My boyfriend has fault in this too but I feel as a friend she could have just toned down the touching.

116,"This girl and I have been getting to know each other for a while, we've been texting regularly for 2 months and have gone on one casual date. The problem is, I think I made myself come across as somewhat ""needy"" I guess and like I put her on a pedestal. I'm saying that because she once told me that I'm not being myself around her in order to get her to like me, which isn't true at all. I don't think I've been my true self around anyone as much as I've been around her, I told her everything about me and even introduced her to some members of my family...like how on earth could she say that? It was just weird. 

The thing is, I don't wanna be friends with her. I told her from the beginning I saw her romantically and not as a friend, and she seemed to like that I was incredibly honest . We had a recent heated argument where she got upset over something I said and then she said ""let's just be friends so we don't lose each other"". My response: ""I appreciate that but I'm not interested in being friends and I've made that clear from the start. It's not comfortable for me and wouldn't be comfortable for you or the friendship in general. If you think you won't ever see me in a romantic sense or believe you've seen enough of me to indicate that you're not interested, then it's okay I respect your decision but we'll have to stop talking.""


Now after that she said ""well ok I don't have a problem with giving ourselves another chance to get to know each other better"" and now she keeps texting me and for the first time ever she actually got annoyed when I didn't text her back for a few hours. Am I doing things right or should I move on? Any advice? Should I go on another date with her or should I end things already?

I’ve been dating my BF for about 5 1/2 months now, we’ve had a lot of smaller problems and some bigger ones. I just am at a loss of what to do at this point honestly.

When we started dating, he had a job; I didn’t. We were together for about a month then he lost it. I have two separate stories on why, one from him and one from a friend who poked around for me. That’s not a big part of this story though. 

Around a week before he lost his job I had gotten one at a place I’d used to work at, in the mean time he was doing some odd jobs for my dad for a few weeks before my dad stopped giving him work out of no where even though he kept saying he needed help. Whatever. 

It’s now been four months since he’s had a job, he’s been putting in applications every so often but not enough maybe one or two every two weeks. He was really upset about loosing the job since it paid well. I didn’t have to much of a problem supporting us in the meantime, which now I feel like I should’ve pushed harder for him to get employment. 

My family and coworkers have been talking with me and I agree with the fact that it seems like he’s kind of mooching off me. I pay for everything, food, rent, his and my car payments and gas, I do all the cooking and a good bit of the cleaning and when he does clean or anything else I basically have to force him to do it.

He’s easily jealous to the point that he is upset when I talk about male coworkers, and doesn’t want me around my friends which all but one is male.(Small Circle.) I haven’t been around any of them in weeks which is very upsetting. 

Today when I’d mentioned after work that I’d talked to my mom and had agreed with her, he needs to get a job. My hours are getting cut and after paying for all the bills(not food) I had 4$ left. 4. For two weeks that’s what we’re gonna live off of. I’m wanting to be able to spend money on things I’d like to have and food and things that technically ‘I don’t need, and it’s just clutter.’ To him. 

I’m just tired of being the sole provider and he gets upset and mad when ever I bring up That I’m the only one that works. I don’t know what to do honestly. I need some guidance.

129,"Allow me to begin by apologizing if this post is poorly placed. I considered a few different subs, like AITA, wedding planning, etc....but this standard advice board seemed to be the best fit.

My father has been married to a woman for about five years now— a woman who, despite our differences, I care for a great deal. Her and my father have a four year-old daughter, and I love the kid to pieces. I’ve noticed, though, since giving birth to this daughter, my father’s wife seems to think she’s become *my* second mother. It might be an overreaction on my part, but I tense up a bit when she even calls herself my stepmom, since they didn’t marry until I was well into my adulthood. She’s dissolving more and more boundaries as time goes on, in part because she can’t seem to have a single conversation without making it about herself. I’m not talking about how we all relate things back to our own experiences to communicate that we understand/empathize. A few months ago, she hijacked a post about my anniversary with my partner to talk about how difficult things were for her right now, and how she hopes a little bit of our happiness comes her way.

Anyways, I can tell I’m rambling in my attempt to provide context, so I’ll refocus on why my sister is relevant: my partner and I are getting married next year. I recently shared a Facebook post regarding children at weddings. The content isn’t really relevant, save the fact that I said I wouldn’t want children running amok at my own wedding. She replied by saying she “only had one request” (because she feels entitled to make requests about my wedding, I guess), and it was that my sister be permitted to be there with a fluffy dress, since she herself feels too old to wear one.

So here’s the question: how do I politely make it clear that, as much as I love my sister, I’m not making an exception on the grounds that she’s related to me? She’s a young child, and I don’t want her potentially creating a scene any more than I want another child to do so. I have friends with children I absolutely love— one of whom I’m even a godmother to. So far, they’re all planning to find sitters and managing not to take personal offense. My dad’s wife, however, has little to no concept of boundaries, and I’m nearly certain she’s going to flip when I say that, no, not even my little sister gets a pass to come when other children who are important to me aren’t coming either.

How can I break this gently, and offend her as little as possible?",05Mar2020,1

I can't be excited about things I've done because she always finds ways to shoot down my pride.

I understand complicated business principles but am not worth much other than, apparently my good-looks and education.

A little bit about me I am around a quarter Asian, strangely progressive in a lot of areas but republican leaning. I am Terrified of liberals but seem to get along with them until we talk politics and policy. No conservative has ever hired me, minus being a contractor for a certain Aerospace and Defense organization. The business who got me the position was also liberal.

134,"Tl;dr: I’ve been sleeping around with girls who remind me of my previous crush in an effort to fill a gap.

To give some context, I’ve never had a girlfriend. There is however, a girl that I’ve been pursuing for a while now. She joined my sports team and I fell head over heels for her. We started out as friends, but eventually we started to go out on dates. For moths everything was going awesome. Then we just stopped going out. In fact, we almost stopped talking all together. She just avoided me. She later told me (after months of telling me that she was interested in a relationship) that we were better off as friends. If by friends she means avoiding each other entirely. She was literally the perfect girl. After months of great times, it had all gone to nothing. 

After that, I stopped trying. I accepted a few “favors” from people who remind me of her. Any time I meet a girl, it feels incomplete. It just feels wrong because it isn’t her. I literally feel nothing for anyone else. I just can’t disconnect, and I feel miserable. 

How can I move on from her?",05Mar2020,1

One of my neighbors was scared and called my mother who was on her way home from work to warn. Now my mother has been driving around the block for the past 20 minutes checking to see if they are still there. She told us to lock all our windows and turn off the lights. 

They’re just sitting there, I want to call the police because it’s freaking her out but she said no. We have weird people living in our area and a few criminals and we do have gangs here. 

Idk what to do. She doesn’t want me to call the cops, we never call the cops on anything but it’s truly freaking her out and she thinks something is gonna happen to me if I do.

137,"Last week, I helped my friend sell tickets for a school dance.  She revealed to me that she was the only person who volunteered, and it seemed to me that she needed more support, so I mentioned to a fellow track team member that I wanted to join Student Government the upcoming year to support her.  This statement of mine was somehow misconstrued into ""Oh, this girl hates Student Government and thinks her fellow team members are lazy.""  They all gossiped about her before one of them confronted her about it recently.  While it has \*mostly\* been resolved, supposedly, it still doesn't quite feel like it, at least not to me - I feel like this has caused a small rift in my friendship with the aforementioned girl, and I also have noticed one of the STudent Government members (someone who is typically at least a little bit rude anyway,) nitpicking what I do more often.  I don't know what to do.  I'm exhausted in every single regard of my life, and I'm wondering if I should talk to them about it or if I should just hope that it passes.

140,"I currently am a sophomore in college and lately my mind has just been a blur. So last semester (fall), I had somewhat of a quasi relationship with a girl I was very much into. We hungout a decent amount, hooked up a couple times, and most importantly I loved her company. We would get dinner together but stay there 2+ hours after eating just talking. I especially enjoyed this because historically I've been a very closeted when it came to opening myself up to people, especially in the way that I did with her. Anyway, this went on for about two months until she unfortunately told me that her feelings for me had become platonic, which I of course was upset about but could live with as she told me some very nice things about myself, our relationship, etc. Now I'm not sure if she was just telling me what I wanted to hear, but hearing that kind of stuff really sticks with you. 

I stop talking to her for a little while, finish the semester, and then go into Winter Break with a pretty clear mind. While I did catch myself thinking of her every once in awhile, I managed to get past it. Sometime in January I get a text from her, nothing serious just asking how my break was. After that, we texted casually once or twice times until returning to school. At this point however, I find myself thinking about her a ton more. We come back to school and the casual texting starts up again but this time much more frequently. Soon enough, I start really looking forward to hearing from her and just holding conversations. Then, about three weeks ago, she asks if I want to get dinner. I agree, because like I said, I really enjoy her company. The dinner goes fine but she is in like a mood because of something that happened with her roommates (Don't know/care for the details). I get back to my own room afterwards and she texts me to apologize for the mood but to thank me for coming. 

At this point, I am stressing because I am starting to think I'm in love with her again. However, after that dinner, I don't hear from her for a week. Exactly seven days later, I decide to shoot her a message and we have a pretty normal conversation, nothing in which seemed out of the ordinary. That last string of messages was like 10 days ago at this point, and now I spend every fucking day stressing about her, whether she is done talking to me or not, and even stressing about shit that happened last semester with us that I felt I could of handled better. These thoughts are killing me and I can't get her out of my head, no matter what I do I feel like I constantly catch myself thinking of her or something we did together. On top of all this, I feel as if I'm making excuses for why we haven't talked. When in reality, the truth is if she actually wanted to talk to me, she would. I've thought about texting her again myself but I don't want to be like this pesky dude who won't let go. (Simp, jk jk)

I just feel so stupid and frustrated stressing about a girl who probably cares less about me or what I'm doing. Like I wish I wasn't so selfish and could be happy with the great support I have my friends who like me and care about me, but still I feel plain unhappy.

141,"For some context, I’m a high school student, live with my father and my brother in a very hot hot house. Since I’m so young, I don’t have access to stores/money as much as I would like and can’t control the thermostat. I also live in southern United States where seasons such as winter do not exist.

So my father likes to keep the house at 78 degrees Fahrenheit while we’re at home and 79 degrees when we are at work/school and while we’re sleeping, which I think is too hot for any normal human being. I’ve talked to my father about how uncomfortable I am, but he likes the temperature as it is (and sometimes gets cold).

152,"So there is this girl (23) that I’ve been talking to for a little over a month now. I realized i’ve gotten attached too quickly and it’s always occupying my head space that it’s stressing me out. We talked the other day and she was telling me how she is looking for a relationship and I told her the same. She told me how interested she is in me and stuff like that. We hang out on the weekends because we are both busy during the week. In person we have a great time with each other. But over the phone texting, she is super short with me and it makes me feel like she doesn’t even want to talk. Like yesterday she snapchatted me late and i was half asleep and opened it but didn’t respond. She got a little upset that I didn’t respond and that I hadn’t talked to her all day. So I told her I didn’t want to feel like I was annoying her trying to talk to her all day. And she told me that I’m smart to feel that way but it’s annoying that I haven’t talked to her all day. But on the flip side, she often doesn’t respond to me at all. 

So all this is stressing me out and having me wonder what I did wrong, has me thinking that she actually doesn’t want to be with me.

154,"I'm 18F, my dad is in his fifties. Last night he was talking to me about how exhausted he is and how busy he's been at work lately, he's a deputy principal and currently the other deputy principal is on leave because he has prostate cancer and is having surgery for it, and the principal of the school is away for three days visiting a camp some of the school's students are attending. Apparently my dad has to pick up all of the slack, because he said he's asked other people to help but they won't so he has to do all of it himself. He said that he didn't get any breaks that day and had to eat lunch over his desk while he was busy working, and then he said that while driving himself and my 13M brother home, he told my brother something along the lines of ""can you hold the wheel for a minute, I just *have* to close my eyes for a second"" he was so exhausted he just couldn't keep them open so he wanted to rest them for a second, only he apparently dozed off for god knows how long. I just looked at him horrified when he told me. And I said, ""you mean to tell me, you closed your eyes while driving, and let a 13 year old without a driver's license, hold the wheel?""
I think at that point he realized he probably shouldn't have blurted that out to me, so he sort of a bit sheepishly went, ""he's probably a better driver than you right now"". 
Yes, my brother is a pretty good driver because he practices going up and down our driveway and used to drive around our cul de sac before we moved, but that doesn't excuse the fact that closing your eyes while driving and getting someone else to hold the wheel for you -especially when they don't have a drivers license - is absolutely fucking wreckless and dangerous.
I repeated my question and he just maintained that it was ""only for a second"" and I told him he should've pulled over and had a nap before driving the rest of the way home. Before closing his eyes while driving. He just scoffed at the idea like ""no way I'd do that""

I have no idea what I should do, I'm worried about the safety of my brother. And my dad of course. 
He regularly goes over the speed limit whenever it suits him, hates having to wait in traffic so often takes smaller gaps than he should, he overtakes when it's not necessary because he has the overwhelming need to be in front of everyone else, plus he has admitted to going 200 km per hour before, for literally no reason, *with my brother in the car*. Not only is this horrible role modeling for my brother, but it's putting him in danger. 
I don't want to tell our mum because I don't want to feel like I'm snitching on him, but I also don't want to deal with what he will say to me if he finds out I ratted him out. Plus, she's divorced from him and already sees him as an abusive and unsafe person so she would likely go to (or threaten to go to) the police or something else pretty drastic. Am I being dramatic about all of this? What the hell should I do? Should authorities know? Should I tell our mum?",05Mar2020,1

She told me she was to arrive here at 8:30 am but never gave me the specific flight information...but she hasn't responded or even read my messages yet and its already past 7pm.

I am quite worried, but we are both young adults (shes 22) so I'm not sure if my worrying is excessive or not... 

I am not sure what to do or if I should do anything. We are great friends and there would be no reason for her to suddenly not want to respond to me. She does not have my US phone number because we communicate mostly through kakaotalk and instagram, which she should have been able to have access to with the airport wifi or her hotel wifi. She normally posts instagram stories when traveling too, but she hasn't yet, which makes me think she probably doesn't have access to wifi?

My other friends are saying I'm worrying too much and it's not my responsibility, but I feel like I would want someone to worry about me if I was traveling abroad all alone and havent contacted the people I'm supposed to see there for over 10 hours after I landed.

A friend (17 M) of mine (17 F) got together a few days ago with one mutual friend (17 F).
Her mom is really strict, and straight up abusive. I told her to report her, but since we’re on the same boat, it’s hard to do that.
I talked to said friend today, and she told me that the relationship would only last until graduation day (when we all graduate, around mid July), since if her mom found out about him (red flag!) she would be embarrassed, because her mom won’t stop talking about how she’s failing classes because of her boyfriend.
I talked to the guy a few minutes ago, and I told him what she told me (I know I shouldn’t have, but I don’t want either of them to get hurt): that their relationship would eventually end.
He told me that maybe I misinterpreted her, since they both agreed to get to know each other (FYI, we’ve all been friends for more than 2 years now. We all know each other really well).
I told him that maybe he misunderstood me, because she clearly stated that she was going to end things with him. 
I told him that it’s not healthy getting into a relationship knowing it’s going to end (I think it’s OK as long as both parties agree it’s going to end). He has MANY issues, and she also has issues: I know because I also have these issues (low self esteem, not know how to be alone, abusive parents, loving attention from others, etc), and I told them we could work our issues out, but they don’t even seem to know that they have them. Or at least, they play dumb so others  give them attention. I’ve been that person.
I know that maybe this isn’t my place, but I love them: they’re my friends, and I don’t want either of them to get hurt. To an outsider, this may look like I’m jealous, but I’m really not. I just don’t want them to get hurt.

Side note: I would let him keep the dog if I knew he’d be cared for properly, but he has a terrible temper and I’d be scared when the dog is older and does something bad he’d be punished in a violent way or not cared for the way I would care for him. He also has two kids whom were apparently why we got the dog (the dog is attached to me the most) but the 2 kids are too rough with the puppy and do not listen when told to be gentle with him.

170,"So basically I’ve been car shopping and I found a car that I’m really interested in, and am going to view it and assuming everything is in good condition purchase the car. The seller has been upfront, we’ve talked over the phone as well so I don’t necessarily distrust him. But there are some slight complications and I’m not sure of the best way to handle the situation. 

According to the seller the car is currently being financed by a credit union, how much hes paid off is unknown to me. The seller basically wants to go to the credit union and pay off the rest of the loan with the money that I’m going to be giving him for the car, then proceed with the transfer. How would this work?

I slightly understand that after he pays off the loan in full he would be issued a title in his name without any lien holders, but won’t that take some time to at least be mailed to him. And if I had already given him the money can’t he claim the vehicle was stolen after he receives his title? (Again he seems very trustworthy but you can never be too careful) Is there anyway I can pay him, take ownership of the car with a title, without having to deal with the loan?

Eventually I tried to kill myself. The night before I did it, I messaged him telling him how suicidal I felt.

My schoolwork is just trash at this point, which is NEVER how I handle school. I haven’t been turning in assignments which I’ve never done before on purpose. I’m a mess. 

I work at a grocery store 20-27 hours a week. It stresses me out, but I know I have to get used to it. The most draining part is having to seem happy when I’m having thoughts of ending it all on the way to work. 

I don’t have financial responsibilities and I know I’m extremely blessed. The job was money to buy clothes and various things. I feel like trash for wanting to quit but I also feel like more time for myself could help me out of my rut.

177,"I just want to begin by saying that this is something I have been thinking about for almost a solid forty eight hours now and I still am having a hard time processing it all. I (23F) just found out that my little sister (14) recently lost her innocence. I know I may be wording it weird but that is the easiest way for me to do so at this time. I am having a difficult time dealing with it all. I don’t mean that to sound selfish at all, it is just hard for me to come to terms with. Her and I had a lengthy heart to heart last night about it all after I was able to get her to get it off of her chest. I could tell something was up with her lately and after she finally spilled, I could clearly tell it was something that was weighing heavily on her. I was already aware of it for the most part, i was just really wanting her to open up and give me her side so I could see how she felt about it all. Being her older sister, I want to be her best friend and be a person she feels comfortable with and such so I can be someone she can go to and lean on for advice and such. I’m aware she’s at that transitioning age right now and she’s getting older and that something like this was bound to happen eventually.. I just honestly could have never imagined it coming so soon. It was a huge shock to me. She is a very good kid. She stays out of trouble and I never saw something like this coming. I’m just worried about her. She struggles with anxiety and depression and I know home life isn’t easy either. I always try to tell her that I can relate to her because I had very similar struggles at this age as well. I think I’m just so worried and concerned because I remember how I felt when I lost my innocence also, but I was almost twenty years old. And even though I was older than she is, all I remember is how I felt with myself. I went through a period of self loathing and regret. Her being so much younger than I was, I don’t know how she’s going to cope. I just don’t want her to go down a bad path that can potentially set a bad tone for her future. She has so much potential and has big dreams for herself. Is it strange how flustered and concerned I am about all of this?

I sent the invites out probably about a month ago so my guess is they *should have* arrived at very least 2.5-3 weeks ago. In it I had one side with info and the other side with an RSVP site that was super easy because I could pick the domain name and it is just a fill in the blank, I also included my number. I have had some people confirm with me via text (they didn’t get a mailed invite but I virtual one with the RSVP link) and that’s totally fine. I was panicking about having no one show up and I finally got one set of them from the oldest family member (my great aunt, her husband and 40 year old son) so I know the link is at least accessible. I said I wanted RSVPs by March 10th, how early do people RSVP? Since it’s family at what point can I message and ask or should I even? I just finished hand making all the decorations and such so I’m really hoping people will come. it’s a surprise party for my parents 25th anniversary so it ranges from family to friends to old college friends which is I think what makes it tough for me to know what to do across the board lol",05Mar2020,1

187,"How do normal people get health care if their employer(s) don't offer health insurance, or if they are students?

Background: F/30 living in West Virginia.

I'm an x-ray tech working full time in WV, and a disabled vet. My current work schedule is not working for me. I work nights, 7 on, 2 off, 3 on, 2 off. The schedule is taking a toll on my mental health and my relationships. There is nothing management can do, so I want to take a new path. Either find a new employer, or go back to school for my BS. 

Herein lies my problem. My employer is the only one in my field within 2hrs of driving to offer benefits. If I leave my current job, or reduce my hours, I lose my health insurance. I have VA health care, but that doesn't help me if I break my leg, my appendix bursts, or if I get pregnant. My only experience with health insurance is my current employer and tricare.

I live out in the country with my parents right now, which is another problem because I can’t just walk to a potential job/volunteering opportunity. 

I know I need to get a job ASAP because I’m not getting any younger and it gets harder to find work every year that you don’t have job experience. I have a car, (thank you grandparents) so that’s one thing going for me. 

I think I’ve figured out my options pretty much. I can get my licence as fast as possible and then try to find work in the nearest town. Or I can try going back to school. Or a combination of both.

190,"Oh, hey. TL;DR at the end.

I’m 34 and up until last September I was a SAHM for seven years. I found out I was pregnant in my third year of college and dropped out to do the mom thing. I don’t regret it, and I have plans to get my degree someday.

Recently, I started working at a “fast casual” restaurant, which is also where I worked as my first job in 2003, and then again in 2012 (my last job before I stopped working to be a SAHM). My husband is the GM of another restaurant, same company.

I’m the second two oldest employee there. I’m not a manager, just regular crew. My coworkers are legitimately great and I like and get along with everyone. I’m twice the age of a couple of my coworkers, and they’ve called me the work mom, which doesn’t bother me. And I’ve never heard anybody say anything about it, but I can’t help but worry that they see me as such a loser. I know it shouldn’t bother me? At this point in my life?

Besides having more money, I started working again because being a SAHM was making me feel like I didn’t have any tangible worth. My husband has always been super helpful and supportive, and my kids are pretty freaking cool and seem like they’re turning into decent people... I don’t know how to explain it, I just never felt like I was doing well enough, especially on bad days. So getting an actual job was kind of my way of being able to measure success, which sounds pretty lame all typed out.

Aaanyway, I’m kind of in love with my job, and I’d like to move up to GM eventually. I guess I probably wouldn’t feel like such a doof being at least 10 years older than everybody if I was a manager. On the plus side, I look like I’m in my mid 20s so I guess that helps.

I think I’m definitely probably looking way into it. I just feel self conscious sometimes, like, working in fast food at 34 definitely wasn’t my plan but it’s what works right now. Bleh. I’m not even sure what kind of advice I’m looking for? How do I get my brain to stop making me think everybody sees me as super pathetic? If you were in your early 20s working in a restaurant and you had a mid-30s coworker who goofed around with you and everybody else, would you be like ugh, bro?",05Mar2020,1

I've been with my SO for 4 years now, my ex has been with his for 1.5 years. We're cordial and co parent very well.

However, our child is now ten years old. My SO is planning to move states to be with me and my ex husband's gf is planning to move in once I'm out. 

I was already feeling some anxiety about the purchase of my own home, it's a lot of money. I have student loans and a car payment and doing it all on my own will be difficult until my SO does place his home for sale and moves. 

I've started to have extreme anxiety and nightmares over suddenly losing my job. I don't know why, I've been there for almost a decade and my particular position is needed. But I'm still plagued with nagging thoughts of the company folding and becoming unemployed after such a large purchase. 

I have been trying to tell myself that I'm being ridiculous and everything is fine. I'm close to closing, inspection is ok and appraisal came through today. All that is left is final closing and occupation. 

This morning my ex husband texted me to let me know he was laid off. My worst nightmare happened to him, right before I am closing on my new home and right before we part sharing expenses.

Luckily it seems the older dog is more intelligent and had been pre-trained before my parents owned him, the puppy is it's son (cause the other dog is un-neutered and got another dog from a friend pregnant ugh). The puppy with no prior training or anything has been pooping, peeing, and destroying objects in the house (the peeing and pooping issue is DAILY with the pup). There are doggy pads literally at every corner (on the end table leg, near the stairs, on the corner of a piano, etc and they have left MASSIVE stains everywhere including the stair steps) because both my parents let them free roam in the house when they're sleeping. For the longest time I've tried to convince them to neuter the dogs, get one into puppy school, train them and etc.  but it seems I'm talking to a brick wall. Their, common beliefs are 1) neutering hurts the pup and it's bad and evil 2) The older dog will train the pup 3) it's just a puppy and that's what they do.

I am diagnosed Bipolar 2 which basically means I have more downs than ups but I have it controlled very well with the medications I’m on. The only issue I have currently is low motivation but I think that plagues us all at times.

I have talked to the nurse practitioner that I see in my psych/counseling office. She isn’t a NP with a psych background, she is just a family medicine NP, but she has been supervised in a psych office for years. 

She is HOUNDING me about getting on birth control. Every time I see her she asks me first thing if I’ve gotten any and she always gives me a sticky note that says “BIRTH CONTROL” underlined in all caps. I fully understand that my medications can cause some complications at the beginning of a pregnancy and that stopping meds when you are stable is not always the right choice. However, if I want to have kids (like ever) I WILL need to stop at least one of my meds, that I’m aware of.

I am willing to go on different meds to see if those will work in place of the other ones, if they’ll will be safer to start trying for a baby, but she won’t even allow for that discussion. 

Should I switch doctors? Maybe ask for a NP in the same office who has a psych background? Is she being close minded in not even having that discussion with me? Or allowing me to request a different med?",05Mar2020,1

I have been asked multiple times whether I like anyone but always go back to “no”. I think this is because I can’t bear the thought of things spiralling out of control, which I’ve found many people experience.

A few weeks ago, I snuck out with his car (a really old Honda Accord we got for free from a family member) and drifted it with my friends and I fucked it up bad and repair costed $400. I feel like a shitty ass son knowing that I should’ve gotten a job and pay for it, but he already paid for the repair and recently gave it to another family member. He then bought a Acura MDX for around $3000 I think, which I’m happy for. And since my sister got grounded for the tattoo, I ended up getting her Jeep (previously owned by my dad) and I while cleaning out the car, I removed the rear view window and had accidentally ripped a chunk of glass out so my dad has to pay for a new windshield for $150. So far, I’ve just made a lot of careless and reckless mistakes that have costed him a lot of money. And also, my sister and I are always fighting and it effects him quite a lot. I love my dad to death man, I want to be able to pay him back and make him retire as soon as possible which is why I’m praying for some kind of success. Same thing applies to my mom as well. I’m currently 17 years old as a junior in high school and I want to pursue graphic design. I have really good grades as well. I’ve been cleaning the house, doing the dishes, taking care of the dog, cleaning my parents’ room and making their bed, spending time with my parents and all.

I’m a 20F and my cousin is a 21M. We do not live in the same country but he does visit time to time. I’ve been infatuated by him from the first time I met him because he is strong, courageous, and adventurous. Qualities I lacked in if I’m being honest so because of his personality I truly admired him. I should also mention that my home and school life was not the best as I was picked on a lot for being too nice (this is what I’ve been told Idk honestly kids are mean). My crush began to develop when he’d show he cared about even the smallest of things and would protect me against people who openly made fun of me. Fast forward a few years and he would play wrestle me, cuddle me, tease me, carry me, and just hold onto me. I’m not sure if this was his way of showing platonic affection because he has a very protective bear like personality. Even though he’d “baby” me a lot he unknowingly led me to these feelings that I cannot see myself getting rid of anytime soon. I don’t mention anything to him because I’m afraid of destroying the only connection I treasure with another person. Also I don’t want him to get freaked out and never speak to me again, but I really love him. Trust me I know It’s weird... I know... but it just happened to me and idk what to do anymore. Do I stay away from him or do I pursue him because I’ve seen so many people who live a happy life with there cousins and I live in an area that is legal for this to happen. The family and public view would be a huge problem though...annnddd I know he doesn’t see me that way so why am I getting ahead of myself. Ugh this is bad. What do you think?

The main problem is that I seem to have some kind of a cold that won't go away. My nose isn't always runny, but I cough and I swallow a lot of mucus, which I guess makes me throw up.

The reason I’m thinking about this is because every time I talk to a girl who’s nice or good looking I just feel horrible because I start to think I’ll never be with someone like that and that I’ll probably just end up in some unhappy relationship with someone.

Those are all my symptoms. I had a full on anxiety attack and during the anxiety attack my chest felt a little tight and I was crying a lot. The anxiety attack has passed since, and the chest tightness went away after I calmed down.

I am currently in a place where I have an opportunity to move about 12 hours away with my out of state friends. It's in a larger city that overall is better than where I am currently living. However I'm on the fence about it since I feel super guilty.

I currently don't normally leave the house besides for work. I had some friends/coworkers here back in October-December but they got toxic over time with constantly degrading me. I think they only kept me around for money tbh. I was lonely and bored so I stayed anyways. My work is seasonal so during winter months I don't do anything. I feel guilty about work because apparently with no warning (even though they schedule events MONTHS in advance) I got a week notice that I start back. If I left they'd understaffed. 

As for family, I don't see most of them. I live with my father who is rarely home and my stepmother is an alcoholic. I buy groceries on my own (then get told I spend to much on groceries despite it being my own money.) Any cousins are away in college, my mom moved away and my grandparents have new love interests and never want to go out for lunch, etc. I have no sense of support irl as most are pretty disappointed I'm not in college and see me as lazy for doing so. I feel selfish because I know my dad loves me and would be depressed if I left. I'm just super depressed myself here and see never making progress. Would I be selfish for leaving?

226,"throwaway:)

As the title says, I am a very insecure person. I have grown up with parents who gave little affection to me and a narcissistic father who has crushed any self worth I have. Throughout middle and high school, I was popular but at the same time, I was never anyone's favorite person. I thought it was because I never had freedom or a phone during those times. I managed to escape and go to school away from my parents in college, but if anything, I have become even worse. I am so desperately afraid of losing the friends that I have made, in particular, someone who is the FIRST person in my life to have feelings for me. He knows me like the back of my hand, but now that we are doing long distance, it's naturally just harder and sometimes I come off as insecure when I ask him things. Most of the time, he is the only one I talk to about many things such as my parents which many don't understand. I just really don't want to lose him and he has said that he is tired of me being insecure, but I am naturally just not that special or pretty or smart and I can't help it. I wasn't like this when I met him, but I can't stop thinking about how he's going to find someone infinitely better when he starts his new job soon and never look at me again.

I am in college so I have little time for hobbies but I still read and work out in my free time. Most of the time I am studying, but I barely get by in school and can't land an internship for the summer.

228,"Thank you Redditors for your time.

My father’s wife hates me, and I’m not sure what to do.

He met her in Turkey. A year after they married they moved back to the US. I was 15. I came to live with them. She was kind to me, but abusive toward my father. I suppose it became normal for me. I accepted it. But she and I have had a positive relationship for the past 17 years. Always friendly. Until recently.

Her daughter, my sister, is now 16. I am 32. She confides in me more and more lately. We are best friends. I sense that my stepmother feels that her influence is waning. Where she once was the overseer of my sister’s development, she now surely feels like an outcast.

Rewind.

My stepmother is borderline developmentally disabled. Uneducated. Unintelligent. Unwilling to learn. My father is a senior environmental scientist. Here we set the tone. The major issue in the family is that his wife abhors the idea that she is less than perfect. Even things as small as a suggestion to load the dishwasher in a more practical way are met with overt aggression. When my father tries to have a (in my mind, standard) family discussion, she either raises her voice and refuses to be rational, or walks away and spends 4 days being passive aggressive in the extreme.

Recently I was in an accident that rendered my left arm and leg paralyzed. Unable to work, my father invited me to stay with them while I rehabbed my injuries. At the same time, his wife took a trip back to Turkey to see family. When she returned, she refused to speak to my father or to me for seven days. No explanation. Didn’t look us in the eye. Didn’t communicate. Ghosted us. We were baffled. Worried. My father was distraught. On the seventh day she woke up and cooked breakfast like nothing had happened. She played “princess”.

...but not to me

Fast forward 4 months.

She has yet to look me in the eye. She has not said one word to me. On a near daily basis my sister relays her disparaging comments to me. She calls me foul names. She implies I am a bad influence. She has literally said, “Your brother is an asshole. Don’t talk to him.”

...I know what you must be thinking. I’m leaving something out. There must be a reason. But I swear to you, I am as baffled as you must be. Granted, my sister hates her. She talks about how unintelligent her mother is to me, and every time I try to steer her back toward altruism. I make every effort to be a positive influence and offer constructive suggestions on how to improve their relationship.

But here we are. My limbs are back to normal. My paralysis is not permanent. I am getting ready to leave their household but I am terrified of what their family dynamic will be after I’m gone. My father is an indecisive mess. My sister is doing everything in her power to make my stepmother feel stupid. And my stepmother is about to give my father a heart attack. 

I know... therapy. I need to talk to someone who is a professional listener. But right now I could just use some advice. Any advice. Am I looking at this from an entirely wrong angle? Is there something obvious I’m just not seeing? Should I just let it go? 

Fellow Redditors, guide me. Please.",05Mar2020,1

He said we should be friends and hang out that night. I didn’t want to, so I lied and said I was spending time with family. He asked for my number and I gave it to him out of pity. I decided it wouldn’t hurt to get to know my neighbor, so I texted him. I found we had nothing in common so I had no intentions of befriending him. I ghosted him after about an hour. The next day, he invited me to a party. I said I was busy, but he kept asking. I eventually gave in and said I’d stop by. As soon as I got to the party, he tried putting his arm around me and I moved away. I spent the rest of the party getting to know other people to try and avoid him. I ended up hearing that he’s a liar, a big criminal, and was carrying a gun w/ him. He would not stop following me, insisting that he was “protecting me”.

235,"Let me start off by saying I'm Asian, and I live in Asia. So it's kinda...whatever your parents say is gospel. 

I(26F) have a really good relationship with my mother(66F), we're pretty close and talk about everything. My mother treats my BF like her 2nd son. She adores him, and buys him more presents for him that for us whenever she travels. 

While me and bf(23M) have been together for nearly 5 years we're still very, very, much in love, never bored around each other! It's like, as long as we're with each other, even watching paint dry is fun. 

When we first got together my BF was kinda overweight. His face was a perfect circle. But after discovering his unhealthy lifestyle of eating junk for years took a toll on his health, he decided to change his lifestyle. A complete change - change in diet, going to the gym daily, signing up for classes. This was 3 years ago and now he has the body of a Greek god! If I'm being completely honest, I didn't really notice until I saw before and after pics! 

I've read romance novels all my life and couldn't really believe people saying stuff like 'I love you for who you are, what you look like doesn't really matter' etc. I mean...I grew up listening to KPOP and so I may have slightly unrealistic expectations about body image. But being in a relationship now, I honestly don't notice or care what scars/body shape my boyfriend has. It truly love him for who he is. 

The problem is; I'm chubby. To give you an image, I'm 153cm and about 57kgs. My BMI is literally borderline-almost overweight. I wasn't always so fat, I slowly gained weight as I started working. I'm also not really a girly girl per se. I live in a tropical country so, all I wear is a t-shirt, shorts and slippers. I never wear sundresses, or jumpsuits. I spent most of my salary on food, games and..more food. 

Growing up, I've had relatives tell me to 'act like a girl!! Otherwise boys aren't going to like you!'  I went to an all girls school and all the girls were into make up, clothes and dressing up. They had all the boys after them- here i was, into anime, manga, and games. This crushed my self-confidence as a teenager.

My current BF is my first and hopefully last BF. I nearly dated one guy before him, but he turns out he was just using me as fodder while waiting for the girl he liked to reply me. He didn't mention anyone despite me asking many many times. He flirted hard with me. Again, this pretty much destroyed whatever self-confidence I had. 

My BF absolutely doesn't care what I look like. When he started going to the gym, I went along with him but let me tell you, I ABSOLUTELY HATED AND STILL HATE GOING TO THE GYM. It got so bad that I would cry before going. It made me MISERABLE and it affected my relationship with my BF because it's part of his identity now; a gym bro/rat whatever you call it. It's his hobby, his lifestyle HE LOVES IT.

While this was going on, my mum would constantly tell me that 'You need to keep your boyfriend interested, dress up more often, make yourself look good. lose some weight. **NEVER BELIEVE THEM WHEN THEY SAY THEY LOVE YOUR BODY AS IS. THEY NEVER DO.'** This would constantly be drummed into my head whenever my mum spoke to me. My father and brother have always thought I look fine, all my extra bits + slightly boy-ish personality and all. 

It got to the point I was so desperate to lose weight that I even signed up with Herbalife. This almost ruined my stomach, as I was getting SEVERE stomach cramps every day; it got so bad I couldn't get out of bed one day. I tossed it out as soon as I could. 

The thing is, I did try dressing up, I did put on make up. I bought nice lingerie - the whole package, my bf would look for a split second and go 'oh thats nice.' Or I had to ask 'What do you think?' \*thumbs up\*.  ....that's it. 

On the other hand, when I wear my ancient, tatty set of PJ's, had just woken up, looking all dishevelled and homeless, my boyfriend would ***always, always*** come and give me a sniff, a kiss, cuddle etc. I started experimenting and its the same, every, single time. 

Basically-&gt; Dress up = No attention/compliments. Don't dress up = Lot's of affection and compliments. In fact, he sneaked that ratty looking t-shirt i sleep in and took it home with him!! 

He has never asked me to lose weight, he LOVES squeezing my flabby tummy, my bat wings, my thunder thighs. He only wants me to be healthy and just move a little(tbh I'm almost one with my bed; I'm the happiest when im lying down playing my switch or immersing myself in a good book. although I am getting a little pudgy.) I WAS SO HAPPY WHEN NINTENDO RELEASED THE RING FIT ADVENTURE! Game + the chance to start getting active! 

DESPITE telling my mother exactly what I wrote, she remains firm on 'It doesn't matter, a slimmer, prettier girl who smells nicer will steal him away. You better start losing weight, your thighs are huge. Your cellulite is getting worse.'  


I'm feeling absolutely crap about myself right now. My boyfriend has remain absolutely firm that I'm beautiful as I am, he'll love me no matter what I look like(and has shown through his actions, so far). My mother is convinced that he will change and won't find me attractive if I keep this up. 

My mother has good intentions I'm sure, she gets along SO WELL with my BF. Really treats him as if she gave birth to him. But again last night, as I was playing my switch, my BF on our PS4, she openly said that 'Your thighs are so big! Look at it!' My bf kept quiet. And I told him after she left I was feeling really shit. He said again, 'I love how ever you look, in fact don't get too thin, I love all your juicy bits.'   


I'm just wondering...I mean...my mother means well, but...is it really okay to believe what my boyfriend says?",05Mar2020,1

240,"Hello there. I  haven’t really done anything like this before but I figured it couldn’t hurt to get some stuff off my chest and perhaps get some advice from others. I just created this account specifically for this post and to stay confidential. First off, I’m a freshman in college (18M) that has been naturally shy around people I don’t know very well since about 14. This is mostly due to the fact that I constantly worry about people I don’t know judging me (Ik it sounds ridiculous it’s just the way I’ve been). I’ve never been a big social media guy (I don’t do Instagram and I have a Snapchat but only use it to communicate with a handful of people) and I feel like it definitely has some effect on how I interact with others my age. For the past few years I’ve only really had one amazing friend who I feel truly cares about me and checks in on me daily. I of course have other friend from college but it is much more casual of a relationship (I would never hang out with them outside of school). There have been times over the past year or two when I hang out in a group, have a fun time, then slowly push them away and make excuses to not hang out again. I honestly couldn’t pinpoint why I act that way. I’ve only been out partying legitimately 2 times in my life, so yeah I don’t really get out much :/. Before I keep going I do want to say I am still happy and have a great, loving family life, it’s just this point that I’m about to get into does leave me a bit empty inside. Regardless of all of this social awkwardness that I define myself by, I see myself as a pretty good looking guy and crave having intimacy with someone just like everybody else.  There’s been a few girls that I have gotten close with, but I’ve never been in a legitimate relationships. I’ve come to the point where I realize its unlikely for a girl to just walk up to me, so I know I need to make the first move. I have trouble dealing with this reality though because it makes me extremely anxious just thinking about approaching a girl. I’m naturally very shy out in public and constantly worry about judgement of others, but when I am comfortable around somebody I am a completely different and enjoyable person to be around. I know if I got past that first awkward stage with a girl, that I would never be able to let her go as long as she did right by me. I just need to build up the courage and confidence be more open around strangers. I know I’m taking forever to get to the point but I felt the backstory was at least slightly significant. I am looking for advice on how to approach a girl without being super creepy about it, and how to not psych myself out of it right before I make a move.

243,"Hello there. I  haven’t really done anything like this before but I figured it couldn’t hurt to get some stuff off my chest and perhaps get some advice from others. I just created this account specifically for this post and to stay confidential. First off, I’m a freshman in college (18M) that has been naturally shy around people I don’t know very well since about 14. This is mostly due to the fact that I constantly worry about people I don’t know judging me (Ik it sounds ridiculous it’s just the way I’ve been). I’ve never been a big social media guy (I don’t do Instagram and I have a Snapchat but only use it to communicate with a handful of people) and I feel like it definitely has some effect on how I interact with others my age. For the past few years I’ve only really had one amazing friend who I feel truly cares about me and checks in on me daily. I of course have other friend from college but it is much more casual of a relationship (I would never hang out with them outside of school). There have been times over the past year or two when I hang out in a group, have a fun time, then slowly push them away and make excuses to not hang out again. I honestly couldn’t pinpoint why I act that way. I’ve only been out partying legitimately 2 times in my life, so yeah I don’t really get out much :/. Before I keep going I do want to say I am still happy and have a great, loving family life, it’s just this point that I’m about to get into does leave me a bit empty inside. Regardless of all of this social awkwardness that I define myself by, I see myself as a pretty good looking guy and crave having intimacy with someone just like everybody else.  There’s been a few girls that I have gotten close with, but I’ve never been in a legitimate relationships. I’ve come to the point where I realize its unlikely for a girl to just walk up to me, so I know I need to make the first move. I have trouble dealing with this reality though because it makes me extremely anxious just thinking about approaching a girl. I’m naturally very shy out in public and constantly worry about judgement of others, but when I am comfortable around somebody I am a completely different and enjoyable person to be around. I know if I got past that first awkward stage with a girl, that I would never be able to let her go as long as she did right by me. I just need to build up the courage and confidence be more open around strangers. I know I’m taking forever to get to the point but I felt the backstory was at least slightly significant. I am looking for advice on how to approach a girl without being super creepy about it, and how to not psych myself out of it right before I make a move. Thank you for reading this long rant/venting and I appreciate any advice.",05Mar2020,1
244,"So, I'm a 14 year old boy in my freshman year in high school, and I've enjoyed most of my year so far, except for my band class. After an admittedly fun marching band season, the band class has become nothing more than a waste of everyone's time. It's and hour and a half class period with 20 minutes worth of instruction, followed by over an hour of nothing. I am in the middle band, symphonic band as they call it, and all of the resources are given to wind symphony. For over three-fourths of our time, we (symphonic + concert band percussion, maybe 11 people) are lucky to have one vibraphone and a single practice pad to share between all of us. We don't get practice, we don't get help, and we aren't even allowed to use the time for study

Our instructor (let's call him Jonah), has always been picky with cleanliness. He's the Percussion director for our school, and we are around him all day. He requires all chairs be stacked constantly, everything to be covered, and mallets to be organized neatly into pockets, or else he'll call the class in to tell at us. But honestly, it makes sense. Make sure everything is organized so it stays in good condition longer. 

So where's the problem?

For the past two quarters of school, I've been the only one cleaning this up. My class is full of juniors and seniors, yet I'm the only one trying to follow instruction. Typically, cleaning up a board doesn't take very long, maybe 30 seconds at the maximum, but before lunch, I can always see a bunch of uncovered boards, mix-matched mallets, and stray sticks. I'm often 4 to 7 minutes late to my already tight lunch period because of this, and I've resorted to snacking in my other classes to try to ease my hunger. 

I've tried to ask people to just put up their boards, or even just cover them to make my job easier, but they don't ever do it for more than that block, if at all. I would be tempted to just leave it, but I get very, very overwhelmed when people like Jonah get angry, and when he does, my percussionfolk always blame me for not cleaning up their mess! I've tried confronting Jonah about this, but he just keeps repeating ""see a need, fill a need"" in response.

Things came to a head earlier today at our almost-spring concert. The concert was around 6-7, but we had to be dressed and warming up around 5. (Yes percussiok has to warm up) Symphonic band was told to set everything up, and Concert band was expected to take everything down. I got there over an hour early to help set stuff up, and to work on some of my load of homework, and I helped move everything all the way around the school. 

I'm going to take a quick second and say, moving Percussion is not easy. If you've ever stayed after a middle or high school band convert, you'll know that almost all the equipment is heavy, hard to grip, and big. And there are a lot of them. Our school has very small doors in the school, so for larger instruments like the timpani or the bass drum, we have to go outside the school. We moved everything from one end of the school to the other in a reasonably short amount of time for the concert, because the 5 of were all moving fast and all of us were carrying something.

However, after the concert, things were not so great. For our concerts we have to wear a really, really hot outfit that stays on the whole time, and whenever I get really hot, my nose starts to bleed. So, the concert is over, people start moving to take their things, and I go across the school to put up my music folder. I saw a couple of the concert band people moving some of the equipment, so I thought nothing of it. Then, I was told to run in and give a key to Jonah, who was in the auditorium, and decided to take the chimes with me to the band room on the way back. I made a mental note of what was there, and went to put up the chimes. It was here when I probably made my first mistake. I told people I was going to see if concert band needed any help, so I went over and noticed that in the probably 10 minutes it took to move the thing outside the school, get a key to get in, get a key to the elevator, and get up, not a single piece of equipment was moved. I knew for a fact that they were supposed to be moved upstairs (Jonah was right there and I asked him). So I moved another thing. And another. In the end, I took a tam-tam, two timpanis, a bell kit, a bass drum, two stand racks, a pair of crash cymbals, and of course, the chimes.

By the time I was halfway done, most people had already changed out of their uniform, and a good portion of concert band people had headed home. By the time I was done, I was not only miserable- with a stuffy, bloody nose, a headache, a foot ache, and very, very tired- but I was also the only student left. No one I asked helped me, and a grand total of one person from Concert band helped me operate the elevator. I got home at 9:45 (I live far away) with several hours of homework to do. But instead of doing it, I guess I'm plotting revenge and typing this.

I don't want to have to clean up all the messes the class makes. I'm fine with doing things for others until it seriously impedes with my own wellbeing. This has burnt too much time I should have spend studying and working, and I really can't fathom wanting to do it again. I did basically all of this alone, for around an hour and a half of my own time, without thanks. I don't want to be in another one of Jonah's fits, where the finger is pointed at me, but I'm starting to think that I might rather that than only me clean things up for the rest of my four years.

So, what I'm asking is what a good course if action is for tomorrow and the next few days? I've asked before, and no one would help me, but maybe I just didn't ask nice enough. I've considered dropping band, because I haven't been enjoying it, and I haven't really developed any real relationships in it, but ultimately that would mean dropping my creative program, a good shot for GSP and a good shot at a school for composition. I've thought about just being self serving, and not doing anyone else's stuff for them, but Jonah strictly forbids this kind of stuff.

My last thought is to try to bring this whole issue to the director of the whole band, to see if he could stop it, but this honestly feels kinda vengeful, and like it would make the rest of band for my next 3 years be even more horrid, with the sorts of grudges the band people can hold. 

TL;DR: People in band have been letting me do all the work for cleanup, and I'm sick of it

247,"I just have this sense that over the last few years people have gotten meaner to each other. I notice it when I interact with people or when I observe other people interacting with each other, in places like the grocery store, fast food places, and at college. It just seems like most people are in their own world not giving anything to each other emotionally, and end up sort of being cold and unkind to each other. I'll say that it's not everyone, but probably most people are like this.

Because of this, I'm finding it harder to connect to people. People seem shielded and closed off. Like, for example in the past if I was talking to someone and I made a joke that wasn't that funny, they would at least humor me and give me a little smile to acknowledge that I tried to make a joke, but if I did the same thing today they would probably give me a dead emotionless face and just ignore what I said, almost as if they didn't have the energy to give a minimum effort. Or if I'm ordering fast food, I'll smile and be polite to the cashier, but I'll just get nothing and get blanked from them. It honestly feels like they hate me when they look at me, but my perception might be off.

Maybe it's more of a reflection on who I've become over the past few years, and maybe it's really just me that's changing, maybe I'm just giving off a weird vibe... I don't know. That's why I'm asking if anyone else feels this way?",05Mar2020,1

252,"Ok so to preface this: I am not anti-Christian. Frankly I do not care what, if any, religion people choose to believe in.

However, this situation is concerning.

So back in September, I met these two people, a guy and a girl. We became quick friends. 

The girl, let’s call her T, is very christian. According to her, her faith is in every aspect of her life. She travels home (we’re at uni) every weekend to go to her church. 

The guy, P, wasn’t religious when we met. He has since joined T’s church and been baptised and everything.

The problem is that P was gay. Now he says that he’s changed his mind and he’s straight. 

I know that he’s done this because of his new religion and that T encouraged and persuaded him to do so. She told me that she considers homosexuality to be a sin and that when P became christian she’d get him to be straight and find a nice girl.

P claims he’s happier than ever, but I’m concerned. Is there anything I can do to help him? I discussed this with my boyfriend and we’ve agreed to be there for P and support him if or when this backlashes.",05Mar2020,1

So I have 2 friends, and we’re going to prom together (1 girl 1guy) and I am a female myself. My female friend (Lily) asked my guy friend (Nick) if he would be my prom date. 

Mind you that Lily and I already had plans to go as each other’s date (we call it no homo dates), so this caught me COMPLETELY off guard. Even stranger was that Nick said YES. 

So later I asked Nick if he was serious about us going as each other’s date, and he said “no.” “Jk.” “If you want.” 

Not knowing how to respond, I texted Lily and asked her, but she said she felt horrible for saying something like that, and she didn’t mean to make it so awkward. I ended up texting Nick that I wouldn’t mind going with him since Lily said it was fine, and then Nick started acting strange. 

First he said it was because he was taking his dog to prom, and then he said he was going to ask Lily to prom. I, being a supportive friend, said “good luck asking Lily”. 

However, he got upset after I said this and then asked if I liked him. He then brought up my ex-crush and said he was “a little hurt” when I said we could go as friends. 

However, this is not the end. Nick had said that he wants to go as each other’s date, and when I said “I would be delighted” he kept asking if I was sure and positive. After I finally convinced him that I was sure that I wouldn’t mind going as his prom date, I asked him about if he even wanted to go as dates. Nick said “let me think.”

255,"This is super long and plz excuse spelling mistakes I typed this on my phone!!

Hey Reddit! This is my first time ever posting on here so plz go easy...and give advice!!

So, I'm president of a band club at my school. It's not necessarily a marching band or orchestra, we're a performance/stage band, which means guitars, drums, vocalists, basses...etc. this is my first year as president (I've been a club member for three years now) and I have a pretty good idea how things work. 

So, not to brag, but we're kind of awesome. Our performances are really good, we're probably the best club on campus, and all that fun stuff. (I'm giving this info just for background info so please bear with me lol)

So on to the problem. We have a singer who we'll call X. X has been in the club for two years. She's now a sophomore. She's our main vocalist, and she's sort of our front woman. I'm on guitar so I don't usually speak, and sometimes, I fumble words around, but I'm taking a public speaking course at the community college to combat this. 

A couple of months ago, on finals week, we had a gig lined up, and we totally had forgotten about it. I asked the teacher in charge of the club if we could cancel, but he said it was too late and we had to roll with it. I had a major apush exam the very next day, (I'm taking 3 AP's) and I was studying between sets, and everyone was generally stressed, or they didn't want to be there, X included. Our set ended at 7 and we packed up and left by 7:30. My parents are hella strict so I got some screaming over the phone by my mom and was told I had to walk home because she couldn't deal with me. So I walked home. Alone. At night. (This is all background info)

May I add, we were at rehearsal one day and I saw X in the hallway. X is well liked by everyone, she's super awesome, and I love her with all my heart. I said hi to her and she turned around (to not face me) and said hey. She seemed a bit odd so I asked her if something's wrong and she said no. I knew something was up, but if she didn't want to tell me I have to respect that. She eventually confided to my VP saying how she felt like this club was like a job, and that she loves everyone. 

 After that, we had significantly low morale as a club, and my leadership, myself, and our teacher unanimously agreed a break was well needed and deserved. I was so ready and relieved, but I was especially happy because we would have a rejuvenated X. 

We had a rally the day school started, and we had two practices scheduled over the break. Our teacher didn't show up for both (even though he scheduled it) resulting in even LOWER morale. X was even more and more dissatisfied. I was too. At one point, I thought about quitting my club, and I knew I was talking nonsense so I talked with a club alumni to help me out. She's a university student and she's usually super busy. I just felt like I was doing everything wrong, and how X was unhappy

""How is it your fault girl? And it's honestly extremely normal for X to feel that way. A majority of the band kids feel that way because they realize that what they do for fun can be a serious job and it's not always a good realization. 

And as a leadership TAKE A BREAK FOR YALL PLEASE.""

So we took a break. A long one. The only gigs we focused on were open mics. That was IT.

Flash forward to now. We have a women's empowerment conference that we're gonna play at, and X said she was only down to do one song. I was happy that she was beginning to develop a (figurative) voice for herself. Saying what she wanted and didn't want to do. She left before we could hold a vote on our setlist, and I said bye to her, but she didn't really say anything back. I thought she just didn't hear me, and I looked over to my friend and he said ""maybe she's just not vibin today"" totally understandable

But then... Then I see a post on her spam account. And... I just. A switch just flipped. I'm just... Done with her BS at this point. The post read

""I feel so out of place when I'm with band""

It felt like my heart sank. I felt like this was it. Like, I was done, and I was just so, so, tired. I've tried everything. Literally everything. Maybe you wouldn't feel so out of place if you would just show up? Maybe it's not the band's fault but maybe it's just you? I've been super understanding this entire time, and... I'm just over this bullshit. 

X had moved, and she's gonna be going to another school next year. I had told her ""man, I keep getting sad thinking about you leaving."" And she responded. ""It sucks to suck.""

I'm done. You can't afford to come to practice, but yet you could still show up to your friends basketball game? You feel so out of place, but you don't show up to any of our events, maybe a meeting once a week... But that's it. You've just totally disassociated yourself from the program... And I hate thinking this.... But I honestly just feel like it would be best for her to quit.

So this is where I ask advice. I'm at a loss for what to do. But I'm just done. I'm sick and tired of me stressing myself out and breaking my back to make X happy, going out of my way to make sure she she's okay with this, okay with that... Like... I don't want to sound selfish here... But you don't think I'M stressed? I have super strict parents that hate it whenever I'm with my club, I have apush and AP physics to manage, a fuckton of AP Lang homework, classes at UCLA and the local community college. You don't think I'M stressed? You don't think practicing guitar parts for gigs and managing a whole club is stressful? The rest of my club is happy and content without her. I had a talk with my teacher about this, and he said he'll talk with her. I talked with my awesome VP and she's getting tired of X too. I'm just wondering what to do.

I don't want to give her the boot. But she's not expressing her feelings and due to her ""schedule"" I don't think I can talk with her. I'm just... I'm at a loss for what to do. I'm sorry if this is so long...I'm just so tired of bottling this all up. I'm going to discuss this with my teacher if I can stay after school and get my feelings out, but... I think I need more that just that at this point. I just don't know anymore... I need advice.",05Mar2020,1
257,"My mom just passed away a little over a week ago. From childhood, her dream was to have her ashes scattered off the Island of Capri (Italy). One reasoning for this is she wanted my father and I to also see and experience the beauty of Capri as she had once. Currently, it is financially impossible for us to go to Italy. My father and I have been tossing around ideas about what we could do for her that would best memorialize her. 

I had an idea last night that maybe I could find someone on social media who lives there. I would then mail a small portion of her cremains to this person (if willing) and have a piece of her there forever. Aside from the legality of such actions, as I have yet to research into it, what would be the best way to go about finding someone on such a small island and approaching the subject? I know if someone asked me to do this, I would be very willing and take it seriously. However, I know that many people are not as open to favors for strangers, let alone it involving cremains.

Small business owner for onsite diesel repair.


Dilemma : Have opportunity to take a position of near equal rank in Charlotte NC, with the same pay and benefits with some additional “positives/perks”. Moving to this area also has clear benefits that I can see. I would take this position with absolutely no regret, however one thing is holding me back. My aging parents in Connecticut. 

So here are the job differences. I’ll start with the job differences. The pay, benefits ( medical, time off, etc ) are nearly identical. 

Connecticut Job : 37.5hr base work week, M-F 8-4, pension with retirement at 63, 85% tuition reimbursements, mandatory overtime for snow work ( on - call ) from Nov 1st - May 1st, no training or certifications, limited movement in promotion, supplied tools ( poor and worn tools, will not insure personal tools )

North Carolina Job : 40hr bass work week, 4 day work week, M-T 2-12 ( 2nd shift to start ) , pension &amp; 401k 4% match with retirement at 57, 100% tuition reimbursement, no mandatory overtime, training and certifications funded and offered, movement &amp; promotion promised ( gray area ), tool allowance (personal tools insured). 

In addition to the appealable job is the cost of living, weather and people of the Charlotte area. I also believe I can conduct my small business with success with the thriving and booming economy of Charlotte. 

I’m going to school for business to either rank up with a government agency or pursue my own business opportunities, which I strongly believe would be much more successful in Charlotte area. 

I own a home in Connecticut and have lived on my own. I currently rent the home out with cash flow, and live back with my parents though to save for my next home.

I’m torn on what to do. I’ve looked at homes and visited the Charlotte area multiple times. I’ve found homes for half the cost of in Connecticut that would place myself in a country setting with area and a garage to help conduct my business, yet placing me only 30 minutes from downtown Charlotte.

I also do feel a need to venture a bit from my “hometown” , given my first house was only one town over. 

BUT my parents are in there early 70s, and while still physically able and both working.....I worry i won’t be there for them, or will regret leaving if something happens to them soon after. I do have siblings in the area, but I don’t want them “stuck” with everything if something did happen. I have a good relationship with them both enjoy me being home and I know they both rather see me stay local.

I feel immoral about leaving them, they’ve helped me so much!

264,"Okay so I need to know if I’m just crazy or I have a right to be thrown off. 

You know those movies you watch where they’re friends but grow apart before falling in love or enemies and they fall for each other? I’m basically in the middle of that movie, the part where no one has feelings yet.

It all started when I was in 1st grade and this little boy (we’ll name him Kyle) and I became best friends. Kyle liked me a lot but I didn’t like him at all in that way, however that didn’t stop us from being friends. Unfortunately, we didn’t stay close after I moved being how young we were.

But then, a few years later, I went to a new school in 4th grade and he went there too. We were on student council together until I had to move again. During the time I was there though we despised each other more then anything in the world. We could barely be in the same room without wanting to scream at each other.

Now we’re both in high school, and I told my friend this story and she tells me he goes to my school plus they’re friends. Now we’re going to be on student council together AGAIN and we have a ton of mutual friends we just never interact.

With all of that being said, my friends have a running joke that we’re “soulmates” and while idk if that’s necessarily the case the universe clearly needs us to interact for some reason. I’m not one to believe in the “universe” sending me signs but clearly there’s some reason we keep running into each other.

I’ve tried to talk to him but he avoids me and doesn’t want to talk. I want to be friends and possibly put the past behind it but he doesn’t seem interested in anything like that.

So reddit, I ask one thing. Do you think the universe is trying to send me a sign?",05Mar2020,1

266,"My gfs best friend who admitted she was bi and was pretty much in love with her last summer when we weren’t together yet is trying to break us up after a relatively serious ongoing 4 month relationship. in the beginning of the relationship this friend helped me with getting better acquainted with my gf (things she liked and shit and my insecurities when it came to my gf) it hurts because she’s manipulating my gf and isn’t allowing us to spend any time together anymore because she’s pretending to be suicidal and then gets mad at my gf when it’s time to go see me and asks/threatens harm upon herself to make her cancel our plans. My gf just doesn’t see it and I have no clue how to address it to her in a way that won’t make her completely livid with me. The thoughts that im not good enough for her or anyone or she just doesn’t care enough to simply either balance us both or just talk to me about it creep into my head every day and is affecting my mental health beyond measurement when I’m alone all I want to do is permanently check out and not wake up. it hurts so much not being able to see her since this has all started I haven’t gotten to spend any time with her and when I am able to for a short period of time before said friend calls saying she’s “in a bad place” and gf leaves. she’s always stressed but tries to be herself when we’re together and it gets more and more awkward with each time I see her. I feel like we’re growing so distant over this whole situation and it’s killing me. I’m always there for her and I care about this girl so much however im beginning to think that it may be time to break up with her and let the friend win.

268,"So I originally posted this to AITA but it occurred to me to post it here since I’m in a bit of a dilemma. I want to preface this by saying that usually I don’t think it’s right to ghost/ignore someone in normal circumstances. Being on the receiving end must suck. So I make sure I reply to any messages in a timely fashion and apologise if I forget to reply etc. 

But on to the actual post. So I (early 20s F) have this online friend (40s M) who I met through gaming. We’ve probably known each other about 6 months. I like chatting for the most part but the problem comes with the fact that he seems to get quite offended if we haven’t talked for a couple of days. It’s not my intention to ever make someone feel ignored but at the same time I have my own mental health issues I’m trying to work through and sometimes I just don’t feel like being online and want to concentrate on my studies. I have tried to explain this but the same thing happens, I’ll be offline for a couple of days and he’ll think I’m ignoring or don’t want to talk to him.  Occasionally he’ll send a message and I won’t get back to him for a day or so hence why I think he feels ignored. 

I feel conflicted because on one hand, I could put in more effort to reply/initiate conversation regularly. The fact that he gets upset/annoyed leads me to believe I’m not handling things in the best way. He is also an active participant in other groups on the platform that I’m in, and I do not want to cause any drama if I can help it. But I also need my space and don’t want to feel obligated to talk to him everytime I’m online. And I want to be able to not be online for a period without feeling guilty or having to justify myself.

274,"So  I matched with someone on Hinge that said she was looking for ""friends with benefits."" I commented on that, and we matched. She basically immediately asked if I wanted to exchange pictures and I said I wasn't comfortable with that. She then asked me to make a Kik because that's what she communicates with (or something stupid). I made one and we started talking. She asked for a face pic and then what I did for a living. I said the state I lived in and a very broad answer for my job. She asked if I wanted to exchange pics and I told her again I wasn't comfortable. 

Out of nowhere, she sent me a pic stitch of the messages with my face next to another kik conversation with a dick pic. She went on to say basically  my life is ruined unless I sent over $300. She said that she would post it to all of my local pages and university page (my hinge profile has that info even though we aren't matched anymore). I said I had proof that that conversation wasn't real and she responded the damage would be done once I send that proof out, and I would be humiliated and ruined before I could do damage control. The funny thing is, the picture of me has my kik username, and the dick pic chat has the usernames blurred out (you can actually see the last 2 letters of the blurred out name and it doesn't match mine).

282,"Hey redditors, this is officially my first attempt at a post so bare with me.

TLDR at bottom of post;

I'm co-own a Tattoo studio with my wife. She is the lead artist and CEO. I contract and work elsewhere. Wh have recently been made to move out of our space due to owners of the building changing hands.
Our shop is based in a back level area of a makers space on a loft raised half a story in the back of the primary shop
We had been sharing a lease with the primary holders over two business turnovers. The original owners were friends and were fantastic. The building was sold and they moved to a bigger space. The new owner lasted Three months and has decided to change plans. Because of this we have to find a new space. Such is the way of commerce..
Luckily after a few hiccups we have landed on two options:

Option 1:
A small store front across the road from university campus. Great main street exposure and relatively the sq.ft as our current space. It is a bit more base looking and lacking character but can be decorated and brought up to our esthetic needs, I feel the better option.
$100.00 more monthly than our current space.

Option 2
A second floor loft in another currently operating business that retails for makers and artisans in the community that has recently changed hands . Second floor. Rustic and stylish. More like our current shop. Currently it is being used for workshops but the new owner wants to bring in something more permanent. She seems to dig what we do and my wife got a good vibe.  Closer to our original shop almost exactly what we are working with currently. 
$50 a month 

We are at a deadlock deciding. I feel that we should go for the university store front and become more autonomous from others business whereas my wife likes the second space more and isn't bothered she is sharing a space again. She is going to bring our o lead artist to the spaces tomorrow to help get some insight. 

TLDR;
Does anybody have experience with subleasing spaces verses carrying a business leas on thier own? They are virtually the same size and cost.",05Mar2020,1

Now even my mom and stepfather only talk once every 6 months or so (was never the case before).

I started dating again and most people want to keep our relationship private, never inviting me out to restaurants or places where they might get recognized by others. They don't invite me to meet their friends or family.

I've worked at 5 different places in the past 4 years and at all of them other workers are very antisocial around me. Many refuse to talk to me or even acknowledge me if I say hi to them. A few others have been hostile toward me up to threats of violence, but management never takes my discrimination seriously. My current employer is celebrating womens history month and they've created a slideshow with all the women on site but they didn't include me.

294,"So I am a 14 year old male, and I have recently been thinking about living with my father. Don't get me wrong, my mom is a good parent and tries her hardest, but the circumstances don't really work out that well for both of us. So she works third shift, so that means we don't spend that much time together, and she can't get much sleep, having to sleep during the day. This also means that I have to be in online school, which can be described in one word: Painful. It sucks not being able to easily make friends, being in online school as well as an introvert/lurker combo. It nearly pushed me to suicide. She also can't afford gas to drive me to and from public school. She makes a decent amount of money, about 1200, but about $900 gets taken away by bills/expenses. Still don't know what those expenses are.

Now living with my dad wouldn't instantly fix these problems, since i'm not used to living with him, having lived with my mom all my life, but it would sure as hell improve a decent chunk of them. He lives in an area that has many more activities and is more suburban than urban, which I prefer. He also lives in my birth state, which I know like the back of my hand. He also is unemployed but looking for a job, which means he might be able to transport me to and from school with enough money to spare for other expenses, such as groceries. Now I know this sounds a little stupid, but I feel like it might relieve a bit of the burden on my moms shoulders, and allow me to spend more time with the rest of my family members in my birth state.

Now onto the problems with wanting to live with my dad. I would have to leave my boy scout troop, of which I promised I wouldn't miss as many meetups, having missed nearly every single one last year. That complicates things and would make me feel guilty about abandoning my troop and breaking a promise I want to keep. Then there's the fact that I wouldn't live with my mom anymore (obviously.) I have been close to my mom all of my life, so this is a problem. I guess you could call me a bit of a mommas boy. I get a fair bit homesick when away from my mom. I also wouldn't have the comforts of being in a familiar place, but this can be easily fixed by getting used to living with my father. And the last (and kind of big) problem. I wouldn't be able to help my mother with things such as chores.?  As you can see there would be a fair bit of guilt involved in this process. I was wondering if these are good reasons for this decision, and if I am wrong in what I am saying, as well as any help involving the listed problems with both living situations. Cheers!",05Mar2020,1

He was cute, sweet, really really chill, and i thought there was a mutual attraction between us. We have exchanged Valentine’s Day gifts and we finally met in person the week after Valentine’s Day. Not only that, we have expressed mutual interest in seeing each other again and are still keeping contact with each other.

But since the beginning of the year, she’s been ridiculously stubborn about the dumbest and simplest things. Examples include: leaving her shoes in the middle of the entryway, loudly closing the front door when entering/leaving (which I can hear all the way back to my room and literally shakes the apartment), loudly playing computer games and listening to music at the kitchen table (instead of staying in her room, where she’s always done that stuff until now), and just this week - leaving her cast iron skillet with burnt-on fish out on the stove since Monday. The few times I’ve addressed any of these, she just says “whatever, get over it. I’ll be gone soon anyway.”

Frankly, I’m fed up. The fish-skillet incident is kind of my last straw because the entire apartment smells like burnt fish now, but she doesn’t care because she works most of the week and I’m the only one who’s frequently at home.

We worry that the kittens might be harmed because of this so we risked getting scratched by the mother and relocated to a brighter location in our garden. It's just the usual place she sleeps before she give birth so we thought it would be a good location. 

Anyways on with the issue. I don't think she feel safe with us knowing her kittens location so she started hiding them in different places. The first time was under another tire and the opening was only big enough for the kittens and she couldn't get in. So she was meowing near there for like a couple of nights. We try to look what happen since the kittens were not in the locations we places so we knew something had happened but we couldn't find the kittens. But luckly on the third day we have some workers cleaning up our garden and back yard and when one removed the said tire, we found the kittens. So we place them back in the  initial spot we replaced. The mother found them and she was with them for a while. 

The next relocation was last night. Our garage door was open and have a stack if disassembled beds in a corner. She relocated her kittens there on top of the pile. Sadly since it is a stack if beds they wooden bars would have space between them and the kittens wander off into the hole and potentially hurt themselves. But the mother managed. But since we didn't know the kittens were in the Garage when night falls we close and lock the doors. While having dinner we once again we here the mother meowing again. She doesn't sound like shes asking for food but more like a worried meow. So we went and invested after dinner. After we ate, the mother was nowhere to be seen so we opened the garage and searched what's wrong and behold we see the kittens on the pile of beds between the cushions.  And so we place then BACK at the safe spot re uniting them with their mother once more. 

We don't know when the mother is going to relocate her kittens again and potentially put them in danger. I need advice on what I can do to make her trust us. Or at least feel comfortable in the location we picked for her babies.",05Mar2020,1
307,"My mother is narcissistic, and my only family. This past January I was able to get my degree in computer science. I was hoping to find a good job opportunity so I could escape living with my mother. 

Recently, my mother has become obsessed with the coronavirus outbreak. I have cancelled doctors appointments and even a job interview because she has furiously objected and threatened to make me homeless if I go. She claims I would be putting her at risk of infection if I go to these places. I can only see things getting worse from this point on given the fact the coronavirus is not going away anytime soon. 

I happen to have an interview with a great company coming up next week. I plan on going to it, and I'm almost certain that my mother is going to try to make me homeless after I leave for that interview even if I lie about where I'm going (I have to stay overnight for it). My first question is how can I protect myself from eviction given that she is likely to pull something after I leave next week? I am not paying rent in this house, and we have no contract. We live in New Jersey. I was told earlier on reddit that she would need to give me 30 days notice. However, my mother has falsified a domestic abuse claim in order to get me removed from the house immediately in the past. She dropped charges against me after I was removed from the home. I'm afraid she might do something similar again.

Next, in case there is nothing I can do to avoid being kicked out, I would like advice on what I should do in the likely case that I find myself homeless. I don't think I can really handle being homeless right now. I am not in good health, I have difficulty walking, and can't run. I wouldn't be able to hike long distances, AND I don't have a car or a license (narcissistic mother never taught me to drive). I receive $700 ish dollars a month in aid from the government due to my disability. I planned on coming off this aid when I was able to get a job. I only have about 2k in savings. Rent for a single room in my area seems to be around 800 to over 1k. I also have no credit history and a poor score, I am expecting to get a secured cc in two weeks in order to start building it.

If I can survive until I get a software job, then I should be okay. Now to complicate matters a little bit more, I do have 1 offer from an employer in mahattan NYC that would start in April. However, it's for 90k salary which barely affords a room in manhattan (and I think I would need to find a room in manhattan, I don't have a car), and with the job's contract they would essentially own me (4 month notice period required to leave....). I would also be moving into one of the most densely populated areas during a time that the outbreak is projected to become worse (I'm not nearly as afraid of corona as my mother, but it's still a realistic concern I think?). On the other hand, it would give me valuable work experience and I would be worth more in a 2 or 3 years if I took this. I was hoping that the job interview that I have next week with a more reputable company would give me a better alternative, however that job wouldn't start until June.",05Mar2020,1

311,"Right now I work a full time office job at a tech company (account management, post-sales) and although I wouldn’t say I’m in love with it I really don’t hate the field I’m in. I make good money doing it and it definitely has more flexibility than working in a more traditional job. Although it is quite stressful and demanding mentally I can’t complain as I would much rather be doing this than a lot of other jobs. 

Really my passion is photography and I have my own business doing some weddings and couples photos on weekends but I would love to focus on this more. I notice that when I put a lot of effort in I start to get bookings but it’s not something I’m able to do super consistently because I can only do about one shoot a week (which I have to put a lot of effort in to plan) and then I have to edit the photos after work and on weekends so if I make plans for the weekend or travel I don’t have enough time to keep up with it unless I sacrifice sleep or something else. 

I am moving to a new state this summer and will be receiving a bit of an inheritance that will help kick start my move.

Today my coworker (who knows I’m quitting and moving) pulled me aside and gave me some advice. He said I should focus on my photography and what I’m passionate about now and grow the business especially while I’m younger. To work a part time job and focus on my business instead of getting another job doing the same thing I do now. 

Now he’s got me thinking and I’m wondering if I should stick with my original plan which is to find a full time job in tech in that city and continue to do my photo stuff on the side , or if I should instead get a part time job that is less demanding mentally so that I can really focus on my passion.  I’ve done the math and if I book 40ish weddings or elopements a year I could be in line with my current salary but it would take a while to get to that point. 

The only thing really holding me back is money. Although I am getting the inheritance it’s not enough to live off of and I will of course still have to pay my rent and a car payment. My parents do not have a ton of money on hand so if I’m screwed there’s no one to really bail me out.

What would you do? TIA!",05Mar2020,1

I’m a Jewish girl who does normally take the Holocaust and Anti-Semitism pretty seriously, but now I realize that I get weak in the knees if a attractive male Nazi appears on the screen while watching WW2 o Holocaust documentaries/movies. The only other TV characters I’ve formed crushes on were Simba from the Lion Ling for a short period while I was young, and Diana from the 2017 Wonder Woman movie.

I also finally accepted the fact that I have a gigantic crush on Klaus Jäger from the Russian tank film T-34.

I only find him attractive in the movie as a Nazi, and have no interest in him as an Actor...

316,"I just got into my first ever car crash. I’m a seventeen year old girl. My friend who was driving and I were following our friend to go get lunch. We were on a curvy back road with lots of hills and blind spots, also very very narrow. Our friend was flying, and we were trying to catch up. Probably going forty-fifty when we should have been going 25. Stupid, I know. I wasn’t the one driving or it would have been different. I call the friend in front of us to tell him, “slow tf down, you’re going to get in a wreck,” only for my friend to scream and swerve as I finished the sentence. Ironic, I know. Anyway, she thought she was going to hit a car we met on the road so she swerved right and over corrected. Which landed us in a ditch but not before clipping a tree on my side. The only way I can describe it is how movies show it, which is depicted quite accurately. Everything was moving and suddenly it wasn’t. And the airbag deployed and bits of glass where everywhere, even in my mouth. And I couldn’t open my door so I crawled over all the glass and jumped knees first on the pavement. Our friend had turned around and came back for us. People were dialing 911. All I could do was scream fuck and latch onto the friend. The ambulance and cops came and checked us out. We were fine but still needed x rays and such to make sure. My side was crushed, I’m lucky to be alive and just dealing with some minor bruising on my chest and neck. Along with some pretty bad scrapes from the glass. I’m home now, and if just keeps replaying in my head. And I can’t stop hearing sirens. How do I get over this traumatizing event?",05Mar2020,1

I (M30) am have a really good friend Lucy, 30 We share common interests and have good time together. We also are in friends with benefits relationship. About 2 months ago we had a talk about dating but I refused saying thats not what I wanted and plus we tried already and it didt work. We dated for a month or so but it wasn't a good time for her and I felt like the relationship wasn't going anywhere. 

A week or so after the talk I went on my holidays to another country for couple of weeks. Had a good time and met a girl there, Dora. That was in December. I went back home but continued talking to Dora. In the midst of that I was still hanging with Lucy, having sex, but didnt tell her that I met someone. We talked about us though and decided to put things on hold and take a break for few months.

Few weeks ago I went back to that country for couple days to spend time with Dora and I really enjoyed it. Didn't say anything to Lucy about it.

Came back home and she messaged me that she missed me over the last few weeks and we went for few drinks ending up sleeping together.

Now, I will be going back to Dora for few days.

330,"Hi r/Advice \- 

today i was fired from an accounting job i really loved (shitty company, great people.. US Bank) due to an, ""ethics violation."" neither HR or my manager would go into detail beyond that i had recorded something on my phone (I had been joking around with some coworkers using Snapchat filters. nothing published, saved or sent) &amp; it came to the attention of HR. 

i asked about other positions i applied for within the bank (different departments) and if i would be eligible for rehire within the company, to which my HR rep would only say, ""you are welcome to apply to any job you like."" she did not comment on my standing within the company, even after asking several times. i had previously received 2 glowing yearly reviews from my management and several awards for my work. 

while my boss left to gather my things from my desk, i didn't want to speak with the HR rep, so i kept mostly silent. i was crying and visibly upset and didn't want to talk. HR rep asked me if i was ok, i said no. she asked me what i meant, and i told her, ""you just fired me, of course i'm not ok."" she continued to probe with the same question, going as far as saying, ""you seem more than a little upset,"" to which i replied, ""i lost my job. my livelihood. this is going to ruin me."" 

i have PTSD. this is in my file. she then mentions this. says she thinks i am in danger of doing, ""something."" she says if i won't, ""promise not to do something drastic,"" she won't call the police. still  crying, my boss now back in the room, HR asks me to repeat what i had told her, i say no and want to leave. she walks me outside, i hand her my things and go. on my way home, i get several calls from numbers i don't recognize, so i ignore.

i then get a call from my boss-- thinking it is her, i pick up. it's not my boss, it's HR. 

""what are you going to do when you get home? are you in danger? i need to give you these resources.""

i blow up--i told her, ""i don't mean to be disrespectful, but you just fired me. i don't want to speak to you. i don't want to receive your resources or have any more conversations with you. please stop calling me.""

cut to 20min of me being home with my roommate and the police show up to my door for a wellness check. they were told i was an active danger to myself and said i wanted to harm myself. officers were super nice, got me in touch with some local resources. bless both of em. 

&amp;#x200B;

going forward, since i have never had to do this, how do i explain my termination to a potential employer when they ask about it? my resume is updated and i've sent a couple out w/cover letters today (trying to do the best i can thru the crying) . i know i'm not the first person to be fired and recover, but any suggestions as to how to handle it with new employers would be greatly appreciated.

 “you’re fat! You eat too much. Sometimes I just wish you’d give up. Don’t eat anymore. You’ll be happier. Hungrier. But happier”

She's been suicidal in the past and has ended up in hospital, and she told me she's been depressed her whole life.

I've tried and tried to talk to her and help her understand there is light at the end of the tunnel and that shes never had the opportunity to escape the things that are causing the problems, but its hard when I personally am not doing too good either (I'm struggling to keep up the supporting boyfriend figure). So sometimes when I feel down, she thinks I just don't care about her, when in actual fact I'm just emotionally dead. I've told her I need to tell other people about it but she freaks out when I bring it up. Her family isn't there for her at all and really don't care about her mental state. And my family has just been hit with a loss of $25,000 after the coronavirus stuff (they had booked a holiday and now its 99% not going ahead and insurance doesn't cover it).

One of her main issues is her family. I'm not going into specifics, but they are toxic. She wants to move out but can't save the money because she has to pay for the vet bills for the family animals, and she also gets no finical support at all for food or necessities. 

I've told her she needs to see a professional but she doesn't have the money. And she also doesn't have the motivation since she's tried so many things, all with failure.

In my past relationship ( first relationship ) at 24 my ex was clearly still hung up on his ex but would deny it. I gave him the benefit of the doubt and in the end when we broke up he finally admitted I was there to fill a void. I was basically second best. 

This still angers me especially as I lost my virginity to him. To be honest I still haven’t forgiven myself for that. But alas I learnt a lot from that relationship about what I want. 

My current boyfriend that I met 2 years ago is great. He’s a lovely guy who has been serious with me from day one. The only thing is early on in our relationships when we spoke about our pasts he mentioned he’s had 2 girlfriends. He regrets the last one but his first girlfriend that he was with when he was younger - around 22  ( 4 years long ) he said that they were just too young at the time and that nothing went wrong. It fizzled out and that if they met when they were older things could have been different. That he was her first everything ( clearly something men seem to like ). Now I’d be lying if it didn’t bother me. It makes me actually wonder - am I second best, am I a place holder - what if she came back now that they are older &amp; more mature. To be honest these insecurities have been bothering me and I’m putting less and less effort into the relationship. 

I have brought this up to him and he’s said that he’s happy with me, and that if he wanted to stay at the time he would have stayed with her that he doesn’t think about his exes. But I’m not sure. My ex said the same things.its my biggest fear to be someone’s second best. Nor do I want to be with someone who has a soft spot for someone else.

364,"I'm 23, two years ago I graduated with a BFA from an art college under the assumption that I'd find an art related job upon graduating. That didn't happen, so I became a line cook to make ends meet. My plan was to work in restaurants to pay loans/rent and as art opportunities presented themselves I'd jump on them. Over the course of a year I worked 40+ hours a week while submitting to art shows and trying to get an art related job. Eventually the restaurant I worked at unexpectedly closed leaving the whole staff shit out of luck and I had to move back into my parents house. By this point any art opportunity that seemed promising had ultimately fallen through, and though I was accepted into a number of art shows I hadn't won any money or made any meaningful connections.

366,"tl;dr:

I was unknowingly the ""other woman"". He and I work together in a corporate environment. I have no relationship with the girlfriend and am trying to decide if my morals (values?) are strong enough to give her the information he has not (putting myself in her shoes, I would absolutely want to be told). I'm also worried about making my work environment even more uncomfortable for myself by ""ruining"" his relationship. I don't know how I would go about telling her either.

Backstory:

Last year, my coworker presumably ended a relationship with his girlfriend of three years and began seeing me not long after.

After a few weeks of going on frequent dates and sleeping over, he informs me that they've decided to get back together and so he and I stop seeing each other outside of the office. I'm somewhat annoyed with how unnecessary my involvement is, but this is fine.

A few more months go by, we end up hooking up again after a work event and I learn in this manner that they've split again.

Mere days after, he lies to me about his whereabouts at another work event, and I catch him pursuing another person we work with and lying to me about it. He has not wronged me ""technically"" but it rightfully pisses me off and I end things.

More months go by, we get drunk at another work event (a terrible pattern I have since rectify by not drinking) and sleep together. The next morning, he initiates ""the talk"" by saying we shouldn't go back to this and that we should keep our relationship professional. This is fine with me, although it's a bit surprising how quickly he's arrived at this decision.

Lo and behold, the very next day is our company party and he texts me less than hour before the start to ""warn"" me that he's bringing his ex, referring to her by name instead of labelling their relationship. I'm furious because this is completely news to me AND I know that plus ones were set weeks in advance, so there's no way this was a last minute decision. Additionally, we'll all be mingling in the same vicinity, as our team has agreed to meet up beforehand.

During the party, she continually introduces herself as his girlfriend and I'm left to feel anxious, unjustifiably guilty, and disgusted. In confronting him days after, I learn that they'd gotten back together some time ago. So... he's cheated on her and not told me of my involvement. 

It's been a few months now and he hasn't told her. I don't know what I should do.

(To pre-empt the question, I have zero desire to enter a relationship with him myself. His handling and decision making here has zapped any non-physical desire for me. The physical draw is nearly dried up for me as well, although I still find that he flirts with me while he's drunk.

My motivation here is to ensure she's not being robbed of her time, being in a relationship with someone she loves but isn't truthful with her. If after she learned of his cheating she chose to stay, I would still consider my conscience clear and close my case.)",05Mar2020,1

370,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years. Like any relationship its definitely had its downs but honestly I’d say our relationship is pretty solid other than a few troubles that are easy fixes. When we have a disagreement we talk it out, we have long conversations about random stuff, we hang out regularly and also have free time. But it really feels like there’s something missing.
And it’s him talking about our relationship, see today we had sex. I was feeling like cuddling after and I suggested we did. He didn’t have a problem with it and we cuddled. After the cuddles I was feeling happy and talkative. I asked him if he felt closer to me with cuddling because I do. I mean I see him and want to hug him tight and rub my hands all over his body. He said it makes him feel a little closer. That was it, just a little closer... it made me pull back. 

I mean he barely likes to cuddle and I get everyone’s different but he doesn’t say much about it. He doesn’t like to talk about his feelings. Like usually if we talk about something say its about a fetish I have, he’ll just ask me what he wants him to do. He doesn’t spend anytime looking up how to do the specific thing. But if it’s his fetish or even video games he’ll spend hours looking up stuff about those.
He also never tells me about how he feels about things like I’ll be talking about how much I love him and how handsome he is, he’ll be like oh you’re pretty too. Once every 4 months he’ll get a burst of it and he’ll grab me and start kissing me and telling me how pretty I am. He usually only tells me I’m pretty once a week. He’ll make sure to kiss me if he gets up to do something, or when we go to bed. But it’s different, he rarely just looks at me and tells me he loves me. I feel like I’m the one to initiate it.


It starts to feel discouraging and like he doesn’t put much effort into our relationship. I’ve tried talking to him about it and he gets confused and says he does all of the things weekly but he doesn’t, and I end up getting confused because he’ll mention things that I don’t even remember happening. Or make other point of things he does and completely ignore what I’m asking him to do more.


How do I talk to him about this? He won’t open up about his feelings and usually just asks me how to fix it. It kind of just feels like I’m the one telling him what to do and he doesn’t make any effort to do so or think about how to do it himself.",05Mar2020,1
371,"Disclaimer: I understand that for this situation everyone's knee jerk reaction is ""go to college, don't make your future life decisions based on your boyfriend"" but there are other factors to consider here.

I (17m) got into some decent schools, CSUs and Portland State, and I want to go, but I'm not fully sure if I'm ready to yet. I crave independence, and I desperately want to move out of my parent's house, but I don't handle change very well and might be too lonely leaving everyone I have ever known behind, plus I'm not super confident that my major, animation, is what I really wanna do/will make a career.

If I were to stay in town, my school has a very good community college that both of my older sisters went to then transferred, and I'm thinking maybe I could move into a house with my boyfriend and some other students in a type of commune situation. I know another group of students who go there and live in a house together like that now, it's kinda the dream. But I would be delaying the future and kinda living in a limbo/purgatory for two years, which might make me feel stuck in a rut.

Sure, I'd be putting off my future, and it would be bad to not do do something based off the fact that I don't want to leave my boyfriend, sure I might feel resentment if we break up and I didn't choose to go somewhere new, but all I know is that it's gonna hurt so much if I have to leave him.

374,"I (24F) moved into my new apartment a couple weeks ago. The lay out is like a motel- one front door is maybe 20' down from the next on a porch that lines the front of the building. Anyways, I met my neighbor, ""Dierdra"" (\~early 60s-ish), about a week or so ago. She seemed nice enough, if not a little intense. She apparently saw me coming home from getting some groceries, and popped outside as I was fiddling with my keys. Her arms were full of clif bars and the like, and she asked if I'm the new neighbor, if I like these bars, and do I want them etc, and then dropped them into one of my bags, saying that she has high blood pressure and can't have them so she needs to be rid of them. She told me her name's Dierdra, and I introduced myself and thanked her for the energy bars, saying I better get everything inside, and to have a nice day. I found the interaction a little strange but figured it was her way of welcoming me to the building or something.

Over the past week there were a couple occasions where I'd come home and then there would be knocking on my door. Being a woman and also the anxious type, I don't usually answer the door unless I'm expecting someone, especially since mine doesn't have a chain lock. So I just ignored the knocking. I remember another occasion when someone was knocking on my door, but I was still asleep so I didn't get up. I honestly get a little creeped out when someone knocks on my door randomly, so yeah, I don't enjoy that.

Then yesterday afternoon, I was cleaning a shelf that I'd just picked up from a family member, when said shelf fell over and made a bit of a ruckus. 10-15 mins later, there's knocking on my door. At that point, I was getting nervous that maybe my downstairs neighbors were coming to contend with the noise I've been making moving all my stuff in/around, so I answered. It was instead Dierdra, holding a bag with some groceries, that she put into my arms before I could even say ""Hello, to what do I owe your visit-"" or anything. She said she was wondering what ""all the banging"" was about (it really wasn't that loud of a noise) and had some food that she'd gotten from some person or program or the other that she couldn't eat and figured she'd give to me. I awkwardly thanked her for the frozen food items, opening the door a bit wider so I could explain the noise and she could see the shelf right there on the floor, then go on her way, but she'd already jumped on that opening and invited herself inside before I could say anything.

She said ""Mind shutting the door? It's pretty cold out!"" and shut the door herself, again, before I had time to say ""please no"" or even process the intrusion that was happening. So there I was standing with this strange woman inside my apartment. I had been in the middle of cleaning and getting the place ready for a couple friends to come over and see it/hangout, as I explained to Dierdra. I noted how I had quite a bit left to do to prepare for my guests and not much time left. But, she was preoccupied making comments about how I decorated the place so nicely, how different it was from the other units in the building, and so on, going so far as to give herself a little tour of my place and peek in my bedroom/bathroom while I followed her awkwardly. She talked about how her brother and another family member of hers occupy a couple other units in the building. I had given into the situation at this point and tried to satiate her by acting interested and sharing a little about myself (I talked about my own brother a bit, and what town I lived in before). I also made a little joke about how I hoped she didn't notice my bong (which was on the coffee table. She definitely saw it. I would've put it away but I had zero time to prepare for my... 'visitor'), and she said it's cool, plenty of people in the building get high, and whatever. FORTY FIVE minutes later she finally left. 

Well TODAY, after spending the day out and about with the guy I'm dating, we returned to my place. Not ten minutes later, Dierdra comes knocking on my door. I was pretty much like... okay, is this lady kidding? Wtf? And didn't answer. I had company and wasn't in the mood. She gave it two more rounds of knocking before giving up and leaving. I half expected her to yell, ""Hey!!! I know you're in there haha!"" or something, but fortunately that didn't happen. (Yet). However, when I left to get dinner with my date a couple of hours later, there was a bag stuffed full of random groceries left at my doorstep. Canned goods, oatmeal, and whatever else she decided to ""gift"" me left there to deal with. So apparently she's now made me into the person she's going to unload her unwanted groceries onto. 

I feel like she has good intentions and is kind of trying to help me out. But I find the act itself pretty odd and uncomfortable- I don't know anyone whose neighbor stops by randomly like that, let alone invites themselves into anyone's apartment to stand and talk at them for any amount of time. And I certainly do not want or need all of these groceries, 99% of which I won't eat. And even if I did want the groceries, as I have a couple friends that could use the free food, I feel like I shouldn't accept them anymore because that just invites her to continue this boundary-violating behavior, and keep pushing it further, even.

I'm hesitant to outright be an asshole at all for a couple reasons. a) She's lived in the building for a rather long time and could tell the landlord I smoke weed/otherwise violate the lease in some way. b) She could tell her family living in the building that I suck and they might do other things to mess with me, like screw with my car or confront me or whatever else. c) I just moved in and honestly I just don't want living here to be miserable. 

How can I set boundaries in a firm but gentle way? That will be less likely to lead to any of the scenarios above? I'm sure that there's something wrong with this woman mentally, be it narcissism or something else, and I don't want to be mean but I also don't want it to become my problem to deal with. I thought about leaving a note in the recent bag of groceries saying thank you, I appreciate the thought, but I don't feel comfortable accepting them and will prefer to do my own grocery shopping from now on? Or something like that? I really don't mind friendly neighborly conversation, but this is way past the line for me, and I'm completely out of my element. It's my instinct to be polite and let people step on my boundaries a little for the sake of being safe, but in this case I feel like my usual reactions are just making things worse. No one I know has anything helpful to say about it, just ""dang that IS very weird.... yikes."" Any advice would be appreciated",05Mar2020,1

But I brushed it off, it wouldn’t affect our group work... I was wrong.

 So we’re doing our group warm up, and we’re not talking to each other, so I ask questions here and there. SF finished and AM wanted to check his work with her. There was conflicting answers for one question:
(Not word for word, but summary) 
AM: “hey isn’t this supposed to be equal”
SF: “no, it’s less than... (enter some physics explanation)”
AM: “okay but I disagree, can you explain it to me” 
SF: *rolls eyes and starts to get more tense* “were you not listening to what I was saying?” 
AM: “I was, but I thought (enter more physics things) I disagree with you”
SF: “OH my God, it’s because you’re a m-“
AM: *looks over her notes* “okay I can see why you’re right, thanks” 

I’m going to guess she was going to say male, she pronounced the ‘m’ but she stopped herself. AM seemed oblivious, but I have a feeling he’s not, he’s also not trying to push her buttons, he’s trying not to instigate anything. 
Another part was when AM asked to see her work, he slid the paper towards himself and I. She kinda slid her work forwards cause I wanted to see them too. But later when it was just him reading it, she grabbed it back and said “don’t copy all of my work” but he was clearly just checking his answers with hers. 

This wasn’t the first time she shown aggression towards men. She even shoved my boyfriend out of the way when we were exiting out of the lecture hall up some stairs and loudly said Oh my God. People were astounded by her behavior, my boyfriend did nothing wrong, there was people in front of him. She never does it to females, and I can tell she has a hatred towards males, she even told me herself about  male privilege. I believe there is some, but i didn’t know she was taking it to another level to a point where she would act aggressively towards males her age group. 

How can I bring this up? Do I talk to the university or the TAs? Or how could I prevent more conflicts with AM and SF?  Or should I leave it? It’s really affecting our group work. 

Another thing, I cannot change groups unless absolutely necessary or with the professor’s permission. And I like my new group, it’s just SF isn’t liking the new group dynamic. 

I’m not sure about the culture on Reddit, but at my university, they emphasize on inclusivity and diversity of ideas which she is preventing.",05Mar2020,1

381,"This gon be a whole rant sorry but thanks if you read it. I just want to talk about what I’ve been holding in me. I don’t have much people to talk about stuff like this too, anymore I guess.

Since second semester started me and my bff don’t really hang out anymore. We only have one lecture together but it is once a week this semester. This is bc her and her BFF are always together. It use to be just the weekend, but he pretty much comes to campus every day now. She is at his house fri-mon even. He drives her to her one class 30 min away every mon/fri and back. They wake up early to do this cause he has work. Me and her do go to the gym for an hour every Thur/tue, but lately she hasn’t even been coming on Tuesdays.

I’m sick of asking her to hang out or get food, only for to say she already did or has plans with him. I’m sick of her never replying to my snaps or texts when she is with him. I’m sick of her always being on her phone with him when she is with me. Im sick of him being upset she is with me and not him. I’m sick of her being upset that he is upset when she is with me. Like wtf. I’m sick of her complaining about her health because she doesn’t sleep or take care of herself anymore. I’m tired of sitting in my car alone instead of with her between my classes.

We don’t hang out anymore and I miss her. It makes me angry she ignores me on snap so I make passive aggressive,put pretty straight to the point, comments on it. Oh and then I’m the bad guy and she ignores me even more. She broke our +200 day streak then was like oh I did that to everyone. Bitch I saw you was on snap 12 min ago. That number symbolized how many days since our last fight. 

Ugh I’m annoyed. I miss her. We tried to make grand ole plans for spring break but have not met up once and it’s almost over.

I know I need to be straightforward with her on how I feel, but I know, I know she thinks we are ok. She’ll be like omg I tried to hang with you and shit. I’m sick of always being on the blamed side. She will never admit being wrong but won’t stop to accuse me. She doesn’t take criticism well. I just don’t want to do it. 

Is it bad to say I want to see how long this will go? That makes a shit person doesn’t it. That oh I don’t really value our friendship. We’ve been friend since freshman years and she just leaves me in the dust for a guy she been dating for 4 months. 

Bruh what happened to sistas before mistas?
I know anyone would be thinking just talk to her blah blah. Ya I know.

What is other advice I could use in a situation like this? Or has anyone else been in a similar situation? Do you agree I’m a bad person?

I’ve repeatedly given him solutions and he’s done nothing to fix his “sadness” and he just beats the dead horse like his life depends on it

He had a violent outburst one day at school that hurt my girlfriend physically and he later apologized but my reasoning is he wants to keep trying to control us

From what I can tell he’s trying to be an alpha in all the wrong ways. He’s trying to manipulate my girlfriend and me and he’s trying to dominate us through fear

That’s the end of my problem. I’ll take any solutions that are offered into consideration, however I will not cut him out of my life unless other suggestions don’t work.

388,"Yesterday my dad decided to check my sister’s school grades and found out she’s failing everything, she’s in 10th grade, and decided to somehow shift the blame on me. He told me that I’m a bad influence on my sister because I’m always on my laptop and never do anything else. 

He then kept telling me I shouldn’t just care about myself academically and should care about all 3 of my other siblings. They’re all in school, like middle and high school. I’m in university. He kept saying I’m selfish and all that, that my sister is failing cuz I’m always on my laptop. But the thing that pisses me off the most is that I believe he’s been waiting so long to say that I’m not allowed to use my laptop without his permission, if I get caught using it without personal he’ll break it on my head. I bought the laptop with my own money, my parents didn’t wanna help at all. 

What upsets me is that I passed and got 2 distinctions, but either way even if I pass I’d still get punished as if I failed, it’s discouraging and makes me feel like as if I failed. My dad also said that it’s my duty as an older sister to be my sister’s tutor. He kept saying that “if I don’t care about my sister should he care about working and providing for this family? Should he just abandon us?” Name a father that will stay up all night working to provide for his family, it’s apparently only he that does that.

I also received a holiday bonus of $700 one time in 2019. How is this happening? does this sound like a mistake?

396,"Earlier today, I was talking to some my friends and we were walking around. There were 3 of my friends, I'll call them Jocelyn, Veronica and Nina.

The subject came around to the guy that I like, and he's in an older grade. I've liked him for about 9 months now (since June-July 2019) and cannot get over him. Jocelyn and Veronica knew I liked him (I'm closer to them), but Nina didn't know, so Jocelyn was telling Nina a bunch of stuff describing him to see if Nina knew him.

Suddenly when we were walking we noticed the guy I like close by, so I was like ""hey guys, let's go this way instead!"" trying to avoid him so they wouldn't do or say anything stupid. My friends noticed and Jocelyn started describing him louder to Nina. I told her to shut up and be quieter several times, and shoved her jokingly, hoping that she'd stop. She didn't. I kept telling her to be quiet because he could probably hear her. Around this time he was walking closer to us. I tried steering my friends away from him but they were still super loud and I felt like he was following us. Super weird.

I said ""guys, come on! We have to go!"" and I just ran off. After a bit, Nina came after me as she wanted to help me out (she's super nice but Jocelyn and Veronica are a bit rude, especially Jocelyn. She yells out random stuff in public because she likes the attention).

Nina told me Jocelyn and Veronica told him I like him. Apparently he nodded. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? ""i know she likes me""? The guy I like then continued to follow me a bit which is why I kept running off (with Nina following right behind me). I kept looking for a safe space to talk about it with Nina without running into the guy or Veronica or Jocelyn.

I ran into Veronica and Jocelyn a bit later, and demanded an apology. They said sorry but it was a bit insincere. I've known Veronica and Jocelyn for more than 2 years now, and I don't want to end our friendship over this, but I'm so upset that they told him behind my back.

I don't want to talk to the guy about it. I'm really bad at starting conversations and he'd probably never know if my friends didn't tell him without my consent.

Please give me some advice on what to do. At the moment I've been trying to avoid them, but I can't do that forever.

Today she came to my area and my supervisor told me to leave the trailer I was in and move to a different one and I saw her walking in. She was looking down trying to put her gloves on, so since we were in close proximity I decided to say hi. I didn't really smile or anything I just raised my hand slightly and calmly  said hey, and she looked up at me for 2 seconds and looked back down at her gloves trying to get them on and she had a close mouthed smile. But it was a quick smile it seemed and she didn't really say anything back. Its a fast paced job so I wouldn't have had a chance to strike a convo obviously. She doesn't seem shy  at all shes pretty outgoing with her friends, so... Idk. When I was on break I was leaving the bathroom, I was walking past a friend of mine and fist bumped him and as I was looking around I saw her standing by the microwave and she was turned around staring at me so I noticed and looked back and she turned back around.

401,"So I apologize if this is a long post. I also want to make it clear everything I am saying is 100% true to the best of my knowledge and I am in know way trolling or joking.

Basically about 5 years ago I used to be into fortune telling. Now I'll preface this by saying I'm heavily sceptical about things like that. I typically think they make things way too vague and honestly it's typically bs imo. However I eventually stumbled upon something that startlingly showed genuine depth and specificity.

This fortune telling technique was so in depth that I was concerned that I'd somehow been tracked. By me simply saying where and when I was born it essentially told me my entire life from start to finish. And it went into very specific detail and even told me how I would die. I was very caught off guard and hooked when it told me my past. Stating that I was going to have a lonely and painful time for the first period of my life. This was true. It got specific about my hobbies and correctly stated some that were VERY specific such as fencing. It correctly predicted which career field I would go into and was very specific about that. It knew secrets about me that I wouldn't tell most people. It was so detailed about things from past to present that when it foretold the future it had my rapt attention minus the skepticism.

And so far it foretold things that have been true. However despite me being destined to have a fairly good life there are some negatives it mentioned as well. Most of which where true. But it's the future negatives that concerned me. How can I avoid what seems to be pre written? I don't want to get a divorce. I don't want to get into a car accident. Do you think this might just become a self fulfilling prophecy? If so is there a way to stop focusing on it? Knowing my future despite the fact that it's mostly good has proven to be a blessing and a curse if you will. Apologies if what I'm saying sounds nonsensical but knowing of my impending dooms concerns me every waking minute. I'm soon to be married and the last thing I need to think of is how it's apparently destined to end before it even began.",05Mar2020,1

In Memory Of Quinner, my father and John, my grandfather.

I didn’t think I’d talk about this, but I felt like it fit somewhere on Reddit. 

This happened in third grade, which was the worst grade for me ever, while I was still a scaredy-cat. (Then again, I haven't changed much!) My dad was in horrible condition, who died the same year, and I had trouble with social interaction. 

If you need an example, once in 3rd grade, I hide under one of the picnic benches and ate my snack crying just because I did really good on a test and everyone wanted to know how I did it. 

Enter OH. (I became friends with her later, just because I'm not rude enough to deny friendship) She was kind of popular, being friends with this really nice girl, Buggy. OH, Buggy and Lia were super close, but I was only friends with Buggy and Lia.

One time, I was playing basketball, but our teacher (One of my favorite ones of all time) told us to run 3 laps. I didn't want to interact with anyone, so I set my basketball down by the garden by my class. I ran the laps with a friend, but finished faster since I left her on lap 1. (sorry Kath!) 

The second lap started with me seeing two little girls looking at my basketball. They were trying to find out who it belonged to. 

I kneeled down next to them and said, ""I'm sorry, but this is mine. Thank you for finding it though!"" 

The two girls gave it back and went back on their way. On my second lap, I couldn't find it. I asked the little girls, but neither of them had seen it. I looked everywhere, my mother paid a lot for that ball, so I didn't want to lose it. 

I see OH playing with it and I'm like, ""Okay, I'll just ask for it back.”

I have social issues, so when I asked her, I stuttered so much it was hard to understand me. 

Me: O-OH, t-that's my b-ball. M-May I-I um... Please have it back?

OH: Just give me a minute, K?

I simply nodded and waited. 

10 minutes pass, and I wonder what she meant by a minute. 

Me: Y-You said you'd give it ba-back...

OH: But I want it now!

Me: O-Okay... 

This one REALLY nice girl (who I recently found out was bisexual and had a crush on two people!) came up, swiped the ball, and handed it back to me. OH started yelling at me and her. 

Anyways, that's only my first back thing with her. Around a week later, my dad was in the hospital overnight. He had woken up in the middle of the night screaming, (he called my mother because I was forced to not live in the same house as him.) and I waited at the hospital for him along with my sister and my mother.

When I returned the next day, I acted really happy. During WOW (it’s a time where you play sports, watch others, free time basically.)  I broke into tears. My teacher was watching the track and soccer field, and I was on the blacktop which was behind her. 

Buggy comes over and starts comforting me. A few girls also come over to help me, then OH. They kept asking what’s wrong and my reply was.

Me: M-My dad...

Everyone knew my dad was in horrible condition. Since I was constantly absent, my teacher explained why I was gone every time since she knew I didn’t want people to bother me. So OH says,

OH: Please; your dad is probably alright!

I went into a crying fit. I basically couldn’t fucking breathe. Someone explained it to her, and after that’s a blur. I’m pretty sure she left or something since I didn’t see her after that. 

This doesn't really matter, but I want to mention it. Around a week before spring break, it was my dad’s birthday. I was really happy during school, and this brought a few’s attention. After school, my family went to the hospital (he had started throwing up blood a day or two before) and ate cake, talked, told stories, jokes, and bonded. This was one of the best nights of my life.

This is important though. Only a month before this, my grandfather had passed away. My mom and uncle started having fights over the will of him. My sister also felt like he had it coming though. I was basically the only one mourning him. All was hell at the moment. He lived in a nursing home, and I was super close to him. I didn't see him pass, which made me nervous about who actually cared besides me.

My worst experience with her was around spring break. It was the week (only a week after his birthday) my dad passed. He called my mother and said, ""I'm going to die today.""  and he did. How he did a large list of things, so I won't tell you.  

I was gone for two weeks. One was preparing for the funeral, the other was for my self-therapy. When I returned, I instantly regretted it. 

Lia ran up to me and said, ""Weeb, OH said while you were gone, ""When my uncle died, no one cared!"" and started crying. She also said something about how you got too much attention for your dad’s and grandfather’s death.""

To confirm, I asked four other girls and they all agreed that OH had said it. (I later in 5th grade confirmed her Uncle only nearly died.)

Bitch, what? Alright. I understand you lost your uncle and you deserve attention since he's passed. But like... The fuck? Who does this?

Anyways, I started sobbing. After school, I locked my bathroom and slept there. My mother was worried, and asked what happened. She already knew OH was a bitch, but this was too far. 

I never told my teacher until the last three days of my third grade. You know what my teacher did? She told my teacher from fourth grade about OH. 


Background of me: I hate assuming things. If someone tells me someone is rude, I hate saying I don’t like them without and context of them. Most of my opinions are from my family, so yeah. Fighting verbally makes me disturbed. I don’t want to fight, so I usually leave before I do.

As of late, I’ve been having to be more nice. I greet people in the morning, and I have no problem with that, since I enjoy doing it. More people have been talking to me, which also isn’t a problem. Still, we’re doing a project. I won’t reveal what it is, since I don’t want anyone I know personally to find out who I am. I’ll just say it takes voice recording. 

One of my group members (out of us 4) prefers the other two over me, which is fine, if she didn’t show it. If you’ve read my r/entitledkids post, you’d know this girl is named OH. She said shit about my dead dad. 

Now, here’s the other two fake names for the other members:
H/B
Y/Y
OH
And then my teacher
M/R

Now, we working on this, and she wasn’t listening to me, as I had to edit all the audio and write the entire script. Thing was, I was already going through issues with life, and I just felt stressed out. I asked for help, and got none. My group kept fooling around, or did nothing.

OH had to do something one day, and I had to do choppy lines. Thing was, she got mad at me. I couldn’t do anything else, since me and Y/Y had to meet up (which, last minute, OH and H/B suddenly said they could come, and I was so confused.) in two days, and we only had thirty minutes during two classes later.

Then, the next day, I had to do some errands for teachers, and when I returned, I said ""We have to work on Saturday, I’m really sorry."" Which I was yelled at by OH, but I didn’t know we had another hour to do it that day since I was busy. Yup, yelled at. I was on the verge of tears, and I didn’t want to get in trouble.

More context: if you have a comeback at our school, nice or not, they have a right to tell on you. So, basically, you can’t stand up for yourself. If you tell a teacher, you have a high ass chance of getting in trouble if you said a single rude thing. I did once, after having a horrible morning and night of sobbing, meaning I couldn’t do anything.

So, we worked that day, did choppy lines, and all around decent. H/B and OH had to do something else during the beginning of class. So me and Y/Y (who is really nice, shout out to her.) had this conversation.

Me: You know that H/B and OH prefer you over me, right?

Y/Y: Not true! They both care about you.

Me: Remember that one time I offered to sit with you at two seats, and someone took one, so returned back to OH and H/B and they made you sit next to them. That was also the day I had no food and starved. 

Y/Y: Oh yeah, I’m really sorry about that, but I don’t think they have anything against you.

Me: I can prove this.

Me and H/B, or in my opinion, were friends. She was nice to me, and I worked with her on a few things. But I felt horrible after what she said.

Later that day:

Me: So H/B, OH, what do you think of me?

OH: You’re an acquaintance. (She gave me a glare.)

H/B: Yeah, same here.

They also both called Y/Y their best friends. I’ve known both of them longer, yet they said that. I was going to cry, but I kind of left. 



Alright, thank you all.

Now, I never thought I’d have to make a part 3, but I do. This is getting really annoying, and I just want to be left alone.

Here’s two new people:
U/U
A/B

This is a few things, but I’m going to have to cut it short. 

Problem 1:

I read manga. Yes, I know, I like anime. I’m sorry if it offends you, but that’s just some of my personal tastes. The ones I bring to school are Assassination Classroom, Seraph Of The End, Noragami (1), One Punch Man, and The Promised Neverland.  

I have to say, some of the scenes aren’t Child-friendly. But, my teachers have confirmed that as long as no one who borrows it or I makes a huge deal out of it, I may bring to to school. 

Today, I was reading a novel, nothing too weird. Even the cover and back were fine. Now, OH came up to me and said:

OH: Your books are really inappropriate, you know that?

Me: Oh, the teachers were fine with it as long as no one made a deal out of it. Why?

OH: Because so weird. Like, why do you even like it?

Me: OH, you read my manga at the beginning of the year and loved it. 

OH: But that’s different!

Me: No, it isn’t. If it’s inappropriate, it’s inappropriate. 

Now, I don’t like to point fingers, but she was having a conversation with Y/Y and H/B and asked:

OH: Who do you think would get raped later in life?

Hypocrite.


Problem 2:

Now, this isn’t really a consistent one, but a minor one. At our school, U/U is a friend of mine. Not a best friend, but someone I enjoy talking to.

Now, U/U was giving out this book. I forget what it’s called, but it was a comic book. She gave it to A/B, and said it was his. She did asked OH if she wanted it, but A/B confirmed what he had said, and ultimately got the book.

After he finished reading it, and gave it to me. He confirmed I could have to.

Only two seconds later, OH came over and got mad at me. She told me what happened and I said that it technically belonged to A/B. OH got mad at me, and I was forced to give it to her.



Problem 3:

She told on me. 

Yep, I’m not joking with you. OH told on me for it. I don’t know what she told on me for, but it was something. I will get in trouble and get my ass burned at the stakes. 

I have no idea what to do.",05Mar2020,1

Firstly, I love what I do at work, I’m very good at it and management is very understanding and easy to work with. Sometimes it can be stressful but my supervisor always recognizes that I’ve tried my best if I miss a deadline. It’s a German company that builds industrial machinery with about 5,000 employees. The company has almost doubled in employees since I started there.

I’ve been with this company for over 8 years and for the most part they have treated me pretty well. They have a free healthy lunch every day and the “ok” healthcare is totally free for my me and my wife/kids. 

I’ve been given more than my fair share of opportunities at this company and feel I’ve exceeded expectations according to my annual evaluations every December. The eval always goes well for me. 

The problems started in December of 2018. I volunteered for an open position within the company that sparked my interest. I was granted the position, Great! 

Enter my first mistake.. I expected to abandon the responsibilities of my old role and would be able to fully focus on the new role. Not the case. It was not made clear to me until I started the new position that I would be expected to fulfill my responsibilities in the new AND old position. I now work 10-12 hours a day, Mon through Fri, to try to keep up with my workload. But still, I am constantly missing deadlines because there is no way I can complete all of my tasks.

My second mistake... I didn’t ask about a raise with the new position. I assumed since I was taking on a new role with more responsibilities, I should be compensated accordingly. After my annual evaluation and knowing that I would take on the new position(Jan 2019), I received a letter in the mail with my raise. $1.00/hr. This is a pretty standard cost of living raise for our company. As you might imagine, it was a bit of a slap in the face for me. But after my initial blood boil, my reasoning was that “Okay, maybe they just want to see my performance in the new position for 6-12 months.”

Yes, I know I should have said something right away. There was a communication problem on my end and my company’s end. But I really feel both of these conversations should have been initiated by management. Now I feel tricked into doubling my workload for the same pay rate.

Twice, before all of this, I have changed roles within this company and both times my compensation has increased fairly without a conversation. Both of those times, I was also able to abandon my previous roles and put all of my attention into the new role.

Let’s move forward to December of 2019. I have now been performing both roles for an entire year. It’s time for my annual evaluation. I have a speech prepared that I’ve been practicing for weeks; I’m going to ask for a raise for the first time. Despite my missed deadlines, my evaluation went great! I scored higher “points” than I ever have in my 8 years there. 

But when I gave my speech explaining why I deserved a substantial increase in compensation, I was told “It will happen eventually, it just can’t happen right now. It’s been a slow year for us and we don’t have the funds.” When I asked them when the funds would be available, they couldn’t give me an answer.

Understandably, it has been a slow year for the company since most of our customers are in the automotive and aerospace industry. But we still continue to hire for various positions. So I can’t imagine we are doing too terribly. 

This is my only job after college so I don’t really have any company culture to compare it to. I feel unappreciated and overworked. I feel like I’ve been duped into this situation because I assumed that it would be like the 2 times before.

So the question is, do I stay with this company for another year to see if I get a raise? Do I start looking for a new job? Was I treated unfairly? Or is this a case of greener grass syndrome?",05Mar2020,1

416,"My girlfriend whom I recently had a argument with is in a coma right now. I was not with her when the accident happened but I do know it was a traffic accident.

She lives in France but came to visit me here in the US for my birthday. She was planning to stay for around a month. We had an argument the first few days she arrived. Without mentioning the details, it was mainly who will be moving to the other's country. She left my place the following day and went to her sister's place. 

I tell myself this is why she got into the accident. As someone who's been struggling with mental health issues, this is just compiling with that. I hate myself even more than ever. I've spent a couple nights at the hospital looking over her now. Her family doesn't seem to know about the argument we've had. I feel so guilty when they're around.

417,"I’m going to be a bit vague with details. I was nervous to post this on my main account and want to remain anonymous. 

I fell madly in love with this person. We clicked so well and everything was fine until they stopped contacting me and pushed me away. I was super hurt and confused because this was a very sudden thing. 

A few weeks go by and then we get back together. They explain that bringing themselves to love someone is an extremely hard thing to do because they’re afraid to lose another person. This is due to a bad break up. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and thought we could work through it.

Nope, this began the vicious cycle of us playing cat and mouse. They would make me feel on top of the world and then pull away. I would get mad and then block them. We have been at this for almost two years now.

I keep thinking that eventually they will come around and we will live happily ever after. But in all honesty, I just don’t see it working out that way. We could have build something stable over these two years but it’s been nothing but a game of chase. 

I am exhausted of us running back and forth. I am also very verbal about my feelings on these things opposed to my love interest. I express how I feel and they bottle up everything inside and then disappear. 

What advice would you give to someone in this situation? What is a good method or way to finally say “I’m done” and hold yourself to not adding them on social media or texting? 

tldr; I’ve been playing chase with this person for almost two years now and it’s time that we finally part ways. How do I go about this and hold myself accountable?",05Mar2020,1
418,"Since around the beginning of March/April of last year, someone has been sending me hateful text messages.  I have no idea this could be and they labeled me a hoe, also constantly refer to me as such. (I think anyone can sleep with whoever they want but w/e, not the point, and no I don’t make a habit of sleeping around either.)  I knew this was serious, since they immediately start saying that they’re gonna roll up to my house (they knew my address) or wherever I worked at the time. 

I initially filed a police report and nothing came out of it, but they soon texted me again saying “fuck that police report, scary bitch,” and even somehow managed to text one of my friends, but ONLY ONCE. I find that very suspicious now, since looking back at it, she was the only person to ever receive a message. We were always theorizing about who it could be, but we never reached a solution. That was a few months ago in 2019, and I hadn’t heard anything since.

Fast forward to now. I just recently quit my job I’ve been at for nearly three years due to disagreements with management (my friend recently got a promotion to management just to note). A week later, they’re back at it again after months of silence, calling me a bum and a homeless bitch, telling me that I’m sucking d*ck to pay off my Corolla. They call me a crybaby, which I admittedly can be bc I’m very depressed and have been struggling with suicidal thoughts and the like for almost SIX years. Finally, they say that I can go have another panic attack about this message - and the panic attack comment is what sets me off. The last person to see me have a panic attack at work was the same friend/manager, the only one who’s ever been sent a message by this person ALSO, but she also hasn’t said a single word to me since I left that job, not even asking if I’m doing okay, which in terms of timing makes me very suspicious.

Now, I’m starting to feel something unpleasant settle into the forefront of my mind - it would make sense if she was the one texting me this entire time. She was the main person I spoke to about it, and always wanted me to believe it was some other girl who was texting me. I cleared the air with the girl she wanted to blame and she told me, high as hell rolling on shrooms in a bar bathroom, that she would never do that to me or waste time just texting me. It makes sense when I think about it this way, but I also have no idea what to think.

If it is my friend, I know that she already knows all the information she needs because I gave it to her. She knows she doesn’t have to actually roll up and do anything because my mind will do all the damage on its own, my anxiety is one of my greatest enemies. Now, I’m not scared to get my ass beat - I have one person I’m essentially staying alive for, and that is my mother. I don’t want her getting dragged into my mess, but I don’t even understand why this is happening. 

What should I do? Do I confront her directly, or just change my number and forget about since I don’t have concrete evidence, just a gut feeling. I’m thinking about just changing my number since I think this will essentially stop everything in its tracks.... but I can’t help but think about how easy it would be to ask a close friend of ours for my new number and continue her harassment.

Any thoughts? Am I just reaching for strings here, or are my instincts trying to protect me?",05Mar2020,1

420,"So I have a friend that sometimes says things that really piss me off.  These comments are usually sexist in nature or have sexist undertones. I know that he does this sometimes to try to get a rise out of me and I don’t want to give him that satisfaction. I would be fine ignoring him and just not giving a fuck if it was just directed toward me, but they are usually comments about women in general and how they are somehow stupid or inferior. 
Examples of comments he says are “women aren’t funny” or “blah blah blah, women can’t do this bc they’re stupid”. 
He’s a good friend otherwise, but just makes jokes like this every so often and it really bugs me.  I’m also unsure if he just says this for the sole purpose of getting a rise out of me or if he actually believes some of what he’s saying. 
What should I do to make him stop and/or get the message across that I don’t think it’s okay of him to say those things? I can’t really distance myself from him bc he’s in my friend group.",05Mar2020,1

He seems like a bit of a fuckboy and he also uses a couple swears I think of as extremely bad.

428,"Disclaimer: I guess this post makes me seem like a dick, but my feelings are quite real and excruciating, I have thought about over several weeks now.

I (M26) have been in a long term relationship (9 years) with my girlfriend and we are about to get married in a few months. My relationship with her is quite fulfilling, we share some hobbies, but have seperate interests as well, we communicate well, we have a nice apartment and are generally a good team (also in bed). She has a good job with a promising carreer in front of her and we share the same dreams, and yes sometimes we fight but it's mostly in a civilized matter. She gives me comfort and security. 

Then there's this other woman, with whom I've clicked from the first time I've met her. We have become close friends and it just feels like we are carved of the same wood. We have similar fears and worries, a similar approach to life and similar experiences during childhood.  However, she has her flaws, her carreer is not that promising and she will need to work on some personal issues. It's just that the feeling she gives me, those butterflies, they are amazing and I crave them. I know she feels the same for me but the situation is so interwebbed, that I don't know what to do.

Should I listen to my head and stay in a perfectly well functioning relationship and engage in the bonds of marriage while keeping a platonic friendship with the other girl?

Should I listen to my heart and go with the woman that I have those incredible feelings for? Which would result in losing my current partner who I love and care for on a different level, and also our entire life that we have built up together?

I know that you cannot decide for me, and I don't expect that. I'm just longing for an outside perspective on the matter that will help me reflect on the way I feel.

434,"Well, I don't know how to put this, but I'm pretty much stuck at the same point of my life, trapped if I'm being precise.
I keep praising my past-self and bashing my present-self. I have my reasons to go hard on myself. I feel like I've been fooled that I gave my everything on something that I simply lost ,without anything in return other than self-loathing and hatred left within me. I isolated myself for 3 years without any human interaction mostly. That period it felt horrible, going from a well balanced mindset to losing it completely: ie.  starting some conversation inside my head with people that either don't exist or no longer have a place in my life to have any kind of communication, until I got used to it. Gotta say that's the worst feeling one might feel. As a consequence, I doubt myself 24/7, have 0 self-confidence, yet keep thinking who I used to be, "" THAT GREAT PERSON "" you'd want to be huh.
I started talking to people again.. I did my best, any chance to talk to them I'd take it, but with my consequential anxiety and them gloating over me or something - I don't know the word for that sry - chances were pretty rare. And that made me more insecure tbh. Besides ever since whenever I talk I feel like I'm not the one who's talking,my way of forming a sentence is really strange -if I did manage to form a sentence in the first place lol -like that's not me, my words feel strange to me I don't know how to put this really.
and quite frankly I'm overwhelmed by my past-self. I've been through alot, depressed for 3 years or so, I feel empty inside and that creates an opposed feeling of anger and fear of being left out. I used to not care about other people opinions much, and have my own guidelines. But now I feel pretty lost and I can't even talk to people, or interact with them, so I just go with the flow and it hurts. I feel like I want validation from someone, I wanna be wanted again and that's pathetic. Comparing my old self to all of this, it makes me feel helpless. And seeing someone who's passionate or gets better at something, it really makes me envy them. And I hate that feeling.

I feel guilty asking for my younger siblings to stay quiet as they are all still kids and they should be able to play around and enjoy their childhood. I also take up the 'parent' role in this house since my mother is single and works all the time, leaving me to cook dinner for them, clean, advise and everything else that the role consists of. I dont mind doing so since i love my siblings and i want to help my mum out but its very exhausting and leaves me little time to study.

My mom is very kind and i understand that our situation is the way it is because our financial difficulties and i know she is trying her best so i try not to let her feel like she is to blame so i never bring up these problems to her. I just wish i could be the one taken care of instead so i could just focus on my studies properly since i really wanna do well in uni but im not sure how ):",05Mar2020,1
438,"This is a long story with a lot of exposition.  
My father had a first wife and they had two children together. After a lot of legal trouble and abuse (his first wife was the abuser and the one that caused legal trouble), they got divorced. She got custody of both their kids after claiming my dad abused them (which wasn't true). But she quickly lost custody of them and her parents took both her sons in to raise. The second son is the one that molested me later on. He got everything he wanted by throwing tantrums and was never told ""no"". Unsurprisingly, he grew up to continue throwing tantrums as an adult.  
When my dad remarried to my mother and they had me, I had limited contact with my half-brothers. I don't remember a lot about my childhood, and I've had people tell me that could be because of repressed memories. I think perhaps I was 3 or 4 when this took place, but I don't remember exactly how old I was or how long it went on. But my half-brother molested me several times. My mother found out about it and had him sent to prison. But he was still technically a minor-- in high school.  So that's not on his records as an adult.  
Flash forward to current day, he has several assaults on his record including assaulting his mother, her boyfriend, his ex-girlfriend, and one of his old bosses. He can't hold down a job. He's been diagnosed with anger management problems, Intermittent Explosive Disorder, and Bipolar Disorder. He often refuses to take his medicine for them.  
He is now married with a child, and for years I've tried to have a relationship with him. For a very long time I never had any emotion attached to the memories of what he did to me, despite them being very vivid and detailed. So I always figured I was just too young to really be affected by it. Yes, I have seen therapists and have talked to them about it. They have all said that there's no way I haven't been affected by it, and the most likely cause of me not feeling anything is because I've repressed the emotions as a coping mechanism. I never believed them when they told me, just figuring they didn't understand.  
Well, on Sunday I was going to hang out with my brother, his wife, and their kid for the day. It was supposed to be a fun day, and for the majority of the time it was. Until his mood suddenly changed and he got angry at everything. I don't want to go into too much detail because it's a lot of little things leading up to bigger things (the important things)-- those big things being the following:  
\-He made his wife cry because he verbally abuses her (he does this on a regular basis).  
\-His 6 year old daughter hurt herself because she was afraid to make him wait to safely do something.  
\-He broke his daughter's phone out of rage.  
\-His daughter had a panic attack and literally BEGGED me abandon her father in the park and drive her and her mother away from him.  
I guess for some reason he didn't understand why I would be mad about this. This isn't the first time he's done something like this before. But for some reason this made me way more upset this time than the times before. So we're currently having a huge fallout over it.  
For my entire life I have struggled with my sexuality. I have absolutely no desire to be touched. The thought of anyone being romantic or sexual with me makes me feel physically ill and afraid. I have always thought that was normal when I was a kid. The whole ""cooties"" thing didn't help. But when everyone I knew started growing up and dating people and talking about romantic and sex related things, I never left that feeling of repulsion. I'm an adult now. I've spent my life questioning what was wrong with me. I've questioned my gender and come out as transgender because my body disgusts me so much-- the thought of people touching it. I thought maybe that was the problem. Until I realized I wasn't transgender. Then I was back to square one with ""What is wrong with me?!"" I thought maybe I was asexual. But I can be aroused and... you know, all the normal stuff. I just can't stand the thought of other people touching me. So I'm not asexual.  
Then it suddenly hit me one day. I'm not okay with what happened to me as a kid. I'm REALLY not okay with it. And out of no where all the repression of those emotions about the memories went away and now I can feel everything. I'm so angry and upset and I hate myself, and I hate my brother. But I don't know if I should try to fix our relationship. A part of me wants to, but another part of me doesn't. He's not always angry and horrible, but when he is it's bad.  
I think what I'm asking is, should I convey this all to him? Should I try to fix our relationship? Should I care anymore? I love my niece to pieces, and I'm so worried about her growing up in an environment like that (No, I'm not calling CPS. I would never do that to the mother and the kid again. All CPS does anyway is give people a headache before leaving without doing anything). I want to be in my niece's life, but I don't know if I want to be in her father's life. Is that even possible?  
I know this lacks a lot of details, but there's honestly so much that I can't actually write it all down like this. But I can explain things if needed...",05Mar2020,1

441,"throwaway because I'm just frantic, paranoid, and humiliated. 

I don't know what I'm doing and I'm terrified.

I'm 22 years old. I live in my own place on money inherited from dead family members and have never had a job (yet but I'm working on it.) A year ago I met someone online who I unexpectedly fell in love with. He was supposed to come and visit me from out of state for two weeks but is now in a situation where he can't return to where he was living and is completely homeless. He's been here for a month in my apartment. I'm trying to help him secure his own housing in the area since he's disabled from breaking his back years ago. I haven't told my landlord. I don't know how or why or when I should go about putting him on my lease or if it's even the right decision. 

I don't know what the fuck I'm doing and everything is moving so fast -- a two week trip has turned into something a lot more permanent than I expected. And I really like living with him, but I don't know his entire financial history and I don't know if he can get on my lease or how much it's going to affect rent or if he's even going to be able to help me pay it, but I can't kick him out because if I do he's going to be on the street. He he has no one else. My family doesn't even know this is happening and I'm so scared and lost. I don't know what to do. I'm scared for me and for him and I'm just freaking the fuck out. I've never been involved in anything like this before. 

I'm supposed to take him to the social security office this week to inquire about disability and housing because he's literally homeless except for staying with me. But I'm told that's a long process. I can't just continue letting him stay here without my landlord knowing, but I don't think it's wise to put him on the lease yet. I don't know what the fuck I'm supposed to do and I don't know how I even got in this situation. He isn't a bad guy -- I love him, he's not trying to take advantage of me, it's just that circumstances got really twisted during his stay here. He's just in a really awful fucking spot and I want to help but I'm just petrified of what's going to happen. (And before anyone suggests it, I'm not being scammed. This is someone I know extremely well and have spoken to for a long time. The situation he's in is 100% real and I've spoken to the people involved and confirmed everything. This was not intentional and not a way for him to get a free ride through me. The agreed on plan was that he would come stay for two weeks and then go back, but things turned sour while he was there and now he can't.) 

What do I do? Where do I start? Everything is going so FAST. I feel like my life is spiraling into this bizarre, unwanted direction -- I was already lost after finishing college but now I'm extra lost. I'm so scared this shit is keeping me up at night. I'm spending entire nights crying because I feel so young and stupid and unprepared. Please help me. I'm in desperate need of guidance here. Any advice about what to do, where he can stay, how to tell my landlord or my father, possible solutions etc. Any way to make money fast would also be helpful bc I'm okay on savings but I need to start putting back in. I feel like everything is going wrong and just need someone to point me in some semblance of a direction because with my plan this undeveloped I'm freaking out.",05Mar2020,1
442,"When I first met my wife, I fell head over heels pretty much immediately. She was my dream girl. We were friends first, and it took several years for me to work up the courage to tell her how I felt. To my surprise, she reciprocated. I was overjoyed, and it felt too good to be true.

So I, being insecure, started trying to prove it was too good to be true. She was estranged from ber family and didn’t have many close friends, which was a bit of a red flag to me. I immediately started snooping through her stuff, confronting her for anything I’d find. Personal things about her past (such as childhood abuse, an abortion she’d had in high school, and a sexual assault), that she just hadn’t felt comfortable opening up to me about yet because our relationship was brand new. I called her a liar for having “hidden” them from me, and forced her to open up about them before she was ready. I also, to my shame, accused her of lying about the sexual assault, because I found a picture of her smiling with her attacker (her ex from right before me). I was jealous and often accused her of cheating. Texted an ex-hookup asking for nudes (and got caught). 

We were long-distance until she finished college. She was roommates with an ex from high school (had been friends since grade 4) with whom she was still friends, so I felt justified in my jealousy. That ex was in the midst of questioning their sexuality and gender identity, and at the time was living as a gay man (she began transitioning to female shortly after). I didn’t believe my girlfriend that her ex was actually interested in men, and therefore didn’t trust her at all. Not knowing this, she had her ex help her take some boudoir photos for me, which I consider to be infidelity. Her close friendship with that ex was extremely upsetting to me, and my wife cut contact as soon as she moved out.

Sometimes I still don’t think I have forgiven her for that. I still bring it up from time to time, doubting her. She gives me the same explanation every time, but it’s not enough to keep the thoughts away permanently. It still really hurts, and I wonder if that’s driving my subsequent behaviour.

She forgave me every time I fucked up.

Fast forward four years. We’ve moved in together and marriage is on the horizon. I didn’t have any doubts about whether I wanted to marry her. She was my One, after all. After living together for over three years, she was still initiating sex every single day, despite our opposite work schedules. I realistically had no reason to be miserable (we were struggling financially and my job was dead-end, but our lives were happy otherwise), but became depressed regardless. To an extent, I subconsciously blamed her for it, I think. Then a coworker came on to me and I had an affair for three months. My wife (then girlfriend) found out and confronted me. She did so very compassionately, and I confessed and ended the affair. But when she later started showing her hurt, asking me why I did it (I still don’t know), crying and getting upset...I got upset too and didn’t know what to do. I didn’t have answers for the questions she was asking, and I felt she couldn’t heal until I came up with *something* she would believe. She has always struggled with her self-esteem, and I told her what I thought she wanted to hear...which was how she’s inadequate, how much prettier the other woman is, better in every way. She asked me to go to therapy, to read some books...I went to one therapy session and never went back. I didn’t really do anything to make it up to her.

She forgave me and married me anyway.

Fast forward another five years. Everything’s been going really well since we got married, and we decide to have a child. She gets pregnant quickly, and we’re both very happy. But the changes in her body have made her very insecure. She stopped initiating sex because she was afraid she repulsed me. I didn’t initiate either, and put the responsibility on her for the dead bedroom. I didn’t talk to her about it at all. If I had, it would have been quickly solved. Instead, negative feelings started to grow.

After she recovered from the birth, our sex life resumed, but not as often as I (or she) would want, because we now had a child to care for. I didn’t think she was attracted to me anymore, that sex with me was a burden for her.

Sometimes she acts like she’s scared of me. I logically know it’s because of her abusive childhood, but for some reason, in the moment, it makes me feel annoyed and defensive, like she’s doing it because she thinks I’m a bad or scary person, or to manipulate me. I have never and would never hit her or yell at her. I don’t insult her. I’m extremely easygoing despite my many faults, and she has no reason to recoil and cower like she does. But expressing my annoyance with her anxiety only makes it worse. I feel like I have to walk on eggshells.

A former coworker hit on me on social media, out of the blue. I hid it from my wife at first. Until one morning, when she picked a fight because I had, in a half-asleep and state, snapped at her about a minor parenting mistake. I hadn’t meant to use a harsh tone, but I was tired and that’s unfortunately what came out. She said it hurt her feelings and she was afraid I (and others) thought she was a bad mother. I got annoyed at her and told her she was crazy to think that. After she cooled off and we both apologized, I asked for an open marriage. The timing wasn’t meant to be intentionally hurtful or manipulative. I just figured since we were already having one tough discussion, why not get it all out there. We talked about it a bit, she said no, and I said okay and wanted to move on. Nothing happened with the coworker. I didn’t continue messaging her after the initial conversation, and unfollowed her on social media after talking to my wife.

But later, my wife got really upset and said she’d hit her breaking point with me. She asked me to recall the last time I complimented her appearance, unprompted and not during sex. I couldn’t. It was probably before we got married, but she couldn’t remember either. She asked if she was a bad wife. She isn’t. She asked me when the last time I was willing to take her on a date. I couldn’t remember. It was over three years ago, while she was pregnant. She asked if I could remember the last time I bought her a gift or gave her a card for her birthday or Christmas. I couldn’t. It was before she got pregnant, four years ago.

That was a couple months ago. She started initiating sex nearly every day, solving our problem with a positive outcome. But she’s crying all the time and I know I really hurt her. She has absolutely zero self-confidence and is convinced she’s terribly ugly and stupid and worthless. (Before you ask, yes, she is in therapy.) 

The other night while I was trying to comfort her, I brought up wanting to message my old primary school crush and first love (whom I unfortunately bragged to my wife about a few times because she has a cool job and lives abroad—this makes my wife upset because she gave up her career and dreams of moving abroad to move to my hometown), to thank her for showing me what I wanted in a partner and, essentially, brag to her about my wonderful wife and kid. This made my wife even more upset. I was trying to prove that she needn’t be jealous of this person, but the way I went about that had the opposite effect. I want to comfort her, but I don’t understand how I keep making things worse. My intentions are good, but the execution of those intentions exacerbates my wife’s insecurities. I feel very frustrated with myself about this.

I’ve come to realize, through our talks about the issue, that I never acted this way in previous relationships. I’ve never thought of myself as a cheater, as someone who could hurt the person they love this much. It’s like being in a loving relationship brought out the worst in me. She’s a great wife, a great mom. I would never treat anyone so badly and I have no idea why I do these things. I want to stop. I never wanted to be this person in the first place. I just don’t know why I do this and I don’t know how to make sure I never do it again.

We get along great, rarely fight (and when we do it’s more of a serious talk than a fight), and day-to-day, our relationship is really quite harmonious. It’s just that these periodic fuck-ups really hurt my wife, and I never manage to fix it fully. I don’t handle it well when she’s sad or anxious, and it causes these occasional hurts to compound, in her mind.

I had no good role models for healthy relationships, growing up. My mother is a serial cheater, and most of my family members have been divorced. My relationship with my wife is the first and only serious relationship I have ever had. I come not from a place of malice, but of ignorance. I didn’t get the chance to learn what a healthy relationship is, as a younger man. I am trying to learn now.

If anyone has any insight that could help me understand and fix this, I welcome them with open arms. It’ll be a while before we can get into couples counselling, and I don’t want to wait that long to start working on this. 

And please don’t suggest divorce; both my wife and I love each other very much and are totally committed to working on this.

TL;DR I keep hurting my wife and I don’t know why. Please give me advice on how to stop.",05Mar2020,1

I Had a lot of dates but never felt that i would give up being alone and spend the time with a lady. 2 Month ago (Working at a Gym) we got a new co-worker. jesus christ, i never felt like that. She's amazing. First time i didnt even think about sex because i kind of respect her so much. We're going out for like 1 Month now and i made a lot of things for her. I really like her and im sure i will fall in love with her. BUT. When there wouldnt be that ""but"". She's insecure. She had a really difficult past and living since 1 year in an another country, far away from home and everything (Shes 22 btw). She has big problems showing emotions, big problems talking about what she feels (she never told me that she likes me). She will not let me help her in any form, because for her it lets her feel weak, after going through life alone. I dont know what to do, i want to keep that here short but maybe will continue in the comments. She's amazing, really and i dont want to screw this up.

445,"Hey team, first time poster here, totally baffled by a situation today. This may turn into a rant but my question is and where i need advice is “what should i do?”   
  

Some context. So i’ve been working at my current place of work for around a year and approximately six months ago a new staff member joined. We introduced ourselves, shook hands etc. All fine.   
  
Since then he has never said a word to me. I could be walking in the the room everyone will say good morning except for him, walking down a corridor will pretend im not there. Wont help me carry equipment, im sure he would if I asked but it would be awkward and he would do it begrudgingly.   
  
Ok sure he doesn’t like me as a person I can handle that, even though we have never interacted shit happens i get it. But there is no level of professional courtesy.   
  
Today I was typing an email on my phone leaning on a wall, he is walking backwards and walks straight in me, not just a bump but to the point where I stumble. Looks at me, not in the eye, just enough to know who he bumped into and walks off. Not a word.  An “oops sorry” would have been more than enough.   
  
Like what the hell, am I crazy. 

So in summary, what do i do? Is it a let it be and just mutually ignore him for the next few months we are working together or do i say something? The problems not being ignored, thats fine, low effort for me. But its just bloody rude at this point. I get along with every other staff member, even one im not too fond of we still chat, help each other etc.

446,"I am the kind of person who needs a schedule planned and laid out in front of me in order to get things done.  Improving myself feels so overwhelming.  I’ve made some significant diet changes, so that is a good start.  But I still struggle with taking care of myself.  I have depression that I am managing, but sometimes it’s hard to do simple things like shower, brush my teeth, make food, etc.  I also have a chronic bladder pain disorder...it often feels like trying to manage my bladder takes so much out of me already (if I start to get a pain flare-up, the pain is really bad, so I have a whole regiment of things I need to do to alleviate it, and I often spend 1-2 hrs on this).

Some things I’d like to improve about myself: try meditating (never tried and don’t know where to start), stretch more, get more exercise, drink more water, brush/floss regularly (this is really difficult because I often get extremely tired at night despite the fact that I get 8-9 hrs of sleep a night, and I feel too exhausted to do it), dedicate some time to myself/hobbies (instead of falling back to sitting on the couch and watching tv because the living room is the most comfortable spot, and my husband is there).  I used to have so much more free time, so I’d get a lot of exercise and get dolled up often.  Now, I feel too exhausted to dress up anymore, and it’s affecting my self-esteem.

Ok so I had a baby 5 months ago. At my 6 week postpartum check up I was prescribed taytulla birth control pills for 3 months to see how I liked it. The first few days I was dizzy a bit and had my “period” before the placebo pills all three months. I had insurance issues so I had to switch birth control pills to Loestrin fe 24. I started the new pack on time after completely finishing my last taytulla pack. I had sex 2 with my husband 2 days after starting the new birth control on time and was told by my nurse that I was still protected from pregnancy because the pills have the same active ingredients and I didn’t skip any days. But even so I was paranoid about getting pregnant. I started what I thought was my period the Thursday before the placebo pills and was thanking god I wasn’t pregnant but then the bleeding (which was more like a brown discharge) stopped after less than a day. I started having PMS symptoms nearing the placebo pills and got a cold at the same time. I was on my fourth day on sugar pills yesterday and started again with the brown discharge and it stopped before the end of the day. In the middle of the night tonight I wake up and sit up in bed to all the sudden seeing the room spinning violently and not being able to hold my vision for a few seconds. I woke up my husband and said “I’m really dizzy I’m really dizzy” he said what do you mean and I told him the room was spinning like crazy. He asked me if I got up too quickly and I said I might have... then I’m having trouble going back to sleep and I’m being careful about turning around in bed so I don’t get that dizzy again. But then I’m laying down and the room starts spinning again! I close my eyes tight and it stops but I’m low key freaking out. I’m not sure if this has to do with a cold or my birth control pills or a combination. My symptoms are cramping, low back pain, and now dizzy ness. I have no nausea or breast soreness or any other pregnancy symptoms but I’m wondering if this has happened to anyone else and if anyone thinks I might be pregnant.

And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and in person so she was probably surprised I did something in a bad way :/

456,"I babysit for a family friend quite often, one of the children (8yo) has trouble with sleeping, overactive mind and such. No big deal. But recently her parents and her have apparently started a routine of giveing her melatonin to help her sleep.

I myself started taking melatonin in middle school (12/13yo) because I couldn't sleep due to trauma. (*I by no means think this child went through some kind of trauma, she just has trouble sleeping*) My body built up a reliance on the melatonin I was taking, when I decided to stop taking it cause it wasn't helping I realized how screwed I was. Even now 8 years later I get severe episodes of insomnia that can last for months, I pretty much only sleep if I'm physically exhausted, feeling tired is a near constant state of being.

This child is starting melatonin much younger than I was and I dont want her to end up like me.

459,"Sorry it's long...

So I know I'm being crazy and my situation really doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things but I'm just finding it so hard to control my emotions at the moment and I need advice. 

A while back I stupidly got feelings for my housemate. Every day we'd go for a walk or to the pub to chat. We'd spend weekends together and he'd invite to events with his friends.

A few months later those feeling disappeared when he started dating someone and he just changed. 

He'd get aggy in the house, he stopped wanting to go to the pub and he would forget he asked me to go to things and then when I asked what the plan was he'd say he invited his girlfriend instead and would pity say I could still come. 

When she broke up with him, he went back to normal but now hes got a new girl and it's happened again. 

I know I dont want to date him but I'm finding it so hard to stay in this situation. Sometimes he can be so nice and offer to cook dinner or watch a movie and other times I can be crying my eyes out having a panic attack and when he asks if I'm okay and I say no he'll just go to bed. 

The problem is, everytime the new girl comes over I get panic attacks and so mad at myself that I cant cope. I avoid the house as much as possible but he doesnt tell me when hes seeing her so I cant always keep away. 

I believe my anxiety and panic is because I feel like I'm failing as I havent had a boyfriend in years. He almost filled this role for me until he started dating and now I just feel left behind and unwanted. In part I think I'm jealous that he wants to give his time to them and not me anymore which I know is crazy but there you go. 

He can be a good housemate though and i dont want to lose the friendship. All I want is to not be affected by his dating life anymore because I know they are irrational. 

I cant be the only person whose had this issue so any advice or insight is much needed! 

Thanks :)",05Mar2020,1
460,"I'm (30M) asking that for my sister, who is 26 and seems to be going nowhere. She also battles depression, but she's gone on and off therapy for years, and the depression somehow always comes back.

Sometimes she seems interested in things, but only for a short span of time and then she lacks the discipline to follow through or work through stuff.

She's intelligent, you can tell, she could have so much potential, but she lacks the energy, discipline or whatever you call it. The subjects she studied in uni were things she was actually interested in (such as sociology, psychology, etc) but at some point she just stops making an effort and falls into depression. 

She's currently working a minimum wage job and I'm afraid she'll work those unskilled jobs her whole life.

I tried to talk her into learning a trade, but she doesn't seem motivated to even apply for anything and look into it. 
Also, it's her decision and I can't make her do anything, she's an adult, but I worry about her.",05Mar2020,1
461,"First  of all, I am not going into work tomorrow. It's a nightmare watching  the panic buyers sweep through the store and flinching every time I hear  a cough. I work in a busy store smack in the middle of the floor. My  job is not essential, in fact I hand out food, and I have no idea why my  bosses haven't shut things down yet.

Here's  my issue: I've been having daily panic attacks, I'm off my lithium and  adderall because I read somewhere that medications which mess with the  heart can cause organ failure if you get sick. Bad decision, because  now, I'm terrified to leave the house. I'm having really bad nightmares,  and it's fucking up my sleeping, eating, and ability to think of  anything but the virus.

It's getting to the point where I've started hearing voices and feeling suicidal, but those urges come and go.

We  actually have a nice crisis center in the area that take in low income  people for a few days, give them peer counseling and therapy, and get them back on meds. TV, nice staff, they actually care, it's a great place, my  insurance covers it, and so I've been considering checking in.

After  a bad panic attack, I packed my bags, and went to call the center. But I  couldn't help feeling off. I've been taking my temperature every few  hours, and I felt like I should try again since I was at a 99\* this  morning.

I wasn't expecting the thermometer to make the 'uh oh' sound, but my heart sunk when it did.

101.0. Fuck. The treatment center doesn't accept people who are sick.

this  means that if I showed up to an ER with suicidal thoughts and a fever,  having a job working with the public and handing out food a 2 hours drive from the county  with all the cases, and also having been in that county within the past  month, I was probably going to a quarantine center.

Maybe  that's for the best, but there's no way to know if they'd have a  therapist on staff. It could make my anxiety so much worse.

So I put my clothes back and decided not to call.

My  fever broke an hour ago, but I've been coughing slightly. It's 2 in the  morning now, and the only way I got calm enough to write this was by  downing about 20mg worth of weed soda.

Should  I risk going into an ER, or should I hunker down at home and stare at  Spanish Flu documentaries for the foreseeable future until my immune  system attacks my lungs and leaves me dead in my bed? I feel fine right  now, but an hour ago I was crying my eyes out.

For context, our hospitals are swamped right now with panicked people. Unless I went into an ER at the crack of dawn, I doubt the nurses would pay me any mind. There's a hotline for the virus, and I've been trying to get a representative, but the line is clogged.  People are losing. their. shit.

I'm scared. I am paranoid. I keep imagining what a future without my parents and grandparents would look like, or what would happen if my husband died or if I had to take custody of my little siblings. What do i do? Hell, fig my family got sick while I was in isolation or a psyche ward, I'd never forgive myself for not saying goodbye! I'm freaking out.

462,"I'm a 16M and I understand that im still young.
I do have my career sorted so far, as I'm most likely getting a trade which I'm not going to announce which one. It will set me up for life. But that's not what I'm focusing on. I wanna know why my life is messed up and what to do.

So first off, I believe that I have depression of some sort. I dont know if its severe but I always brush it off. I cant talk to my dad about it as he will just say its 'teenager stuff'. Theres a few signs that I have depression and I did do some surveys online  they are saying I'm severely depressed but I highly doubt that. I'm overweight (6ft and 97kg roughly) I'd say i have some muscle but a lot of fat, and I hate my body very much. So my first question is what should I do with my mental health, as I do not want to freak my mum out since she cares too much about me. 

Secondly; I dont think I can ever get into the love life. 
I use to have crushes on girls in primary school (as everyone does) but I have started to notice no matter how much I talk to a girl (or guy, but I'm straight) I never really seem to like anyone anymore. Heck one time I sent 'ilysm' to a girl but never really felt love in my heart. She liked me and I would of asked her out. But that's besides the point. I miss the feeling of liking someone, the excitement. Idk

Over christmas she went over on an exchange trip meaning i hadnt seen or really talked her for like 3 months but when she got back eventually she told me she still had feelings for me but just didnt know what to do and being the ~~little bitch~~ nice guy i am i just said ""If you ever make up your mind i'll probably still be here"" and left it at that, that was about 2 or 3 weeks ago. Well yesterday in our Chemisty class we share she leans over to me and nonchalontly says ""I found a boyfriend"" outta nowhere. So there i am just kinda feeling broken and used.

I really dont know what I should do, personally im thinking of just blantingly saying to her that ""Im done with feeling thrown around, lead on and used"" and just ending our friendship there cause after all this time with saying that she liked me to saying she was gay then to go back and say shes confused and needed time to think it over then to just get some guy outta nowhere.",05Mar2020,1

467,"Not entirely sure where to start, so I'll just say that for most of my life I have been an extremely confident, outgoing, extroverted and humorous person. I never had any issues with myself, felt very comfortable in my own skin and never cared much about what others thought about me.

At 18 I moved out of home and in with two other friends. It's important to note that I was quickly assumed to be at the bottom of the social hierarchy within this house, I was the smallest, most short tempered and least confrontational. I didn't realise it at the time, but looking back on the situation (currently still in it), I realise that my confidence and personality has really been stripped from me. I'm unable to directly pinpoint why this is, but It scares the absolute hell out of me. I have had people tell me lately that I've changed a lot, and the tone of their voice assures me that they don't mean it in a good way.

I find some silver lining in that I think I have become a more empathic, understanding, genuinely happy and aware person but I can't seem to socialise anymore. I get too anxious and nervous. Anxious about something I may have said, anxious about what they think of me, and it kills me when people bring up the fact that I'm different.

I guess I'm just seeking some closure, if anyone has gone through this I'd love to know how to keep my chin up and continue going on, because it ruins me and sends me into depressive episodes with awful anxiety.

468,"My mom and I were inseparable when I was a child. She showed me the type of love that every young boy needs from a mother and taught me how to be compassionate and helpful in life.   She was the world to me and I was equally the world to her.

However, during my high school years, it all took a gradual turn for the worst between my mom and I. Despite being well-liked and having many friends, I felt that my opinions went unheard and suggestions often disregarded. I didn’t think it was a problem because I believed myself to be a easygoing guy. 

Then one day my friend called me out for being a pushover and a people pleaser. It cut me deep because by then I knew it was true, and with a wound like that I became very pissed. Pissed that I never truly stood up for myself and got what I wanted for a change. Pissed looking back in all the times I was disrespected and did nothing about it. I hated myself for who I was, knowing very well the real world would chew me up and spit me out with my weaknesses.

That’s when I began to notice a mirror reflection of myself in my mom. Never went to college because her dad said to get a job, sacrifices her needs for my brothers’ wants, always adopting my dad’s opinions as her own, avoiding conflict with friends at all times while the her inner conflict tore her apart. It’s fucked up but I began to look down on her, constantly snapping at her to stop helping me all the time and mind her own business, when I really just wanted her to focus on herself. That would usually end with her crying, asking why I’ve become so cold and spiteful to her. 

I’m 20 now and the rift between us only worsens. I don’t spend more than half an hour with her a day out of fear I’ll yell at her. Her memory is starting to fade and she’s only in her 50s. She’s forgetting words, names, and places while indulging more in her pleasing tendencies from fear of being useless. I need any advice to make peace with my mom and rekindle the relationship we had.

I recently got a rejection mail from a company I was really looking to work for.

I am angry - not because I got a rejection but because of the reasons and timing of their rejection. I'm about to reply to them - lashing out in a polite way, so please tell me if I have the locus standi here. The role I applied for has two components: field research work and desk research work (mainly data research, writing and some project management)

I interviewed last week - they said they were looking for someone immediately and were really keen on my profile as I have both the above mentioned components in my work experience. I had an average interview on the phone. I thought I wouldn't get to the next round because I particularly felt I had not brought out the best in me. While ending the call she said I'll most probably get an assignment to complete which will not be a make or break thing necessarily as most learning in the job happens during the job (this was said verbatim). She also said she and her colleagues would want to meet me in person since we lived in the same city.

I got two assignments to complete about 36 hours later, one was for data analysis and one for writing. It was written in the assignment that I should not be spending more 5 hours each on them since they don't want me disrupting my life for it. Writing assignment was fine. The data analysis assignment required me to write a very long code. It is not possible to complete that in 5 hours! It took me about 25-30 hours to complete that assignment. To verify I got my other friends to tell me how long they'd take and they all said that it would take them a whole week to do something like what I received.

I did my best job regardless and sent the two completed assignments. 48 hours later, I got a mail that they will not be taking forward my application. I was shocked. I thought my assignments were perfect! I asked them for feedback.

Now here's the thing: they thought I don't have much field research experience and hence it put me in a disadvantage and I won't be going ahead with other rounds. They said my assignments were perfectly done so they encouraged me to keep applying to their company. Now my problem with this entire situation is, that they could have easily rejected me in the first interview instead? Why make this call so late in the process? Why make me spend a good 35 hours doing your stupid assignments when you didn't even consider them?

My question: should I tell them that they shouldn't have made me go through the second round? Additionally, do you think I should tell them that their data assignment is not possible to complete in a matter of 5 hours, especially so because they ask people not to disrupt their daily lives doing the assignment but it very much does? Do I have the right to be angry or should I move on?",05Mar2020,1

479,"I just found out yesterday that I was promoted at my job yesterday and this is my second year in a row being promoted (they had to make an exception for me and four other colleagues in order to do this). However, I also found out that all four of these individuals got put at the exact same salary. We all started around the same time (a little under three years ago) but I know we varied between 1-4k difference in salary to start. The salary that they put us at is 10k under the 20k salary range of the title that we are being promoted to. Is it worthwhile to go back and ask to be put in that salary range or am I being greedy...

Some background: at the time we were hired they were doing mass hiring and hiring mostly fresh out of college kids and paying very low. The turnover from the time period we were hired has been extremely high and as a result they pay a decent amount more for incoming folks. For example, I know that someone that was hired last year (and they started with work experience but none relevant to the specific job) has a higher base salary than I will even after this promotion raise even though the individual is at the title that I started at (two title levels below what I’m at with this promotion).

Frankly it feels insulting that they could not put any of us even in the range of the title we are being promoted to and we are clearly the top performers in our department. They did increase our pay over the normal 10% raise amount, but it seems fishy that we all got put at the same number when we were not all at the same number to begin with. The pay raise would have been quite substantial (40-50% to get us to the bottom of the range), but I also know that recently hired individuals at this title are being brought in on the high end of the range so that also makes it feel worse.

I had a lot of issues about it, I was depressed and that got better but its still here, I have always felt like an outcast and people usually don't really treat me well. I feel like how I am is affecting every aspect of my life and I don't know what to do. I tried losing weight so many times, I even succeeded a bit but I feel like my issue is never solved. What do you think I can or should do? I currently feel very stuck, lost, mislead, cheated on, and due to some traumatic experiences from the past I end up not wanting to be anyone's friend and am distancing myself from everyone.

As a result, I have a tendency to, whenever I find that a category I consider part of my identity now contains a significant amount of people who consider it part of their identity rather than the amount of people belonging to that category being a relatively small group, want to be able to make it so all the new people *aren't* and never *were* part of that category, which is obviously not a good way of handling things.

I'm homosexual and homosexual intercourse is legally punishable and not only that but the punishment is oftenly not enforced after fair trial but by suspicion or hearsay, the mere utterance or inference of being gay or same sex attracted will put my life in danger, in some parts it is legally punished by sharia law, stoning to death. It is societally frowned upon and being physically assaulted by people due to being homosexual is not uncommon. I'd be socially outcasted, disowned and have my life in danger if I ever came out.  

My country is incredibly backwards with a culture that I find very hard to tolerate, academic degrees are arguably useless due to density and over population of the job market and overall the economy is suffering. It would take 8 years to be able to get a degree and enough experience to even be considered for employment when I move out.

 I've looked into asylum application and at this point I'm not sure if I qualify as a persecuted person since it would have to be direct persecution and I'd therefore have to be out.

I discovered about her feelings on the first day of this semester, she sat next to me in class and despite sitting next to me she wrote me a very cute and kind note saying that how much she appreciates the fact that she knows someone like me and then in the end she wrote a joke stating that I am an old man trapped in a young guy's body. I told my friends about it and they suggest that she has a major crush on me and I should give her a chance.   


To be honest I used to have a crush on her too but that was last year and now I have moved on. In fact I am not looking for a relationship anymore, never was in a relationship and I don't plan to be in one for a long time. She was the last person I had a crush on. I am so focused on improving my GPA and getting an internship, I don't have time to develop a crush on someone let alone be in a relationship with someone.

504,"On March 15th, 2016, there was a tragic ""accident"" that happened in my family. My 4 year old nephew had been beaten halfway to death by my sister's boyfriend. The doctor's also determined that he had been physically abused on numerous occasions. He was put into a medically induced coma.

He died 2 days later on my 14th birthday.

No one told me until 20 days later. I missed his funeral and have not been able to feel any sort of happiness about my birthday since.

I feel guilty that I wasn't there. I've always felt it should have been me who died. He didn't deserve what happened to him and I would've been the better choice. I have no significance to the family. I've always been a burden. I was older. It happened on my birthday. I should've been the one to die.

507,"So, this is my first time ever posting on Reddit (this is a throwaway but I have never posted or even commented on any account). I am just kind of desparate and need someplace to get a bit of support in these times and hopefully even some advice. 

    TL;DR: I have missed 2 periods but know I'm not pregnant. BF wants me to tell my mom. I am worried I (and everyone else) might find out I have an ED.

  
Firstly, I (16F) am not sure whether I have anorexia or not (I haven't been diagnosed nor have I visited a doctor). Facts are, I have lost a significant amount of weight in the last 5 months and am currently below the weight I thought was gonna be my goal. The problem (and the main reason I am posting this) is: **I have lost my period.**   
 In addition, I am often feeling cold, physically and mentally tired (hence my username for this throwaway account, - I really feel like my brain's battery is running low), people keep telling me I look sad/sick/withdrawn and I really do feel different, but I don't think I have an ED, it's probably just the stress from school and my overall mental health lately.  
 As of now, I have missed my second period and am seriously starting to worry. Before it happened, I thought my weight loss process was actually pretty healthy and I certainly wouldn't call it dangerous, maybe just a bit obsessive at most. When my period didn't come, I logically thought I was pregnant, which really freaked me out (I am sexually active with my BF but we are careful and *always* use condoms).  
 Then, two negative pregnancy tests later, I realized that *not being pregnant* actually freaks me out even more because that would mean something is seriously wrong with me.   
 So far only my BF and a few of my close friends know about the missed periods and the worries about  possible pregnancy. The struggle now is that my BF is demanding that I tell my mom about my problem and seek medical attention.  
 I know that irregularities in the menstrual cycle can be signs of big problems and are not to be ignored; I know it would be completely stupid not to pay attention to this problem and kind of pretend it's not happening.  
 **BUT** today I realized I can't bring myself to tell my mom about my problems. I am overwhelmingly scared of her thinking I may have an ED. She has asked me several times if I am eating enough and healthily. I always told her not to worry and to ease her worries I told her I am not trying to lose any more weight (altough I am). So now I'm afraid that if she takes me to the doctor, they will find out I actually *do* have an ED (I still think I don't have one but am not so sure anymore). Then there would be all the consequences - my mom would blame herself for not realizing it (which would be *awful*, she is an amazing mom), I would probably have to get treatment, I wouldn't be allowed to lose more weight and would probably end up gaining some, the thought of which terrifies me.

  
 I don't really know what to do now. I don't even know what answers I am expecting to this post - I guess I just needed to get this off my chest and if someone has any advice for me, it would make me feel a bit less alone in these never-ending worries and fears.",05Mar2020,1

A year ago one of my good friends came over one night and was having a mental breakdown...contemplating everything in their life. Particularly their SO. We ended the night on a very good note, everything was great and dandy but out of nowhere they unfollowed me on social medias. We had planned a night of drinking...responsibly the day of the incident. I texted them for about a month once a week on different social media platforms asking about the night out. Not even a read notification but of course they were active posting posts, stories,statuses, etc. A week ago they added me back since my page is public and reached out saying ""what's up?"". 

I should mention this...their SO had a thing for me before they had a thing,  but I wasnt playing ball so basically a rebound with all due respect. She had mentioned something about me not viewing their posts ,its was honestly something very petty and useless. 

What really hurt me was that I've known them since the beginning of my teenage years. So we have history. They came unannounced to my home, we ate dinner that same night...what would you guys do in a situation like this?",05Mar2020,1

512,"Just a little background I work as a custodian for a high school. I started working as a substitute custodian for 3 years. I did stopped working there and worked as an actual part-time custodian at another school but that school wasn't for me so I quit. This is back in October, I get an emailed from my boss saying if I would like to return working 20-24 hours a week for 5 days a week and I agree to it. When I agree to this position, I thought I was receiving a part-time position due to the amount of hours I work and working every weekday. He never said I was going to be part-time, I just assumed it. I did pursue him a month after I return asking when I am going to get my part-time contract. He said that it is across the street (it's where the administration office is located) and don't know why it was taking this long. I talked to other coworkers and told me to wait and see when they get their contracts to see if I get mine. Just as I expected, two weeks ago they got there contract and I did not get mine. So it confirms to me that I am still a substitute. 

I feel like I should be considered part-time with the amount of hours and days I put in. Usually my boss would ask me to come in whenever I was doing substitute work before I left, but ever since October when I came back he never asked me to come in since I agree to working 5 days a week. Also, the reason why I think I should be part-time since one of my coworkers started out part-time with the same amount of hours like I am. But she worked under a different boss. The boss I have now just recently started working there 6 years ago I think. Plus, substitutes don't get any benefits like sick or vacation days. But since I am there everyday during the week and not weekends then I should have at least some sick and vacation days but I am not part-time. My coworkers are part of the union but substitutes and part-timers cannot join it. 

Plus it doesn't help when I get put with a lot of work with my position. I am the main hallway custodian where I take care the hallways and a few stairwells. But lately a coworker has been sick for 2 months now so I got put with extra work for part of his section to take care of his hallway and stairwells in which he is normally do. My supervisor put me in charge and not the other subs who are covering his section. Plus my supervisor keeps tackling on little extra things to take care of but I literally have no time to do it. Like vacuum rugs, clean door glass, and wipe down door handles. I am only there for 4 hours a day. By the time it takes me to get done my main work (sweep the sides, use the big dust mop down the hallway, clean water fountains, take out the trash, and quickly sweep my stairwells) takes me about 3 hours to do. It leaves me the extra hour to run the machine (a floor scrubber) to any hallways that needs it which is everyday since there has been recent construction going on and the workers leave footprints in the hallway that doesn't get picked up with the bid dust mop.

I do not want to seem to complain about the work since I know there are worse jobs out there but it is just I am rushing around too much with the little time that I have. Does not help when my boss would let a specific sub work 6 hours when me and the other subs get only 4 hours a day. Grant it this specific sub doesn't work everyday like I am but still if I would work 6 hours a day then I feel I can get all my work done and the extra work I am assigned to do.

I mean this is just a job while going through college. I am studying to become an Accountant and started to post applications for paid internships around my area. It is just I do not know what to do now in my current situation. Should I quit and find a new job? Should I pursue my boss again about the contract? Should I tell my supervisor that I am being given too much work with the time I am here for? Or should I just suck it up for now and wait till I here something back from my internships? I do not want anything bad to happen but don't know if I should speak up to someone other than my coworkers about this. Grant it, my supervisor is the kind of supervisor that would get mad at us for taking a day off and gives us extra work when we get back.

521,"I know it's a popular fear out there, but I'm not actually afraid of them. I fear they will do a poor job. That's because I only met people who had experiences raging from bad to very bad.

Some examples that came to mind:

• Mom had a cavity on one of her molars. The doctor scraped off her front teeth so she'll come to fix that too.

• Dad is your ""really afraid of the dentist"" person and he always managed tooth problems himself. To be fair, he didn't have problems except maybe a random toothache. But he managed to chip a piece of one of his molars and that hurt a lot. He was afraid to go for a long time, until me and mom managed to convince him to see a dentist. By that time his molar was multiple pieces. She removed them and said that he's done, but after that his face swole and he was in incredible pain. He kept going to the dentist and she always said that he has nothing there. He had enough of no sleeping and continuous pain 3 days later so he took a pair of pliers and squeezed his inflamed gum. Pieces and puss came out, and with that the pain was gone and he's fine. You have no chance of convincing him to see a dentist ever again though.

• Classmate had a cavity, doctor wanted that tooth out along with the one before and the one after. She was terrified and the doctor keep telling her that she'll get an infection and her jaw removed if she doesn't do it. She didn't cave in thought, found anomaly dentist that helped her out (and who didn't extract any tooth).

• Sister has a crooked tooth, dentist wants to break her jaw to ""make more space for it"". It was a baby tooth that fell and the adult one grew just fine.

• I had multiple rows of baby teeth ( this happened when I was around 5) and the dentist wanted me to have braces up until 18. I said to mom there's no way and that I love my shark teeth. We kept going to different dentists and each one had another wild solution, up until this dude who just straight up told mum my adult teeth would grow fine. And they did, all my teeth are straight.

• One of my grand-grandmothers had a tooth extracted and the dude didn't sterilize his utensils, she ended up in hospital with surgery done on her neck and a lot of complications.

One thing to note, none of these were suspicious alley dentists, but we're recommend/ had a known cabinet and stuff like this. The only good experience I heard about was my aunt's, but her problems required an orthodontist not a dentist.

I managed to chip one of my molars (like dad did) last year around this time. I didn't go to any dentist because it wasn't a big deal, meaning it didn't hurt. But since then I don't chew with that side because food would accumulate there and I don't want to rot food in my tooth.

I constantly weighed options since last summer on what to do. No matter the area or the price, most dentists people I know dealt with were only looking to get expensive and unnecessary procedures done on them to get more money or didn't do their job properly. I'm afraid that my little problem of chewing food with on only one side would become way bigger if I go, but I'm also afraid it will get worse if I don't go.

Then I started worrying, yesterday over the phone he said he was gonna see a guy that night about some house investments, now I'm thinking, what if he was lying to me? What if he had a girl come over and he sent her that when she left? What if he accidentally sent that to me and not her.

529," I have had a(secret) crush on this girl I share classes with for quite some time but was always scared to talk to her. A few months ago through a mutual friend an impromptu (super random) conversation was struck but I got intimidated and left after making a humorous comment about something I can't remember except that she laughed at it.

 After that she tried approaching me a couple of times but everytime she did I left the group because of some fear I honestly can't explain. (Now I do realise this is majorly screwed up, I don't do this with other girls and have a reputation of being extremly social and specially caring with girls.) 
Post the second time she stopped approaching and started ignoring me in the same way. 
Everyday, we would have to cross each other at a common hallway and she would always have an intense and pretty scary gaze in her eyes,which further scared me into not talking things out, I really thought it would get normal but it's been quite some time and she still seems to be pretty annoyed.
As written above we share a few classes together and I have noticed her staring at me, infact a few friends have pointed it out as well, (they don't know about the above and I discredit them to stop it from spreading) but everytime I catch her she changes direction.

I honestly feel very cringey about this as it stemmed out of my immaturity and thought I should clear things out but I have absolutely no idea how. 
I added her on insta but she didn't add me back so I thought maybe my judgement was wrong, but a few more incidents occurred (it's kinda long and it would already add to a very long post that this has become, so just trust me on this)  which convinced me against it.

I asked a close friend and she said maybe the girl's attracted to me which I really don't think this is about . I do think she's angry, infact she had once told a mutual that I am very selective and have an ignoring streak in me.

 I don't want her to feel uncomfortable and if talking to her would make her feel that I wouldn't. 

What I need help is figuring out what she wants me to do, whether I should approach her and if yes how?",05Mar2020,1
530,"{M23} So my brother is getting married in June and I was given a +1 for me to bring a date/partner... Now they know I’m gay and it’s never talked about or mentioned ever and they told me straight up they love me but are not okay with it. When I proposed I bring a guy the response was “you’re going to be at the top table and he will be at a table with people he won’t know and you have duties and so you won’t get to spend much time with him” 

My brother is a fairly sound guy and 2 nights ago we went for a drive and he said maybe I should bring my friend Aoife (childhood friend). 

What’s going to be different will I not see her either?

As most of us gays have been through an internal battle discovering who we are in a world where we were told it’s not the norm this is proving to be difficult. I love her very much but also don’t want to hide again. This feels like a massive step back and now I’m contemplating not even going. Now I know it’s not my big day and it’s not about me but at the same this is my only brothers wedding and probably my parents only wedding for their 2 sons.  As big a day as this is for him it’s also a struggle for me to either show who I am or hide for yet another day and it breaks my heart..

I don’t mind letting my friends borrow my stuff and I’m all for it but everyone else gives it back. She takes forever to give things back or I have to track them down. For example if I let her borrow a top on Tuesday I’ll see her wearing it again Sunday. Or If I leave something in the living room like a jacket she’ll take it and wear it without even asking. It’s getting a little tiring having to track my things down or letting her take things when I need them because I don’t know how to say no (which is my fault).

560,"I don't know how to start with this, so I'll put it in context (first of all I want to clarify that I'm not trying to be interesting or cool, I just want to be as realistic as possible since this is driving me crazy):

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 22 years old, I consider myself really attractive and the people around me do too, since many times they complement me or tell me that when I'm on the street some girls look at me a lot.

When I was around 15, I fell in love with a girl from my class, yes, I know many of you think that at that age you don't know what love is, but I was really completely in love. I rejected all the other girls and I didn't notice any of them. I had many opportunities to have sex, but I never had the interest because I was in love with someone, and my eyes were only for her. Even without having a relationship with her, I felt that if I did something with another person, I would be betraying her.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't heard from this girl in almost a year, so I feel like I'm not in love with her anymore and I've managed to get over it. Here comes the root of my problem. 

My circle of friends are the same as when I was 15, so they think they know me a lot, but they don't. At that age we care a lot about what other people think about us, and at least in the city where I live, around that age everyone was starting to have their first kisses or even sex. The question always came up of whether we had kissed, had sex, or anything like that, and I would lie to them and say yes. Today they idolize me, because they consider me very attractive and they think that I have had a lot of success with women, when I have never kissed one. It hurts me to tell them that I lied to them and never kissed a woman, since it's wrong to lie to your friends, but that's really what worries me the least. What worries me the most is that they force themselves to find someone for me, because that's when I get anxious because I'm afraid of kissing someone and doing it wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

All the people around me have already had their experiences, but I haven't done anything with anyone and I'm ashamed to do it wrong. To this day, I keep rejecting opportunities because I'm ashamed of doing it wrong, and it bothers me because I feel like I'm wasting my time.

I feel that I should wait, enjoy myself and when the right person comes along, do it without worrying, but understand that at this age hormones are sky-high.

564,"My boss keeps dangling a flashy promotion as work incentive to get projects done. The problem is I don’t know if he’s serious, or trying to make me work harder. I’d appreciate any honest feedback/comment below if you don’t want to read everything. 

I began work at this company as a simple customer service agent. After 9 months of being a temp employee through an agency, I began seeking work elsewhere, thinking I would never be hired. This was after much promise that I will be hired permanently, with a new job title and nicer salary. 

When the day came, and advised my boss that I would like to transition to part-time, so I might balance both jobs (the one I sought and got paid more) he offered me a raise and said no I need you here full time. The raise he gave is so good it is unheard of for a customer service agent to make (over $20/hr). Given my education and work experience I do not know if I can find something better elsewhere. Keep in mind, he’s still keeping me as a temp 1099 worker with the same job title - not full time for the company. The only difference in my job title is I am now “Senior” customer service agent. Woooooo -__-  

Well, the raise came with strings attached and my boss works me ragged day in and out. My daily job duties are that of a supervisor or even department director as i’m managing all tickets, agents, making huge approvals etc.. I wouldn’t mind the extra work, but my boss speaks down to me quite often (sometimes even in an insulting manner) when presenting him with things that need his attention. Another issue is he swears he is open to suggestion but is unapproachable/impossible to try new things 99% of the time. Not to mention our company policies are all kinds of unethical and totally f*cked up but I wont get into that. 

The problem I am now facing, is he is constantly using “a carrot on a stick” and using his same tactics saying he’s considering me for a greater role with better pay (a story i’ve heard since starting). However he finds fault and finds a way to scold me almost everyday. He often says “If I’m going to consider you for this role you need to prove/not do this/handle this the opposite of what you did!” Which leads me to believe he is using this as an incentive to get important things done, keep me motivated, and make sure the company never needs to hire an actual Technical Director with a salary and benefits. 

I feel like im stuck. I want to stay because I need the pay, but couple days ago was the first time I got home literally depressed and drained. I mostly only want to stick around because I find the work to be EASY if it weren’t for his micro-management and condescending criticism. I am not the kind of person that does not handle criticism well; I would say I have the thickest skin when it comes to business. The last thing I am going to mention is this company goes through QUALITY employees like toilet paper, it is an actual revolving door. All of them leave because of him and it is well known in the office. 

I am now faced with the decision to tough it out, see what happens (if theres ACTUAL room for growth)... or, say no thanks to any future promotion. Stay comfortable with my current yearly salary and not deal with his insane management style which often involves him treating me like im his kid; meaning he can pretty much scold/ put me down when things aren’t done his way.

After some months, I started feeling too much pressure to reach ""unreachable"" standards, that my manager didn't pay attention to the things I say or even ignore it, and also makes me feel as I am insignificant and replaceable.

I've been through situations where I was considered guilty for things that weren't my fault, or questioned when I had to stay home because I was feeling ill. I haven't talked about it to my superiors because they're all friends and from the same country originally, so I basically feel outnumbered and vulnerable.

I'm definitely willing to leave this job and look for another one asap, but I'm extremely insecure because:

1) I'm an immigrant;
2) my family depends on me on my home country.

If I give notice now or soon, I'm sure my coworkers will make my life very difficult on my last month working in this company. 

Any advice about what to do or how to proceed in a situation like this will be very welcome! If any of you have similar experiences, please share with me since I'm feeling really lonely when comes to this subject.",05Mar2020,1

585,"So maybe 5 or 6 years ago, a coworker of mine (I'll call him ""Carl"") invited me to a weekly board-gaming group, while around the same time one of my husband's coworkers invited him to the same group -- which happened to be co-hosted by another former coworker of mine from my previous job. Over time, one of the two alternating hosts (neither of which was Carl) had to drop out due to a new baby, so we volunteered to start hosting every other week. We have groups on Facebook and MeWe to share info about each week's game night.

Meanwhile, Carl made life at work a living hell for a new hire who was just out of college and working her first job (I'll call her ""Cathy""), to the point where she was in tears more than once (though not in front of him). I won't get into too many specifics, but as an example, he started a false rumor that Cathy was sleeping with another coworker, just because she was friendly with him at the office. Carl is kind of a jerk in general -- not just to Cathy, but she got it worse than most of us because she was young and female and had to work with him directly.

I've become friends with Cathy and like her far better than I do Carl, despite our 20+ year age difference. She's come to our game night a few times, but one of those times Carl was there and said something that got under her skin and she had to go out to her car for a while to compose herself. Cathy has since decided that she will not attend game night if Carl is there, which I can totally understand.

Carl has since left my workplace for a different job (so Cathy is much, much happier at work now), and over the years he's rarely shown up for game night -- maybe once every few months, although sometimes he'll show up a couple weeks in a row and then not again for months. However, he will often RSVP ""maybe"" and then not show, so we never know if he will be there. Last week he posted on the FB group asking if there'd be gaming, but then didn't actually show up. And he's also often the one who posts about game night on the weeks we don't host, because the person who has recently started hosting during those alternate weeks is not on FB.

My husband proposed making a new FB group for game night and inviting everyone but Carl to join it, as a way of getting him out of the group without having to tell him directly that we think he's a jerk and we'd rather have Cathy there than him. I'm torn between my non-confrontational nature and thinking this is kind of cowardly...and also, we'd have to give the others an explanation as to why we did that. There are maybe two or three others in the group who know Carl; the rest don't know him outside of the times he's come for our game night. (I have no idea what the people who didn't know him already think of him, but he's a jerk when playing games, too -- the kind of person who plays more to screw over others than to win himself.)

The options as I see them are 1) be direct and tell Carl that Cathy won't attend if he does, since there'd be no work repercussions for her now that he's no longer there, and ask him to either quit the group voluntarily or give a more definitive RSVP; 2) do as my husband suggested and start a new group; 3) quietly remove Carl from the existing group and tell him why if he notices; or 4) leave things as they are and let Cathy decide whether she wants to come based on whether Carl RSVPs. None of them seem all that great, so I'm wondering if there's another option I'm missing. Ordinarily I'm not a fan of getting involved in other people's personality conflicts, but as I've said, I don't really like Carl either, and I'm also one of the hosts so I do have a say in who gets invited to my house.

So, Reddit - what would you do?",05Mar2020,1
587,"So a little background about me. I’m 18, I live in Illinois and attend the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, and recently started becoming sick. Some other things, my hometown is a suburb of Chicago and someone from my homework recently had to be put under quarantine for the Coronavirus. 

I started noticing I was feeling ill last Friday and had rather mild headaches and a rather mild cough. Sunday those symptoms stayed about the same, but I also started getting congested and was pretty fatigued, and since then my symptoms have gotten more and more severe to the point that last night I could barely move and yesterday I couldn’t eat like anything. Now I’ve seen tons of articles about what to do if I get the Coronavirus but I’m rather confused on what I should be doing. I can’t get an appointment at the health center on campus until next Thursday. Obviously it’s unlikely I have COVID-19 but if I do, I don’t want to be walking around my campus and being in massive lecture halls. I haven’t gone to classes since my first class on Tuesday. Should I go home and see my physician at home, who I could see as soon as Saturday? If so what should I be doing until then? I feel I may be overreacting but literally every article I’ve read has listed the exact symptoms I have, nothing more, nothing less. Please any advice is welcome, any articles you think are helpful would be greatly appreciated, and I don’t plan on going to class the next two days for rather obvious reasons. I’m just looking for some general advice here, please don’t tell me I have or don’t have the flu or Coronavirus or something because I haven’t been tested so there’s no real way to know.",05Mar2020,1
588,"Overall I would see myself as flamboyant, and I swap between being very camp and being very ""Not camp"" often, however see myself being camp most of the time. I am straight, have always been straight, but have started to question it ALOT recently because of other people thinking I'm gay, and some outright saying I am.

I honestly do not think that I am gay, or even bi for that matter, and I don't know how to feel about people mistaking me for being gay. In a way I dislike it because it makes some women I'm interested in less interested, and it makes some friends feel uncomfortable. However sometimes I like it, because it makes me feel more confident? (I have no idea why).

589,"Let me try to keep this short. A university has pulled a crazy stunt that is unethical and unlawful (open for debate should there be court proceedings). This all stemmed from problems on the university side and affected students.

Without elaborating into what the problem is (don't dig please), let us jump into the solution.

One elegant solution is to have the affected students overload modules across anywhere from 1 to 2 terms. In order to graduate on time. The overload could be anywhere from 1 extra module in that term, to 3 extra modules in that term. Because the university is liable for the damages suffered by the students, they should provide some sort of ""relief"" or ""benefits"" I dunno which is the correct term to describe it. You see, for the students to take more modules in one term brings in an element of risk. Affected grades and hence aggregate score. Some universities have a system where grades can be forgone and performance for that module not affecting aggregate score. But that applies only for electives. Over here, the modules in the course are all core modules only. So there must be some other system that will grant students some ""relief"" or ""benefit"" for taking on the extra workload. What is your suggestion?

Clarification: Students are not made to overload modules. There was a problem. The best solution to that problem is for the students to overload modules.",05Mar2020,1

594,"Context: I am a 17 year old male high school student who recently made peace with the fact of being bi. I am a bit of a dry cake, but I am 2nd best (academically) of my class and have some interesting stories to tell every once in a while. My high school is overly Christian and they like to abide by the bible, but are reasonably accepting of others. I have this one friend, let's call him, Nick. We have been on and off of the friendship train for a little while now, but recently he started chatting a lot more than he usually does with me. I like him because of the way he looks, his sense of humour and how we can talk about anything if we want to. It feels like this cycle could repeat endlessly. 

The dilemma: I have made quite a few friends over the years. Some of them know about me being, well, bi, but not all of them. One friend in particular, Nick, doesn't know. He is, accordingto him, undoubtedly straight. He's a typical jock, nerd, hybrid that is comforting to talk to, but at the same time, a bit of a brick wall. Today I found out that his parents have contacted the school for a transfer document. After I found out about this I was a bit (idk how to describe this) unhappy, sad, frustrated and moody, but I managed to press it down for a while. During our second break between periods, I casually asked him what he was doing this school holiday. He replied with, ""Moving"" , before he shrugged it off as a joke. At this point I am starting to come to terms with him moving away. But one question keeps popping up in my mind. ""Should I tell him that I like him?"" 

He is currently the first person that I would choose to be in a relationship with (even though I know he'll never want me), after a girl in my class, who I also like and get along with pretty well. It breaks me to let him go and I just want him to know what he means to me. 

Should I tell him even though I know he'll try to avoid me afterwards?",05Mar2020,1
595,"I am a new nurse who has worked in this field for a total of one year this month. I have a lot of passion for what I do and I have taken the approach of the “learner”, and work hard as wel as have a lot of humility for how much growth I have yet to do. This probably comes across cringe-y already, but it is the most honest approach that I can take for myself based on who I am. I have always had a lot of respect for this profession ever since I decided that this would be a great fit for me, and I am so interested and often overwhelmed by how much information I have to intake and process on a daily basis. Which is a huge part of the appeal. 

I have always been a pretty quite person in groups, but much to my surprise I get long great with patients and families. It’s with my fellow nurses, techs, and not to mention doctors, where I tend to struggle. I am very self-aware and understand how I come across to people. This often times makes me self-conscious when I feel like I’m not smart enough or experienced enough to answer a question or help out. I have no problem saying that I don’t know something, but I find it honestly outstanding how many other nurses (especially newer ones) never admit they are unsure of something and make excuses for why they don’t know (often pointing to some apparent dysfunctional feature of the system). 

Another work-characteristic that I’ve always had is that when I come to work, I work. I don’t spend a lot of time shooting the shit, even though I do enjoy getting to know my co-workers and get along well with most of them. But I’ve never had the gift for gab, and just naturally fit into a more task-oriented role when at work. I honesty don’t have any hidden agenda other than I just enjoy being steadily busy when I work. It makes the time go by a lot faster. 

I have noticed that one of our charge nurses has been harping on an opinion of his that I apparently “don’t ask for help enough”, which I’m honestly a bit dumbfounded on because I’m not sure how he’d really know that. Plus I constantly ask for fellow nurses opinions and do ask for help when I believe it’s appropriate. Lately this consensus that I don’t ask for help has been spreading around and people are casually saying it more. At first I thought it was just a friendly jab or maybe even a compliment to my work ethic, but last night it all really boiled
over. 

Last night was one of those nights when I just didn’t get a chance to sit down. There was something constantly happening and I was in reaction mode to it all. And honestly I was really enjoying my shift and during the shift, and in looking back, felt like I really kicked ass and gave it my best. Literally no one else had a busy assignment last night, which is fine, we all have our day. But usually the team constantly asks of you’re doing good or just jumps in and address some minor things and really has each other’s back. But last night no one would lift a finger to help for anything. If an IV was beeping, I’d get a text saying “your IV is beeping” while I’m trying to address a new altered mental status case pt who is a one-to-one. All while literally 5 nurses sit in a circle for hours just chit-chatting. 

I can block it out for the most part but then the chatter started getting directed to me that I’m “doing too much” or “God! I haven’t seen you all night, doing okay bud?”, “ask for help” while they all sit there with mocking attitudes. 

I am trying to chalk it up to a little new guy hazing or the uncertainty that comes along new people. But I do think I’m getting a reputation (which has happened before) where people see me as a “goody-two-shoes” who is trying to be nurse of the year. But the funny thing is is that I’m so humbled by what I don’t know and really try and respect everyone while just working at my own speed that’s comfortable for me. 

I don’t know, does anyone else have a similar work-mind/ethic, where you’re pleasant enough but really just want to focus on the work and do a good job? I think people will always find fault in everyone. But I think it’s so much healthier to have a approach of building people up as opposed to the, so common, break people apart tactic.

603,"Hey there again everybody, it’s Thursday and I’ve got a good bit of updates for you on my workplace situation. After his aggressive outburst yesterday, the last in a long line of outbursts, I had went home at the end of my morning shift. Keep in mind here, I am a committed employee, even after his huge outburst I finished my last hour of the shit because we had paying clients present. 

I am seldom late and if there is an emergency I am quick to notify. I’ve been consistent for 2+ years. I was in a major accident back in August of last year which left me with a broken foot, damage to my lower back (torn ligaments and the like) and severe whiplash that I needed PT treatment for. My boss made me work the whole way through and any time off I needed he would berate me for. One day when my back pain was so bad I still went in to work, he saw me and began screaming at me saying he can’t have employees in pain in his workspace. Fast forward to now, and I was seriously ill last week, and then my cat had a seizure the other night (as mentioned in my last post) calling for more time off. 

Yesterday is where it all unraveled. He came in to the office and began coming down on me for no longer being a ‘reliable employee’ and if he can’t rely on me he’ll bring someone else in. I immediately ask why he’s deciding to threaten me when I have all of these emergencies going on. He starts getting mad immediately, calling me too sensitive and immature and then begins yelling at me. As I walk away to diffuse the situation he follows me out of the office and begins getting in my face, screaming that this is ‘his shit, he can do what he wants’. I ask him why he’s screaming and he says ‘because you’re getting upset with me’. This happened 15 minutes prior to a class that’s scheduled, this time there are no clients present this early, however there have been before. 

I finish the session and leave. During this time I send him a message saying I won’t be treated that way anymore and I’m not his emotional punching bag, he replies with ‘I’m sorry you feel this way, but I have a biz to run’ word for word. He calls me later because I’m running 5 minutes late for a client, and begins going off on me about how I left him and this client hanging. I’m on my way in to work at the time of this mind you, At this point I’m still monitoring my cat who had a seizure the night before and I briefly lost track of time. 

He begins telling me he won’t apologize for wanting a reliable employee and that he’s gonna write me up and I have to decide if I want to be here or not. I simply ask him if he even feels a little bit sorry for losing his temper and screaming at me to which he retorts immediately with ‘Not one bit, not at all’ causing me to end the phone call. 

Shortly thereafter I receive a message from a client of mine saying she’s sorry to hear the news, and that she’s loved her time working with me. At this point I’ve neither said I quit nor he said I’m fired. It turns out after the phone call he decided to send me a cold and impersonal email, rather than notify me directly that I’d no longer be employed with him. After which he notified my clients of my apparent termination, and still not myself. He cites reason for termination being ‘excessive absence/chronic tardiness’. I know this is simply not a true statement, and only recently have I had real and serious issues which have prevented me from functioning at full capacity. 

Even today I have not received any actual word from him personally, even via text message that I am no longer his employee. Above all this is a shady tactic at best if it’s not illegal. 

What does everyone think? Is there anything illegal here? Any advice on where to go from here? Thanks reddit!",05Mar2020,1

Its helped his mental health and also confidence. 
But he's looking at taking the next level up, starting to consider it as a career...

Now I'm his partner and in that I REALLY want to support him, but im hearing and reading horror stories about a higher risk of Alzheimer's (already runs in his family) and brain damage over time.

615,"Preface:

I work at a large company over 1k workers but my particular specialization is very small with less than 10 people. In this tight knit group I was hired on with a coworker at the same time. She cycles through phases of being buddy-buddy and extremely passive aggressive or just outright aggressive. I’ve had multiple sit down conversations and side conversations with her about how to work better together. 

The short:

Last night after yet another occasion of my coworker becoming super passive aggressive I went home to think it all through. I wrote down instances of issues I’ve had with them and a few stuck out.

1.	During company time she used her cell phone at her desk to make a call to buy food stamps from someone. How do I know? She literally told me when I didn’t ask. Said she was getting 50 for 100 where she pays 50 and got 100 worth of food stamps. 
2.	She took a call at her desk saying: “ is the vehicle stolen? Ok are you going to help them hide it? Ok make sure you wear gloves. Whose house? Ok well take that and smash it and get rid of it.
3.	She comes in time to time either smelling of weed or asking if she smells of it. Same w/ alcohol and has even came in drunk after a 5 am bender.


I typically keep to myself and let people do their own thing but I’m thinking about reporting these things to my employer. 

I’ve talked to my manager about other complaints but left these out because I didn’t want to get her fired. Now I’m so over these cycles of aggression she has and don’t want to be surrounded by this person.

A few years ago, before I was in the picture, my bf Ryan (a personal trainer) was training a woman named Rachel. She’s in her early 20s and comes from an incredibly wealthy, important family. They became close because of the struggles they were going through. She helped him through some hard times financially and he helped her be stable and helped her through her episodes. Because of this she became completely dependent on him due to the fact she is estranged from her family and friends. She feels like she needs him to get through the day.

Fast forward to me now dating and living with Ryan. I’ve met her four times. The first time seemed perfectly pleasant. The second I was by myself in urban outfitters, I saw her and said hello. She acted very odd and then said she needed to run away, then left. Freaked me out tbh but that’s not the worst of it.  The third time I was sitting in Ryan’s office and she barges in and tells him she’s going to kill herself. He says “no you’re not, we’ve been over this” and she proceeds to go off about how he’s breaking into her apartment and moving furniture, that her parents are paying him to follow her, then gets mad they aren’t close anymore. He asks for a hug and she shoves him. He says you can’t come to my work like this and she continues on this rant until she storms out. 
The last time I saw her I was out for brunch with Ryan. It was a good day, we were happy. She apparently had seen us and she sits down at our booth. Ryan gets mad and asks her to leave and that she can’t just join us bc we didn’t invite her. She calls him an asshole and that she’s not leaving. She yells over the waitress when she tries to take our order. Rachel starts saying we have serious things to discuss, about you breaking into my apartment. To which, I respond, we will NOT be talking about this, please leave. She is really taken back I talked to her that way, gets up, punches Ryan in the arm and sprints out of the diner.

On top of these incidents, she calls him 46 times a day. Shows up at his work frequently and knows where we live. Mind you, she hasn’t shown up in a while but it is starting to affect my sleep. Whenever I try to talk to Ryan about it he gets incredibly stressed and angry because he doesn’t want to think about it. His plan is waiting her out, just ignoring her until she forgets about him. Which is why he hasn’t blocked her yet. When I suggested that he said it would make everything worse. I believe he’s really scared she’s going to hurt herself bc of anything he does. I keep suggesting the cops or a restraining order, locking her up bc she threatens to kill her self so often, but he keeps telling me it’s going to make it worse. That if he acts it’ll get bad. I’m really scared. 

I just really don’t know what to do. She’s off her meds and is getting worse. Any advice helps.",05Mar2020,1

My ex \[F18\]

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: My ex and I are on good terms again. I've been wanting to get in the dating world for some time now. I'm worried if I date my ex again I'm limiting myself on the dating experience and finding someone special.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel like this could be a common question but I don't know what to do so...

I've only ever had the one relationship and it ended about two years ago. It wasn't ended on a bad note, we were very civil about things. But we broke up because she was working through a lot of things and she had really become a different person from when we started dating that I didnt like. I also wasn't able to be there to help her because I got really sick for a while. (This is a really watered down story because it's the, not the reason I need help but it's for backstory).

I've been trying to go out on dates because I haven't been on them since we broke up. So far no success, I get ghosted by people when I ask for their number. And people I already know are too far away to go out with and don't put in the effort to have quality conversations.

Last night I was complaining about homework while we were at a meeting and she offered to help me with it that night. So she came over and we did do an assignment but then that quickly just evolved into us hanging out and talking. From that, I learned shes changed a lot and really improved herself from those years ago. She's genuinely happy, shes hanging out with a lot of people, and doing really cool things. 

I want to get back into the dating world again. My worry about getting back together with her, or at least going on dates, is that I've only had one relationship. If I do, I am not really getting experience with other relationships/ women and the steps to get there. But as of right now I am not having any success with other women and relationship building. 

I appreciate all of your help!",05Mar2020,1

626,"Posting this a second time cuz it got nothing for some reason... 


Yesterday my dad decided to check my sister’s school grades and found out she’s failing everything, she’s in 10th grade, and decided to somehow shift the blame on me. He told me that I’m a bad influence on my sister because I’m always on my laptop and never do anything else. 

He then kept telling me I shouldn’t just care about myself academically and should care about all 3 of my other siblings. They’re all in school, like middle and high school. I’m in university. He kept saying I’m selfish and all that, that my sister is failing cuz I’m always on my laptop. But the thing that pisses me off the most is that I believe he’s been waiting so long to say that I’m not allowed to use my laptop without his permission, if I get caught using it without personal he’ll break it on my head. I bought the laptop with my own money, my parents didn’t wanna help at all. 

What upsets me is that I passed and got 2 distinctions, but either way even if I pass I’d still get punished as if I failed, it’s discouraging and makes me feel like as if I failed. My dad also said that it’s my duty as an older sister to be my sister’s tutor. He kept saying that “if I don’t care about my sister should he care about working and providing for this family? Should he just abandon us?” Name a father that will stay up all night working to provide for his family, it’s apparently only he that does that. 

There’s more but I feel like this post is already so long, please please give me advice I feel emotionally drained, neglected and just I don’t know, I don’t want to be in this house anymore but there’s no moving out of the house cuz in the Arab world you have to be married to move out as a girl.",05Mar2020,1
627,"This is gonna sound a little stupid...

I recently met a nice guy online. He’s really cool, I like him so far. We were talking, and getting along pretty well, when I asked him about his favorite things and the topic of video games came up. 

I’m really poor, I can’t afford my own console let alone any games. 
But I know that like them and I play games at my friends houses often enough, so I know an okay amount about them despite that fact. 

I tell him how excited I am for the new Animal Crossing to come out. 

He asks me if I’m a switch boi, to that I respond, “Yes, definitely!!” Because I’ve played switch games before. Breath of the Wild and Pokémon Sword and Shield and Mario Kart+Party. I liked all of them. 

I told him the first game I ever played for the switch was Breath of the Wild.  
(Which, is the truth....but the way I worded it made it REALLY sound like it came with my console.) I was embarrassed and secretly hoped he wouldn’t find out. 

I ask him what games he has on his switch. He replies, then asks me what games I have on mine. 

At this point I realize I’ve dug myself into a small grave. I’m panicking. 

Do I tell him I don’t have a switch because I’m too poor to afford them and I’m a game hobo? Do I just lie and tell him the games I’ve played already?

I don’t have much time to mull things over because in the same breath, mid panic, he also asks me for my friend code for switch. 
A totally sweet, normal thing to do, 
If only I had a friend code.  

I’m caught in my own stupid lie.

So I’m at a crossroads,

Do I block him and never talk to him again so I don’t have to face the shame? 

Or fess up and tell him the embarrassing truth? That I’m too poor to afford a gaming system and I borrow my friend’s from time to time. (And possibly offer an apology for lying to him?)",05Mar2020,1

I have depression that I am managing, but sometimes it’s hard to do simple things like shower, brush my teeth, make food, etc.  I also have a chronic bladder pain disorder...it often feels like trying to manage my bladder takes so much out of me already (if I start to get a pain flare-up, the pain is really bad, so I have a whole regiment of things I need to do to alleviate it, and I often spend 1-2 hrs on this).

Some things I’d like to improve about myself: try meditating (never tried and don’t know where to start), stretch more, get more exercise, drink more water, brush/floss regularly (this is really difficult because I often get extremely tired at night despite the fact that I get 8-9 hrs of sleep a night, and I feel too exhausted to do it), dedicate some time to myself/hobbies (instead of falling back to sitting on the couch and watching tv because the living room is the most comfortable spot, and my husband is there).  I used to have so much more free time, so I’d get a lot of exercise and get dolled up often.  Now, I feel too exhausted to dress up anymore, and it’s affecting my self-esteem.

I can’t remember exactly when this first occurred but if I had to guess I’d say it was when I was around nine or eight, I am currently thirteen. Prior to that I had no issues. Along with that I have no idea what sparked it to begin with, the only thing I can think of is that my sibling used to constantly insult me about how I ate (I chewed a little loudly when I was younger but don’t anymore) but that’s it.

First of all, thank you so much for taking the time to read my concerns. Maybe what you’re about to read is dumb and doesn’t make sense and it might be a no brainer, but I feel like my anxiety fogging my good judgment 😰

I recently graduated medical school, and instantly got a 72 h/week job that pays well. But it takes me an hour to get here and another hour to get home. Also my boss is a very nasty person. She swears at everyone and puts them down in front of everybody. She complained to my other boss that “I’m too quiet and never leave my office to socialize”. But as far as I’m concerned, that shouldn’t matter if I’m doing my work. 

Also there was a comment that I wasn’t selling as much meds as the doctor that was before me. But you know, I give out prescriptions but I cannot force my patients to buy from us.. 

Two days ago, I was offered another job as a medical script, so I just have to translate clinical charts from Spanish (my native language) to English. I’d be working from home 45 hr/week, with weekends off. They’d provide the training and laptop. But I’d make about $200 less than my actual job. 

I’ve tried to convince myself that those $200 is what I’m spending in gas every month, but I still cannot make up my mind about it. 

Also, I’d feel terribly guilty of leaving this place. I’ve been working only for a month, but I’m afraid they might think I wasn’t committed enough. 

So please, help me out :(",05Mar2020,1
659,"So I am a senior in highschool and since its almost then end of the year I really need to figure out what I want to do for the rest of my life. Recently I went to a job fair and I saw a trade school that would allow me to become an electricians apprentice.
To me this sounded amazing, but to my mom not so much mainly because she really wants me to have a solid chance to become successful and college would give that to me while IBEW (the trade school) would be more of a hit or miss.

I love everything that I have been reading about electricians and what they do. It all seems exciting to me but like my mom mentioned it seems super hard to get into one of these apprenticeship trade schools. Also once I am in I have to fully commit I won't be able to mess up anything or else I will be kicked out.
This means I won't really have much ability to get any smaller education so I can have a backup plan. 

What should I do?

So here's the deal, 5 years ago I started babysitting veeeery occasionally, I got like less than 10 jobs over the course of 5 years and always to the same people. (it was like parent's meetup in a room and i'm with the kids in the other).

I'm thinking of reaching out. I made a flyer (didn't print) and a website but what will really get me going will be sharing that on facebook. (because then everyone will share with the people they know, or at least be aware).

2. I feel like I'm going to be perceived as ""the babysitter"" - and that's not a thing people usually take very seriously, especially if before it I'm seen as a museum investigator which is much more fancy and cool

669,"**1.What I was promised/told before this part time student job:**

I can work whenever I can but I have to fill in 80 hours in 3 months.I will have to pay for sanitary check up on my own ( quite a lot of money for a student like me) but they will refund me after 2 months.The pay was good and they said I must be a hard worker since the tempo was fast.

 

**2.When things started getting weird:**

Everything was okay in the first month.I worked hard and I met some nice people there.I had to leave my country for 3 weeks and I told the manager in the interview for the job that I had to do that and she said it's no problem at all since I make my own schedule and work when I can.

I came back and applied for a couple of days for the next week.I was put in that week but a few days later they put me off completely.I thought that was weird but she said schedule can change.That week passed and I applied for the next week for a few days, they didn't put me on at all.Then this week came , I applied for 4 days and I was put for tomorrow.I just got a message for them (which I find weird too) that I don't have to come tomorrow.

&amp;#x200B;

**3.What now?**  
Firstly, If this keeps happening I won't be able to fill in the 80 hours in 3 months.Also I don't like such unstable working hours , I have reasons why I work and need money.I never experienced something like this and I don't know if I did something wrong.Or if this is normal for a student part time job?They also lied about returning money for the sanitary checkup -they told me they will refund it after 2 months ( which passed ) and when I asked them about it they said that it is actually after 4 months.I heard from someone that they don't like when people don't work a lot ( which I don't get since they say students can work when they can).

I feel weird bc it was 2ish years ago and I feel like I'm over dramatizing it even though everyone, especially my therapist, is telling me I'm not. 

I went down to our school officer to ask what a report would entail, like what would happen and how it would go about etc., and he said that he had to report it after I said that, especially because most of my assaults happened in school. I dont really mind this and I understand and was ready to hear him say that but they're calling administrators, calling my parents (even though I'm 18), and contacting law enforcement. I told him what happened and he even said it was rape (I always considered it sexual assault). This is really big to me and im worried about how itll all go.

Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and in person so she was probably surprised I did something in a bad way :/

675,"I want to make it clear these people aren't narcissists, or anything like that. They are genuinely decent people who would have no problems helping us out. However I personally feel they are a bit invasive.  


They treat it like when my wife is off somehow we should be spending every waking second doing things for/with them. I'm not only NOT going to do this, my wife DOESN'T want to do this.  


Putting it into perspective: I'm in a situation where I have a 80% at  1 million dollars in a year, or 100 dollars today gaurenteed. Her family is saying its bad that I don't take the 100.  


I had the same problem with my family and I told the problem people they could get over it, directly, to their faces. My family was a bit indignant, but in my family's case they were just a constant drain with no benefit. I just stopped coming around because they would try to argue with me about time spent with them.  


The issue mainly comes from an aunt and her parents. The aunt constantly expects that my wife (and I) do what she wants us to do. As opposed to us doing what WE want to do, and will make it sound like we are being *oh such a burden* on everyone else. She barges in, acts like she knows everything, and then starts pushing her expectations on everyone. Regardless of what is actually going on. I recently lost my job and she is trying to berate my wife for the fact that I don't have a job. What she doesn't know as it isn't her business is that my wife and more importantly WE HAVE PLANS, and PARTS OF THOSE PLANS REQUIRE me to be unemployed. My wife and I have a contingency for every eventuality.   


The other thing her Aunt does is freak out over nothing: Once my wifes Father showed up and gave us stuff. We kept telling him ""We don't want this. Its not something we need."" Ect. It was mostly food products that we don't eat/like. Later we get a text from her aunt bitching about how we shouldn't go to my wifes father asking for food as thats disrespectful. When we made the situation clear, she then called it disrespectful that we didn't want to accept. I asked ""What would have been 'respectful' in your mind? What do you think we should have done?"" She then went on a rant about being older than us, and we need to 'respect' our elders. At which point I said ""I think this conversation ended when you couldn't get your own opinion straight."" She sent my wife about 50000 texts after that.  


My wifes entire family keeps making it out to be the worst thing in the world...and then advising that I do nothing but what they want me to do:  


Them:""You need to have a job.""  


Me: ""Ok I can get one out side of this city.""  


Them: ""No you need to have a job here, around us. We want to see our daughter.""  


Me: ""Thats not going to happen in my field unless I take some time off of work.""  


Them: ""Then you need to accept just whatever you can get!""  


Me: ""That would be a waste of my time. This isn't any of your business."" (Actually true)  


At this point they typically go back to arguing with my wife:

Them (to my wife): ""What are you going to do about \[bills\]?""  


Wife: ""Pay them.""  


Them: ""Yes but your husband needs to be paying part of it...""  


Wife: ""We have other plans. If he gets a job paying less than 10 an hour, its not really going to help."" (My wife makes really good money btw.)  


Usually when we get to this point they do nothing but try to 'break down' what my wife is telling them as if it makes our statements untrue. Tragically for them we ARE correct. I literally have 10-12 job offers in different citys that aren't going anywhere. Despite the fact that I helped my wife get her degree (mostly by getting her away from her family, which caused her grades to rise) they try to treat me having been unemployed for like ...a single month... as if I'm some kind of bum.  


I've rejected 99% of what they have told me directly to them, because quite frankly I just don't give a fuck. We don't \*REALLY\* need their help. The situation we are preparing for will give us lots more money in a year than if I worked now.",05Mar2020,1

687,"Hi guys, 

Hoping someone can help me find direction. Since I can remember, I've had a natural passion and talent for writing. This skill set has followed me throughout my personal life and career. I'm the first person that friends and family come to when they need help with writing anything (resumes, emails, school work, text messages, instagram captions, I mean anything). In every job I've had, writing would become a big part of my role regardless of what I was hired for. Eventually I made it my career and did freelancing for a full year. Having my own business as a professional writer was a great experience, but I gave that up in favor of a stable, full-time job with benefits. Still, writing remains a big part of what I do now in my marketing role at a news organization. 

I feel lucky that I've found a passion that is useful, but my creative side is suffering. I have plenty of opportunities to write, but don't feel like I'm doing it through my voice. I have always wanted a creative outlet to share my writing and connect with an audience. I've tried blogging multiple times, building out full websites only to come up with content that feels scattered and unexciting. I put a lot of work in over the years with nothing to show for it. I'll write a few posts and as soon as it doesn't feel right, I'll throw it away and start another website all over again.  

I'm struggling with how to present my writing in a way that feels authentic and genuine but also interesting to a reader who has never met me. Here are a few topics I've tried or considered covering:

* A bucket list of things to do before I turn 30 (I am now 31 and think that ""bucket lists"" are over done and ""turning 30"" has come and gone). 
* New Age beliefs/ideas - tarot cards, chakras, crystals, meditation, etc - I am super into this but afraid that it might be too niche and not leave enough room for other areas. 
* Music - I've taken vocal lessons for years, love to dance and JUST started piano, but I'm no expert and terrified to sing in front of people.  This could motivate me to ""face my fears"" but again I worry that it's too niche and I don't think I can come up with consistent, regular content.
* Beauty &amp; Fashion - I love makeup and beauty treatments (I do a lot of DIY stuff at home) and I have great personal style, but this area of blogging is over saturated and I don't think I can set myself apart from many other women doing the same thing. 

Those are the main areas I could come up with and nothing has stuck. Besides that, I'm happily married and we have a dog. My life is definitely good, but seems pretty fucking normal and boring. Part of me has always thought that having a blog would make life more interesting and encourage me to try new things. I just can't find my footing. 

Any advice? No idea is a bad idea. Is there anything you, as a reader would like to see more of in the blog/content space? What would be new, interesting or exciting to see a woman in her 30s doing or sharing with the world? Even if it's completely out of left field, or seems totally unfit for what I just described, if I feel inspired in any way I will run with a random suggestion. 

Thanks so much!",05Mar2020,1

I got curious and I looked through her photos, almost all of them have nasty comments about how he wants her, how beautiful she is, heart emojis. I looked at his instagram and I found no photos of said girlfriend, except for a name tagged in his bio with a heart. I go on her instagram and I see the girlfriend. They have a baby together and she’s constantly posting photos of them together, writing poems dedicating her love to him, and even little video edits of them together with her baby.

My stomach churned at the thought of something like this happening to me. What if my boyfriend went off and talked to another female like that? Compared her body to mine? Laughed off the idea of me being “jealous?” I would want someone to tell me.

I have proof, a screen recording of this guy and his comment and screenshots of comments left under this girl’s post. Before I take action, I want to know. Should I tell a complete stranger online that her boyfriend is doing this? Please tell me why or why not.",05Mar2020,1
691,"Hey everyone! My husband and I live in the United States. Husband is from NY and his 30th birthday is next Thursday. For months I’ve been planning a surprise trip to NYC for his birthday. On his actual birthday I was going to give him a binder of the itinerary and then we’d leave the next day for the weekend. My husband misses his home state a lot and I was so excited to surprise him with this. I have plans made to see all his family and friends. I know he would LOVE it.

Obviously things are getting sticky with the coronavirus now. There have been several confirmed cases in our city and there are several in NY also. Now personally, as a young healthy person, I’m not too concerned. I didn’t think my husband would be either, but to my surprise, he’s been getting pretty nervous. I tried to test the waters by making a couple comments about cheap cruise and flight prices right now, like hey we could go to Europe for super cheap! His response was basically “no thanks, I’d rather not die.” Granted I haven’t asked how he’d feel about just a domestic flight as I haven’t found a way to work that into the conversation. 

The kicker for me was today, they just announced they canceled a large event in my city that people travel from all over for. Someone tweeted about how much that sucks for the thousands of people who already paid for a trip to go. My husband sent me the tweet and said how silly it was to care about that in the face of an epidemic! I was like ummmm... I’m over here worrying about the same thing lol. 

So, should I tell him today, a week early? And let him decide if he actually wants the NY trip? Everything is paid for and non-refundable. I honestly think he will still want to go once he knows that, so I feel stupid spoiling the surprise. On the other hand, I don’t want to spring it on him last minute next week If he truly wouldn’t want to go. What should I do?",05Mar2020,1

I was supposed to have it tomorrow, and I prepared for it almost every day for over 2 months, but yesterday came and I basically had a nervous breakdown over it, and decided that I was not ready. I have not decided on a new date (which is another source of stress, because I don't know if I will need to pay some sort of ""fee"" or extra payment just to be able to set another date) but I am thinking, if possible, in December.

695,"My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 5 years. The majority of those years have been great. We live together, travel, eat great food, hang out with friends, etc. 

However, 2 years ago I got a job offer for a great position in my field. It was about 4 hours away from where we lived at the time, and he was not willing to move for my job. I couldn’t turn it down though, so I moved without him. Things became very strained and I had an emotional affair with someone we both knew. I was having serious doubts about the future of our relationship. I ended up confessing everything to him and we worked through it and moved on. My job contract ended and I moved back home to be with him. 

Pretty soon after moving back in, we packed up and moved to a different city together. We’ve lived in this city for about 9 months, but the doubt is back and stronger than before. I seriously don’t think I can picture a future together. I just don’t think it’s what I want anymore. I’ve tried to talk to him about these feelings, but he says I’d be an asshole for moving with him to a new city just to dump him. He thinks I should work through these feelings and try to make things better, but I don’t want to waste his time if I already know this is not what I want. The worst part is that I don’t have any one particular/specific reason to tell him for feeling this way.

704,"So [here](http://imgur.com/gallery/0Yx47jz) is a picture of where I normally park my van. In this picture, it's about 2-3 feet farther forward than I normally park it, but I have parked all 3 vans I've had over the past 2+ years in this spot. I park it there because my parents, brothers, and random visitors have this ridiculous habit of parking in front of me, blocking me into the driveway, and where I park prevents people from blocking me in.

So, the grass below my van is an island that the driveway circles around and goes in front of the house and that part of the driveway is where my middle brother 'Stephen' parks.

Well, Steven drives a 2016 Chevy sedan, owned and insured by my parents, and has pretty good insurance on it. My van is a 2002 Ford Windstar with liability insurance and a few other things - comprehensive, emergency road service, car rental, and 3 different specifications of uninsured motor vehicle coverage.

So, Stephen has recently threatened to hit my van. ""Sometimes, I have to leave at 5:45am and I'm tired and your van is in the way and if I'm careless and I hit it, it's your fault and I'm not going to deal with insurance. Dad's not capable of adapting, and if he hits your van, it's you're dumb enough to park it where it's in the way."" This is typical of Stephen. He degraded and bullies people into doing what he wants them to do. If my van has been in the same spot for 2+ years and it hasn't been an issue until 3 weeks ago (while it's been in the exact same spot it's always been), I honestly don't see how where it's parked could be an issue beyond people wanting to control and manipulate.

I have parked my van in this spot for 2+ years, every single time I'm at the house, and I live in this house and it's parked there almost every single night. My dad drives like a stampeding bull, going as fast as he can. He goes 60mph on a 30mph road with hills, he goes 60-80 on a main road in town that's 40mph, even though most people go 45-50mph. He's a speed demon who believes that the right way to drive is to get on the gas so hard that the tachometer jumps up to 4,000rpm, and to get on the breaks really hard. Yet somehow, he miraculously (/s) manages to make a 6 foot wide vehicle go through a 12 foot wide area in the driveway that the UPS truck can get through without any issue. The distance between the front of my van is wider than the part of the driveway  that goes to the road.

My brothers and parents are not the type of people who let something go on for a long time without saying something. They're outspoken.

Any advice on what I should do in this situation?",05Mar2020,1
707,"Please help. I just moved with my brother and dad to a new house, and there are 2 bedrooms + a master. My mom and dad are divorced but my mom still comes and spends weeks (months) at a time living with us. Since she doesn't have her own bedroom, she sleeps in the master with my dad. The problem is,

(A) they are dysfunctional and codependent. My mom is a narcissist and my dad is really passive aggressive. They fight loudly and bicker  and yell all day and night (LOUDLY!) My bedroom shares a wall with their bathroom so I can hear them shouting and arguing so clearly... it's like they are in the same room with me - the walls are thin. Worse, it echoes off the tiling. When they walk their heels make loud BOOM BOOM BOOM noises on the cheap tile floor. 

(B) Worse still, they keep erratic, random schedules as neither of them have worked in years. They routinely stay up making noise until 2:00 or 3:00 am. They get up in the night to go downstairs and make food. This involves noxious, fried smells which fill the house, and bright hallway lights that flood my room. But mostly, there's a constant lack of *peace*. 

I need to get up for work at 7:30 am. They always keep me up to 1:00 - 3:00 am, then sleep in. Last night/today I am sick with a fever, and they kept me up until 2:30. I woke up early and they are still happily in bed (10:00 am). :'(

Worse still, there is a yappy dog that lives next door - MY room is the only one that faces the problem house - and there's a doggy door in the side yard right below my window (I am on the 2nd floor). The dog runs outside and bursts into fits of barking at absolutely random times of night! Yesterday, after I was lying sick in bed and finally fell asleep (finished with my parents' nightly BS), the stupid thing woke me at 5:00 am! So between that damn animal and my selfish parents, I got maybe five hours of sleep, with an interruption in the middle. 

I wore earplugs for hours last night but finally it just hurt my ears too much. I have a Google home mini and play white noise, rain, relaxing sounds, etc. but it doesn't work. I have tried talking to my parents about it but they are extremely dismissive and have argued that I must be hearing noise coming from somewhere besides their room (again, my mom is a narcissist and my dad is such a pu$$y that he will never argue with her! That's why she's allowed in the house to begin with, despite her having divorced him). 

I am at my wit's end. I would LOVE to move out, but I live in LA so the rent is like $1000/month for a closet, and my job is cutting hours so I can barely pay my bills even while living here. I recently got hired at a much better paying job but last minute they had to rescind the offer due to a ""hiring freeze.""

I lent an acquaintance £20 last month because I knew she was in a tight spot. She told me she’d pay me back in the beginning of March, when her parents deposited money into her bank account again (we’re uni students who do not have jobs at the moment). But I forgot to text her my bank details that day and haven’t done so since.

Anyway, it’s 5 March already and she hasn’t contacted me about the £20 she owes me. 

How can I ask her for it w/o being awkward about it? Should I just text her my bank details and be like, “here’s my info for the £20”  ?

712,"  Im a 21 year old guy who’s normally very quiet and can look/be nervous when I go to appointments with this lady job advisor who's about 32 years old and for example when I get up to go from the end of an appointment she would say ‘awwww’ (like rrrrrrr) before saying bye (maybe as a gap filler) and I sometimes say thanks very much out of habit before she says it does so idk. 


Little things like when I say hello She blanks me and just says ‘how’s your job search going’ quietly and moodily. but when I Didn’t look up to her once at the start of an appointment to  say hello she got  really moody and looked kinda sad/moody about it so idk what to. Then ever since I did that: 


A few months later When I told her about the company I got the bar job interview for myself she looked a bit surprised and asked me the  company name it was for and then she looked me down surprised  and then She said   ‘ohhhh....how did you apply for there then?’ When Just before she’d give me snotty looks when she first called me to her desk. And a bit later the same appointment I looked to my left to look at another advisor who had a short dress   on whilst my advisor was on the computer in front of me and my advisor laughed a bit and said ‘you looking at her there?’ in a smiley way, I didn’t Say anything. and  also said ‘we normally change your advisor at this stage...but erm...I’ll just keep you with me’ pleasantly when the week before she sent me somewhere else instead of her when I called in sick for an appointment but when I asked her is there anywhere else by email she replied  saying she’s referring me back to herself again and I didn’t want to but I said ‘ok thank you’ and she just replied with ‘see you next week’.  but I took her referring me elsewhere as that as her and nobody else wants to bother with me either because I’m ugly. She sometimes would look up at my hair  if I had it styled or just untouched and messy  is that a bad sign?

I got a job myself and she would say ‘well done’ and ‘very well done’ a lot on email replies and in person so she was probably surprised I did something in a bad way :/

Now she doesn't talk with me or hang out with me anymore and i'm left alone in class. Today i told her ""Can we speak for a bit?"" but she said that it wasn't the right time in an angry way and immediately left.

I'm really depressed now. I really don't understand why she let me down like that. And i don't feel like going to class anymore, i just want to listen to music on my own.

Someone told me to text her to ask her why she let me down. But i feel like it's forcing her, and a bit rude.

733,"So this guy has been my friend for a while but now he's becoming closer and closer to me and I feel I don't know much about him but he's opening up slowly. It takes time, after all, so I'm not too upset over it.

Anyway he told me jokingly he hates dating and how that's something so serious for girls to get into relationships etc. And I asked him if he likes being single and he said yeah he's already got enough issues/responsibilities. I couldn't help but look down and feel intense pain because I'm so into this guy and we're just becoming friends. I told him idek the definition in our society(where we are from it's a bit more conservative since we are Muslim) and he said he hates responsibilities and how he thinks almost all or all girls like to really call him everyday/every morning and how couples stick with each other 24/7.

Tbh I hate that too. It's cringe to me. I wouldn't do that no matter how long I'd been seeing somebody or even if we got married, that's weird to me. I think he genuinely isn't ready for a relationship and just lowkey told me that. I personally wasn't seeking a relationship so quickly but I like him so naturally I try and spend a lot of time with him.

I also just called him my friend and told him I trust him but didn't hint at anything romantic etc.

I am pretty hurt tho. Not as if we were gonna suddenly start dating or something but just that he might actually have 0 interest in me romantically.

So as I am still crushing on him but don't want to stop being friends with him as he is a super nice guy and I feel like he understands me etc.

How do I stay friends with him without developing feelings further for this guy? It hurts but I need to move on asap, the sooner the better. We are just friends and that's fine if we stay that way, I don't mind accepting reality and moving on.",05Mar2020,1

Yesterday I told her to look up her symptoms before we go bc were broke and I wasn’t too sure about driving so far. She told her parents I didn’t feel like taking her (which prompted them to demand that I take her)

Her tests came back clear, our other mate had to drive from his job to the hospital and then home because he was locked out since we were gone 

Her results came back clear and when her parents called she lied and said they “couldn’t tell it something was wrong and they recommended a new doctor” which completely dismissed the fact that she wasted EVERYONE’s time, left me hungry for 5 hours,  and gave her an “excuse” to not apologize to me or my family

743,"Yesterday I got a phone call from a number with my hometown area code while I was listening to music. I didn't know the number, so I let it go to voicemail. The caller left a voicemail that was 2 seconds long, so out of curiosity I checked it. It was a creepy male voice that softly said ""You like that song?""

It sent chills down my spine. I don't know if that was pre-recorded, or who that was, or what it was for. I told a friend about it, and he said to call the number back to see if it was the same person, so I did. An elderly woman picked up the phone, and seemed disoriented. She was confused and seemed sort of senile, but I pressed for just a minute for answers. I asked if she recognized my number, and she said that she got a call from my number earlier that day and it left a voicemail, but she didn't know how to check her voicemail, so it was a dead end. Through this I was able to confirm that my number is still being used for spoofing, as I dealt with a similar incident a few months ago but never did anything about it. 

It seems that she was spoofed with my number, and I was spoofed with hers; I just don't know why. The voicemail that was left concerns me, and I'm not sure if I should be worried or if a spoofer was just trying to mess with me. I am mainly concerned given the voicemail that someone is able to see what I am doing. I was listening to music on Pandora at the time, and as far as I know the only way someone can see if you are listening to music is through the Snapchat location Bitmoji thing that puts headphones on your character if you have them plugged in. My Snapchat is set to only friends being allowed to see my location, though, so I don't know how else this person would've known if it wasn't just a made up line to mess with me by some spoofing jerk.

Should I do something? Should I be worried, or is this a common thing I just don't know about?",05Mar2020,1
744,"I met this guy on a dating app around 3 months ago. He's 30 with me being 26. In the beginning, I was very indifferent to him. Thought he was cute and our conversation flowed pretty well, but he had quirks that I found a little goofy and borderline off putting sometimes so I was very meh about him at the start. He was the opposite about me. He was very excited about me. He was always texting me, asking me to hang out, get lunch, go out to the bar with him and his friends, etc. etc. and I usually found an excuse to not take him up on it because I was just not super into him at first. However, I did take notice of the fact that I was physically attracted to him and that we were pretty like minded in a lot of ways so I figured I would continue to get to know him.

About a week after our first date, he had been trying to hang out a lot and I usually dodged him because I didn’t want to lead him on so I texted him and told him that I thought he was great but that I wanted to keep things platonic for a bit if it was okay with him. He seemed somewhat disappointed, but he was very respectful about it and said it was fine and mentioned, “I’m not really looking for a relationship. My last one killed me. I’m really just looking to vibe and chill” to which I said great, lets hang out then with intimacy being taken off the table at least for now. So, we began to hang out as friends. We would go out to the bar, play pool and chill. I usually had a good time with him and his friends. I quickly realized they were my kind of people. A little over a month after we began talking through the app, I made a move and we hooked up. Thus began our FWB relationship. 

Very gradually after we started hooking up, I started to find those off putting quirks cute and endearing, I started to catch myself staring at him, I started to really like him. I realized soon after we started to hook up that I have caught serious feelings for him. When I first realized this, I had planned to tell him. I wasn’t positive if he would go with it or not because he did mention that he wasn’t looking for a relationship and that he was still picking up the pieces from his previous relationship. He also says things sometimes in regard to enjoying not being committed to anyone which tips me off that he's not about it. However, he's pretty intimate with me when we would hang out. Always kissing me, holding my hand, telling me about how pretty I looked, texting me good morning every day (which he still does almost every day) etc. It was hard for me to imagine him doing those things and then being completely turned off by the idea of wanting to date. I kept telling myself and my friends that pushed me to do it that I was going to tell him. “I’m going to do it tomorrow. I’m gonna tell him this weekend. I’m gonna text him soon and tell him”. However, I never ended up doing it and that’s because as gradually as I have built up feelings for him, he has gradually been pulling back. He doesn’t text me as frequently, hasn’t initiated us hanging out in awhile (we hang out around once a week still but usually it’s because I initiate it) and when we do hang out, it's for like 12 hours once a week on work nights. Basically he'll drive over to my place or vise versa (we live 40 mins from each other so it's kind of a hike) after work, we'll hang and have sex and then go to work the next day. He hasn't invited me to do anything other than that in awhile. It's been over a month since we went to the bar or did anything other than a 12 hour chill sesh and that's usually because when I text him on the weekends to see if he wants to do something he gives me ""I'm broke and staying in"" or ""I'm chilling with the boys this weekend"".

It’s so confusing to me because nothing has changed from the beginning other than the fact that we have mind blowing sex now…so why is he withdrawing? I haven’t told him how I feel because I’m terrified of the rejection I know that I will more than likely get. I really, really enjoy his time and company more than I ever thought I would. I don’t want to lose that. Part of what makes me so scared is that I moved to this county about 8 months ago and I barely know anyone so losing one of my only friends that i can be so authentically myself with and going back to being isolated all the time sounds horrible. That's a big difference between us as well. I barely have any friends here whereas he has dozens because I live in an isolated area and have only been here less than a year whereas he has lived here a good chunk of his life so I feel that is part of why I'm wanting to spend time with him so bad because i'm cripplingly lonely most of the time. I live alone in a big house and he lives with two of his best friends in a small apartment and always has options when it comes to spending time with people. I still go on dating apps and try to hang out with others, but I’ve noticed myself comparing everyone to him. I’m so infatuated with this guy that I feel like it’s driving me crazy. I don’t know how you go from always wanting to hang out and talk to a person to not as much when nothing has really changed. Maybe he's just used to me or doesn't feel the need to ""chase"" me anymore since he's got me? Maybe he’s bored of me. I don’t know. All I know is that I just want him to give me the same attention he did when we first met. I haven’t liked a person this much in years and it sucks so much to not have my feelings requited. I don’t know what to do in regards to him and getting over him. I can’t believe I am so sprung over someone I never even officially dated. What do I do to get him out of my head and to get all these questions answered without chasing him off? I really enjoy his company a lot and don't want to make things weird, but I also really like him. What to do?",05Mar2020,1

I avoid all violence in school and I’m chill with everyone. Up until recently I’ve been put into the very situation I avoid. This one person keeps doing things to me to see my reaction. It’s weird because it’s nothing verbal, it’s just unexpected flicks or light punches. I’ve told the person repeatedly to stop and they usually don’t. He acts like we are cool but out of nowhere he starts getting aggressive. I’ve told myself I’m bound to fight this guy, but I never do.

Anyway he left the job a few weeks ago and told me how he had some things he had to take care of. Called twice and this morning. The past two times he was still telling me I miss you. This morning he ‘ended’ things, 2 days ago I sent him a ‘it’s over, wish you the best’ text. I think deep down he wasn’t going to be going with it, this man is not very ballsy and very on paper when it comes to life and paths. Honestly... I knew I knew it was dumb I knew but just got so wrapped up into what we could be, and how we were together. Honestly we were very connected, and although we were just wasting time I ended up finding him very charming and just an overall good person. A very good person. I tried to name bad things about him but all I could find were things that I already knew before, nothing completely disgusting. I mean maybe this, the affair but it’s harder to see since I’m in the situation.

They told me they sent my W-2 out to me but I moved right before leaving. I got in contact with the two places I have lived and neither of them have seen it or know where it is. 

I got in contact with Walmart and they referenced me to a site to get it shipped to my current address. However the site cannot verify me even with my SSN. 

I was told to email the people behind the site and they told me I would need a unique number every Walmart associate gets when they work there (WIN). 

My issue is I cannot for the life of me get in contact with the personnel lady that works there. I have been calling for 3 days straight and I can't get in contact with here. My work schedule lines up perfectly with hers so I can't go to her in person either. 

I am currently in a contact position so I can't take days off without risking being terminated. (It's a very attendance oriented position). 

I am not sure what to do now. I have done everything in my power to get in contact with this lady but I just can't. Most of the time when I call the store literally no one answers my call.

767,"Hello everyone, I’ve been having some sleep issues but I’m having trouble identifying them. I’m in college right now, I usually get 7 hours of sleep or even 10 on the weekends but I still wake up tired.

The past few months my roommate says I talk or scream in my sleep. Sometimes I woke up in the middle of talking or kicking my legs so I realized. At that time it also took me ~1 hour or more to fall asleep as well (but now it takes about half an hour).

Recently she hasn’t said anything and I don’t have nightmares, but now I wake up feeling deeply disturbed even if I don’t remember what I dreamt about. And if I do remember, it’s usually something real that happened in my past but with bizarre or life-threatening twists.

And I get a weird wave of relief after I wake up because I can focus on the things I need to accomplish, or think about future events. I don’t feel afraid to go to sleep each night, but I just don’t know why I wake up feeling both unsettled and relieved.",05Mar2020,1
768,"So OFC we met off Tinder, I don’t have my notifications turned on so I check my messages randomly. Cute white guy asks to see me etc gets my number. First time we meet is last weekend while we’re both in the same area different spots. We end up going to his house. I mean cmon it was pretty obvious what we were gonna end up doing. So we do it. We text and text. Asks me for dinner I said I can’t. Another day we go to the movies. Meet up for a few drinks before we go inside. A lot of superficial talk. Heavy. He had opportunities to ask me questions about myself etc but nothing. He seems like a stiff guy but then again very with the flow. We were watching the movie and he would reach out to hold my hand, cuddle and kiss blah blah. Then he would compliment me, but it just felt very superficial. Again, that night we had sex again. Maybe cause we knocked out the third park out the way first time. Lol. So next day -STILL TEXTING- and I confront him, like I just want the complete honest truth blah blah. And he said he didn’t know if that’s what I wanted to be FWB, didn’t wanna bother me to soon, and then have me run away, and he also said he never intended it to be fwb in the first place and how when he invited me to the movies he wasn’t expecting anything because I was the one that suggested we go to his place.( I have needs too.) So he’s right, and then he said Okay well what’s your family like? So in a way, he wasn’t even asking me about me, lol. And when I answered he went to talk about himself and his family. Not contributing to my conversation. Should I just end this? Cause really I don’t like wasting time. And it feels like to me it’s not going anywhere in the right direction. He may act like it, or say a couple of words that make me feel but, I got a feeling he probably just wants someone to waste time with.",05Mar2020,1

so i started talking to this guy online a couple weeks ago and he was chill at first and we shared memes and talked about random things.

but nowadays, he's getting really obsessive and demands i text him back immediately. if i don't text him he'll leave me some 7-8 messages telling me how rude i am to not text him always after seeing his message and making me the bad guy.

he keeps texting me 8-10 times a day minimum and expects i text back. 

but recently it's become even more annoying, he replies to each of my posts and stories as if we're best friends or something when i barely know him. even when we text, he acts like we're best friends.
i didn't say anything about this directly to him because that would be mean i think.

but really it's getting very annoying now, i don't feel like dealing with him. he's not a bad guy i guess but i don't wanna keep talking to him.

773,"I was sexually abused when I was a kid by a family member (also a female) that was close in age.  It happened several times and I never spoke a word of it to anyone.  Fast forward to present time and I am married and recently gave birth to our first child.  Yesterday I received a photo from my mom (my parents watch my son during the day while my husband and I work) and it was a picture of my abuser holding my son.  I freaked out.  Seeing this person holding my son while I wasn’t around put a fear in me that I have never experienced before and I believe I had my first panic attack.  My mom thought nothing of it since this person has held my son before while I was present, and she is around very often.  I explained to my parents that I don’t want anyone holding my son without my knowledge first and they apologized and said they would remember that for next time. 

I couldn’t shake how upset I was so I texted my abuser this morning and asked her to not hold my son when I wasn’t around and that she will never babysit him or be alone with him.  I went on saying that she knew what she did to me all those years ago and that I never told anyone but now my son is my biggest priority and I would do anything to protect him.   She replied back, said she was sorry and didn’t want to seem like an asshole but she doesn’t know what I’m talking about.  She said she blacked out a lot of our childhood but she could tell that I was traumatized and that she will respect my boundaries and stay away.  

How in the world can someone, who is older than me by a few years, not remember what she did to me numerous times?!?  I was 6 or 7 so she was 10 or 11. I almost feel as if that is another manipulative move on her part.  I called her out on not remembering  and said that she had even told my mom once that I would never let her babysit my son, so she obviously knew that I wouldn’t trust her.  When I asked about that she said she didn’t remember saying that either.  I guess I’m wondering if it’s even possible to forget doing something like that and if I should give her the details of it to jog her memory.  I’ve suffered with this for so many years I can’t believe that she is saying that she has no recollection.",05Mar2020,1

3 weeks ago my fiancé of 4 years broke up with me out of the blue, her reasons being - my financial situation, the fact that because of my disabilities (dyspraxia and autism) I do not understand things that well and am oblivious to subtle hints, and that she has generally not been happy for a while. That being said I understand her reasons and was starting to accept them, but through snooping (her social media accounts were logged into my phone when her phone broke) I have found out she’s talking to her ex, and that she’s been seeking moral support through our mutual friend, she said to her ex that the last time her and our friend met up last week they ‘had ALOT of fun’ (her words), and she had said to her other friend that he had been speaking to her everyday for around a month and a half which overlaps our relationship! 
I need advice on how to deal with this information, how to ask her about it? When we broke up I asked if there was anyone else and she said no.

Anyway he told me jokingly he hates dating and how that's something so serious for girls to get into relationships etc. And I asked him if he likes being single and he said yeah he's already got enough issues/responsibilities. I couldn't help but look down and feel intense pain because I'm so into this guy and we're just becoming friends. I told him idek the definition in our society(where we are from it's a bit more conservative since we are Muslim) and he said he hates responsibilities and how he thinks almost all or all girls like to really call him everyday/every morning and how couples stick with each other 24/7.

Tbh I hate that too. It's cringe to me. I wouldn't do that no matter how long I'd been seeing somebody or even if we got married, that's weird to me. I think he genuinely isn't ready for a relationship and just lowkey told me that. I personally wasn't seeking a relationship so quickly but I like him so naturally I try and spend a lot of time with him.

I also just called him my friend and told him I trust him but didn't hint at anything romantic etc.

I am pretty hurt tho. Not as if we were gonna suddenly start dating or something but just that he might actually have 0 interest in me romantically.

So as I am still crushing on him but don't want to stop being friends with him as he is a super nice guy and I feel like he understands me etc.

How do I stay friends with him without developing feelings further for this guy? It hurts but I need to move on asap, the sooner the better. We are just friends and that's fine if we stay that way, I don't mind accepting reality and moving on.",05Mar2020,1
779,"Howdy, I'm a freshman in college and I've just recently started seeking help for my TENTATIVE self diagnosis of *some kind* of post traumatic stress (regardless if it's a disorder, it's definitely a constant stressor). Please do not self diagnose if you can afford a proper diagnosis, I didn't really diagnose myself with anything I just knew that I've had issues facing several assaults that happened to me several years ago that I consider to be traumatic for me. The psychologist I met with on campus also agreed that I meet a majority of the baseline criteria for a PTSD diagnosis but not all, and so she cannot definitively give me even a preliminary diagnosis as of right now. I have been really going through it lately, and my dad just asked me how I'm doing over text and I want to tell him that I'm seeking help but I've never even told my parents that I've been assaulted. I don't think I could tell my mother right now, she is a hysterical woman and I don't even know how she would react. I'm also an 18 year old girl if that helps.

Also the psychologist used a DSM to determine a possible PTSD diagnosis. She said it's possible because we didn't meet for terribly long and I have so much of it repressed that it's hard to pinpoint symptoms, and she also introduced the possibility of having acute stress disorder, which is similar but occurs at a different time than PTSD. I didn't use a name of any kind of mental illness in the subject because I didn't want to be misleading or to jump to conclusions.

I have a good group of friends, going to the gym to get healthy, and trying to get better when I comes to how I act, now I'm kinda funny. I thought I'd be happier, but I'm not. I'm always tired even though I've been going to the gym for a year and had to get my sleep schedule on point to go in the morning. I don't feel more connected with my friends because they aren't the type to talk about their feelings a lot. And overall I feel the same like I did in highschool. I don't know what to do, nor how to deal.

I've tried god, and I can help me calm down when things out of my control hit the fan. But in my day to day life I'm still the same.

Why am I trying so hard to fix myself when it feels like nobody, not even I, cares. I don't have man tits anymore which i thought I'd be stoked for, but I felt nothing. I've realized that when I do my favorite things to do, playing video games, playing d&amp;d with my friends, making movies, I don't feel gratitude, nor do I feel happiness. My brain only compels me to do stuff.

Am I broken or something? I hate the idea of living on pills, I'd honestly rather die than have to. And I'm at the point where suicide doesn't even feel like an act of emotion but a logistical choice.

787,"Hello, I’m a 20 year old ftm guy. I’m autistic, on top of a ton of other mental diagnoses. What that means is that I’m basically unable to do multiple things normal people do because I genuinely forget/it’s sensory hell. My mom has been taking care of me since childhood, and believes she’ll always take care of me because of my issues. However...

Remember how I mentioned I’m transgender? Well, my mom absolutely refuses to accept it. She claims I’m just “needing to look to God more” and “act more feminine and lose weight”, as though that will fix me being transgender. She’s a Jehovah’s Witness, and believes I’ll die if I don’t change my ways.

On top of that, she wants me to stay a Jehovah’s Witness. I was 15 when I got baptized, which I did because my mother was pressuring me. Now, however, I recognize that the religion is being toxic towards me— I cannot go “preaching” because of my anxiety and inability to be around loud noises, I cannot handle being in the Meetings due to similar reasons. While I genuinely believe in what they’re teaching, I cannot handle the religion’s rigid rules and morals.

One thing to note is that my mother means well, but she isn’t really educated and believes strongly in what she’s being taught at the meetings. She doesn’t want me to live alone out of fear I’ll hurt myself or others, and I personally believe she also wants to keep me in the religion.

Not to mention I’m being punished every time I stim (repeated movements that autistic people do) and do anything that shows I’m autistic. 

This environment is toxic for me, and I need advice in order to figure out if I should move out. However, I’m disabled and don’t yet have SSI (I have the court next week so perhaps soon it’ll be here). I can’t work. What can I do?

I feel like she kind of doesn’t know how to live in a dorm and doesn’t respect my space? Like few days ago we were chatting and she casually said she used to put her stuff to my wardrobe when she was in a hurry and take them later on(she has her own wardrobe next to mine and they are literally same). I get so uncomfortable even when I think about it. Whenever I feel lazy I put my dirty laundry there temporarily. I don’t want her to see it. She uses dorm property that was given to both of us like her own which in that case I can’t use them. For example we have one dirty laundry basket. She uses it like her second wardrobe so I can’t wash my clothes if she is not in the room. She is a foreign student. Btw I can understand her language. When she talks with her family it is usually after 7 pm. She talks like she is shouting. She sometimes jokes to her parents that I must be so angry at her. Which I am but I can’t just tell to her face so unfortunately I just laugh it off. In bathroom she puts her makeup all over the place including my space. She washes her dirty plates and leaves the disgusting leftovers in the sink. I HATE that. Seeing mushed up strawberries waiting to get rotten. I used to clean her mess which I think in some way encouraged her. I stoped the stupid cleaning after her hoping she will realize her behavior but it didn’t happen of course lol. The BIG reason why I decided to talk is two nights ago she got herself some junk food and after she was done with them she just left their garbage on the floor! She cleans it but after they stayed like one night with us ON THE FUCKING FLOOR. We have a garbage can 1 meter away. I like my dorm room to look clean and good but she is making it so hard for me. I want to tell her but don’t know how to do it. I also just talked about her good behavior to my friends so I can’t talk to them. If I just start telling her everything that irritates me she’s gonna be like we were good for months what happened?

He gets along with the male cat whose 5 and can be around with the female cat whose 9. They can sleep in the same bed together. Him and the 9 year old do keep their distance. They’ll go back and forth attacking eachother but it’s just a “hey f you” and then walk away. But my male cat with his female 12 year old cat.....no.

Ever since he first met her he lunged after her, he hissed and growled at her. And it’s been like that ever since. We have to keep them in separate places of the house all the time. There’s not a time where the house has been fully open since he moved in. When he sees her his tail gets puffy and he chases after her while scratching the crap out of her face. She’s little and fragile, a sweet thing but for some reason he hates this 12 year old cat. He’s been here for 2 years and hunts her down if a door is open he’ll dart for her. 

We’ve tried holding them and letting them sniff eachother, we’ve tried keeping the house open and just letting them be (he’ll hunt her down and even if she’s hidden he’ll wait so he can attack her again, we’ve tried just having them in the same room but with both of us keeping a guard up for the 12 year old cat.

My Mother only has two moods one is the most loving and caring person I know, buying me a car, giving me 200€ out of nowhere, telling me she loves me every day and caring for me with all of her strengh. The other side is well. Different.
The other side is her pulling my hair, throwing things around, screaming at me that I am worthless, ignorant and should kill myself and that she hates me. She used to beat me a lot as a child and pull my hair. She always put me in a corner to kneal with my hands up until I was in a lot of pain and making the corner time longer if I cried as a punishment. 
If I start crying because of her yelling she tells me to stop acting because she thinks I can't feel anything.
If I talk back in any way she tells me I am horrible and she will kill herself. She treatenes suicide a lot if I misbehave (talking back or not saying anything)
She also said that if I ever leave her she will kill herself.
She is currently yelling at my father that he should kill himself and take me with him so she can be alone.
All of my life is being scared of her outbursts and dancing around trying not to annoy her, but it never works. There us always something that will set her off. 
We will be talking normally and then for no apparent reason she yells.

So two months ago my ex broke up with me, I am a high school student and she is very insecure. She has broken up with me many times and it ends up with me asking her to stay and everything but the last time she did it I didn’t beg, I was exhausted and tired. She had broken up with me because I had hugged a friend (female) and one of her friends at my school said I did that. Yeah... she dumped me just because I congratulated a friend for her performance at an assembly. 

So she texted me pissed saying “how could you do this” this and that, acting like I cheated. I didn’t ask her to stay I explained the situation and said she was just a friend but at that point I was exhausted. She broke up with me and blocked me for a little while. She unblocked me and started talking to me but we hadn’t gotten back together yet. All she had done was unblocked me. We stayed broken up for two months. After that whole situation the girl i was friends with and hugged started to be there for me and comfort me, she told me how I deserved better and everything and she kind of made me like her. 

I met her family and everything (accidental run in) we were never together though or talking we were just friends, I would constantly tell her how I didn’t want a relationship or anything with her or anyone else. Now here’s where I got stuck... I had sex with her. And me and her both knew it was a huge mistake. She was only my second body my ex being my first. Then we agreed just to put some distance between us and stay away from each other. I talked to one other girl but we never did anything but kiss. I’m the span of two months. Also in those two months I would still sleep with my ex... but that’s all it was... just sex we both knew we were single. 

Now two months later after the break up we started talking again. I know I sound like a dick... doing that within two months ... but I just..‘I didn’t want to be alone and I surrounded myself with a female. Because when I was alone I’d think about my ex and it was dreadful. I was miserable and ... I know I handled things so wrong ... 

So my question is.... should I tell her? I’ve asked some family members elders and everything, friends... they say no because we were broken up... so it wasn’t wrong ... but I feel so guilty...

I left school early to go to my appointment with my mom even though I felt fine, she insisted on taking me. When we got to the doctors the place was packed and the nurses said that the doctor was an hour behind schedule. “I said why did we have to come I feel fine.” My mom got mad and said I’d been complaining to much about being sick and we would stay to see what was wrong. She said I complained yesterday at dinner and that I didn’t eat.

809,"TLDR: ex and I initially wanted to remain friends but i realised I just couldn’t do it because it was to confusing. The further away from her I get, the more pain around it I feel, and the more attracted to her old pictures (not nudes, just any picture), I feel. I’m not sure why this is, and it has happened in previous break ups as well. I initiated the break up. M28

This morning I had a nightmare. 

I was running to the cafe where we had our first date. My shoes were falling off and I couldn’t run quickly. When I got to the cafe she wasn’t there, but she was texting me details of what had happened in her first sexual encounter since we had broken up. Not to be mean, just to inform me. I was trying desperately to respond, but my fingers fumbled over the keys and I couldn’t get a message out. I was trying to find her. Trying to get it stop. I woke up trembling, thoroughly rattled.

I’ve been single for 6 weeks now, and it’s like I’ve only just started to grieve. We were together nearly three years.

I felt incredibly sad about the breakup at the time. But I also knew I had no options. I couldn’t change the fact that I had always struggled to be physically attracted to her. When the psychological attraction started to go, there was nothing to be done except to get out. 

Yesterday we spoke on text. We chatted, i asked if she had been dating (we’d seen each other on tinder) - she was honest with me and said she’s slept with someone (I’d asked). 

Now that really shouldn’t bother me, but fuck did it throw me. In reading that I realised instantly that I wasn’t going to be able to seperate my past with her from the present, that I couldn’t be her friend. 

It wasn’t a pride thing, or because I wasn’t sleeping with anyone personally. I’ve had multiple hook ups with two women since we split. It’s just that I was her first....well everything. And to not know what her second encounter was like is doing my head in. Like what if she did shit with him that she didn’t want to do to me? What if she enjoyed it more?

I mean, I hope she had fun, don’t get me wrong. But it makes me anxious. And angry. Not at her, but with my feelings and the situation itself.

I think what bothered me about it is how blasé the whole interaction was. I left the conversation wondering if she was still feeling sad about the break up and putting up a wall (likely, knowing her) or if she just genuinely didn’t care. And that really hurt. Not that I want her to suffer...but feeling as if three years could be overcome in 6 weeks....that stung.

It wasn’t that the interaction was nasty. It was a pleasant farewell. But it fucking hurt.

Why is it that the further away from her I get, the more attracted to her photos I feel? 

I listen to old video diaries and there is no doubt that I consistently struggled to feel attracted to her. My psychologist even told me “this is a deal breaker, and the longer you leave it, the worse it’ll become”. He was absolutely right. So right in fact, that I stopped seeing him for nearly a year to stop dealing with the problem. 

I am investing a lot of energy into my life since the breakup. I’ve landed a new job. I joined a more powerlifting focused gym and have started doing a 4 day a week program there. But I put on 40kg in the relationship. It’s a lot of weight to shift. It’s affected my confidence around approaching women. I’ve gone from being very comfortable with being rejected to being very averse to it...and I hate that. 

I realise now that the weight gain was in no small part because I was unhappy and avoiding the problem.

It’s confusing. I very clearly do not want to get back together. Yet I feel hurt that she moved on so fast, or that she put up the wall that quickly around me. I know why she put the wall up - I was her first boyfriend. The first person outside of her mother and therapist to see inside the walls. Now that I’m on the out, it’s only natural that she would feel protective of herself. But it stung. It was a testament to how things had changed.

I guess I just hope that she too is still mourning the relationship. I don’t want her to stop getting on with her life of course...I just want to feel like I mattered. And that’s such an insecure thing to say. All I have to do is look at anything she ever did for me to know that I mattered to her. But I wish I could hear it from her. She wrote me a letter immediately after the breakup telling me she’d always love me. Barely a month and half later and it’s like I’ve shed like dead skin. 

I don’t want her to stay put and never get over me to be clear. I just feel so confused at how quickly things appear to have changed. 

Why do I feel increasingly sad and conflicted the further out I get from this? After the initial burst of freedom, I feel empty. I feel a little alone. I have been lucky to have one male friend I can talk about it with, but there are limitations on things.

Why is it that in almost every break up, I start to feel most sad around the 6-8 week mark? Is it because we thought we could be friends, but now I’ve had to permanently say goodbye?

I still plan on finishing this degree since I’m already almost there but I’m not motivated to master CS skills. I’m inept in every aspect of computer science except for a basic understanding. I’m a good test taker so that’s the only reason I got this far I feel.

811,"I live in student housing across from my University. It's a pretty big apartment, not a dorm because our University doesn't have dorms. There are 8 total people in my apartment, and while we generally get along, the dishes have been and continue to be an issue, particularly for a roommate I'll call K.
 
K has anxiety and OCD tenancies, so things being left around, counters not being cleaned, dishes pulling up in the sink, etc. really bother her. She is working on this, but the dishes still really bother her, and while I'm not quite as bothered, it is annoying that half of the sink is always full of dishes.
 
When we first moved in, everyone used the dishwasher. Most of us, myself included, would leave the dishes in the sink and someone would load the dishwasher later. Obviously, this wasn't a great system because losing the dishwasher was voluntary and so K would often be the one who did it. Sometimes she would ask me to do it, which I did.
 
Additionally, people would leave the clean dishes in the dishwasher for a long time, preventing anyone from reloading the dishwasher.
 
Eventually, K was fed up with doing everyone's dishes, and started to just wash her own right after she used them, and I am doing the same now. However, dishes are still left in the sink for days or weeks at a time. Thru get stinky and have even started to grow mold in the past. Sometimes, we know who the dishes belong to, but a lot of times they're communal dishes like pots and pans and there's no way of telling who used them. Furthermore, some unknown people have used dishes belonging to other roommates and left them in the sink, which is inconvenient for the roommate who had her dishes stolen, as well as disgusting because it adds to the dishes that get old in the sink. 
 
K has left passive aggressive notes around the kitchen and on the whiteboard, but half of the sink is still always full (it used to be both sides of the sink, but K had manated that the side with the garbage disposal needs to be empty so that people can wash their dishes on that side). We are at a loss for how to solve this. Notes haven't worked, and we don't know which is the other 6 roommates to talk to about this issue. We were thinking of putting all the dishes on the living room floor or something to get the attention of the roommates who dirtied them, or just loading up all the non-communal dishes in a trash bag and either throw them out (K's idea) or put them by the door to send a message (my idea).",05Mar2020,1

814,"As the title says, I’ve moved to a new city- I don’t really know anyone here, and kinda dawned on me that I really crave this community feel.

People mostly are older with families so mostly go home after work not much opportunity there- I don’t know how to find a community without being religious.

About a year ago I desided to pursue a career in dog training, I already have extensive experience (about 17 years) volunteering for rescues fostering dogs, doing dog intros, application evaluations and home visits. I've potty and kennel trained countless puppies, taught dogs/puppies obedience and manners, and helped many dogs overcome fear or anxiety issues.  I've become great at reading Canine body language and behavior over the years, I can easily tell when a dog is feeling sad, happy, anxious, stressed, ect and I can usually tell what a dog is trying to communicate with me. When I realized dog training is my calling I started buying books to research positive training methods, canine behavior, body language and how dogs think/learn. I'm now to the point where I am needing a mentor or someone to show me the ropes of how to properly interact with clients and assess a dogs ""problems"", proper training techniques and tips, and how to properly conduct private lessons and group class. I looked into educational programs such as catch dog trainers academy, Karen Pryor's dog training school as well as an apprenticeship program offered by a local dog training business near me. After looking into these educational organizations I've come to realize that these programs are for people that don't have the knowledge or experience I've gained over the all the years I've been working with dogs and what I really need is to find a mentor I can shadow and learn from. My end goal is to open a business training dogs and educating people about dogs so more dogs will stay in homes and out of shellers or euthanized.

So my question is: how do I go about finding a mentor? I've never been one to ask for help so I really don't know how to approach this situation

840,"Long story short, I work as an Assistant preschool teacher. My site has two classes. I’m in classroom 02 with a teacher, and the “pain in my ass” teacher is just a wall over with another teacher helping her in classroom 01. Our classrooms are separate and never interact with each other. Two classrooms, one building. 

Anyway. As of late, that teacher has been a bitch for the sake of being a bitch. She’s been in the company for about 30 something years, threatens to quit almost everyday because they want her to do more work than she is “supposed” to do, she says she gonna hire an attorney because they’re making her do to much work, yada yada. (Yes, I’m working with that type of person)

We don’t really come in contact with one another. We start at 8, children come at 830, and after that we don’t really cross paths. Lately, both of our classrooms have been having difficulty with the children. We are in a really bad neighborhood with unsupportive parents. We still come to work everyday and try our best given the situation. 

So lately, this teacher I speak of has just been nitpicking EVERYTHING. She’s always bitching and moaning about nonsense. She’s the kind of person that only looks for the negative. She’s not even our boss for christ sakes. She’s starting to say that me and my teacher “talk” to much, we are too loud, we don’t do anything... we have two supervisors that visit regularly and they never have anything negative to say. They actually say the opposite. “You’re all doing fantastic with the classes. they’re doing so much better. We are so proud of all of you”. So idk why she is so negative. She likes making a fuss out if things for no reason whatsoever. We are stuck together for the rest of the year. Why not just make things hassle free? She’s killing her self and making her job difficult for no reason. All of these concerns do not affect her job performance, or pay rate... so why?

Is this something worth reporting to HR? My supervisors? Or should I just ignore it for the remainder of the program year?",05Mar2020,1

My problem is that I'm surrounded by people who don't seem to care as much as I do. 
My bf, my parents, my friends, all of them don't even wanna hear me talking about it anymore because they're bothered of it. The only person I can talk to is my sister, but I actually don't see her that much. 

to me, the whole thing means the world. Literally.

I don't know why but I suffer from this horrible habit of procrastination, Everything from waiting to the last minute to pay bills, not getting tickets or making arrangements for things, what to cook for dinner (usually end up just buying take out) to yard work or going to the Dr.

It came to a head over the weekend when she asked me why there was a trashcan standing in our backyard, I had been raking leaves in the fall when it started raining and I had to stop, in September. Needless to say there was a huge black patch on the lawn where the leaves had started rotting and killed the grass, along with all the water built up in the trashcan from snow/rain over the months. It ended up to be a huge argument, because I wanted to wait until the water had dried or I figured out a way to drain it out. Then she pointed out some winter weeds growing in the driveway and asked why I didn't just pull them, ""I am going to spray them"" Ok she responded when ""Next weekend probably"" she got more pissed and started pointing out all the things I put off all the time, and how its a huge killer in our relationship. I guess because I don't plan ahead or take action right away it puts a huge burden on her. I know she is bugged because it has been years and years (like 17) since I have been to the Dr, That I once forgot to change the oil in my car for 1/2 a year. It ended up to be an ugly fight.

So i have been brought up pretty religious. But I started developing my own ideas and I slowly left the Islam. I have friends who helped me discover stuff like pork and sometimes even some beer. And well I can’t keep this a secret from my parents ofcourse. So I asked my older brother for advice (he also left Islam) and he said the best thing I can do is wait until I’m more independent so I can live to my own rules. But lately they are noticing that I don’t prey anymore and that I’m falling out of line. Now I’m asking myself the question should I do as my older brother advised me to do or should I tell them. I know that logically seen I should tell them but they will probably get more strict one me and won’t let me go out with my friends anymore.

864,"So I work at a very large company buy my shift is in the evening so my office is pretty small. Due to this, the few coworkers I spend a lot of time working with have grown pretty close. This specific coworker is a self-identified racist, like they literally told me ""I'm racist as shit."" It started out not as blatant, but has increased over time which I assume is partly due to my inaction.

Anyway, it started out as ""ambiguous"" racism, like you couldn't really tell how they meant it or maybe it's ""just a joke"" but over time it's become so clear and shameless. For instance, they will speak with a ""Hispanic"" woman and complain about how hard they are to understand, how you shouldn't get a job if you can't speak English, mock their accent, say the group can't drive like the entire ""race"" of people, and will often refer to ""nonproblematic"" members of the group they shit-talk as ""one of the good ones."" This is only scratching the surface but I hope to illustrate the types of statements being made. ""You know he's wrong, hes black!"" Blackness is a common insult against people the coworker doesn't like. 

Basically, they've been blatantly racist at work to the people we work with/for. Now my problem is not what I should do, because I've reported this behavior to HR, but now I'm feeling tremendously guilty because I feel like I betrayed her trust in a way. I wish I had reported earlier but it really wasn't as bad as it later became. It felt like as they trusted me more, they became more and more toxic and racist, at least outwardly and this wouldn't just work itself out.

One of my really good friend was unfairly barred from the trip because they simply didn't have enough people going. I feel like I could give up my spot for her because 

1. this would be her first time and last time going, whereas I have been before and (maybe can go again later).
2. she took a break from work and also canceled plans to make time for this trip, whereas my plans don't seem to be as important (maybe this is just my lack of self-respect speaking)
3. The organizers originally said they will start barring people on the basis of points (a way to indicate our involvement in the org) and I am on -14 points where as my friend is at a really good standing. I feel like I dont deserve to go as much as her, and I think I only got the chance because I had some really good friends request me in their car. 
4. I am behind on some other work I need to do, so I could use the weekend to my advantage and catch up.

But these are the reasons I want to go:

1. My best friend is on this trip and it will be one of the last times I get to hangout with them before they move away. 
2. Some of my dear mentors from previous years are at the city we're going to and it would be a really nice opportunity to see them again.
3. I also might leave this organization so this could be my last chance going.
4. It is a good time to get to know new people in the organization on a personal level, and it would be fun and socially fulfilling.

He and my mom are still together but he always treated her like crap emotionally and cheated on her multiple times. She couldn't leave him due to money reasons, she wanted my sister and I to have everything growing up. We all live together still but I have pretty much no connection with my dad, whenever I tried to talk to him growing up he would always shut me down or turn it into some kinda rant so we don't have any real conversations other than small talk now. He is a very manipulative and narcissistic person. He's threatened to kick me out before when I went against his wishes. He doesn't want me to be with someone outside of our community, doesn't matter if I'm happy or not. For the longest time I kept my relationship a secret from him because of that.

875,"So, about three months ago, I moved in with a couple of people in a mortgage agreement. The three of us would all pay an equal portion of the mortgage, but the house is in the name of one person. The house only being in one person's name, but being paid for equally by all three of us seemed not-so-great at first, but the owner was super nice about everything, and we signed an agreement with him.

Fast forward three months, and he has some ""bad news"" for me and the other house mate. He sits us down and says ""here's how this is going to work. I'm raising your rent. You can pay it, or get out by the end of the month.""

Obviously, we had questions. Chief among them being why is our mortgage agreement turning into rent all of a sudden? He said we didn't need to know. Then we asked why it was being raised, and to what? ""We're going up by $700. That's all I care to say."" Then he just left...? For like two days? When he came back, he acted like it never happened. Refused to talk about it. I called my parents and they're like ""you need to leave. Now."" Which I feel is accurate, but I have nowhere to go. At all. I don't have friends here that I can ask about living arrangements. I tried looking for apartment listings, but there's nothing even remotely close to my job that has openings until months from now. I have a good job here, and I'm trying to make a life for myself here. I've started seeing someone here as well, but it's way too early to talk about moving in. 

So like, what can I do? The other house mate moved out immediately. I asked him if he had a new place lined up, and he said ""no offence, but this whole thing is weird. Rather not say where I'll be."" Which I think is fair given the situation. So I'm stuck. I'm still here. The owner wont talk to me, and doesn't acknowledge me at all. I feel weird. And scared. 

&amp;#x200B;

Does anyone know what might be happening, or what I can do? The written agreement says that the payments may be subject to change under the circumstance of repairs, etc. Unfortunately I never got a copy of this agreement, so there's no proof on my end.

I have a close friend who in this regard is the polar opposite of me. He gets along with everyone, has countless friends, and has sex with basically every woman he meets. I don't necessarily want to be like him, but I'm jealous of his ability to be interesting, and to attract people. 


I've tried observing him to see how he does it, but I really don't understand it. I guess he says something to them, and before I know it he's either kissing with them in some corner, or being best buddies with them, even though they just met. He's not much better looking than I am. I guess he has confidence and social skills, but I don't know how to build those. I've tried for years and have made very little progress. I don't know what to say to people I don't know, so usually I just freeze unless the person is particularly easy to talk to. People say to ask questions, but that feels weird to me. It's not an interview. I also don't want to talk about myself, because I'm the most boring person in the world with nothing interesting to say.


All of this has lead to me feeling some amount of envy towards him, and it's also having a negative effect on my already low confidence. How can I get rid of these feelings? What's wrong with me?

I don’t really know where to start, so i’m just gonna get straight to the point. I don’t know if i’m overreacting or what, but i have this pet peeve where if i ask someone (like a friend) how they are doing, or whenever i show interest in their life/well being... and after i’m done listening to them, i become super disappointed when they don’t ask how I’m doing in return :/ 



I’m such an empathetic person, i love connecting with people and being a safe space for others to open up. But it really starts to bother me when people only want to talk about themselves. I always feel like people leave me hanging when i put in the effort to be THE supportive, understanding friend. 



I overthink a lot about this. I know we all communicate differently and it sounds like i have all of these expectations, but i’m trying to not get so sad every time i’m talking to someone. 


I just feel like nobody cares enough to ask me “how i’m doing” all the time and it ruins my day sometimes. 

I just want advice on how to not be so bothered by this. I went to counseling for a few years, so i guess i’m just way more head when it comes to my emotional intelligence than most my age? I’m a 23 year old female. 


I’m afraid this way of thinking is going to affect my relationships with others if i don’t figure out a way to overcome this.

901,"Just a little back story: I come from a religious family. A family with a ton of secrets that are hell bent on taking them to the grave. I've always hated my uncle. He constantly polices what I wear, what I do, and never misses the opportunity to tell me I will go to hell for the progressive way I live my life. He's toxic and alpha male abusive in a way that would make anyone want to punch him in the face.

&amp;#x200B;

The other night my cousins and I were having a girls night, drinking wine and smoking. When all of a sudden my cousin (we'll call her Jen) was visibly upset. She told us that she had been keeping a secret for years and that she didn't know why all of a sudden she needed to spit it out. It was word vomit personified, she was clutching her chest like the words were about to pour out of her. She kept on telling us that something bad happened to her as a kid but she didn't want us to think differently of who had done it to her. We reassured her that her secret was safe and she said it. My uncle had molested her as a kid.

Jen is 32 now but the abuse started when she was 6/7 for a couple of years. He was 16/17 at the time so it's not like he didn't know what he was doing.  She proceeded to tell us that this was something she had completely healed from. One of those things that she can read articles about other sufferers and that god at the fact that she didn't end up emotionally distressed because of it. She said that years later when she was 19 he had asked for forgiveness and she forgave him. Keep in mind he didn't apologize, just asked for her to forgive him It makes me so sick to my stomach, still waiting for my therapy appt tomorrow to fully process.

I want to out this man. I want to have him thrown in jail and/or ruin his life. But I need advice. Here are some things to keep in mind

1. My uncle does have a wife and two kids now
2. I have no idea whether he's doing this to other children but statistics show shes probably not the only one.
3. My family will disown me but I'd rather them disown me then have to associate myself with rape apologists.
4. There is already another case within my extended family of molestation of several young boys that my family has kept hidden (which I just found out) that I will also out

Another issue is that my cousin does not want us to tell anyone and especially not the family. She wants us to go on like nothing happened but that's just not possible for me. There could be other people in my family falling prey to this man and he deserves to be outed regardless. When I do it, I will most definitely let her know beforehand but I'm afraid she'll never speak to me again or at least hate me for a while.

903,"I (18M) have a tendency to get pretty jealous over a lot of things. I'm in a relationship with an amazing girl who I do not want to lose, but have come extremely close to losing mainly because of my jealous ways. But mainly, I want to get rid of these issues for myself, because they are really tormenting me, to the point in which I feel like I can't deal with the thoughts and feelings I am experiencing for much longer. The feelings of inadequacy, self-hatred and anxiety that I experience daily because of this is simply exhausting.

I'll give you an example: I'm watching a movie with my girlfriend, and a good-looking guy comes on. Without her even having to react in any way, I'll assume she thinks said guy is way hotter than me and that she wants to have sex with him. And even if I brought it up and she assured to me that that is not the case, I still wouldn't believe her. As a result, my confidence goes down the drain and I begin to have self-destructive thoughts

Another example: I recently found out that my girlfriend has/had a ""celebrity crush"". This absolutely crushed me. We have talked about it many times and she has always assured me that she only wants to be with me and that the ""crush"" wasn't a major one at all. I want to believe her, but my thoughts scream that I am simply not attractive enough for her and that I have no value as a human since I'm not the one she was crushing over.

The thing is, I am a fairly attractive guy. I just fear I'm not the most attractive guy in my girlfriends eyes, even though she says I am.

907,"Little Background story to the question.

I'm quite a lazy person doing mostly the minimum. The only things that overcomes my laziness is going school because I have to attend it, my GF because I don't want to make her mad, my only sport karate (only on Mondays and Wednesdays) because it's the only 'real' activity I really like doing and once in a while meeting friends when we all have time.
But remember I only do the minimum, for example copying the solutions of the maths homework from a PDF file with all the solutions of this year (don't ask why I have that) because it's the only subject in which I need it to get an acceptable grade (I never do any other homework) and I never ever learn until it's absolutely necessary. And at home I do very few in terms of chores and helping my parents and on top of that play a lot of videogames with my best friend and some others (which my parents understandibly don't like in combination to work moral) or sometimes read a book (that's accepted by them) but all together let to some fights with my parents since they want me to be more active especially in terms of school, and chores and a little bit more sport like jogging or biking once or twice a week.

Now I would like to get my self to be more active especially since if I would learn I would easily get mostly 1s and 2s (As and Bs for the Americans) as grades and be on a way better relationship with my parents. Furthermore my GF would be way happier because she knows I am lazy af and could do way better which sometimes makes her grumpy.

I would really appreciate tips on how I might beat my laziness especially in the case of school, doing chores and maybe starting jogging or sth similar.

To clarify the situation on what might help:
I live I a fairly small village with only one friend living nearby (who is already working and has even less time then me) and about a 20min drive into the city if there's no traffic and the bus connectin is BS.

915,"I have a habit of falling too hard. The infatuation blinds me and I’ve gotten manipulated and taken advantage of because of it. I know I’m supposed to let go of my past but that’s easier said than done. It feels like there’s a sort of blockage keeping me from doing so.

There are somethings in specific that trigger me the most. This particular one is challenging for me and it’s recurring. I’ve been with my girlfriend for 8 months now. We used to work as apprentices together at a tattoo shop and I noticed one artist constantly hitting on her, getting really close to her when he talks to her, messaging her a ton on Instagram. &amp; I can tell when a guy is running game when I see it. Ive heard stories about him f*cking apprentices in his van, and just a bunch of shit he gets into. They work together once a week.

Here’s the thing, I can’t tell if I’m being paranoid or not, but sometimes I’ll notice her wearing extra provocative clothes on the day they work together, today she went the extra mile to curl her hair in the morning. And then while at work she says they’re going to have a staff meeting at 8 (After the shop closes), which seems fishy to me. 

So I’m torn. I can’t tell if I’m being paranoid because of my trust issues, or if it’s my gut telling me I shouldn’t be trusting her. And if it is just paranoia, what are some steps I can take to get over my trust issues?",05Mar2020,0

I have two elder sisters but they've both moved out, so my house is going to become empty.

917,"My brother was recently diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, and this has dramatically reorganized life at home. Life has always been tumultuous: my older brother was deported a couple of years ago, and my mother later effectively abandoned us. It’s just my dad and I now, and unfortunately we’ve never been close, always distant. My brother’s intense and violent psychosis and resulting financial consequences appears to be sending him spiraling into a depression. 

In the past month, I have frequently lived in the homes of my friends out of fear of my brother. Luckily, he was recently hospitalized so I’ve been able to live at home without fear again. 

I feel empty. It seems as though my aspirations have halted, and I want for nothing. Every time I have attempted to rise above my circumstances, it seems I am forced back onto the ground. Though I am fed, sheltered, and have access to incredible public education system, I feel no hope. It feels like people like me aren’t meant to make it. 

My high school is aware of my situation, and I’ve received incredible support from the counseling department. I’m seen as a leader amongst my peers, and I’m treated with respect. I have an outgoing and confident personality, so I am well-liked. 

I am supposed to head off to college in the fall. I don’t know what to do. I don’t know where to go. I feel like a zombie without purpose. Another issue: I can’t drive either, I totaled our only car when I first started driving and I haven’t been able to access a car since. I feel no autonomy in my life. I feel like everything around me shifts, and I remain static. I internalize humiliation when my peers ask me why I’m walking to destinations that can be 40+ minutes away, or when I beg for rides. It’s a constant worry for me. 

I don’t know what to do with my life. I don’t know what to do with my night. I don’t know what to do a month from now. I feel distanced from a life that was once rife with excitement and curiosity, now replaced by a dull drumming ennui. I am tired of being hurt and of every day being a struggle. I am tired of loss, because everyone I love has always left. I dream of writing or picking up an instrument, but I am so tired of losing. I can’t remember the last concrete, self-actualizing goal I set for myself. I am scared of the future, and I dread the intention-less, empty adulthood ahead of me. I don’t know what to do. I quit my part-time job because I couldn’t do the commute and the stress, but the abdication of responsibilities in my life has left me feeling even more confused and directionless. 

What should I do? Where do I go from here, especially since I have my whole life ahead of me? What should I remind myself? What are books I should read? Thanks for reading all of that, in part writing this has endowed me with a strange, momentary catharsis. 

TL;DR: Struggling with issues at home. No familial support network waiting for me. Lacking hope. Can’t drive, stuck in a somewhat rural area and feel lost. Any advice? Any good books to read?",05Mar2020,1
918,"So we do communicate but his just keeps end up happening over and over.
We are long distance friends, about 3 hours away from each other. Use to live a lot closer till about 2016 when I moved.
We text semi daily but it’s like she doesn’t like to talk to me unless it’s about what’s going on with her?
It’s not all the time but it’s enough to where it’s starting to annoy me. It makes me not want to talk to her as much because I feel like I’m gonna be ignored. Even when she sends me something I’ll eventually reply to the picture or what ever she sent me. Even if it was several hours ago.

Her excuses are always, got a migraine, reading fan fiction, watching YouTube, etc.
Migraines I can except here and there, she’s on several meds and it happens. But she’ll look and leave me on read. Like, don’t look if you’re not gonna reply some way of “I’ll reply later yada yada yada”

Thing is, this has happened several times before and I start to distance myself a tad and not say as much and then she’ll get mad because I’m not talking about my life with her.
Like, i don’t need to tell you everything of my life.
We’re both artists, I try to send her my WIPs and finished drawings and see what she thinks, normally I get nothing it seems.
I try to send a funny picture to get some kind of conversation going, nothing. I say something that happened at work, nothing.

I’ve been slowly kind of checking out I feel like. I adore her and she’s my only friend besides my BF. I don’t want to lose her, but I can’t keep with this.

Any advice??",05Mar2020,1
919,"I have a very strange relationship with one of my co-workers. Let's call her Sarah. Me and Sarah have another co-worker, lets call her Kristen. For a while, the three of us were pretty close. We'd talk, Skype each other throughout the day, eat lunch together, share stories about our lives and relationships, everything friends would do even if you didn't work together. 

About 9 months into working at our job, Sarah started to act really weird towards just me and no one else. Anytime I would say anything during a meeting, she would call me out as if I was saying something completely stupid and useless. I would try to contribute, but she would just say ""Uh, no. We do it like this."" and it was always said in an aggressive way (Most of the time people backed me up because she was actually wrong, and I was right). Regardless, it was really weird. She never called anyone else out, it's like she waits for me to start talking so she could call me out specifically. 

I tried to ignore it and figured I was just imagining things. After all, we were pretty close and I gave her no reason to be mean to me. I also figured maybe it was just her personality. I went on with my life and just tried to ignore it. Eventually she would start to call me out not only in meetings, but whenever I would tell a story, it seemed like she was looking for a reason to pick it apart. Anything I said, she wouldn't even let me finish before interrupting me and saying that I was wrong or I could've/should've done this or that. Again, it was always said in a very condescending way as if she was trying to prove that she knew something I didn't know and was trying to take me down and come out on top. Whenever she talked or was showing pictures of something, she would skip right over me and not even look at me. She would show everyone else except me and Kristen noticed one time that I was trying to lean over and see but every time I leaned over, she would show someone else so I couldn't see. If I was ever talking, she would either try to find flaws or she would interrupt and change the subject. Again, I would try to ignore it but eventually I just stopped contributing during conversations. I would be very quiet so she had no reason to be mean to me. 

She was never like this with Kristen. Her and Kristen got along the same as if nothing happened. I spent weeks sitting and thinking about what I possibly could have done to make her act different, but I'm baffled. After about a week of not talking, she all of a sudden would start being nice to me again as if nothing happened. She would laugh and joke with me, not interrupt, never try to find flaws in my stories, nothing had changed. It was so strange, but I wasn't about to question it. I figured she must have been having a hard time at home.

Fast forward a few months and the cycle starts all over again. The condescending tones, interrupting, trying to find flaws in everything, excluding me from conversations, everything. But still, no change in attitude towards Kristen or any other coworkers. And this time, it was worse. She would be more aggressive with how she called me out and if I tried to explain myself, she would fight more. It's like she always has to be right. She would try to fight me on stuff she couldn't prove either and fight over a personal experience I had. Again, I stopped talking and again, she tried to be nice again. This has been going on for a while.

This last cycle was the worst. I stopped eating lunch with Kristen and Sarah because Sarah was just so horrible to me. And again, you guessed it, she started being extra nice to me. And that's where we are now.

I have to work very closely on a project with her and she drives me crazy. I hate my job now because of her and I dread going to work. How should I handle this situation? I feel like it's not bad enough to where I should go to my boss, and I don't want Kristen or any of my other coworkers to think I'm hard to get along with. I also don't want to tell any of them because they're all friends with her and since Sarah hasn't treated anyone else differently, I don't want them to tell her or think I'm just badmouthing her. I just don't know what to do. And I guess if no one has any advice, just letting this all out feel so good so thank you for reading this far.",05Mar2020,1
920,"I met this girl, we'll call her A, in April of 2017 through a kik groupchat focused on a band I liked at the time. There were a lot of people in the group so I talked to them all but she stuck out the most. At first we talked platonically, got to know each other, and bonded over our mutual love of different bands. She has insomnia and my sleeping schedule was really messed up at the time so when everyone else was asleep we would be the only two left awake. As a result, we got a lot closer.

 Eventually the conversation turned flirtatious and she ended up confessing that she liked me. In July of 2017 we started dating but the relationship was unfortunately short-lived. Everything happened so fast and I ended up breaking up with her after a month because I was confused about my own feelings. She was understandably really hurt by this and we stopped talking to each other because she needed time to process and move on. I continued to talk to another mutual friend from the group chat during this time but I really missed A. 

After about a month she returned, claiming she had gotten over me and we resumed our friendship. Things were a bit tense at first but the tension eventually settled and we fell back into our usual banter. Cut to now, it's going on three years since we met and things have stayed basically the same.

 In the past two years we've both confessed multiple times that we still love one another and continue to flirt but A has made it clear that she's either scared of or not ready for a commitment. She's had crushes over the past couple years since we broke up but none of them have lasted very long because she's still in love with me. She had a boyfriend for like six months last year before she came to the conclusion that she's a lesbian. It's been pretty much the same for me. I was talking to someone a couple months ago and I liked them but A was always a constant thought in the back of my mind. 

The way I feel about her kind of scares me. I've never loved someone this much unless they were family. At this point, I'm almost afraid to date her and risk losing our wonderful friendship if things weren't to work out, though it almost feels like we're already dating without an official label on it. She gets jealous if I talk to anyone else in a romantic way, though I've only done it once or twice in an attempt to get over her.  

I guess my question is: should I keep waiting for her or move on? If the answer is the latter, then how? The thought of cutting contact with her breaks my heart but I don't know what else to do. Could we ever be just friends?",05Mar2020,1
921,"I’ve realised I gravitate towards men who end up not wanting anything serious from me, they use me when it suits them. 
When I actually connect with a guy on an emotional level, I get scared. 
I’ve had 2 dates with a guy called “Dave”. 
Last night we sat on my verandah and spoke for 7 hours straight with no lull in conversation or awkwardness at all. 
We really connected on so many levels. 
He missed the last train and slept over and we cuddled all night. 
This level of intimacy scared the shit out of me and I could feel my self start to try to nitpick him and turn myself off him, and I have no idea why. 

I can’t let myself be vulnerable. I’m scared of affection, I’m way more comfortable just having meaningless sex with someone and that’s were my confidence lies. As soon as real emotions and feelings get mixed up I feel grossed out.

922,"Hi everyone,

I'm  sitting in a library at the moment, applying to jobs and wanting this mental stress and uncertainty to go away. Since January of this year, I  have lived paycheck to paycheck and am finally at the trickling end of  what I have left in my accounts -- and am silently terrified while  somehow remaining calm on the outside. I have a couple hundred dollars  left in my checking, the same in my business savings, and a few hundred  dollars in my personal savings account. I have about $5,500 in credit  card debt which has amassed from my last art show, travel to/from school  (as I study for weekend intensives at an out-of-state university), and I  now put my bills on the CC, as well as my public transportation fare,  and groceries.

**BACKGROUND:**  I live in one of the most expensive metropolitan areas in the world,  live with two other housemates and am doing my best to keep going. I am a  college-educated woman with 12 years of professional experience under  my belt in media and the arts. I don't feel as much of a failure as I  used to, but I feel exhausted, misunderstood, and unwanted / unloved  simply because I am not getting callbacks and 'no one seems to want me.'  It seems like I can't get a foot into the door anywhere.  I cannot  stress enough that I have always been frugal (but not tight) with money,  and have never excessively spent money on clothes, shoes, beauty  products, etc.

I started applying  to jobs as soon as I found out a client (who was responsible for a large  source of my income) could not renew my contract because she was  experiencing financial hardship. This was back in December. I had three  interviews with a startup that culminated with, ""Oh, we've changed the  scope of the role, and won't be hiring for it anymore."" I was gutted.  Two months of waiting, and three rounds of interviews and that was sent  in an email. Needless to say, there has been *a lot*  of flakiness from clients, job prospects, and people actually demeaning  my self-worth and professional experience over the past two months. I  recently received a text message, saying: 'Your rate is more than what I  get paid. I'm putting my neck on the line for you so buck up and accept  the rate. You don't have room to negotiate.' Talk about seething /  feeling deflated / just another nail in the coffin that is my brain. I  have applied to bakeries, galleries, restaurants, bars, and -- nothing.

I  have had very little income the last two months as an artist and  consultant (I work with art-oriented businesses and organize and manage  their goals, including scheduling, curating, developing marketing  strategies, etc.). I've been freelancing for five years, and am at the  end, I feel, even though that is such a gutting thing to admit. I've had  several art shows of my own work for which I am beyond grateful, worked  with amazing clients and teams over the years, but was hardly paid my  worth, which is partially my fault, and partially the client saying 'I  can't pay that right now' and me taking the job anyways because I needed  the money.

**CURRENTLY:**  Needless to say, I am just looking for reasons to keep going. I KNOW  things will come my way, as the universe is throwing some interesting  opportunities toward me, but they don't translate into pay in order to  survive in this city. I visited BOA (my bank of 10+ years) to discuss  hardship and the advisor actually chuckled and said, ""Honey, you don't  have a lot of debt."" I was shocked, repulsed and almost burst into  tears. No, I don't have six figures in debt from earning a doctorate,  but I also have *very* little  money coming in. I have asked friends if their places are hiring, and a  lot of them are experiencing hiring freezes because of Coronavirus / the  economic 'downturn'. I have even considered becoming an escort or  joining a website which matches you with someone 'looking for company.' I  have also considered asking my parents for money, but I haven't asked  them for anything financially in almost 15 years, and to me it's an  absolute embarrassment as I completely brought this on myself.

In  the end, I am beyond embarrassed that I am in this financial abyss and  in a occupational cul-de-sac, even though I have a great skills set in  organization, creativity, ideation, management, etc.

Can anyone offer constructive feedback, words of wisdom, kindness, etc.? Am I missing something / experiencing tunnel vision?

I'm completely confused here. I've lost hours before, days even. Not entire weeks, though. I remember working on the 4th already. I remember working all the way up to the 16. I remember conversations I had, I remember people I met. I remember what I did.

It includes two sets of best friends, so I am the outsider as my best friend is in college and therefore isn’t apart of my daily group. They never really take notice of me and only use me if they haven’t done the homework because they know I will have done it and they can therefore copy and not get into trouble. For example(I’m gonna call her Anne for privacy) Anne will copy my homework and then take the credit when the teacher congratulates her on MY correct answers. She will also turn on you in a second if you do anything she doesn’t like and spill all your secrets without a second thought. I hope you can guess why I’m a little scared of her. 

I have another non-toxic group of friends that have been encouraging me for ages to leave my toxic group and join them, but I just can’t bring myself to do it. What if they completely hate me when I leave? I have most of my classes with them, so it’s not like I can just avoid them. I also know from experiences of when others have left the group that they talk about people behind their backs about how they have “a bad dress sense” and “stink like a garbage can” to name a few insults I’ve heard them say about people they used to be very friendly to.

Things have been really great for the most part but recently things have been getting a bit rough.  One of my friends has to live with his grandma with his Mom and brother because they can’t afford their own place.  This however means that they have to follow grandma’s rules, and she can be very overwhelming. The problems first showed up when my friend wanted to get a Nintendo Switch. Mom and brother wanted it too, but grandma wouldn’t allow them to get it because she believed it would rot their brains and make them not help around the house. My friend ended up buying one behind her back and when she found out she took it away. ...for seven months. Eventually he got it back but then he got all his electronics taken away for not having a good sleep schedule. He now is only allowed to use them for four hours a day.  Now computer and video games I understand, but they also include his phone in the punishment. As any millennial knows taking away the phone is a major problem.

Usually I'm one to tag along with other people, text people first because I know that once I've made a friend, I don't want to lose them as one of my worst fears is becoming lonely and digging myself into such an antisocial hole that I can't get out of and become the ""loner"" of my course.

Today one of my friends, for literally the first time, asked to tag along whilst I headed through my usual routine of visiting the cafe and getting coffee. This was so shocking for me because I'm not used to someone coming to me instead.

Unfortunately despite this going well, I have a habit of over thanking people. I think it's because them coming and interacting with me means so much that I really appreciated it. I thanked them once when we departed, and again via text later in the day.

When I told my mum about the interaction, she called me an idiot for thanking them because it makes me seem really desperate.

I'm not asking for pity; my confidence is something I have to improve by myself, yet I still have a long way to go. I'm just looking for a few tips I can apply to my mental state to become a little more detached so I don't seem so desperate for friends.

961,"I have 3 dogs. One 16 yr old female who has always been sweet and good natured. I have an 11 yr old male, that I've had since a puppy, who is very attached to me and never leaves my side. I rescued a golden retriever lab mix 3 yrs ago with aggression issues but never knew how severe they were when I brought him home. He was a  close family members dog and the 2 yrs before I got him he had to spend most of his days in a crate due to children being born into the family. He was neglected and ignored when the kids came along. I decided to bring him to my home as he could no longer be in that particular home due to growling at his owners. My male dog and him do not get along. There have been more fights than I can count and the rescue has had to wear a basket muzzle due to the incredible intensity of his fighting. I live alone and it is very hard to break up these incidents by myself, esp since he is so focused. The rescue weighs in at 92 lbs of solid muscle...my other male weighs 62 lbs. Fast forward 3 yrs and I am having dog fights in my home at least once a week. Sometimes its as often as every other day. I know that the rescue would seriously injure or kill the smaller one if he had the chance. The smaller male has had some issues too but his behavior is getting worse as well. The stress in my home is unbelievable at this point. What do I do? I'm considering euthanizing the rescue. I love all my animals and want them to be happy but I can't tolerate this behavior any longer and I am totally heartbroken about it. I've tried everything I can to make this work. Just for additional info. I was bitten by the rescue on my thigh prior to him wearing a muzzle while trying to break up a fight...which is why he wears one now. He bites HARD and the area is still numb to this day. The smaller male has picked fights with the rescue but is not nearly as intense and after a few no's will usually stop and listen to me. My heart is in agony. So my question is: who would euthanize and why? Who thinks it's wrong to euthanize and why? Who else has had to make this decision and what is the rationale?

My grandma was diagnosed with stage 4 lymphoma at age 76. 2 weeks after her diagnosis she passed away. A month later (33 days) to be exact, my grandfather died from heart disease. As long as I remember, my parents, sisters and I lived with my grandparents. After they passed my parents didnt have the finances to keep the house we lived in until I turned 20. The house was foreclosed and my parents were forced to rent. They found a place, got evicted and had to move in with my sister. After a year or so there they got evicted. I let them live with me and my husband for 4 months until they found where they currently rent. Ever since the day my grandparents passed away, my parents have been taking advantage of me, but this last year has been the worst. Both my parents had heart surgery last year. My dad was forced to retire. He was 68. My mom hasnt worked since I was very young. I'm 26 now. My mom had 3 instances where her heart stopped. She now has an ICD which is a permanent heart defibrillator. Her health has been going downhill since last year and continues to get worse. A few weeks ago I had her admitted to a mental health facility because she wasnt caring for herself and she was having suicidal thoughts. She was there 4 days and was sent home because her insurance ran out. Thats at least what she told me. She was supposed to start therapy but has been making excuses as to why she cant. My mom is queen of excuses and has always been liar. Over the last 6 years she has been making constant excuses for everything. Examples: my 34 year old sister and 24 year old sisters still live with her and she doesnt have the guts to kick them out or tell them it's time to move. My older sister cannot hold down a job and when she does she spends her money carelessly and doesnt help with bills or rent. My younger sister doesnt have a HS diploma, driver's license and has never held a job. Clearly my mom is an enabler. The whole point of this post is for this concern. I took my dad to the food pantry today and while we were sitting there, he told me my mom had an accident the other day all over the bathroom and left it there, and the next day my dad went and took a putty knife and cleaned it all up. My mom didnt clean it up and she didnt see it as an issue. I'm worried something more is going on with my mom mentally. Does anybody have any advice?

973,"I don't work in receiving. I engrave part numbers on blank parts after they are inspected and before they go into inventory department. Our old quality inspector left the job and people have been filling in for him, trained by my manager who barely knows the process of quality inspection. Ever since these new people have been coming in inspecting. I have been catching items that were not physically counted but received as the quantity that the vendor put on the package. The package was not opened and as I opened it I discovered 2 parts were missing. I brought it to the attention of the receiving manager and he says he's not supposed to physically count small parts. There were 200 metal parts in egg crates stacked in layers of 30 and 1 layer was missing 2 in the middle of the stack. I am not obligated to count but I pointed it out and suddenly it became an argument about orders needing quantity verification. 

His argument was: I don't count small parts, if the package says the quantity then its right. 

Result = missing parts and nobody knows how they got missing from the time it entered the building to cycle count after inventory accepts it as the number it was received and inspected. The receiver and inspector both enter the quantities after their duty, then inventory enters what they enter and stock it. The cycle count is when they catch the mistakes....

&amp;#x200B;

My argument: The person receiving should unpack and count every item with the exception of screws which if its so critical, use a scale. The quality inspector should also inspect the items ""double check"" if anything since they input the quantity they inspected as well. 

Result= if you catch a part missing before it is received, you can address it with the vendor.

I need advice on how to cope with my guilt.

      My mom is a raging alcoholic and chain smoker since before I was born (fetal alcohol baby here!). She works at a grocery store currently and uses all of her money from her job to get beer. Once she runs out of that she will take any money in sight to get her fix. She’s stolen thousands from my dad in the form of checks and credit/debit cards and cash. She’s taken money from all of my family members no matter the age. Book fair money, chore money, work money, birthday money, literally anything. She acts mortified and accusatory when you confront her and ultimately leads to nothing. 

    Anyways, she stole my debit card and car and took off to the liquor store. I was struggling at the time (only 19) and had about $35 in my account. She had used all of that and then some causing me to go into the negative. Each day I was charged $34 for not paying it. I was a bit a slow to notice and didn’t get notified so when I did check I was a couple hundred in debt. I filed a police report, they came over and questioned her. She was drunk when they arrived and denied everything, said I was with shady people, it was a tinder person who did it, I owed her money blah blah blah. They caught her on tape and bada bing bada boom ARRESTED... but then eventually let go and given a court date. My dad hasn’t been able to do this to her bc they are married and there are some technicalities to that (no joint account tho) and he can’t bring himself to actually report her. She’s being charged with a felony or a few (one of them being identity theft)

My family was torn on me going through with this, some said she can never get a job again, and it’s cruel while others said it’s about time and it’s for the best. 
I see both sides, she’s childlike in that she’s unable to support herself and lacks in the reasoning department. 

I’m really struggling with the decision I made, she’s my mom and I love her. When she’s not drinking (bc she’s broke and can’t find money) she will act motherly and do her best to help out with laundry or dishes or cooking but when she begins to drink she’s not helpful, overbearing and just overwhelming if she hasn’t become violent and belligerent yet.

  I feel a massive guilt at times bc I don’t want her to struggle in prison or become further depressed or miss out on life with her family. I just don’t think I can bear to see my dad suffer with her destructive habits.


background if you have time to read after that novel:

     There’s no reasoning with her, it’s like talking to a brick wall. She’s been fired from dozens of jobs bc of her drinking and being hungover. She’s been to rehab but ultimately leaves early bc she can’t deal with being sober. She calls the police when she feels like she’s in the right, she will say she’s been raped, beaten or threatened to get people out of the house so she can drink. This has gotten both of the men in my family arrested several times by police who don’t listen. She’s thrown bleach at my dad, thrown away phones, broken TV’s, broken any electronics us kids liked at the time, ran over my dads foot eventually breaking it, she’s given family pets away and even stolen our cars. Nothing is safe. Keys, money, literally anything of valuable has to be hidden. 

    Her side of the family enables her (they live 20 hours away) — specifically her mom. She calls her and cries about how she’s abused by us and her mom sends her money. Her mom knows the situation but is as equally in denial as she’s her troubled only daughter (she has 5 brothers). Her brothers have threatened my dad, my cousin has threatened me it’s incredibly frustrating.",05Mar2020,1
983,"Hey I (F21) have been dating my boyfriend (M23) for over 3 years. Over the last 6 months we have been having trouble in the bedroom. He has had a history of not being able to stay hard for the whole session but we can usually figure out a way to get him to finish. For the last 4-6 months he has has more trouble staying hard and is consistently not finishing during sex. Of course we don’t discuss this other than we will try again in the morning. 

I can’t help but take this really personally and I would be lying if I didn’t miss having sex with people who are hard and who can finish - this makes me feel extra guilty because I love my boyfriend very much. But I feel he is no longer attracted to me but I know that it is likely erectile dysfunction and not me because He makes it clear to me that he finds me very attractive. I’ve asked him what he wants or what I can do and I always try to do my best to meet those desires. I try to compliment him and comment on how attractive I think he is outside the bedroom as well. However, that often does nothing. I am a personal trainer and have been taking extra workouts in the gym to stay fit for him.

I want to have a healthy sex life, I want to be with someone who makes me feel attractive and desirable. I’m tired of having to try so hard to have sex that we both enjoy.

Should I take extra care/have reason to be scared? I was recently diagnosed with a virus that lasts 12/15 weeks, it makes me (M20) slightly weaker than usual. Except for that I'm healthy, an ex-athlete and eating/drinking well.

985,"Hello my name is Ryan Peabody I'm a 32-year-old male with cerebral palsy. I was born in 6 weeks premature as a result I suffered brain damage at birth. According to the doctors I was supposed to be dead at 3 years old and then they changed it to 5. they did not know what my development of capabilities would be and never expecting me to be able to talk. The only thing they got right is I am unable to walk.

Growing up as a child I did not get the proper therapy I should have due to other people's choices. Through what would be too long a story to tell here 7 years ago I started living with somebody who was able to take better care of me and was able to get me the proper therapy and equipment I needed. It took some time when I started living with her but over the last 5 years I've been going to physical therapy on a regular basis.

During these last five years I can now sit up on my own and my posture has gotten better. Though it took time within the last two and a half they finally got me to where I can take steps. However the equipment they have to use at therapy for me to walk with is 25 years old. And I need something better something called a gait trainer.

I've tried going through the proper channels. The insurance company will not pay for a walking device and a wheelchair it's one or the other. And if I get the gait trainer I will be listed as being able to walk. And even though I have put in the work I'm not quite at the point where I could get rid of my wheelchair.

I've been trying to get the gait trainer since the end of October beginning of the member. With no luck I've exhausted all my resources earlier this week I started to go fund me. A friend of mine suggested I post my GoFundMe on Reddit. I'm not sure what the best subgroup is for this or how many people will see this I really would like my GoFundMe to go viral if anybody can give me advice on how I can get more people to see my GoFundMe or if you would like to donate or help share my link.

My husband is more concerned about the societal impacts of it spreading (eg. mania in grocery stores and things being sold out, supply chain shortages, daycare and schools closing &amp; essentially holing up in our house with our newborn/toddler if need be). It started as a joke when one night he literally left in the middle of the night and bought like $500 worth of supplies (food, diapers, formula, sanitizer, toilet paper etc.) But now, it’s gotten to the point of everyday I see new amazon orders for gloves, hand sanitizers, cleaning supplies, masks, batteries, water purifiers, portable toilet etc. I have asked him to stop on multiple occasions. Some of these things are expensive (like $50+ for masks). He will not listen to me. He is a pretty intelligent man (policy and economics background) and he using his knowledge in this area to justify his continued purchasing. I am feeling overwhelmed and frankly, disrespected that he is not hearing my concern that there doesn’t appear to be a limit to his preparations and spending. There is no history of mental health (he does have ADHD that is managed with medication). I’m just at my wits end with the spending and all this survivor stuff that is accumulating in our house.

995,"So i'm 19 and from Romania..I'm in the last year of high school, and in June i have this final exam that we call ""BAC"" wich consist in 3 different exams that differ from one high school profile to another. When i entered high school at 14-15 years old i have chosen a pedagogical profile because i've always wanted to become a psychology teacher so my final exams are in romanian literature, mathematics and base psychology.

The thing is i dont find the motivation and time to study for those exams, and we have A LOT to study, the problem is that my profile is very time consuming, we have this pedagogical practice in wich we go to kindergarden and elementary school and teach whatever our proffesors tell us to teach to the little children. I love teaching children and i have a lot of beautiful memories with them, but i'm starting to hate this profile because, we have to be good at everything. The expectations from my high school are enormous and my class is a very competing one (From a class with 27 studens, i was in 11th place with a GPA of 9.47..Max GPA here is 10). We have all the subjects other profiles have, even tho we dont study them as deep as the other profiles study their subjects, we must know everything because our teachers always say ""You are going to teach children, so if they ask you about ... you must know""

The competition, the practice, maintaining a decent GPA, having to work after school, all these things often consume me, i am aleays tired, and never have time for myself and sometimes i just want to fuck it all and give up. I dont have family problems, i don't have relationship problems, i don't have friendship problems, i may only have some financial problems but as long as i have food to eat its ok, every other aspect of my life is kinda perfect, so how can i manage school stress to not put me down so often? Even tho i am 1,85m and a pretty big guy, i found myself crying a lot of time because of this stress. No motivation to study for the BAC, no motivation to teach children, i lost my motivation on everything. I really need some advice about managing stress and school work.

I don't think i have explained well the school sistem here in romania so if you have any questions about that i can answer them. Or if any other fellow romanian can explain better than me, i would appreciate. Thank you for your advices in advance !",05Mar2020,1

Car is a 1998 Acura integra with 91k miles well now that don’t really matter lol. so the mechanics at the shop told me I can continue driving it as is as long as I keep up w the oil and make sure it doesn’t burn through the oil.

going to keep this short and sweet, all of the relationships i’ve been in have either been incredibly toxic or physically abusive. my most recent relationship was with a man who i thought was perfect, compared to my history he was so sweet and nice to me. he left me for another woman, but lied to me about it for months whilst insisting we stayed friends while he was dating her. lied to the point that he was gaslighting me about the situation everytime i brought it up because i felt like something was just off with why he left me, and he went so far as to call me manipulative for questioning his reasons. i found all of this out recently, and i’m not quite sure what to do. i’ve always been an emotional person, if i was sad i was sad and i would cry, if i was crushing on someone i would physically feel the butterflies when i’d see them or they’d message me etc etc. for the past few months after this situation ive felt like i’m broken. it’s like my brain is covered in cotton wool and anytime i experience an emotional thought it gets cut off right away. if i get the opportunity to cry it lasts me 2 minutes and then i’m right back to feeling nothing. i want to work out how i feel about this situation within myself and i want to deal with it, but everytime i try to think about it it’s like my brain just switches off. i’ve stayed away from relationships since the breakup because i want to better myself and really work through my issues before i get into something, but i’ve met someone that i really really like. but this time i don’t feel anything. they make me extremely happy, but physically it’s not there. i don’t want to get into anything because i’m terrified of hurting someone but i don’t know what to do. i don’t know how to work through this and would really appreciate some advice? again, apologies if this is the wrong place, if you have any alternative subreddits please link me :)

1015,"I feel like there's a fine yet undefined line between self promotion and spam on various places online. Lately I've been posting here and onto Facebook groups every time I post a new video on my channel, and every so often I'll share an older video around too. Sometimes I feel like it's maybe too much? But then I think, well how else am I going to get the results that I want? What exactly is the difference between promoting myself and spam? 

YouTube and the internet in general is highly highly competitive, and all I'm trying to do is get myself ahead in a way, and get myself noticed.. Because I genuinely think I make some really good content with thought out points and pretty sleek editing that I put a lot of work into, and I have some pretty original ideas for videos every so often too. (I do movie reviews, but inbetween the basic current movie reviews I do video essays and other more original stuff) I guess everyone thinks this but I think the videos that I put up are worthy of a wider audience - And when videos do actually get views, people seem to like them a lot.. it's just that, they often go by unnoticed. I don't have the traction, I don't have the promotional advantage.. 

My channel has grown a little this year as I've been concentrating on a regular schedule and getting 2-3 videos a week out unlike in my past where the uploads were sporadic. Like I said the engagement is great when I get it and when people see the videos, it's just people actually seeing the videos that's a problem to begin with. How can I get that advantage I'm looking for (other than luck) My thumbnails are of pretty good quality, I research tags to see what's effective, I put long descriptions in with credits where they are due and links to my social media accounts and I post my videos in groups and subreddits where I deem relevant. What more can I be doing? 

And also, the very very slow growth, as opposed to no growth, has made me want to post post post more and more. Which feels more and more spammy, and also I hate doing it. It's boring, I feel intrusive and it's hard to keep track of. But the small results are there. And THAT makes me feel like I should be doing more, like if those efforts are showing SMALL results then logically that only means doing more would increase the success of this right? And by this point, I'm also asking all this here because I feel like I'm becoming too obsessed with views and likes and stuff. Constantly checking updates, constantly consumed by whether something was a success or not or if I'm annoying people or if people online like me.. etc... I don't exactly know what I'm asking here but I just thought it was relevant to the overall question. 

I love making videos. I love editing. I've been doing it for nearly 4 years with not heaps to show from it. I've got some, I've currently got 233 subscribers which I understand isn't nothing. Every single subscriber is a whole person with their own entire world viewpoint and life expierence and they all decided that I was worth subbing to. That does feel like a big deal. I am proud of that. But the thing is that I get increasingly frustrated when I see crappy, lazy unimaginative content get more attention than me. It's hard. I spend a lot of time on all of my videos, but I also spend a lot of time thinking about all this. I did get around 10 subscribers in the last week. That doesn't feel like nothing. It's a massive improvement for where I'm at at my level at the moment. But because of that I feel like promoting more and more. When does it become too much and just become annoying spam? I figured if I post in DIFFERENT FB groups and different subreddits and not post the same video in the same ones over and over then it would be all good because they're entirely seperate pages. I dunno, it's tough. 

I'm gonna keep going at it and keep trying, and keep making good content and with the slow build it could really start taking off. I'm trying to be optimistic. I dunno, in the end I guess I'm just asking; what advice can you give me?",05Mar2020,1
1016,"Ok, so a year or two ago, when I used to use Tumblr to look up porn, I used to look up ""scally"" porn, which effectively is men in tracksuits and things like that.

While I'm almost certain that anything I may have ""got off"" to included men of legal age (I'm not attracted to people that look suspiciously underage), I am concerned that other material in the groups I looked at were of underage men (fully clothed).

This might be an unstemmed fear, but I have reported groups on Tumblr in the past for what clearly had underage shirtless boys, so my concern has been heightened since then.

1018,"Hello Reddit, I am looking for life advice and please bear with me, this is going to be  a long one. 

I am recently 24 years old. Early last year my girlfriend and I broke up. I dropped out of college, 1 semester away from my associates, and I moved out of our low income apartment, and stayed in my grandma's old house. I was a foster kid for a good part of my life, so my support is low, and still attempting to figure out everything on my own. 

I started a business that is growing today and I am connected with a team who can help with life mentor-ship. Just wanting to lay out a basis for what lays ahead. 

As of October of last year, I was in a severe car accident. I was tboned at 62 mph, and I suffered a severe brain hemorrhage, a severe TBI, and a broken c3. I spent 6 days in ICU, and another 7 days in rehab. 33 days after this accident, I was in a second accident where I suffered a minor concussion and another portion of my neck which I had broke, my c4. I went into emergency surgery, and had a double cervical fusion. Due to limited support in the United States, I moved to Dominican Republic where my dad resides.  He offered me a room to stay in, while he is building a new company of real estate. While I was down there, I did all the social media marketing and website building for this company he is starting. This is a brand new business, and no sales have happened just yet. So this is my question for all.

I recently have come back to the United States because I have been officially cleared to start working again. I have no clue which route I would like to take. I could live in Dominican with my father and continue working on the real estate business, however due to the coronavirus, prospects have fallen. Or I could stay here in the United States, and get my own place and continue to build my business here with my team.  However, I have never truly lived on my own, and due to my condition, my work is limited as well as I don't have a degree, so expenses would be high while trying to fund my business. 

I will be moving soon out of where I am now, and I have until April to make a decision. I am not swinging either way. I would like some advice from others to see what option would be best for this moment. 

Should I go back to go school? Should I find a job and build this business with mentorship from my team? Or should I move down to Dominican Republic with a hopeful future with real estate despite the adversity with the current global crisis?

1020,"So I recently got a new job and everything is really great about it. I have no complaints whatsoever about my pay, hours, benefits, or my bosses. The company seems really good and seems like somewhere I could stay for a long while. 

There’s just one problem: one of the other people I work with in close proximity is /constantly/ rude and talks down to me. I consider myself a relatively intelligent person but I know that no one knows everything and I constantly look to others for knowledge given that they have all worked there for a lot longer than I have. Someone acting like I am a dumb person is one of the few ways for me to lose me cool very quickly. Not that I would ever show that I’m upset really, but it still gets to me and sours my mood. 

Even unrelated to the job, I will say good morning to this person when they walk in or “drive safe/have a good day” when they leave but the only thing I get from them is either a grunt or silence. I’m doing everything I can to be respectful and considerate of this person but it makes no difference. I also know they are not this way with others as they are perfectly responsive, communicative, and chipper with others. 

How do I deal with a person like this? Do I talk to my boss about it, or deal with it on my own? I don’t expect everyone to like me but this person is single-handedly souring my mood a couple times a day. I just want to gain knowledge and be able to function on my own and they treat me like I have no common sense whatsoever and like I have no brain of my own. I do ask questions but it’s so that I can be explicitly clear in the expected quality of my work. How do I handle this?

Thank you in advance for time spent answering. I will check back periodically and respond to any questions or comments.",05Mar2020,1

1024,"I received a speeding ticket marked as 89 MPH in a 65 MPH zone in Los Angeles County in California. This is a 1-point ticket, and less than 25 MPH over the speed limit, but the Los Angeles County Court website is not allowing me to request traffic school online.  This is the first traffic ticket I have ever received and as such I have no points on my license. Why am I unable to request traffic school? How should I go about requesting traffic school to avoid the point on my public driving record? I don't intend to fight the ticket.",05Mar2020,1
1026,I'm a young programmer that has been exploring programming for the last 3 years. I feel somewhat confident with my knowledge and have people to ask when I am stuck but I always seem to come to this nightmare of getting a job as a programmer and not being able to apply those skills in practical situations that a business would go through. I then doubt my knowledge and spiral into thoughts of disbelief that I will ever get out of where I am now. This is kind of a weird and obscure topic but I thought maybe one of you guys may have felt the same way. If you have a better place I can put this please tell me,05Mar2020,1
1027,"My sister and i rented an apartment together march 2019, november 2019 we had a falling out. I moved, even though i paid all of the deposit, i also find out at this time that i am the only one on the lease, i don't tell my sister so she doesn't run and leave the apartment. And i start working with her to transfer the lease completely over to her.

Now, she has never completed getting the lease transferred, she needed to provide a proof of income, and since she works for a pyramid scheme, cannot. 

I checked with her boyfriend regularly and i check the payments for about 3 months, her boyfriend says don't worry about it we will get it taken care of, since they /had/ been taking care of it i let up.

I come home today to a letter from a lawyer saying ""after viewing court records i see you have an eviction notice, i can help you fight it blah blah...."". I look up local court records, and what do you know, my name due for court, 3/9/20. I have never been served, this is my first time hearing about ANYTHING, since my sister refuses to speak with me and i have to get information from her boyfriend. 

I am at a loss for words, and I'm terrified about what the outcome of this will be, and i don't even know what to do, if i need to do anything. Please help. Do i need to go to court on monday? Am i at fault for this? I live somewhere else and pay my bills just fine.

I have access to the online payment app still, i checked it today and it says no payment due, and 3 payments have gone through just today, one has a label of ""eviction fee"" on it. 

I'm really not sure what happens now, I don't have any papers being served to me, yet i still see i have to go to court on monday, i do not know what happens now.

I've already posted this in legal advise but i don't think the mods like me there, so please, anything helps.",05Mar2020,1
