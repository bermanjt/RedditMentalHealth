1,"I work with this girl and her boyfriend doesn't want me hanging out with her. They met in a similar situation where he was dating another girl and then him and her started hanging out and then he started going out with her so hes jealous and worried that she's gonna leave him for me, but we don't feel that way. I don't like her in that way and she doesn't like me in that way. so what do we do to make it so that the boyfriend isnt stopping us from being friends because right now it feels like she doesn't want to send me messages on the phone anymore because she's afraid of what he'll say. I dont want to lose her as a friend. What do I do?",05Jun2020,1
2,"I recently shared a post regarding BLM and how if you identify as Christian but are still in the camp of 'all lives matter' you need a refresher on the parable from Luke 15.

To summarize - Jesus has 100 sheep, loses one. Jesus leaves the 99 to go after the one. The 99 say 'what about us? Don't we matter?' of course the 99 still matter... But they're not the ones in danger. The one sheep is.

My (white, midwest) cousin responded saying ""I don't see how this is comparable to talking to races or species. The sheep was lost meaning he needed found. He wasn't outcasted and abused but LOST. He needed HELP. We all need help. It doesn't matter race or species. We are following Christ and are in his pasture so he does not have to go find us to ""save"" us because we are already saved. All lives DO matter and what happened was a pure tragedy. Black lives matter IS important but needs to start in their own communities. They need to treat themselves that way. Instead they are using it as an excuse. It is all very sad.""

How do I respond?",05Jun2020,1
3,I have had a lot of jobs from hostess to software developer and I always end up crying and hating my jobs. I need to pay bills so I need a job. What can I do? I don’t like anything.

4,So I am currently 13 years old and about go to high school but I feel like I am not ready and really worried about my future. My Asian parents want me to become a doctor ever since I was born and I am afraid that I will not be able to complete their dream and they have always worked so hard to get me everything that I ever wanted. I am not sure how will I make my parents proud and really worried about what if I did not become a doctor as my parents want me to be. Every time I think about this I always burst into tears and my parents always tell me how hard they work and how so they want me to become a doctor but I don't know if I can. I am ok at studies and education but no way near to the top as my parents want me to be( i also don't like to study anything that is hard and anything that I can't understand after a while) I probably sound really stupid about crying when I am 13 but I am really worried. So how should I deal with this situation and worry not a lot or get motivation?,05Jun2020,1

8,"I'm friends with these 2 people that I've known for like 3 years they were my first friends in the area one is a boy and one is a girl they are really good friends but one acts really gay. I started being clingy with one of them and I got shunned by both of them because the one I was clingy to stopped talking to me (we still friends tho) and the other stopped aswell. (I was clingy to the girl idk why.) I sometimes ask them if they want to come out (you can meet up now 2 metres apart) and they always say no (not because of covid but because they dont want to) and I respect that I dont mind but the fact that the gay one uploads videos like ""when my friend asks me to go out and I say no because I just want to eat chips all day"" it's annoying because he just lies like he said he couldnt go out his mom wont let him but he wants to. the other one also did the same thing I called her boyfriend a simp (fr I'm not a normie he is actually a bigass simp but I'm sorta friends with him i was serious when i said it though) then she put on her story on instagram that people overuse simps and a video of someone on instagram mocking people who say simp (usually they normie I get it) im pretty sure it was aimed.


this is mainly because I've stopped being friends with them and it's annoying. I used to call them on video with 2 other people then they just stopped talking to me for no reason and the gay one said ""oh sorry the wifi went out"" which isnt funny and it's a lie they were on call when they kicked me (and my friend was kicked too they dont hang out with us that much anymore) the gay one really annoys me it isnt funny and it's actually kind of sad ngl.

9,"I'm having a political identity crisis. At this point I don't know where I stand on anything.

The thing is, my friends are all very naive and very liberal, so I am well versed in liberal talking points and ideology. While I'm stuck at home I've decided to take the time and educate myself on both sides of a very complex issue: racism. I mean, it's kinda what everyone is talking about right now. 

So if I'm really going to consider both sides I need to start educating myself more on conservative ideology. For now I am focusing my research on the Black Lives Matter movement. 

Some basic starting questions I am trying to answer are:

1. Are police brutality and lynchings really still big problems today? 
2. Why are Black Lives Matter and Blue Lives Matter enemies? 
3. What is ""welfare dependency"" and why is it so often used to describe black Americans?
4. What is ""white privilege"" and what are white people supposed to do about it?
5. Should people strive to be colorblind?
6. Why are people blaming Donald Trump for racism in America?

I appreciate any help you all are willing to offer in finding answers to these questions!",05Jun2020,1
10,"This post got removed on r/relationship_advice because it was not a question or a situation but a piece of advice and explanation. It got quite a bit of traction in its short life so this is the best place to post it. :)

&amp;#x200B;

For a long time I have had observations about a massive problem that just isn't talked about enough, and after witnessing some of the ill that comes from it and seeing other people's thoughts, I decided to give it a try and make a post about it.

Throughout my short life, I have come to witness many things related to this thing that have resulted in bad decisions that tiled the course of many people's lives. Especially on this sub (r/relationship\_advice) we can see people with issues arising from this question: age differences in relationships with the most common factors being 1. shared experience of abuse, neglect, intense longing or some kind of other missing element during the formative years of the person and 2. development of connection between two people before one person is even of age or more importantly at an even earlier period of brain and character development that directly influences behaviors of people later of age - commonly grooming. It relates to such a huge number of people most of which don't even understand the fact that age difference plays a huge (or biggest when it is relevant) part in the formation and structure of not only a relationship but the people involved in the relationship and how issues often arise from it. There are countless couples consisting of a barely-legal legal major (18-yo) dating someone biologically fully-developed and miles more experienced than them (25+) that likely often hear the age difference argument but don't understand as to why it's made and why it is important to recognize this. I have personally and as have many people in general witnessed similar situations where a much younger person is dating a significantly older person and there are two types of situations where that occurs:

The person is a mature adult dating a significantly older adult. A 28-yo woman dating a 59-year-old-man definitely raises eye brows but if the relationship began close or at this age, that person is a full-grown adult capable of making the decision to engage in romantic relations with another full-grown adult - in this case the factor of age is not important for these reasons. You can make the argument that the older partner is a much, much more experienced person, and while true, this doesn't negate that fact that the younger partner, while young and less experienced, is a full-grown adult capable to mature decision-making not influenced by developments of youth.

or

The person is a freshly-legally-adult legal major (18-yo) or around that age dating a much older, more experienced and neurally mature person who isn't influenced by a developing brain and lack of experience/pressure in their decision and has a huge effect on the development of their younger partner. In many cases, people who are abusers with a fetish or need to manipulate someone who they find attractive for their youth or for their lack of experience, naivete and submissive nature, they mold and influence that person into becoming fashioned tools for their person use while deluding that person into thinking they are doing no such thing or having the person either not pick up on it or straight-up deny it. They often lock them in with marriage and other decisions that are technically consensual but stem from careful manipulation of ideas, beliefs and patterns of thought from the older individual upon the younger one which can then culminate into various issues that often destroy or set back lives.

The fact of the matter is brain development does not finish at age 18 or even around that age, but culminates only in the mid-twenties after which the person is a mature adult capable of making entirely-informed decisions or at least ones not influenced by undeveloped brain parts such as the prefrontal cortex, the amygdala or unfinished neural wiring pruning which are all ongoing until the mid twenties. I, like many, have witnessed similar cases where more often than not the older person is a manipulator that ends up screwing over the younger person's life or limiting them in their scope of behavior and understanding and want to see more people make logical arguments and facts as to why this should not be the case and taken into consideration. That's my 2 cents on an issue which I've understood given my background in biology and one that I feel is not talked about enough, or in-depth. Thanks for the read.

The matter of in-development dating doesn't need to extend only to dating between a young person and someone older but two young people who will both experience or suffer from a lack of both experience and the incomplete developments - the difference there is no clear power structure imbalance and one-sided manipulation dangers facilitated by superior maturity but it is still important to recognize that people grow and develop and change during these years and that sometimes things fizzle out or change drastically. The more we understand about a subject, the less we fear and succumb to it. I encourage people to research about brain development, with plenty of data and studies out there, that confirm.

On the last note, I've included some technical studies on as to why specifically it is important to understand adolescence and the development period and exactly how it affects behavior and reasoning in my response here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\_advice/comments/gwrxzi/please\_please\_share\_and\_recognize\_this\_fact\_age/fswzoal?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gwrxzi/please_please_share_and_recognize_this_fact_age/fswzoal?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)

TL;DR: Brain doesn't stop developing at 18, people in relationship with huge gaps should be careful and know your brains do not work the same. (Credit to PotterheadZZ for the TL;DR)",05Jun2020,1

12,"I get paranoid. Like...a lot. For example, I legit am paranoid this very second because of how this girl I follow on insta has some connections to mean people and she blocked me? I think? Maybe just removed me as a follower. But it is cuz she talked crap about her bf who is one of my friends. I messaged him asking if he was ok and I sent him the pic and he was really upset. He said he would keep me anonymous...but it is really hard to stay anonymous when the girl only has 11 followers. I'm just afraid! I wanted to know if he was ok is all and now I'm shaking in my seat wondering if the whole ""snitches get stitches"" thing will happen to me when she sees me again. 
The thing is though...it isn't just this situation. I get paranoid about EVERYTHING. Like whether or not I locked my car doors at night, or when I go outside at night there could possibly be a criminal waiting for me, or when the UPS guy knocks on my door it might be a bad person, or when I get a sore throat that I might have the coronavirus, or when I walk to class I might have forgot to turn my car lights off. I get so paranoid and it gets really bad really fast! I sweat and I can't focus and I just get really freaking worried! 
Can anyone give me advice about not only my current situation, but my situations I have in my past? I'm just so worried and I can't live life like this! Especially when I'm about to go to college soon and there is danger left and right off a college campus!

13,"I'm a 25m and have this 21f friend I've know for two years. I've been thinking of buying a braided bracelet as a gift nothing to fancy but simple. I hangout with or use to hangout with her like all the time before the Covid virus. Last summer I hanged out with her like 2 times or 3 times every week. Mostly she asked me to hangout. We get along really well and talking to her is really easy. We both have good conversations and think some what alike. I've given her gifts I would say 3 times. Like a drawing note book for her birthday party.  during her college graduation I gave flowers and she gave me a note saying thank you for the flowers there beautiful,  and a drawing of herself. Shes an artist.


So I guess my main questions are would a bracelet  be  interpreted as a sign of friendship? or be interpreted as me wanting to go out with her. Or would it be downright creepy?


I feel like I'm almost ready to tell her what I feel and ask her out but not yet. 
I am ready for what she says. If she says yes she wants to go out cool if not cool I willingly to remain friends with her and move on but still talk to her.",05Jun2020,1
15,"So, here goes: I’ve been dating this guy for three months now. The first month was great, we were happy. Month two, not so much. Verbal arguments where I said demeaning and humiliating things....just awful to this guy. Month three he begins to react violently. Choking me until I lose consciousness, punched me in the jaw which broke it and required me to have stitches. Broke my collarbone. I called the police, he has four active aggravated assault warrants because I reported the abuse.... Anyway, he came by to apologize last night, I said I’d work on forgiveness and we watched a movie and fell asleep. When I asked him to get out of bed just now he refused and said “Don’t start that shit, I’ll kill you”. I believe him. I need him to leave but I am afraid to call the police. He has a history of assault charges and if I turn him in he would be looking at a minimum three years in prison and a maximum of 20 years in prison. So yeah, WIBTA???",05Jun2020,1
16,"My girlfriend of 6 months is currently crying at the edge of my bed right now, away from me, because I just told her a lie about something I had completely no reason to lie about.

I remember lying about little things when I was younger. Since then, (I’m 17) I’ve never taken a notice at it, ever. In fact, I don’t think I’ve really lied at all, like REALLY lied, since I was a kid. 

Up until my current relationship, that is. A couple months ago, I lied to my girlfriend about something so stupid, so pointless. But I didn’t just lie and then when she proceeded to resist my denial, I admitted to it. No, I went through with it. And kept going. And kept going until she accepted it. I still, to this day, have no idea why I lied. Genuinely. And I kept going, too. 

A couple hours ago, my girlfriend took a nap with me and was laying on top of me. While she was sleeping, I took her phone and tried opening it multiple times, until I finally got it and I went on her Twitter as, the other day, she had opened it and attempted to hide it from me. I was okay with it, and said, “Whatever.” She began moving around in her sleep, tossing and turning until she was facing me, but still had her eyes closed. Suddenly, she began waking up, and before I could close out of Twitter, she began looking for her phone. I began helping her look for it. I was hoping that she wouldn’t notice I was on Twitter, and she didn’t at the time. In fact, she stared at her screen while it was in the middle of her Twitter feed and swiped off of it. I was relieved.

Fast forward a couple hours (where everything was normal completely), she finally asked me, “Why did you go on my Twitter?” And you know what I said? I said, “What?” And she continued. I relentlessly resisted it. I swore on everything that I didn’t go through her phone, that I don’t know her password, which I surely do. And I kept resisting. Until she stared me straight in my eyes as she began bawling, saying something like, “I can’t believe you can swear on everything and lie to me straight to my face.”

Eventually, I came clean. It took her locking herself in my bathroom. And I told her to come out so I could explain while looking at her and not at a door. So, I explained. I told her that since she was hiding her Twitter (I also somewhat justified it by reminding her that she went through my phone once some months ago, but it was very innocent. And she admitted to it), I wanted to surprise her and DM her as a joke. That was complete bullshit. But I still said it and believed it. 

Afterwards, I told her that I promise, and swear on everything, that I won’t ever lie to her again. And her response was, “Yep, you said that last time.”

It kills me that I’m crushing my relationship over stupid lies. Not only could I not lie, but it’s over something that I could easily break to her. And I’m not. I’m not admitting to it. When it’s so fucking easy for me to.

So, yeah. Here I am, also silently bawling into my shirt. She’s been facing away from me this entire time that I’ve been typing this post, so I assume she’s asleep.

I just don’t know what to do. Am I a pathological liar, even though I’ve only really lied like this two times? I just... am so lost. And ashamed of myself. And I hate that I am doing and have done this to her. I’m sorry if this isn’t the right place or whatever but... I’m so scared.",05Jun2020,1
17,"Hello! I (20F) recently moved to Florida with my family right before COVID, but they’ve been here since October 2019. My stepdad (37M) got a job offer making a good enough amount to support our family so my mother (42F) does not have to work. All she has to do is take care of my 4 year old brother.

We lived in Mississippi prior to this. My mom has worked very hard to take care of us her whole life and this is the first time she’s never worked. In Mississippi, she had tons of friends to talk to and hangout with. In Florida, she’s having a hard time meeting people. Due to not working and COVID, she hasn’t had any socialization since she got here in October. She would go out with my stepdads friends but they’re in her late 20s and it isn’t her crowd. 

My stepdad has been excluding her from hangouts, is constantly working, and never has time to spend with her. He’s a complete grouch when he comes home, it’s not even worth having a conversation with him. I am an introvert, I spend a lot of time alone and thinking. Hanging out with my mom isn’t really ideal for me considering we have nothing in common. I feel terrible because of it. Some days I bring her to the beach of nature trails with my little brother, but that’s all I know to do. 

I found her crying on the couch today. I asked what was wrong and she told me she has no friends and wants to go back home. She explained that she hasn’t felt heard by an adult since she moved to Florida. For me, making friends in a new state was hard, but at my age we use social media for everything. All I had to do was go on tinder and talk to people and become friends from there. For her age, I’m not sure what she can do to socialize except get a job. I tried introducing her to an app called meetup. She hasn’t had much luck. 

Does anything near her age have any suggestions on how to meet people? I hate seeing her depressed all the time. 

TL;DR: My mom (42F) is depressed because she moved to a new state and has no friends. She does not work. How does someone her age meet people with similar interests when she knows no one?",05Jun2020,1

19,"I work in a small company and we have two senior employees A and B that probably do not like each other that much. Lately, I have been working more than usual with them and we have had some meetings to review what they did. A few days ago, A wrote a direct message to me, the project manager and our CEO to say that when we do meetings to review our work, the presenter should use a specific tool.  I agree completely with him but I also realize that that was was pretty much an attack against B who does not like to use that specific tool. The CEO replied to the direct message by saying that we should tell B to use that tool and that it may be best if I suggest it the next time we have a meeting like that. The problem with this is that I am quite new as I have been working for this company for less than 2 years while A e B have been around for 10+ years. Moreover, I am not a manager and as such I do not feel in the position to tell senior employees what to do. I think that our project manager or CEO should take care of this and set standard procedures to follow during meetings when we review our work and make sure people follow them.

We had a rough patch in the past few years but we got past it and I felt like we were a lot closer. However since heading off to uni this year ive noticed that I we rarely talk and it always feels like I have to message first. I used to have a really close friendship group that lost touch as we went to college. I'm worried that we might be losing touch as shes my last close friend from high school that I talk to. I had to cut contact with another close friend last september.

25,"I’ve talked about this sooooo much but somehow it never seems to go away. Even when I see how irrational I was being I think about why I acted the way I did, and get frustrated when I don’t find an answer. I’m gonna try to be descriptive here, so be prepared for a long post, but hopefully this’ll finally make some sense! 

I think I might split it into three parts, before the big incident, the big incident, and after the big incident 

Part 1: before the big incident 

It all started in high school. In 9th grade I met a really nice girl, and being a shy guy who is often apprehensive to start a conversation, it was nice to meet someone who was interested in asking me questions and was genuinely interested in me. She had a boyfriend at the time, but fast forward to the start of 10th grade and she broke up with him, around the same time she started sitting with me at lunch and acting very eccentric and silly around me.

This led me to suspect that she had a crush on me, but I turned out to be wrong, as she started dating someone else. But we were still good friends, and getting to see her and a friend of hers in 10th grade English class was definitely the highlight of High school for me. 

But here’s where things start to take a darker turn. Around this time I developed a fear of driving, mainly because of how much my school hammered in how dangerous it could be (I’m not even kidding the fucking final exam in the aforementioned English class was about texting and driving!). 

And me and this girl talked about it, and I told her that if I could, I would NEVER drive, and she told me it could be kind of scary, and was once upset that one question on an assignment assumed we wanted a car, and had mentioned biking as an alternative. I told her my mom kept saying that I have to drive, and she told me that a family member of hers wanted to, I forget who, but I think from all this I gained some sort of misunderstanding. 

I guess I thought we were going to be the two kids who didn’t drive, or something like that. It was really only a minor part of my life at the time but things were only to get worse. The day we got our schedules back, I messaged her on Facebook about it and found we didn’t share any classes or lunch hour that semester, and it downright devastated me. But what she said next is pivotal to everything that comes next. To this day I don’t know why it didn’t bother me at first, but later drove me mad. I want to emphasize that this is all how I felt in the past, NOT how I feel right now, and that I admit to having been wrong.

She said “I’m driving for the first time tomorrow” and I said “I wish you the best of luck with that” and she said “haha yeah.” 

When 11th grade started, I occasionally saw her in the hallway and at the end of school, and like before she was the highlight of my day. One instance stands out in memory: she was talking with a group of friends and I said hi to her, and she said hi back, and then immediately went back to talking and paid me no mind. Perhaps that wasn’t a good time to say hi, but it was the kind of thing that would happen more than once. 

But there was one instance before it spiraled into chaos that bothered me slightly. I remember talking with her in the hallway as we were leaving school and she said something about a renaissance fair the next year, and on my way home I told me mom about it, and she asked me if she was driving. The conversation went something like this:

Me: she told me she was starting soon. She said someone was making her 

Mom: someone should make you drive 

Me: I don’t know if I like the idea of her driving. I hope nothing bad happens to her

Mom: nothing bad will happen to her 

Me: you don’t know that. Great, I was in a really good mood just now and you ruined it! 

Mom: that one conversation about driving ruined it?

Me: it ruins everything! We’re done talking about this

And then she made some sort of joke about me deciding to end the conversation, or something. Like I said, I was wrong in the way I acted, and I really REALLY wish I said something, because I could have avoided soooo much, but I guess I didn’t realize how bad it would get at that point. 

My school would get even worse as far as the driving issue was concerned. Oddly enough this exact assignment was given multiple times: where we had to argue whether or not we should be allowed to go home for lunch. And literally EVERY TIME they made sure to remind us that car accidents were the #1 cause of death in teenagers. If that’s something you didn’t know, my school would be sure to tell you. Multiple times! 

Part 2: The Big Incident

When the new semester came is when things REALLY got bad. I found that I shared a lunch with this girl, but no classes. I talked with my mom the night before about how the idea of her driving scared me. I don’t know why it took that long to kick in, but it was so bad that I actually started crying during that conversation. I just tried not to bring up the issue when I saw her, but when I did finally see her again it was like she was an entirely different person.

She had a new group of friends, and like I hinted at earlier she seemed much more interested in them than me. She used to be so kind and caring, and willing to talk to me about anything, but now she basically ignored me and I could barely get a word in edgewise. But one conversation really set me off, her and this one guy were talking very dirty and seemed almost to be hiding something, and I interpreted it as them having had sex (later I found out this guy was actually gay and they were just being silly, but that was a long time afterwards) and it was especially jarring because I perceived her as so innocent. 

This alone would be upsetting, but the real kicker is that this was far from the only bad thing to happen that day! In my photography class, we had an assignment to make a PSA, and my teacher had a folder of examples to go through, and one of them was of a burnt woman who was in a car accident (we had watched a video about her before in my health class) and then after school, I wasn’t able to tell my mom about all this because my grandpa had to go to the hospital!

Now, obviously I felt bad for him, and what he was going through was definitely worse, but if you had so much bad shit happen in one day you’d probably go mad too! And it made matters worse when my mom said something along the lines of “you’re just a kid, all you do is play on your phone.”

So we had a two hour drive up to my grandparents house, and I was lucky to have the option of staying alone there while my mom and grandma were at the hospital, because it gave me an outlet to let out my emotions and I REALLY lost my shit! 

I pounded on the floor, yelled like crazy, said absurd over the top shit, cried my eyes out. Sadly, this would be far from the last time I acted this way.

Part 3: After the Incident 
I talked with my therapist about this after it blew over, and things were ok for a while, but the idea of this girl driving became increasingly scarier to me. With my school hammering in that it could be the difference between life and death, telling us of an accident virtually every day, it just got worse and worse. 

And with this girl I eventually had lunch in a certain room (I forget what it was but it’s basically where you could have private lunches). Things got complicated with her, because she was still nice to me when we were alone, but I just saw a side to her that I really didn’t like, and the fact that she admitted herself she wasn’t good at driving just made it worse. 

I didn’t think about her for a long time, but when I went to college these thoughts came flooding back, almost like it was reminding me not to get to close to anyone because it could end the same. And being in quarantine is driving me mad, bringing all this back, and I just think about where it went wrong, what could I have said to stop it, why didn’t I ask earlier. 

And maybe I felt jealous, idk, but when I think about driving I think about her, and when I think about her all this bad stuff comes flooding. It almost makes me wish she had done something wrong, so I can justifiably be mad at her, but the fact she didn’t just makes it more complicated. Maybe I put her on a pedestal, and I was just disappointed that reality didn’t match my fantasy. 

It would be so easy to say “get over it,” but when you’re ocd it’s not so easy. It seems contradictory to say there’s plenty of fish in the sea but that everyone is unique. But I do believe that I can get through this, that I can stop thinking about her and that I can get through this fear. 

Thank you for enduring all that with me.",05Jun2020,1

So back in 2015 my parents got “divorced” I put that in brackets because they were never able to pay for a legal divorce or even to have one of them move out and because of that, they never told my younger sisters that they were split up (aged 10 &amp; 11 as of me typing this) 

In this past year, my mom has started to go to couples counseling with my dad to try and fix their relationship and hopefully not have to actually go through the legal divorce process (once again, because of finances)

In 2016 I was using my moms phone to google something as I didn’t have one at the time and I saw a text from my friends dad which was, suggestive to say the least but later my mom found out I knew and excused it as “just friends getting coffee” even though they weren’t even friends on facebook let alone real life less than a year ago

Now cut to present day. Last night my sister (aged 11) came to me while I was watching tv in the living room and my dad was upstairs. She had quite a serious look on her face so I immediately asked her what was wrong. She told me that while our dad had been helping her with math, she was using his phones calculator and a text message popped up from a women who’s name she couldn’t remember but it definitely wasn’t our mom. she told me that the message was “something about calling dad sexy and that she misses him” and i immediately started to silently freak out. i didn’t want to let my sister know that our parents have sort of been divorced since she was 6 because i know how much it fucked me up when my mom first told me. 

ever since she told me yesterday she’s been cold and downright mean to me while my dad on the other hand has been doing the same thing he did in 2015, trying to win over my trust and love so if things did go to court, he would have more custody. 

Should i tell my mom? or should i just pretend nothing ever happened? to make things worse i’m still in high school and have started going back part time so i can complete classes. i’m scared that i’ll have to have my life change again in such a traumatic way while trying to pass school, deal with crippling mental illness, fight in the BLM movement and also take care of my pets ( a cat and a shit load of fish)

I’m not sure if i should confront either of my parents as i have no solid evidence for any of my claims of them “cheating” (once again, not technically divorced)

29,"All my life I have been moving around countries so making friends in school became almost a tool that I used. It wasn't difficult for me, but it seemed that as I moved to new places, my old relationships would diminish. 

After College I moved back to my home country where I still had a group of friends that I knew since I was around 4-5 years old. I haven't lived there since I was 7. The only difference is, that I hung out with them when we were children or during summer breaks when I was home, but not as much when I moved back as an adult. I have two friends from this friend group that I am closer with than with the others (with the others I only hang out with at parties) but I'm still not as close with those two as I was with my roommates in college (that now live across the world and I can't see anyway). 

They invite me to parties but sometimes I don't feel like going, as they live across the city from me (40 minute drive) and I don't have as much in common with them. For example, I'm into video games and music, they are all incredibly into cars (they can talk about engines for hours - cars were never my thing). 

My problem though is that I'm afraid if I stop going to these parties they will just forget about me altogether, and this way I won't have any friends at all. On the other hand, even though I do enjoy their company and the two closer friends I have I have a great time with, every time there's a party I dread it more than feel excited. Most of the time I force myself to go (even though sometimes I have a great time). My friend group is around 15 people btw. 

Finding new friends is difficult for me, as I live pretty remotely and work for a small company (also my coworkers are much older). On one hand I was always kind of a loner and was totally okay with that, but on the other I'm in constant fear of loosing that small group of friends as that would mean that I would actually have no friends (at least in the country that I live in now). 

On one hand I'm fine with not hanging with anyone and am happy in my secludivness, on the other I don't want to feel like I have no friends. Any advice?",05Jun2020,1
30,"So I've been a full-time software engineer for almost a year now. Truthfully, I don't really like it all that much. Coding itself is alright, I do enjoy problem solving and the idea I create things which people actually use on a day-to-day basis.  What I strongly dislike is the majority of the business side of things (politics, meetings, deadlines, etc), and just the whole process in general.

For those who don't know, roughly the way our workflow works is we do it in chunks called ""sprints"" (it's similar to this at a lot of tech companies nowadays). Every two weeks each developer is given several projects (usually bug-fixes or adding features) and each project is assigned a value based on we think it'll take. So a project worth 2 points is supposed to take about 2 days. I find this to be extremely nerve racking. The estimations are often way off, especially for me and lot of the other newish people since we're not going to know everything about some undocumented legacy software. My coworkers all tell me I'm doing a good job, but regardless the impostor syndrome is real.

Truthfully, I probably picked this career for the wrong reasons. I took some coding classes in high school and I ""liked"" them, but there's a lot of other things I like way more. I choose to major in computer science in college because out of everything I was at least somewhat interested in, it seemed like the best one for getting a decent job. It also probably didn't help that my parents are both engineers. They never forced me into anything, but for whatever reason I felt like I had to pick a hard technical field to make them proud. Pretty dumb on my part.

For those of you who changed careers, why? And more importantly, how? I've been spending my spare time learning skills I would need to get into another career path, but as of right now that's it. I think I can do the software stuff for at least a few years, but there's no way I can do this for my entire life.",05Jun2020,1
31,"So my SO and I have lived on the third floor of a three story walkup apartment building for two years now, and we're about to renew for another seven months. Our downstairs neighbors have changed three times now, and our newest neighbors seem oblivious to proper neighborly conduct. 

They go out onto their balcony, in a non-smoking building and smoke cigarettes. This means we cant have our patio door open because the smoke infiltrates our living room. So okay, it sucks and we hate it, but we've decided just to keep our patio door shut. 

The thing we cant live with is how loudly they play their music late at night. Its loud Spanish music with lots of bass so all we hear are beats and thumping from their speaker system. It's so loud our floors vibrate, and we can hear it out in the hallway. It's so loud we can go into the bedroom, which is down the hall and STILL hear the music (which is playing in their living room). 

This monday it was 9:30pm and so we called the apartment to issue a voice complaint. 

Tuesday nothing changed so we decided to ignore it and give it a day.

Wednesday it was 8:30pm and so we called the apartment complex again to issue another voice complaint. The mgmt said they would issue a formal letter of complaint but that further voice complaints should go to 311. 

I really dont want to call 311. Its loud and annoying and obvious but it's not something I want to get someone into trouble over. I just want them to be more curtious. Either turn it the fuck down or end it earlier in the evening. 

I dont know what to do from here but I know we cant spend the next seven months listening to it.

33,"I am going to try and keep this as short and sweet as I can.

I have been dating my boyfriend close to a decade. When we met we were teens and now in our early 20's.

Throughout our relationship, we both have changed but my boyfriend changed differently than I did. When he went to college he was out nearly every weekend and then sometimes 'school nights' he was changing and not for the good.

He has multiple friends groups from old jobs,schools etc so he was on a timetable of working, college, seeing his college friend outside of college and then seeing me as well as other friend so I was getting him for a limited time.

He began to drink more and knock back pints of beer like it was water and began to smoke. It was a mess I sat up most night waiting on a text to make sure he was okay only for him to be tired and pass out to let me know he got in okay.

fast forward to the last 2 years, he has got drunk enough on vodka that he has become a different person. He has been on and off smoking after each time he vows to stop but somehow every time he goes out drinking he wants to smoke, he wanted an e-cig but he has already had 5 of them which have been thrown out by his mum and even once he lied and told her it was mine so it wouldn't be thrown out. Each time he goes back on it he will tell me how he just needs something to help with stress etc.

When he goes back to drinking vodka he will tell me 1 of 3 things 1) It's different now I know how to handle it I won't get drunk I promise 2) Literally I am only having no glass to finish this off ( which turns to more because he was fine with one class 3) My friend bought me it but I was drinking beers the rest of the night.

The times he has got drunk on vodka we have fought, we have screamed at each other, he has pissed in the street, he becomes someone so annoying and he has said some really hurtful things. After that he promised to stop but then started again and I brought up about how the drinking was affecting us and he stopped the vodka but then now he is drinking it at home because he can 'handle' it now, he is in denial and whenever I try to talk to him he says I am going on at him and how I am dictating his life and acting like his mum and a babysitter??",05Jun2020,1
34,"I’ve been in serious relationships that lasted years not being able to imagine a future with said partners, trying to force it. I just wasn’t ready. I had to get my shit together for myself and be independent. Recently, my perspective has changed into really being interested in a life partner. The only problem is, the men  I have to choose from where I live my age and older (people around here get married young, I’m an odd ball) are mostly divorcees with several children.

This guy (19m) is really sweet and good looking. He approached me at the gym. He doesn’t look 19, I would have guess he was at least 22-25, except I knew he had to be younger by the way he was talking to me. Like my highschool boyfriend. “I had to talk to you, you have such pretty eyes and a pretty smile.” And the fact that he wants to have long conversations over text and gets a little hurt when I don’t reply. I’d just prefer to talk in person. 

We haven’t been on a date yet. And Although he’s legal, I’m concerned he won’t be mature enough to handle a relationship with me. I’m very experienced. And I can tell he’s barely experienced if at all. Should I give him a chance or let him down easy right now?",05Jun2020,1

Like the title says, I’m wanting to go to a nonviolent demonstration this weekend and my partner won’t let me because he fears for my safety. I plan on being fully geared up with a gas mask and everything when I go, though the police haven’t been bad where I am. We’ve of course had some incidents, but I’m wanting to steer clear of the precinct and stick with a group. I’d also be going during daytime, when it’s safer. 

Now, I talked to my partner about all of this. I wasn’t asking him, but I did tell him my plan in case he could give me additional advice. He got mad and told me he would prefer it if I didn’t go. He told me if I went, he wouldn’t be able to stay with me for fear of something bad happening to me. I told him that ideology was selfish and he cried and apologised but still will not allow me to go. 

This happened yesterday morning. Since then, he’s claiming to be having suicidal thoughts and depression. I know he has mental health issues, but I’m very upset that he’s using them to get what he wants. I’m still going to the protests this weekend. Am I wrong for wanting to go against his wishes and show my support? And how can I get him to see a therapist?

It’s supposed to be a 15-30 minute presentation on how to prepare for college / how to apply, but don’t have a lot of knowledge on college readiness other than doing some research in google (I’m going to be a junior in HS next year).

I’m expected to talk about my experience in preparing for college and give advice, but I don’t really have a lot of what would be considered “experience” other than fulfilling the my school’s requirements for graduation (minimum 40 volunteer hours, mandatory language / AP / VAPA classes...)

38,"I was emotionally, psychologically and sexually abused (covertly) by my estranged mother. One of our family friends happens to be the lawyer of my dad’s estate, and he’s very emotionally abusive (possible narcissistic). He knew me since I was 10 although I wouldn’t say we’re friends. When I was a teenager, I bumped into him at a movie theater and without say hello, he condescendingly commented that I’m too young to understand a romantic comedy that I had seen. He always been cold and arrogant.

 When I was at his office regarding matters of my father’s Will recent during my adulthood, he asked me for the details of how my mom abused me. I confided in him, or at least I thought I could if he’s asking because he cares about me. It turns out that that was a mistake because after I told him about the emotional abuse, he said, “Oh, so it wasn’t physical [abuse].” as though he were relieved that I was emotionally abused. When I started talking about the sexual abuse, he said that he doesn’t want to hear any more. He also interrupted me at one point to try to question my authenticity. Not to long after that, he texted me to say that I should wish my mom happy holidays because he thinks that it’s the right thing to do. Does he really think that I should wish a child abuser happy holidays?? What’s going on with him?

I finally stood up for myself last month by texting him, “My relationship with my mother is none of your business.” after he tried to meddle. Guess what his reply was? “That was unnecessarily fresh.”

How could a lawyer not understand the concept of boundaries? Why did he ask me about the abuse details to begin with? I’m ignoring him for now.

40,"Very dramatic title I know but this is how I feel, I’m 23 living in the uk and in benefits for my anxiety and panic attacks ( I’m not a lazy benefits scrounger who doesn’t want to work before people start judging me, these issues have ruined my life since I was 13 ) 

I made a lot of progress last year and I felt like it is time to start progressing in life instead of being held back by my fear of leaving the house so i started looking for colleges in my area to get on the path to the career I want 

The problem is I would have to give up my benefit and the reduced tax that I receive now and After doing the maths it wouldn’t be possible for me to afford my rent and bills on a part time wage and I can’t find a single college that does the course I want on a part time schedule so  working a full time job would be pointless because I won’t be any better off financially than I am right now working 40 hours a week while still not making progress towards my career goals... 

I don’t know what to do, it baffles me that the system is structured in a way that it’s more difficult to get off benefits than stay on or that there’s zero support for people who want to educate themselves to get a career but no it’s like I’ve missed my chance for that now either stay on benefits for the rest of your life or become a modern day slave working 40 hours a week in a warehouse for minimum wage",05Jun2020,1
41,"First, I'll apologize for this pretty hefty post. I don't have really anyone to talk to about it so a lot of it might be word vomit. I tried to at least be a little concise. 

I (24f) currently live in Alaska with my parents. I was out on my own for a year in a college dorm before I moved back up to help them with financial stuff since on-campus tuition was a lot of money (I ended up switching to online). I’ve since graduated this February and I wanted to be out of the house by now but the coronavirus put a stop to that. My dad is always on my case about moving out and even though he and my mom were pushing me to go to college, I never really got a lot of support from him about it while I was still doing it because he would always ask me about every month what I was going to do with my life. Whenever I told him that I was doing school, it wouldn’t ever be good enough for him. 

Fast forward to now, even though I really don’t like living in this state, I have an opportunity to get an apartment with a friend nearby. The problem is that my mother is really pushing me to not go and I want to talk to her about it without any issues because she’s always been the one that I get advice from, but every time I mention it she gets mad at me as if I’m acting like some sort of rebellious teenager. It gets aggravating because I’m not looking to start an argument. I don’t want to hide this from her, because she’ll then get mad at me for not talking to her. 

One of the many reasons I’m desperate to move is because I feel like the relationship I have with my parents becomes more strained the longer I stay, and for different reasons for both of them. I’ve already had a pretty strenuous relationship with my father and I won’t get into it, but with my mother I feel like I’m being coddled and treated like a kid who isn’t allowed to make simple decisions. They both still even monitor what I spend my money on sometimes despite the fact that I’m 24. I’ve been wanting to leave for a few years now, but the urge grows more the older I get. When I was a teenager, I felt like I never really got to be a teenager and now that I’m an adult I feel like I’m not allowed to be that either. 

Honestly, I feel like I just keep doing whatever I can to make my mom happy, but I have to admit that I feel absolutely miserable. I go to work, I come home, I go to my room. I try to minimize interactions with my dad because sometimes we just can’t get along. I can’t buy things at the store because if my dad sees that I spent money on it, he’d yell at me. I’m tired of it, but I can’t really have a talk about it because whenever I try to bring up how I feel to either of them they end up making just enough sense for me to end up feeling like a terrible daughter. 

The worst part is that I actually don’t know what I want to do with my life and that makes me feel even worse. I got my BA in game design, but a lot of the times I feel like I didn’t learn anything despite all the hours I put into getting that degree. I don’t know where to start looking for a job and I feel like I’ll never get one. The only thing that I feel like I want to do that isn’t influenced by anyone else is that I want to move to California. I used to live in Arizona for a while and I’d often go to California for vacation, so it feels familiar enough to potentially be called home, but new enough so I’m not trying to live in the past. California’s so expensive though, and I’ve been saving money for a long time, but I’ve never completely moved out on my own before into ‘uncharted territory’. There has been some particularly bad days where I almost bought a one-way ticket down, but I chickened out because I’m so unsure of how I’d go about life after I’d get off the plane. I’m both encouraged and discouraged to leave so I’m constantly wishy-washy on it. Where would I live, what are good neighborhoods, where would I work, how would I get around, etc. 

If I could, I wouldn’t even move in with my friend here in Alaska, I’d just leave the entire state behind. I might be glorifying it in my mind a bit but leaving is the only thought that makes me happy. I imagine being able to decorate my own apartment, cooking my own food, doing chores on my own time, going wherever I wanted to go to after work, being able to *actually* look for a job that isn’t in food service where I don’t have to earn minimum wage. I don’t think I mentioned that I also work the same shift as my mother at the same place. The only reason I’m considering moving in with my friend is because it’s at least *something*. 

My mother’s main argument for me to not move is because they all plan on moving when my sister graduates high school next year. She says that if I move out, they’re not going to help me move out of Alaska either. Sometimes I feel like I don’t really care about that, but I also don’t really want to be trapped here. But again, I feel like maybe I should just learn how to deal with that on my own so I don’t have to be treated like this anymore.",05Jun2020,1

I'm looking for genuine opinions on this topic. I am not asking or looking for advice on how to commit suicide.

If you have received a message, how did you feel about it? Would you have felt better without one? If it's not too much personal info, was it too much or too little in the message? If it helped you feel closure, what did they say that helped you feel better?

I'm planning on sending a couple of scheduled texts out, about a month after I commit suicide, IF I ever do it. I would rather leave a note, but many of these people aren't very close to me (either location or relationship wise) and thus I don't know if a note will make it to them. I'm worried a text is too impersonal but I'm also worried that not leaving anything and leaving them to forever wonder why I haven't responded for months or years is also kind of messed up.

As of right now I've only thought about scheduling for one person. My friend who is 15. He's who I care about the most in regards to sending stuff. He doesn't know me SUPER well, like we're not good or even best friends but we joke around and talk now and then. Used to. Not so much anymore. I at least wanna send something. Do you think it's too young to send something like that? I mean the last thing I'd want is a 15 year old, who I imagine is going through a ton of other shit, have to worry about me having committed suicide.

**Please do not try to talk me out of suicide. I am not actively suicidal. This is not about me. This is about trying to comfort my friends the best I can. I understand that the best way to comfort them would be to not die, but I can't promise anything. I want to plan ahead in case I do do this. I don't know when, it's just an if, and a likely if, but still just an if. I simply want to hear other's opinions and or experiences.**",05Jun2020,1
44,"So there’s a lot. She was my friend until all of this unfolded. I was her only friend up at the college that we go to, and one of her only two friends. She doesn’t have family because she decided to quit talking to them. She had a lot of mental health problems. Before there was a pandemic brewing here in the US, she was starting to get really controlling with me about where I went, who I went with, who came to the apartment, what I had in the fridge, and where my cat was. When covid shutdowns in California made school go online, so I decided to go home for spring break I planned to come back because I still had a job at school. She was extremely angry at me for leaving our apartment (1 other girl out of our 5 roommates stayed there), since she couldn’t go with me. She wouldn’t leave me alone about it. She kept confronting me and asking me why I couldn’t just wait. She really loves one of my two cats so I left that one up there even though it made me extremely distressed (I now know I shouldn’t have done that). She was still incredibly angry at me. I came back and didn’t feel great so I self isolated. She was again furious at me. I didn’t feel safe, so I stayed isolated. I started experiencing extreme psychological distress, traumatic and vivid nightmares, and physical symptoms. I felt like she was going to hurt me. She at one point was going to confront me, but I had a panic attack so I left and sat in my car in the middle of nowhere until I felt ok. She gets violently angry, so I didn’t feel safe talking to her in person (and I couldn’t have my friend come over because of corona and the other roommate doesn’t really talk to either of us so I couldn’t have a mediator) so I talked to her through the phone. She called me a narcissistic manipulator for telling her that I did what I did to take care of myself and to help my family move because we got kicked out before the eviction moratoriums kicked in. A little after that, I left without telling her after 2.5 weeks of staying in my room and her being extremely abusive and angry. I instantly felt better when I went back home. I haven’t talked to her since she asked why I left. I don’t have to go back until probably late September. I can’t get out of my lease, get someone to sublet, and/or get a new place to live. Too many people are trying to sublet their rooms for only fall and not enough people trying to take over a room for the year or having a room available that I could afford for the whole year. So I can’t leave. How do I deal with the situation when I have to go back? How does one live with an abusive and controlling roommate? She feels like I owe her something. I don’t know what to do and I do worry that she might get violent with me and get progressively more abusive.",05Jun2020,1

I try to tell her I don’t like it and think she shouldn’t do it, but she does it anyway and lies about it all the time. It’s not that it’s giant lies, it’s just that it’s a lot of smaller lies. Yesterday we made plans to hang out today after she worked, and then an hour before we were hanging out she told me she was hanging out with “Jane” (random name) instead. Whenever my gf hangs out with Jane, she smokes. She always says she doesn’t hang out with her just to smoke and that she doesn’t even think she will, but the past 10+ times they’ve hung out they smoked. She also seems to get mad when I tell her I want her to stop and makes me feel bad. She acts like I just want her to myself but I just don’t want to lose her to drugs. My uncle died from an overdose and my gf’s sister has been in and out of mental hospitals for drug related problems. Am I in the wrong? Please be honest.",05Jun2020,1
46,"My (19F) boyfriend (19) and I don’t ever argue about anything that actually matters. What I mean is that every argument we have had is about something so small but the argument is blown up. There will be arguments about chores, whether or not someone is doing a task correctly, jokes that were taken out of context, etc. We’ve never had a serious argument that would make a huge fight valid.

I have picked up on things that indicate an argument is about to happen and once I come to that realization, I try to stop it immediately. I apologize sincerely. I tell him that I am choosing our relationship over a fight. I don’t know why he does this but as soon as I try to apologize and begin the making up process, he leaves the house.

Our fights are dragged on for several hours - I’m talking like 5+ hours. To be fair most of that time is spent away from each other. He leaves to get space and I do my own thing. It’s still very exhausting to feel like your relationship is on the line for several hours.

When he eventually comes back,he demands an apology. I apologize but then I’m a little hurt that he doesn’t give an apology in return. I tell him many times that I hate long drawn out fights and I wish we could just stop once we feel it escalating. It’s not like we’re fighting over cheating or lying. There’s no need to have such a huge fight.

I guess I’m just tired of the long unnecessary arguing. I’m tired of him not apologizing. If he cares as much as he says he does, why can’t he just apologize? But at the same time I ask myself, if it’s such a small fight and not worth it, why do I want an apology in the first place?

I know I’ll get a lot of “break up with him” comments. I would prefer not to especially because of Covid and it would be difficult to break our lease and find a different living situation right now. I guess what I’m trying to say is that it’s easier living with your boyfriend and trying to fix an issue in the relationship, than it is to live with your ex. Also as I said before there hasn’t been any serious problems in our relationship so maybe it’s worth it to try?",05Jun2020,1
47,I'm a 14 year old girl from Texas. My mom is getting me a worker's permit so I can get a weekend/summer job and make a little bit of extra money for myself.

48,"After being fired from my retail job as an ASM, I have no motivation to find a job. Obviously I need money, but because I have no experience in any other profession jobs do not even consider me. I feel more strong about finding a passion and not being stressed like how I was as a manager. 

I've tried applying to less demanding retail like walmart and target (I was in sales) but they won't even consider me. I have so many declination letters. Ive been unemployed 6 months for underlying issues with transportation, money, and simply no call backs. 

Like I'm just tired, I need money but I just can't fathom going back to retail sales and being stressed about meeting goals,  putting on a fake smile, being  blamed for everything. Almost like I don't want the responsibility. But jobs like office clerks wont consider me.

49,"I (20F) am planning on going to a protest tomorrow for Black Lives Matter. I’ve made my poster and I really want to go as this means a lot to me. I don’t live with my parents at the moment but I did for a while at the beginning of the pandemic (had to return to my apartment for school). My dad doesn’t want me to go because of coronavirus. He has anxiety and is blaming me for making it worse as he is so worried that I’ll get coronavirus while I’m at the protest. He’s called me selfish, an asshole for even considering it, and that no one will care if I go anyways. He just texted me “this is really stressing me out. Like I need more anxiety”. Obviously if I go to the protest I won’t go home for awhile as to make sure I don’t have covid (my dad has lung problems and it would be bad if he got it). I get that he means well and wants me to be safe, but I feel like the BLM movement is far more important than me going home to visit my parents soon. What should I do?

51,"So 4 months ago my father killed himself and left my sister (30) and I (21m)to pick up the pieces of a broken estate.

My sister has been distant and pretty much avoids all confrontation with me. We haven’t done the legal process of probating my fathers estate, we haven’t been paying the mortgage on his home, we haven’t been doing anything. I want to include her in anything I do but it’s getting harder and harder to try. We have till the end of June to pay the due balance of the home mortgage ($2400ish) or else foreclosure is going to happen. I don’t want this,I am more than capable of paying the balance, but I think my sister should pay her half. Her whole life she’s been mooching off of everyone and everything she can. She’s never had a job, she has 4 kids (dad is in the picture, but much like her, doesn’t have a pot to piss in). They have been evicted from I don’t know how many apartments. She is borderline narcissistic, manipulative, and toxic. I on the other hand, am the complete opposite, I’ve worked since I was 18 years old. I bought my first car on my own, this happened last year. A part of me has grown to resent my sister because I believe that a part of my hardships in life have been caused by her not wanting to grow up. I never had nice things because she was draining my father dry. He bought her 3 vehicles in total (all of which she’s destroyed) He payed for insurance, he payed for her phone, he gave her money often for life necessities. There were some nights that I remember going to sleep hungry because my dad couldn’t afford to buy us food because he had given all he had to her. 

My father has a home, a vehicle and a business. Those are his three main assets. She and her boyfriend, are currently using our fathers vehicle against my wishes. I’m not okay with it, but she doesn’t care. She thinks that she can use it because I have one and she doesn’t. 

Her and I are complete opposites, I made good decisions in life and now I’m getting screwed because of it. She got pregnant at 17 and is now reaping the benefits of not having anything to lose. 

I resent my sister, and this is my dilemma. 

If I pay for everything, lawyer, house mortgage, property maintenance. She wins, because she didn’t have to pay a dime and she gets HALF of whatever is left after all debts ( and there are a lot of debts) are paid. Grant it, I get half too, but once again, she gets something for nothing

If I don’t, we lose everything. We lose the house, we lose our fathers memory. I don’t want to lose that, but a part of me is okay with it if it means she doesn’t get something for nothing. 

I’m stuck between two losing situations. 

I don’t know what to do and I would greatly appreciate some advice. Thank you for reading.",05Jun2020,1

54,"I’m an absolute fuck up of a human being 23f
Hello you guys. I’m already an anxiety-ridden pos, so please spare me the comments on how wrong I am for getting to this point in my life. I am not joking when I say I’m a fuck up. I was always good in school, but come junior year of high school I just let go of all ambitions to get good grades. I come from a middle-eastern family so the shame still follows me to this day. 90% of not getting good grades was completely my fault. 10% my dad being verbally abusive on a daily basis, if not with me then my mom or sister, and the occasional physical abuse. I had very low self-esteem from bullying ing middle school and my grandmother calling me ugly a lot of the time. My mom is still hard on me for my body even though I’m a 125lb 5’3’’ woman. It’s very hard for me to gage how difficult my life was at the time because I don’t really have an idea what “normal” is. No ones family is, so I feel bad saying I had a difficult time especially when my family is upper middle class and they afforded me whatever I wanted. I just didn’t apply to schools because I knew that I wasn’t going to get in, so my plan was to go to a regional college (I don’t know if it’s a community college it has a med school attached to it. I tell myself it’s not to make myself feel better) and then transfer to this university’s sister school’s main campus. Anyways, I ended up doing that, my grades weren’t phenomenal, but I got As in all the classes that pertained to my major. The summer after I had 2 internships. I got accepted to this school, and when I went I basically flunked my entire first year at the school. My parents don’t know about it and I never plan on telling them. At the time I lost my best friend, the closest friend I’ve ever had at the time, by loss I mean like a break-up, and we “broke u” in a cruel manner. During this time I gained 30 pounds and was very obviously depressed. I tried different medications until I just stopped. The summer before my next year I gassed myself up to go very hard because I wanted to get good enough grades to study abroad the next summer. I did. It was really weird thinking about it now that I’m in the state that I’m in now. I got a membership at orange theory and would go basically every day to work out and then go to my classes, and I didn’t necessarily ace them, but I got above B-’s in all of them. I come back from my study abroad trip in the best shape I was ever in throughout my life, mentally and physically. I got all As in my classes abroad, walked everyday, made new friends, etc. the natural serotonin was amazing. Now coming into my senior year, my first semester was good as well. I signed up for next years classes and took everything I needed to graduate, despite basically being a complete failure my sophomore year. The beginning of the semester I am doing tremendously. I am on top of the world. And suddenly, I just stopped. Stopped going to class, stoped giving a shit, stopped doing anything. The shame of walking into a room with people who knew I missed even three classes was so disappointing I would literally tremble from anxiety thinking about going into class the next day. So I didn’t. My parents think I graduated. I planned on making up for it by taking classes the summer after. I didn’t do that as well. I slept all day, I would take two benedryl a night just so I can sleep as long as I could so I wouldnt have to face anyone or anything. I come home from school. I find a job as a paralegal. I do that. I take the LSAT, get a pretty low score. The summer is here, I’m taking online classes to finish my degree, and I’m not doing too well in that either. My parents think I’ve applied to so many law schools, and I actually tried to but because I have a tuition I cannot pay off my university refuses to send my transcripts to apply. I tried applying for a student loan but my credit is too low and need a cosigner and don’t have anyone in my life that would do that for me to be honest. I’m writing all this and it seems like I’m nonchalant about this please know I cry on a daily fucking basis, I resent myself, the amount of times in the middle of the night I think about just jumping off a balcony makes me cry as I write this but I’m too much of a fucking pussy to do that too. I feel like I’m just a sentient being occupying too much space for the Earth and don’t deserve that. What really made me crack though is yesterday my boyfriend (doesn’t know much of this but he knows I’m depressed) invited me to his house for a barbecue. His dad asked me what my favorite memory from high school and college were. I answered, but in the moment I almost felt like ditching and just crying. My bf is way too overqualified to be attracted to anyone like me. He’s a graduate of uc Berkeley, I’ll just leave that there. Thinking about what my favorite memory was so heart wrenching. I know people always say, “ fuck high school, I want to peak later in life” yeah that for me is heightened ten fold. I don’t have a good memory from high school. I just don’t. I regret so much that the word instantly just brings tears to my eyes. I didn’t go to football, basketball, or any games in high school or college. Both of them were athletic schools. I didn’t join a sorority in college, and I didn’t have many friends, honestly I don’t know gif they’re really my friends they haven’t talked to me this year. I’m a loser. The worst part about this shit, the shit that keeps me up at night, the shit that I crave the answer to so much is WHY DID I JUST STOP GOING TO CLASSES LAST SEMESTER OF MY SENIOR YEAR? Why did I do that? I had it going so well. It feels like I’m not in control of my fucking body. I’m so ashamed of myself I’m scared to let anyone know of this. I come off as a very intelligent person, I can carry intellectual conversations, I read, I can speak 4 different languages, I’m not stupid. I use to refuse that I was stupid, but I’m getting to the point of where I think I am. Anyways, I just wanted practical advice. I just wanted to know why I suddenly dropped all of my priorities out of nowhere especially during a time when for me, life was good. Is there a disorder or something? I want to fix it, I am so disgusted with myself I’m doing so many weird things. I want to break up with my perfect boyfriend because I feel like he could do so much better it feels like a joke that he chooses to be with me. He doesn’t know about not graduating but he knows that about past struggles. I can’t even use my dad as an excuse anymore, he’s mostly good to me now. He has some hiccups, but in general he’s good at this point. So this is me. It is all me. And I need to fix myself. Please help.",05Jun2020,1
55,"I [28F] currently live with my mother. I had been living with my husband at our own place, but my mother needed help that I felt I could better give by living with her. Her house was a disaster due to her being bipolar and a hoarder. She was in a terrible relationship and couldn't afford to get out of it. So my husband and I moved in with her 2 years ago. We got her house clean and got her away from her husband. The plan was to then start spending money on renovating the house, because it will eventually be mine. However, my mental health took a major hit and I am now only able to work part time. I have applied for disability, but the odds of getting it are very slim. My husband and I are currently getting a divorce, so it's just my part time income and my mom's disability payments. 

So now we enter the problem. I HATE my home life. My mom NEVER stops talking and never leaves me alone, despite me asking her to repeatedly. I love my mom and am always willing to help her when she needs it, but I am so tired of trying to fix her life while mine suffers. She refuses to go to therapy and instead just stresses out and vents to me, which causes my depression to get even worse. She refuses to clean the house, so I have to do it all. While I obviously have the responsibility to help with cleaning, I shouldn't be acting like her maid and cleaning up all her messes too. Plus, my depression makes it really hard for me to even do basic things, so keeping my own stuff clean is hard enough.

Another big issue is my mom's cats. She has 3 of them and they are terribly behaved. They are always on the table when we are trying to eat unless I lock them up, which is hard to do because they don't like to be caught. Her male cat, although fixed, sprays everywhere around the house, especially in my room. We can't have rugs anywhere in the house because he will spray over them. Mom doesn't clean the litter boxes or feed the cats. I don't even want them, but I end up having to take care of them. I can't force her to get rid of them since they aren't even mine. I convinced her to take them to a rescue once, but they refused to take them.

On top of all of these things, I cannot tell my mom how much she is making things hard for me. If I try to talk to her, she falls apart and is depressed for days. She is barely stable and it takes very little to push her past the edge. Her being upset will just make it all worse. 

Am I just being negative or whiny? I can't afford to move out and I have no friends I could live with. I'm so tired of trying to live two lives. It's like I am almost okay, but I have to also drag her along and I can't handle it. I go to therapy and take my medicine for my depression, but it makes no difference. I'm probably just being dramatic, but I am miserable and I do not know what to do about it.",05Jun2020,1

Its illegal here in the U.S, but somehow my best friend, who we’ll call Mari, told me to watch it as a dare. I of course, googled it and was immediately disturbed by what it was. 
I got upset at Mari, but he claimed that he didn’t know what it was. I forgave him, and we both apologized. 

A few days later, he posts a link to a article, out of the blue. Mari said that a lady was upset the store wouldn’t refund her, so she stomped on a cat, killing it. 
Later on, Mari backtracked and said that it was still alive, but had broken legs. He joked and said that the cat was in a wheelchair now. 
I was mad that he was joking about a cat breaking its legs, and then Mari tried to justify it by saying “It could happen to every cat, theres no stopping it” And imo, that just made things worse. I fought with him for a bit, saying how it was so mean that he was joking about a kittens life and how he was justifying it. 

The next day, my friend of five years who we’ll call Cassie, invited her girlfriend in the group chat. 
I introduce myself, and then I introduce Mari as “The jackass that showed animal cruelty” 
Me and him then started to fight, then i said, “You’re the one who told me to watch child you-know-what” 
Of course, Avi, the girlfriend started freaking out.
Mari then said “You know OP, you’re bad at making first impressions.” And then left. 
He messaged me later saying, “Thanks btw.” 
I responded with, “For what?” 
“You know what.” He responded

Nothing makes me happier than seeing someone I love with a smile on their face, a laugh in their voice. Shit! Just seeing thrones I care about everyday makes my whole week. I am a peoples person and I love people . 

 But this woman has done nothing our whole lives but bring me down. She constantly made fun of my ""stick thin arms and legs"" when I was severely underweight from an eating disorder. She called me an attention seeker and a slut whenever I got enough courage to flirt with anyone. And when I mom outed me as gay my sister made it point to let me know 24/7 that being gay is a sin and that I will go to hell no matter what I do. Recently, she has completely disregarded my health and safety to invite he  r boyfriend(who is known to carry illnesses asymptomacitlly) over to her house after he got back from another state that was having an increased number of cases of covid. She is one of the only people to have ever gotten violent with me in an argument, she shoved me into the corner of a tv stand and has smacked, she once pushed me out of anger, making me fall over and smack my head on a metal bed frame and I had to go to the hospital for it. I know that you are probably like, but she's a girl and your a guy, she can't hurt you! Well I don't want to hit her or shove her back, even in self defense, okay? The thought makes me pyshically sick to my stomach. 

I know she has anger issue, I don't try to downplay her for that and I don't want to make her anger issues define her, but at this point I am scared of her, I am scared of making her mad. I try to keep in mind all the good and fun times I have had with her, because their are a lot, but  all I can think of when I see her is all the pain she's caused me over the years and I want to cry or throw up. I have tried to just ignore it all but it is hard to be near her anymore. 

I don't want to cut her off from my life, but I think it's what I have to do for my mental health.

So as you can imagine, my GPA was not super high. Fast forward to my last semester, and out of the rest of my classes, I only got two C’s. The rest being B’s. But that works out for me better because I am taking weighted classes. So my cumulative GPA so far is 2.91 and an amount of odd numbers. This upcoming year, I am signed up for AP classes, weighted classes, and a extra program hat takes me off of school grounds to teach me blue print reading, robotics, and more.
I am confident I can put in the work to make my GPA rise because I know I’m smart and intelligent enough to do so. But it’s going to be a uphill battle it’s looking like. I dropped one of my free periods to take physics and I’ll end up graduating with extra credits, as I’m on course for that. So to say the least, my academic record will look well above average.

66,"Hi guys, 

It’s my first post ever on Reddit. I hope I’m making sense and hope someone can offer some light into the situation. Thank you kindly in advance. 


I consider myself an older student (29yo, F) in my school cohort. This school has the same students within the cohort for three years (condensed BSN program for nursing). I am socially functional, but with the waves of depression, I tend to steer away from making friends and socializing. I try my best in all that I can do.

There’s a guy in my cohort who is of the same age group as me. Last summer, I went to a concert with my sister and he kept calling me to ask where I was. I had a few drinks and an edible so I was not in the mood to socialize with someone I was acquainted with from school. I wanted to spend time with my sister. He called me 3-4x asking where I was. I kept telling him my sister and I were hanging out and going to play by ear. By the 4th time he called, he asked where we were and I briefly told him that I was eating ramen. He ended up coming from wherever he was to the restaurant. At first, he pretended he didn’t see us and was drinking alone at the bar. Because of the awkwardness, I just told him to come over to our table. He then asked my sister some questions by leaning in super close to her ear about random things and looked at me and commented on how I wasn’t wearing a skirt. He then touched my leg. I was in shock so I couldn’t say anything. My sister and I quickly ate and left. I later found out he was high on molly and that was the reason he was acting very strange.


My problem is.. after that incident, I can’t be civil with him and become defensive every time he flicks my arm, touches me or is very close to me. People in the cohort started noticing and is siding with him to confront me with my behaviour. I am aware that I need to be civil, but I don’t know how I need to act around him. 

Dear redditors, do you have any advice on how I can be more civil around him until school ends? I still have a year a bit left.

Thanks a million in advance.",05Jun2020,1

Hey everyone just wanted to ask for a little advice here as I'm starting to doubt myself in Grad School.

As  for a little background, I have a BS in Secondary Education: Social  Studies and have been out of school for the past 2 years with no luck  with a teaching job.  As of last year, I decided that I wanted to go to  Grad School to get a Master's Degree in Clinical Mental Health  Counseling.  The requirements at the university that I chose only  required you to have a BA or BS  in any field of study.  I was able to  get into the problem without any issues at all.  With the couple of  classes that I have taken, I have understood the material and have  gotten As in the courses that I have taken.  However, my professors are  starting to say things like ""You should have already had this coursework  in this topic"" in a class like Rehab 230 or something.  Being an  education major, I have no background in Rehab courses.  I only have  education courses as well as the sociology and psychology classes that I  needed to take to get my degree.  I have other classes, but none will  realistically be applicable to this degree.

So  I guess what I'm really asking will I actually be able to complete this  degree only with the knowledge that I have right now along with the  courses that I'm going to take?  I love what I'm learning and everything  seems like it's going well, but I'm starting to feel like I'm going to  fall behind everyone due to not having prior knowledge of the topic.",05Jun2020,1
68,"I have this assignment, and I'm procrastinating a lot. Its for Chorus, and that is because despite not being scared of a lot, and being a pretty open person, I cannot deal with singing on camera. I don't mind it when I'm singing in class with 30 or so other people, however, sitting in my bathroom, my voice sounds so loud... and the accompaniment sounds so quiet... and I'm painfully aware of the fact that I have to sing the entire song and that my Chorus teacher will be grading it later. Every time I call my friends, I rant, I practice after cringing in the mirror for way too long, and then the two measure piece I had to sing is done. But this is the whole song. The entire song. I don't know how I'm going to do this. Why is it so easy for some people? I'm trying not to feel bad for myself because I know that this is such a stupid, first world problem, but something about singing brings out a lot of insecurities. It doesn't help that I'm not good at it, either. I've never had any interest in singing. While many people want to be stars, or amateur singers take lessons and all these girls hum and sing under their breathes in class, I've never wanted to. I'm jumped off a cliff in a harness attached to a long bag that catches air and I can't raise my vocal cords an octave and emit noise. Stupid, I know. Really. I don't know how. Please, anything that can help me do this without sitting around, probably crying because I'm feeling sorry for myself (it happens, I'm trying) and spamming my friends with dozens of video messages, that would be awesome. I think its more than just not liking singing.",05Jun2020,1
69,"Hey yall, so currently I'm starting two new jobs, and I already work at starbucks, so three Jobs total once I start the other two. Starbucks just gave me three options. I can either 
1) stay with the company but with slightly reduced hours
2) quit with a 60 hour severance package (only like 600$)
Or 
3) take 120 days off unpaid to give me the opportunity to get unemployment, unemployment in Omaha Omaha Nebraska is 700 a week.
I have until tomorrow afternoon to decide what I want to do.
The only reason why I wouldnt take off the 120 days off is becuase unemployment is only that much until the end of july, and my new position is  a soon to be manager position at the new job at zumies. I'm super conflicted . I'd have to quit the zumies job and the other new one if I wanted unemployment",05Jun2020,1
71,"I think I was raped and it triggered OCD

So I (20F) went to a party on Halloween weekend, and drank too much and this one guy at the party started making out with me. That was fine whatever, he kept pulling my skirt up and I told him to stop and he kept doing it. Anyway we end up ubering back to campus together with a few of my friends. He kept asking me to go back to his room but I wanted to make sure my Roomate got home ok, so he came with me to walk her home. When we got there he kept trying to convince me to go back with him and I was essentially saying no I think (I don’t really remember, I just remember saying I didn’t want to hook up with someone who doesn’t actually like me) but he kept persisting and was making me feel bad.

 

I ended up going back with him and set a limit of only giving him oral, which once again was only because I felt bad for saying no to going back. When we got there before anything happened he asked me if I was still drunk and I said yes (which I was, not black out but very wobbly on my feet and I didn’t remember certain points the next day) and then I asked if he was and he also said yes but I’m thinking he only said this because I said I was. Anyway I started giving him oral and he started trying to finger me, and I eventually gave in to having sex with him.

 

Like I said yes to having sex with him. Ever since that night, starting immediately after, like the next day, I’ve been worried about being pregnant because while I do remember insisting on a condom, I have black memories of seeing it go on. He didn’t finish in me, and I know for sure because I gave him oral sex again to finish but I don’t remember seeing a condom come off. It’s been like six months and I have had my period 6 times and have taken countless pregnancy tests all negative. I’m mentioning this because my question is, is this sexual assault? Is thag why I have so much anxiety pertaining to the situation?

 

One part of me thinks it is, but then I did say yes. Is it sexual abuse, or was I just taken advantage of?",05Jun2020,1

73,"I can’t seem to ever make friends. To be more precise I cat seem to ever make male friends at all. I have this pattern that keeps repeating itself. Ever since I was around 15 or 16 I can’t ever seem to make male friends at all. It doesn’t go past the 4 months mark with only 1 person being an exception for me but that friendship only lasted 2 years and we’re not friends anymore. 

During the quarantine, I’ve turned to Reddit to make friends especially on the sub reddit for friend making but got left on read multiple times. At this point it’s hopeless. It just all ends within a week or a bit over a month if we’re lucky. 

Recently, I was talking to someone on Reddit and it just came about from something totally not related to the friend making Reddit. Just a normal conversation I would say and then we started talking for a few hours. The next day I didn’t hear from the person at all and I really do miss the person. We have so much in common and at this point I think I feel desperate or really lonely. I don’t have any male friends at all and this person I actually wanted to be his friend because I found that we had so much in common and I can actually see myself hanging out with this person in real life and that would be possible as we aren’t on different parts of the world. Another coincidence. 

But I haven’t heard from him IN DAYS. Text him on his number and I haven’t gotten anything in 2 days. 

I called today and it just went to voicemail. No dialling just straight to voicemail. 

I messaged him again on Reddit and haven’t heard anything. 

I hate that I get attached to people to quickly. It’s annoying and at this point I hate life. I really want to talk to him and help him and stuff but now I can just throw it out the window because none of that will ever happen. 

What should I do ? I’ve been advised to stop making friends in Reddit but I don’t know what to do at this point. I seem to not have the best experience with friend making.

One of those links was a very large file or a lot of files containing normal porn.

I also take my work very seriously. I am very new to my career so I do experience imposter syndrome, however, I feel as though I am kicking a lot of ass with little experience I have because I constantly research, grow, push, and learn. I have been on my current team for little over a year and my last team were completely obsessed with me because of my work. My new team barely talks to me. It bothers me a lot and I feel completely unseen and unheard constantly. Nobody ever reaches out to me unless they need something from me. When I leave a message on the board, it gets zero comments or reactions while others will get a ton. I am doing a lot on this team than my last team and constantly figuring out complex shit. It bothers me and makes me want to work harder and longer than before just so I can be seen. I am starting to notice it be unhealthy because I do not know how to be by myself without wanting to work or think about work. I really like my team and I think the world of them. I am constantly in awe with each one of them. I starting to recluse myself because I am starting to get a mindset that they don’t like me very much. I have told my higher ups how I feel and they said it’s their job to close the gap but to be honest they aren’t even talking to me as well. It’s also hard to have continuous motivation because the lack of attention on my work. I feel like I am doing stuff that above my role so I don’t know what I am doing wrong.

81,"I was a 22 year old virgin, and I was at a music festival that got delayed until now because of corona.  

This local pegan band was playing, and it was very sexual, a man was even preforming oral sex on stage, and I almost left. 

 It was all girls except the vocalist, and I only stayed because I liked black metal.  

At the end the bassist said ""hey Im going to need all you guys who are virgins to raise your hands"". 

 I didnt at first because I thought it was to mock me, but I saw only 2 guys did it, but she said ""is that all tonight"", so I said fuck it, and raised my hand. 

 she told us to come on stage, and fallow them. 

 She asked if I wanted to get sexed by her, and I said ""HELL YAH"", she took me into her trailer with the other guys, and band members. 

 It felt great, BUT AFTER I HAD CHLAMYDIA FOR A MONTH, I contacted her, and she said ""oh my god man Im so sorry, I thought that went away, I can pay for your medication if you need me to, I dont know which girl it was but we will use protection next time"". 

 This pisses me off even more because when I finally got sex I got an std, probably from chad.

82,"So my friend introduced me to her friend (let's call him Callum). We became pretty close, and I began to trust him with a lot. He was close to two of my best friends, so it felt natural.

Then crisis hit my life. My dad got diagnosed with stage one lung cancer, and, because of his incarceration, I am not allowed to see him or talk to him in any form. I am the most steessed out I have ever been. I am a 17yo kid. I was still trying to cope with my dad being where he is, then boom. Cancer.

I was upset and I confided in him. He said ""I've been worse."" I got really mad. I felt like he was trying to downplay this. I told him that and he got defensive. I assumed he was just having a bad day, so a few days later, I gave him an update since he asked how I was. That was a bad idea. He said the same thing again, so I got upset again.

A couple days after that, we were talking about hatred in a group chat with a few other people. We talked about really deep topics in that chat. I said I only hate people who hurt me, people I love, or people who don't deserve the hurt. He said ""I hate people that get triggered when I say 'I've been worse'."" I was livid and I went off. If he had dm'd me that he was still salty, ok. But he did it in a group chat. In front of my friends.

I unfriended him saying ""A person that says the same things over and over again that only make the other person angry, isn't a friend."" He apologized later. I don't believe him. Like my gut says he is only doing it for our mutual friends. I don't know what to do anymore...",05Jun2020,1
83,"I (30F) recently accepted a new job in a different city. Due to COVID-19, my start date has been pushed back a little, but my current job has already ended.

The thing is, my parents (69M, 54F) are Trump supporters and have a lot of opinions on COVID-19 and the recent police brutality protests. My dad regularly makes inflammatory remarks about race/politics, and I honestly feel he does so to provoke a fight with me. I've decided in the last year or so to stop engaging when he makes those comments. This unfortunately also means I avoid spending much time with him because he continues making these remarks and I just don't want to be around someone who is actively trying to piss me off. My mom always says how she ""is not political"" and is ""ignorant"" to everything going on, and admits that she just basically believes what my dad tells her to. Today she sent me a Candace Owens video saying how she was so ""factual and articulate"". I was surprised she sent me this because I had just been telling her the night before how much my dad's remarks hurt me and that every time we talked about politics, it led to a huge fight. She's never sent me anything political before, so I'm not sure why she chose today to send it. My brother (27M), who does not live in this house but visits often, is also very ""political"", but he refuses to watch the news and instead gets all his information from conspiracy theory videos on instagram. He also voted for/is going to vote for Trump. I asked my brother not to share his IG videos with me anymore after we got into an argument over one particularly stupid one, and he's now spamming me with conspiracy theory videos every day. He always brings up his newest conspiracy theory and steers the conversation somewhere political every time he visits (about 3x per week).

I’m Asian [Chinese/Burmese] mixed. My boyfriend is full Mexican. We’ve been dating for 4 years now. He’s the most supportive person in my life and I love him very much. Even in my childhood and teenage years, I had trouble developing an emotional connection to people around me. I never had that problem with my boyfriend so he’s really important to me. 

My family has always been racist towards the Latinx and African-American community. Ethnicity was always factored into everything I did. I wasn’t allowed to associate with my peers that were Latinx or African-American. My parents [50s] have a strong belief that these ethnic minorities are the cause of economic issues. Once I was 18, I decided I had enough and I wanted to be able to associate with whoever I wanted, regardless of ethnicity. 

It’s been the best decision of my life because I feel free. I didn’t care about my parents perspective and was open about my relationship with my boyfriend. Countless of times they’ve accused him of being a r@pist, drug dealer, etc etc. He tries to be respectful but I know it hurts him. I’m fed up with it too and I want out. They’ve told me that they don’t want their grandchildren to be mixed with Latinx. I’ve finally decided to cut them off, but there’s apart of me thats indecisive because I was always brought up it’s wrong to cut off family, regardless of how toxic it gets. “Blood is still blood” and thats engrained in me.

People we knew thought we were together, and we'd made plans to move to a different state together and live together there. So I didn't see it as a big thing to make the jump to asking her out.

Now, we've sent maybe 10 messages in the past 2 weeks, and we haven't seen each other, and replies I get are very short and haven't really started a conversation.

You known the one that gets talked over, never invited to anything until someone says ""you can come if you want to"", eats quickly because you're not the one people want to wait for and leaves their laces untied because they know that everyone will keep walking? yeah thats me. I've known my friends for quite sometime and I it has dawned on me that we've outgrown each other. I have never realised how materialistic and judgemental my friends were until I figured out that the reason that I don't share personal stuff with them is because they would judge and talk about it when I'm not around. One example when one of my younger siblings shared something personal on social media, and I found out that my two closest 'friends' often bitched about it behind my back. I have always been the listener and when two of my friends grew closer to another set of friends they pushed me aside and come back when convenient. I was never invited to hang out and they make plans in front of my face which involve some of our mutual friends which feels like a slap in the face. My mum always told me never to go anywhere I wasn't invited and I wish I took that advice years ago. I just dealt with it whenever I see instagram stories of my friends hanging out and I was 8/10 never invited. All in all I know that they would never do the things I have done for them and that my effort will never be reciprocated. I just feel so out of place with them now and I hate who I am around them because I know this isn't me. I don't want to be the second choice anymore.

I tolerated it for so long because I didn't want to be alone and friendless and I just got to that comfortable place where it would have been scary trying to change anything because its all I've ever known. And also years ago I shared some very personal things with them and I would hate for them to tell anyone about it. As cheesy as it sounds I wanted that friendship you see on Netflix originals. So in the midst of the world practically falling apart, it somehow made me reflect on my life and I realised that I wasn't happy and that I for once I knew that I deserved more. These people aren't for me, so why am I sticking around and trying to salvage relationships, making the effort when no one makes the effort for me? That's why I want to reinvent my life completely and cut of all ties that don't make me happy,

All I want is positive people in my life but I'm so terrified of being alone. Im 21 living in Sydney and by doing this I will have absolutely no friends and I feel like this is the time in your life where you need them around you to have fun. I know that by cutting ties no one is going to check up in me because as I mentioned I'm the second choice friend. But I guess no company is better than bad company and in a way I feel relieved.

98,"I don't want to do a huge write up, so here it is.

I should start by saying there are good parts to my life that I recognise, I have a family who love me, I have a partner who i can only describe as my soulmate and i have one really good best friend who inspires me to be a better person. I don't have major money issues. I have a home. I've travelled to places like Japan which were truly incredible experiences.

But I'm 28 and unremarkable in pretty much every way.

I work at McDonalds, and i find it embarrassing when people ask what I do. It's a fine job but it's nothing to be proud of.

I'm not sure if relevant to it but I grew up mostly with a young single mother, she's brilliant and incredibly loving, overbearingly if anything. When i was growing up my dad hit my mum on several occasions and they eventually divorced.  I see him rarely now, he has another family and as far as I know it's a happy marriage. He really isn't a bad person, I don't know what my mum did, but I'd never consider any reason to be acceptable anyway.

I always seem to think people can remember all these great anecdotal memories from their childhood, but i can barely remember anything. Some memories here and there but nothing story worthy. 

After my grandad died, i'd say my mum became a borderline alcoholic, and this made for some really stressful times through school. Coming home to burnt dinners, mum passed out or arguments with my stepdad etc. Often just went up to my room to play games.

Still play PC games, I have done for many years, mostly with a group of people which are a mix of people i grew up with, and people we know from another city, it became a pretty big 'friend' group. But i've since realised they are just really toxic and their whole culture is to give people abuse and show how much they don't care. I don't know what happened over the years but they don't care about me or respect me, so i've deleted them all from socials and haven't spoken to them for a month. From what I've heard they've just turned me leaving into somewhat of a joke between them.

Came out of school and college with bad grades because i never applied myself to it at all. Never revised, never did homework, just wanted to be out with friends at the time.

I've never really had any aspirations for careers or hobbies, so i've just floated my whole life. Never went to uni because i didn't know what I wanted to do. I still don't know what I want to do, and i feel like my options are closing with my age.

I have no idea if i'm smart or stupid, sometimes I feel like when i'm having a conversation my mind goes blank. For example if someones talking to me about music we both mutually like, i struggle to think of the artist name, or album name, or song name off the top of my head and feel like an idiot. But at the same time I feel that maybe i am above average intelligence, but it has just dulled after not being 'stimulated' for so many years.

I have no talents - everyone who is my age has been doing something since they were 10-15 so have 10+ years of experience in it already and this gets me down. I've realistically achieved nothing. 

I have bursts of motivation but don't stick to anything, whether that be a hobby, a diet, gym. The generic motivational stuff does nothing for me.

I should probably also add I'm not confident and self conscious with my appearance. I truly consider myself to be unattractive. I don't have great teeth, my eyesight is terrible and have a condition which isn't correctable with glasses, i got my nose broken when i was younger, i have a receding hairline. I could go on.

I feel like time is running out, or that it has already ran out.

I go through phases where I almost forget about it and just plod on with life like I have done for the majority of it already. 

Sorry to drone and sorry about the structure of this, I know it's not going to read very well. I don't know what I expect from this, I just feel hopeless and I don't know what to do about it.

I added the tldr life story in case any of it ties in.

99,"Lately I've been having this extremely disturbing dreams about me engaging in sexual acts with my father. I get chills thinking about it and it's making me feel extremely uncomfortable around him.
I absolutely do not have any sort of attraction to him in any way, and he's never done something to me that would be classified as sexual abuse or things like that.

I usually don’t get it until a day or two after it’s due, but she’s never been this late with it before.

I got fired because of work performance from the grocery store and I decided to reapply at the self-care company. I got an email and went through interviews for the self-care company and got a job offer again.

That sounds arrogant, but nothing is enough for me. Beggers can't be choosers though because I don't do enough to be better).

I have crippling depression that just makes me sleep and sleep. When I'm awake all I can think about is my problems. I can't eat, workout, read a book, study, watch a video or do anything anymore without having intrusive thoughts and thinking about my problems. If I don't think about my problems I feel like I have to or else I will never solve them. I become obsessed and start to get anxious and suicidal.

I feel like my life is over. I won't ever get to do it. I feel extremely pathetic. Truly successful people don't sit around doing nothing and letting their issues get to them. They make something of themselves. I could do that too. But I'm too pathetic and I can't stop my brain from thinking constantly of just problems, problems, problems.

112,"Around a year or so ago, my brother (who is 2 years older than me) came up to me and said he was sorry for what he did to me as a child. I didn’t know what he was talking about at first and then I completely remembered every detail. I pretended I didn’t know what he was talking about though to avoid anything awkward.

Sparing detail, I was I believe 6 and he was 8, he used to have me come in his room and kiss him and one time he tried to have sexual intercourse with me and I did not know what was happening, I was so young. I remember the whole thing, but do not want to post all of the detail. 

My brain completely blocked it out up until last year. I got so brain fuzzy that I decided to block it out again.

Today, my boyfriend brought up a funny (sexual) story and I started thinking and my brain just took me back to the memory from when I was a kid and I completely spaced out and he snapped me back into reality and asked if I was okay. I just looked at him and told him my brother sexually assaulted me as a kid and he was horrifed. I got so completely embarrassed and ashamed I hid my face from him and could not make eye contact with him for 40 minutes or so. I was just crying into his arm and staring at the floor. I was so embarrassed about it because it was my own brother and I don’t want him to look at him differently but now I don’t know if I’ll be able to look at my brother the same. 

My boyfriend kept reassuring me everything was okay and I had nothing to be embarrassed of but I could not look at him or say anything. I’ve never reacted to anything like that.

I realized that that was the first moment I’d admitted to myself that my own brother sexually assaulted me and it hit me like nothing else. I don’t know how to look at my brother. I don’t know if I should tell my mom and dad or if they would even believe me.
They already have a strained relationship with my brother (well, my whole family does) and I don’t want this to spark anything. I just don’t know how to handle this situation. I have a big hole in my chest now and need some help.

I don’t know/know if I want to discuss this with anyone in my life, but I needed to seek some sort of help with it, so I turned to this community.

115,"i have a very large personnal project which i wish to finish, i want to write a comic series. ive bought all materials i need to start it and have even wrote a (albeit barebones) script for its openning. for the past year it is all i have been able to think about and want to make it a reality, but i just cannot sit down and make it. i have tried to start it but am constantly procrastinating, mainly because of the lack of artistic ability causing some level of annoyance whenever i do try to make progression. This is not to say i dont have artistic talent, art and drawing have been my biggest talent for the past decade, but this single project, the one where i can put my talent to a satisfying use, i just cannot do correctly. i am not short on time, not by a long shot, but every day i dont progress somewhat in making this series is another day where it gets more complex and thus more daunting to produce. I am not giving it up, it is a actual legitimate dream of mine to hold a finished product in my hands one day, but the sheer pressure of it all is making me crack. when i sit down to progress i just end up drawing more character sheets or trashing a failed page, ive started doing the first three chapters out but hit a wall at page 2 because of artistic limitations i never face anywhere but on this project. i cant take a break, but i cant work either because both cause overwhelming fear of being in over my head. im fully knowledgable of my artistic ability both for writing and for drawing, but they only fall short when it actually matters.

sorry for the lack of paragraphs and junk. this is more of a vent to be completely honest, i have a genuine love for this idea, and have a clear idea of its entire course, but just getting it going, getting pages produced, getting chapters written, makes me not only look at how big a project this is, but also calls into question the few abilities i thought i had. i havent been able to completely relax over the past month because any time relaxing is not progressing and even trying to progress ends in failure. I can do this, ive done things of this quality (totally not same scale though) before, so why is it only now?

even now i feel as though im procrastinating, i have my paper and pencils beside me, taunting me, knowing full well that anything put upon it wont be satisfactory and will just prolong the dread, but i cant get a break, a schedule wont work because even if i devote specific times to drawing and writing, i will come out of the majority no further along than when i started. or maybe im wrong, maybe a schedule is exactly what im missing, i dont even know anymore.

if you have any advice, id love to hear it, this is a passion project which emotionally and mentally i cannot abandon, but its just been weighing on me more and more. i just cant stop thinking about it. thanks for reading my overly long rant about myself, showing the kindness of just listening is a trait that should be respected, and again, i thank you for it.

TL:DR im annoyed by a passion project i cant do because i very much can do it in terms of skills, but cant use these skills when trying to make it real cause i dont know.

thank you and have a nice day",05Jun2020,1

117,"Hi so I have taken the pandemic very seriously, ive been quarantined since mid march. I only go out to pick up curbside pickups with my mask on. My little sister just graduated highschool and my family wants to have a dinner to celebrate. Im not sure how to feel about this though. I dont know if ive been too rigid in quarantine or if the apprehension is founded. I dont want to hurt my sisters feelings because this time sucks to be a teenager (the last summer as a teen with your lifelong friends before college and missing prom, graduation, etc all of those little things she was looking forward has kept her kind of depressed) but I also don't want to haphazardly throw away the caution ive used so far. 

Some background: my parents are conservative and while they know theres a pandemic they also just want to open everything up. They are in their 50s and in pretty good health. They are also both essential workers so theyve been out wheras i am an essential worker (I work in the educational domain) but have been working from home and not going out.  I live in an apartment, my family lives in a house in the town nearby. My other sister is also home from college (luckily, as she was in Texas which had a resurgence after reopening everything). In the couple of months since all of this began my family has not tried to cooperate in having video calls my mom txts me everyday but getting her to sit still and video call with me seems a moot point (frantic mom energy). I dont want to alienate myself from family or hurt their feelings when they dont understand why i take it more seriously than them (we watch very different news sources). I am in California where it seems like people have let up a bit, personally it see a lot of my friends on social media has seemingly returned to normal life. Thats confusing and kind of makes me feel crazy.

121,"I live in a upper middle class white neighborhood with my aunt and uncle (whom are immigrants). We have been disrespected and told to go back to “our country” over the years but we never let it bother us as we have been here for 20 years and our house is paid off. We have 2 mixed dogs 55lbs each. They are bad at barking at neighbors but have never jumped the fence or escaped. November 2016 our backyard neighbor (male) verbally attacked my aunt and threatened to kill our dogs since they were barking to much. My aunt had to go to therapy for 6 months afterwards because she was so traumatized from the situation. Then that same man attacked our roommate from Peru with the same threats. Again, dogs were doing nothing but bark. We asked the HOA to build a 6ft privacy fence between us but we’re denied and only allowed 4ft. So we built the fence and thought all this was behind us. Fast forward to present day, I was in the backyard talking on the phone and the wife was yelling at me (dogs were not outside) to come over and already had her phone recording me. They have children and they were saying we need to do something about our dogs barking and reiterated they would kill our dogs if they ever jumped the fence. I explained to her our family did everything we could to separate ourselves from them and told her to contact the HOA about a bigger fence. She said she will and that once she gets the okay we have to pay for it. While she was recording I brought up the verbal harassment and threats her husband have given us twice. She said she had no idea but it was justified. Again, our dogs have never jumped the fence or attack people. I am so at a loss for words. I truly think they would try to kill our dogs and after this 3rd threat enough is enough. The American side of my family thinks we should file a restraining order. I have contacted the president of the HOA but he is slow to respond. I know you are thinking... there must be more to the story but there is not. My aunt and Roomate are tiny 115lb women in their 60s with broken english and never said anything back to these attackers.

122,"This might be a bit of a long post and I’m on mobile, so sorry in advance. 

I never post on Reddit, and I’ve made a throw away just in case, but I really don’t know what to do here. I just graduated college this year, and with the quarantine all of my job prospects got cancelled so I’m back home living with my parents. My parents are not a good situation for me, they’ve been emotionally abusive and are prone to gaslighting, something I really only understood when I was away from them at college. I have some mental health struggles I can directly correlate to growing up under their roof and rules. (Which they don’t know about, obviously) 

I also get chronic migraines, and today I had a really bad migraine, so I’ve been in bed all day as movement bothers me. However, light and sound only sometimes bother me and today they didn’t, so I’ve been off and on sleeping and on my phone, because I’m confined to my bed and I’m bored. Well apparently this really bothered my mother, as she only saw it as lazy and not wanting to “engage in the real world and I just wanted to lie in bed and watch videos on my phone”. She thoughts I was lying about my pain and using it as an excuse. She blew up and got really angry (she also thinks I’m not taking my allergy medicine even though I am and she has no reason not to think that. My parents often think I’m lying about things and I don’t really understand why or what makes them think that. Usually I just apologize anyway and move on.)

I didn’t respond in the moment because 1) I just honestly didn’t know what to say because anything I could say feels like a lose lose situation since she will never believe me and 2) I have a migraine!! I’m in pain!! 

But part of her solution to my “laziness” was her threatening to turn off data and WiFi to the entire house, so theoretically I wouldn’t have any connection to the internet and would “have” to join the family for things. (I should note that because of the quarantine I haven’t left my house in three months, and I often join the family for things, expect when I’m actually WORKING on something on my laptop.) I’m really concerned she may actually do this, especially because I’m trying to do online freelance work to save up enough money and move out. 

Is there any way I could address this that could get her to believe my pain and that I’m not lying? I don’t really know how to convince her that I don’t lie to her all the time, my parents have believed this for most of my life. I’m definitely hiding things from them - I have severe depression and anxiety they don’t know about, as well as potentially some sort of dissociative disorder that I can’t even get properly diagnosed or treated for because they believe mental illness is a weakness of character and I don’t want that on my insurance in case they find out. I’m scared if we get into an argument some of that might come out and it would just make everything worse. 

In the event they do kick me out, does anyone have any tips on what to do? I potentially have some friends I could stay with a couple hours away if I manage to be able to leave with a car, but if anyone has any tips for safety or saving/making money, or really anything I would appreciate it. Even if it doesn’t happen because of this conversation I get the feeling it may happen soon. 

I’ve never really been able to stand up to my parents before or even have an honest conversation with them because I’m so scared. I’ve started to try a few times in the past but I get shut down so fast with bad consequences but I can’t keep living like this, especially if my parents are about to take away my only way to make and save money. I know this may seem small compared to some other people’s problems, but it’s only the tip of the iceberg and I just don’t know what to do anymore. If you bothered to read all of this - thank you!! And please, any advice would be greatly appreciated, I don’t really have anyone irl I can talk to about this or get advice from.",05Jun2020,1
123,"Ok this is kinda convoluted and I’m not being that clear because I’m upset right now but I’ll do dot points for you guys.

For context
- I am my mother’s only child (my dad had 4 kids from a previous marriage)

- my dad was really supportive and I was incredibly close to him; he died 4 years ago.

- mum is pretty isolated where she lives - not near her family and doesn’t have a lot of friends in her town.

- mum tells me and my partner what to do a lot - like giving “advice” but it feels a lot like she’s just shitting on us. For example, I work out a lot and I consider myself pretty knowledgeable about fitness and nutrition for someone who doesn’t work in the field. She has never exercised consistently in her life and is overweight which causes her health problems. She still tells me to lift less weight and tells me what and how to eat.

- she’s a really judgemental person, especially when it comes to people in larger bodies and people who look a certain way. I have a strong tendency to be the same way, but am working to change my thinking.

The big issue I guess is really this -

- I feel like since dad died, I’m under an incredible amount of pressure. I feel like I’m all my mum has and it just feels really heavy.

- she lives in a different town about 3 hours away so we talk on the phone mostly. When we talk, she talks about her own issues and things that are difficult for her mostly. I feel like she dumps all her problems, complaints, issues etc on me. If I try to talk to her about anything I feel as if she’s just waiting until she can one-up it with “well listen to what happened to me today, it’s worse...”

- I don’t feel that I can tell her how I feel about our relationship because I think she would either just negate my feelings and tell me that I’m overreacting (which is something she does a lot) or she wouldn’t be able to deal with it emotionally

- In addition to this, I work a job where I’m required to give a lot of myself- I teach kindergarten, and anyone who has done something similar knows that it can really take it out of you. I give a lot of myself at work.

The last straw for me this time around was that it’s my birthday today. She decided yesterday afternoon that she was going to come visit me because she “didn’t want to be sad and alone on your birthday”. She called me this morning at 6.30 when she knows I’m working out and talked about her memories of giving birth to me. Maybe this doesn’t sound that bad but I really struggle with celebrations like birthdays and Christmas since dad died and she doesn’t respect that at all.",05Jun2020,1

126,"I am a mother of 3 kids. I had been a stay at home mom for a lot of my adult life because of them. The kids father was emotionally abusive and I had to leave for my own sanity. Now that I left my toxic ex husband I am building my career from the ground up.
I started working for this company shortly after leaving him. It was a great place to be at the time because the people I work with are incredibly uplifting and kind. I needed that while I was healing. 
I learned quickly and became one of the top employees and 1 year in I was asked to interview for a promotion. 2 hours later I walked into the interview and dominated. I was hired into the position that evening as I left for work. My new supervisor came to me and said that he had just found out that I had a vacation scheduled for the coming up Friday so he asked me to come on in the next 2 days and just manage emails and shadow some of my team so that my clients didn’t think I went MIA 2 days after getting into the position. Makes sense to me.
Friday comes and I leave on vacation. While I am on vacation Covid-19 unleashes on the US. I get a phone call from my new bosses right hand girl and she tells me that I am not a good fit and I will be going back to my previous position. It didn’t make any sense to me because I wasn’t able to really do anything.
I get back and I was pulled to the side and told that we are making the transition to remote work and asked how I felt about what is going on. I explained that I was confused and a little upset that I was essentially demoted. She assured me that it had nothing to do with that and everything to do with Covid 19.
I got I’ll a few days later and was put on quarantine. Because of that I was furloughed for 2 months. They asked me back under the agreement that while we are home I would work the late shift. That was ok with me because I could be home with my kids. I was told that I would have my early shift back when we went back in.
They completely restructured the company the day I got back and are now forcing me to go back into the office without changing my schedule back. I have brought it to their attention that I was promised the early shirt and they are not budging. I don’t make enough money there to even pay for daycare and the only way I can get my ex husband to help with the kids is to be on the early shift so I can pick them up from him by 3:30. If I work the late shift he will keep them during the week and I will have them on the weekends. That will shift our 50/50 custody agreement to where he has primary custody. I am not ok with that.
I am incredibly disappointed in my company but I feel like my hands are tied. The HR lady is married to the supervisor who gave me the promotion and then sent me back. I don’t want to go into to much detail but so many people are in relationships or married to other employees/owners that I cannot even say anything. 
I can’t quit and I can’t open my mouth to anyone. Suggestions or advice?!",05Jun2020,1

132,"I (21F) have gained a substantial amount of weight. I know I need to work on my self esteem and self love, but right now that’s difficult. I’m taking medication prescribed by my PCP to get me back on track, and I’m working on eating and being more healthy. 

Now, in October I am going on vacation with my boyfriend and his family. His mom, sister, and aunt are all GORGEOUS and skinny. I’m definitely overweight, and I can’t help but compare myself to them. They would absolutely NEVER look at me differently or make me feel a certain way, but it’s how I feel. 

I’m at the point where when i look at myself in the mirror, I want to back out of the vacation. I’ve always been very concerned with the way that i look, and even though I’m working extremely hard I know I won’t be comfortable by October. 

So, my question IS, how do “heavier” people dress when going somewhere hot? We will be in Florida for his aunt’s wedding, and I’ve never been on vacation before, let alone at this weight. I understand this problem might be trivial to some people, but it’s making me extremely anxious.

133,"How do I approach my bosses about passing me up on a promotion without letting me know?

So basically before covid I was up for a team director position. I spoke with my director and assistant director multiple times before covid happened about it. We agreed that I would write up a proposal on how I would manage the team and they would let me know basically if I could/couldn’t lead the team. When shit hit the fan, a few individuals were allowed to stay at the campus and the rest were asked to stay home. I was a little miffed when I found out that people that had been there less time than me and were less involved were allowed to stay but I thought eh it’s whatever. 

Today I found out from someone who was under me in one of my teams before covid that they had started the lead the team I had basically applied to manage. No one told me. They were also able to stay. I was not. 

It feels like a punch in the gut. I’m one of the longest standing employees at the organization, surpassed by a few but not the majority. I don’t know how to confront my director and assistant director about this. Honestly I would probably just keep it quiet, except a new team is being formed in August probably and I’m expecting to be the leader of that team since I was the leader on a similar project a few months back, and I’m the only one with experience with that kind of project. 

For some info, I work at an organization that has daily teams and their leaders, seasonal teams and their leaders, and them special project teams and their leader.

23 (f) have a terrible time remembering things . Its never big things like dates or events but more like conversations I've had and things I've learned about people.  It's been this way since I was young and while it's slowly gotten better I fear sometimes that I may be remembering things because my memory is so bad.
Any advice for helping remembering details about conversations or facts about people after having those conversations? Or is it normal to forget entirely these things until its brought up abd than second guess yourself?

If it helps I have trouble paying attention in college classes but I do retain the information  , faces are fine nakes too its purely conversations that this ends up being an issue.

135,"Okay, so I think I'm in a relatively one-sided relationship and it's seriously starting to drive me insane. Long story short, I have a friend and she has been complaining to me about her boyfriend basically everyday for the last year, but it's gotten significantly worse since COVID-19 and quarantine (which is understandable). I've told her numerous times to leave him, since he is emotionally abusive and unambitious (this has been an issue looooong before COVID). I've been able to empathize with her to some degree since I too, have been in an emotionally abusive relationship and have experience getting out of/moving on from something like this. They ended up breaking up because he found something in her messages he didn't like (just girls generally bitching about their boyfriends) and he kicked her out of his apartment. Now all of a sudden she is in love with him again, wants to get back together if he'll speak to her, and apparently wants to spend the rest of her life with him. I'm incredibly frustrated because literally DAYS before she was saying how immature he was, how unhappy she was, and how she couldn't possibly see a future with someone like him and definitely couldn't have kids with him; used the word ""hate"" multiple times. This is the only thing we talk about. Anytime I talk about something that god forbid has to do with me, she will reply briefly and then we're back to talking about her ex-boyfriend. I'm trying to be supportive but I feel like no matter what I say she doesn't take it to heart. If they end up getting back together I know I'm going to have to listen to all the bullshit I did before, and she'll be bitching to me again. I absolutely do not want to deal with this anymore, and I'm seriously considering saying this to her; that if it's the same shit I don't want to continue this friendship.

Side note: She is there for me if I have life problems but my issues are typically just a few messages of venting and I'll figure it out on my own. I do NOT drag on my problems, and I always make sure to keep things about her as well, not just about me. But I have NEVER taken it this far with days and days and days of talking about my issues.

140,"I’m intrigued in everyone’s opinion regarding the rise of the BLM movement recently, and thought I’d discuss it with some of my friends. However, one of my friend apparently thought I was coming across very pushy and forceful, pressuring into making her post about it and maybe I was and just wasn’t aware of how I was coming across (I definitely wasn’t forcing her to post about it tho). She made it clear she didn’t want to talk about the subject by ignoring me and when I called her out on it she sent me voice notes being really nice and expressing her opinion, which I didn’t get to open until the morning due to being asleep. 

However, before I got the chance to listen to the voicenotes, I received videos (over Snapchat) that she accidentally sent to me talking really badly of me and saying I’m trying to ‘act like an activist’, twisted everything I said and that I need to back off (used a worse word) and really painted me out to be this forceful horrible monster. I was already feeling alone the previous night due to none of my friends really wanting to discuss the topic and not being as passionate as I was, and this topped it all of confirming it. 

She’s apologised a lot and said she’s in a weird headspace and has stuff going on and she just ended up taking it out on me and needed to vent and she really wants to make it right. However, her attitude in the video was so nasty and she spoke so awfully of me I don’t know if I actually want to forgive her for her actions during a time like this. I’m extremely hurt and upset by it as they were never my intentions, I just clearly wanted to discuss it and try and educate her as she said she was uneducated. 

However I do understand maybe I was coming across too much. Is it too petty for me to not want to continue our friendship after that?

141,"Sorry if this is dumb.

I started dating my ex when we were 14. We'll call her Jane. We were in a tight knit friend group of four throughought grade 8,9, 10, we'll call the friend in question Joe. She moved about 30 min away in 10th grade and kind of drifted off from our original friend group, and I fell out of contact with them as well around 12th grade, yet I still considered them very good friends. Jane and I dated all through high school and we moved out together, but about 6 months ago, after a little over 5 years, we broke up very amicably. It sucked on both ends and neither of us wanted it but we were starting to go our separate ways. We haven't properly talked in about a month.

So for about 2 weeks now Jane's been staying overnight at Joe's house at least every other day. I don't know this because I'm stalking her, it's because Joe literally lives on my street. Her car sticks out like a sore thumb every time I drive past, especially on my way to work in the morning. I didn't want to believe that she'd sleep with him, but it's hard not to come to that conclusion at this point. And everyone I've talked to says that they're definitely sleeping together, and some think it's intentional where she parks her car so that I see it.

I'm starting to feel very resentful and almost hateful towards both of them. I don't want to have these feelings for Jane, I still hold her very dear. Joe, too, for that matter. I was thinking about calling her and just asking her so I know if these feelings are warranted. But I also don't want to come off as the crazy, jealous ex boyfriend.

151,"Hello all, sorry for possible weird format, I’m on mobile. Also TW on suicide. 

A couple weeks ago I set up an over the phone appointment with a therapist, this was supposed to be my first appointment with a therapist ever. I was feeling my lowest. I was very depressed and suicidal, I had no appetite, no drive, no motivation, no will to live. It seemed like everything was going wrong in my life. I just wanted to end it all. 

The BLM protests are all over my city and surrounding cities, I’ve been participating and found that it’s been giving me drive to live, that I make a difference and I add to the powerful voices and I stand up for the oppressed. If I die at these protests, at least I die for a good cause. 

Even though I felt no will to live, a small part of me wanted to seek help and try one more time, so that’s what I tried to do. I set up an appointment, the soonest was in a few weeks (today), but when I got the call I was too overwhelmed and scared that my problems aren’t as severe or serious as what other people are going through, especially during these trying times. So I didn’t pick up the phone. They tried to call three times. I didn’t answer.

152,"I wanted to start this off by saying that I (18M) am very fortunate for the opportunities I’ve had in my life. I come from a wealthy family and I’m very thankful to have not had many of the experiences people discuss on this sub.

With that though, my dad has always struggled with controlling his anger. Working with him tends to devolve into a screaming fit—telling me that I’m stupid, ungrateful, worthless, etc (I know it’s not as bad as others). He’s also very not afraid to yell in public. There have been a number of times where I’ve been screamed at in front of my team (~20 people) about various things. While my mom disapproves of this, she’s very non-confrontational and will not intervene.

Over the years I’ve developed a very big fear of failure, and have admittedly become very insecure. I’ve become very stressed about doing simple tasks because I don’t want to be seen as a disappointment and useless. I’ve always been criticized for not doing things the perfect way.

All of this has left me really unsure over whether or not I want to have kids in the future. One of my biggest fears is to emulate my dad and treat my children poorly. Occasionally I see myself becoming like him in conversations and it really scares me. On the flip side, I am an intimate person and would really like to get married one day, but I feel like having children tends to be a given in marriage—more often than not at least. I can tell that my mom really wants to have grandchildren. She often makes comments about ‘when’ I have children in the future. She will later correct it to ‘if’, though I can tell it really means a lot to her. 

All this has left me really unsure of what I want to do in the future. While I’d like to have children one day, I fear becoming like my dad. I know that if I elect not to have kids, the friendships I rely on today will likely fade over time as people start families, leaving me with no one.  I’m just looking for advice on how to proceed forward from others’ experiences.

i thought i had put all this behind me, but recently a conversation between my one friend stirred up some uncomfortable feelings. he had said that my ex a few months back had tried dating someone else while we were on-and-off with our talking (which he was/is allowed to, we weren't dating, it's none of my business) but dear god did it hurt. why?? i haven't felt anything nice for him in a year but it still hurts to think that he found someone better. i hate feeling like just a stepping stone in someone's life. that's all i ever am, i'm never the end goal. 

i don't want anything to do with him anymore, i really don't, and he's made it clear he wants nothing to do with me as well. how can i stop thinking about him? stop hoping he's okay? stop wondering if he thinks about me and how i'm doing? it's sick, and i don't know what to do.

i've tried talking to new people but no one in my school likes me (thanks to him), literally i'd go the whole school day without talking. i've had no luck online because i'm shy and have a lot of issues people don't want to deal with. wholly understandable.

161,"I feel like the day where me and my dog finally part ways is coming. I’ve had her ever since I was in 2nd grade and was always paranoid when she was running free that she may get hit by a car or swept away by a coyote or something. But now I think that age is finally starting to take its toll on her and I fear that the end may be coming sooner than I had hoped. I know it’s part of life and that she’ll truly be at rest, but she’s been the best emotional support for the darkest times. I’m not ready. I want to deny it’s going to happen even though I know it’s inevitable. If anyone has any sort of advice for preparing to cope with this, I’d really appreciate it.",05Jun2020,1
162," My GF (18) is on the combo pill and is pretty consistent with it. Always taking it within a 3-4 hour time block every day.

On Thursday (April 21) we had unprotected sex at around 11am. On Saturday (April 23) night around 7:30pm she had some unusual spotting and so she ended up taking Plan B at 8:15pm on that Saturday.

Since then she’s had some cramps here and there but nothing super abnormal for her.

But the real worry came last night (June 3rd) which would be 13 days after we had unprotected sex. She had some brown and dark pink spotting and now she is terrified that it was Implantation Bleeding

Her period is due around June 8th which would be about a week after this spotting

She’s not planning on taking a pregnancy test until Thursday (June 11th) when I can go see her.

How likely is it that she is pregnant? How terrified should I be?

Thanks for any and all input/advice",05Jun2020,1

165,"I hope that this isn't against any rules or seems like I am asking in bad faith. 

There is a local group that has been organizing events for students to go to around my small town, and I have been planning on going to an event soon; however, one of the admins of the group just advocated for racial superiority. 

She stated that the breeding of African Americans has made the race stronger and more resilient to pain, and that she has had doctors and scientists tell her so. I personally cannot stand for any type of speech that encourages such dangerous ideologies. It is an slippery slope that is covered with oil and waiting to be set alight. It is the same type of pseudoscience used by slave-owners and Nazis. It's junk science, but how do I prove that to be true? The reason why I am so moved to do so is because many are simply agreeing with her bad take. 

However, I do not want to come in as a white person and correct a black person during a time of hurt and pain, but I can't stand by such a bad ideology. I have a mug that I use daily that is from the Holocaust Memorial in Washington D.C. I wear a watch that commemorates the liberation of the Jewish people from the death camps. I take these things very seriously.

We're supposed to sign the lease in 2 weeks and he now tells me about how he doesn't want any of my friends to visit our apartment. Like at all. He doesn't want them coming inside or staying over. He suggests they stay in a nearby hotel and can hang out with us in our apartments common space, like pool area and BBQ. This is a hard limit for him and he says the idea of anyone besides family being in our space makes him uncomfortable. I was understanding and said it's fine for them to stay in a hotel (despite me not really wanting this). But he's not willing to compromise with me and let them at least hang out inside the apartment. He says he doesn't bring his friends around for this same reason. Also he suggested him leaving if I really did want to have a friend visit. 

This is making me reconsider moving at all. He says it's a hard limit and I'm just not comfortable with having a friend visit and fly 6+ hours to not even be able to enter my apartment that I pay for half of?

179,"context: i (18M) live in Australia. i also deal with anxiety and depression and see a therapist regularly except for during this pandemic, i havent been able to comfortably have contact with them. 

i work at dominos as a casual. this specific dominos has had major health and procedural problems in the past. to a point where they had to close the store for 2 weeks to properly inspect and retrain all staff. after that incident the store was alot better, espeically with its staff. but now (6+ months later), they have gone downhill. i have problems with late change and get overhelmed very quickly. the rosters are being sent out every sunday or monday for that work, often giving less than 24 hours notice if working on the monday. i have tried speaking to mangament about this situation multiple times but they have given excuses such as they were busy and gave a simple apology but have made no effort to make and send them earlier. i have also asked to not be rostered monday or tuesday if this rostering situation does not change and yet they still roster me on and make me feel bad for calling in saying i cant work it. this causes me alot of stress and lately it has been causing issues for my sleep schedule. 

i am also trained for both instore and delivery driver. i have brought up that putting me on as delivery driver is more preferred but now they have just kept me as in store, to deal with the evening rush. and its become regular that i have been put as making pizza/order during rushes by myself very often. i feel very stressed doing this as we can get as much as 30-40 pizzas every half an hour for 3-4 hours and that doesnt include sides. and i feel as if i am overworked and very often left without support when i need it. 

this week i managed to get sick and couldnt go into work, upon speaking to my boss earlier in the week about me being sick, he put it on me about how its hard to find other staff to cover me and that he cant find people etc. 

when i started work, i specifically said i can only do 12-16 hours due to my mental health (reason im only doing casual work). but recently i have been put on minimum 16-20 hours and the effect on me has been noticeable, especially with my moods. and i have asked to be put on less but no action has been taken. i also end up with my shifts exteneded quite often, and in my agreement it says that when shift change has occured with less than 12 hours notice or working when not rostered, i should be paid double, which i am not. 

im honestly starting to consider leaving, as money is not a problem for me due to getting governemnt benefits. i also do tafe as well, which is online and meant to be one or two days a week but lately with this work situation i have not been able to keep up.",05Jun2020,1

182,"As a young white woman in North America I am finding myself confused, guilty and overwhelmed with the social media posts during the BLM. And saying this I feel even more guilty because I do not want to come across as though I am making this about me to complain about my discomfort. I fully accept that I do not understand and will never understand. And I fully believe that black lives matter, without a doubt. 

At first the posts were influential and meaningful but they soon turned to judgemental and accusing. Posts like ""your silence is noted"" made me feel an overwhelming sense of guilt and pressure to post something to my instagram story to show my peers that I do in fact support this movement. I tried to do it from an informative place, sharing posts that offered advice for the privileged to be ""non-optical allies"" because my biggest fear was being just that. I shared pages where people can donate and I did in fact donate to those communities to feel authentic and not performative. But these posts that I shared were taken from someone else's story and I kept seeing the same images circling every hour. It came to a point where I felt like we were all just re sharing things to show to our followers that we do care because we felt pressured from those saying that our ""silence was violence"". 

My main reason for posting this is because I feel an immense amount of shame and guilt during all of this. I fear that my intentions were wrong for sharing those posts because of my shame. I decided to unplug and deactivate my instagram for a bit to reflect. Instagram was always a bit of a toxic thing in my life and with COVID-19 and this race war I felt myself becoming PARANOID about what I was or wasn't posting. I shared this with my friends so they didn't go to send me a meme only to discover that my page was gone but they all read my message and didn't respond. I then text my friends about something unrelated and I am met with silence and coldness. Now my paranoia stemmed from being on social media has progressed into being paranoid about NOT being on social media and the message that sends to people. I messaged my one friend who went to a protest in town asking her how it went and that I hope she knows that I fully support this movement and I don't want her to mistake my absence from instagram as me just not wanting to deal with the posts. No response. 

It feels like I have been completely estranged from my whole friend group now because of this and I just have no idea what to do. It makes me doubt my instincts and intentions. I wonder if I am just trying to shield myself from the discomfort but I feel like for me to truly absorb my thoughts I need to seek the answers for myself. 

Am I the only one experiencing this? Am I wrong for unplugging? Or am I just so paranoid and making this into a bigger problem than it needs to be???? Any advice would be helpful and my apologies for the long winded and unorganized post.",05Jun2020,1
183,"Im a teenager and i dont know what is going on. All my life ive never had any problem making jokes or talking to people.

186,"Hi, Reddit. 
I’m having a.. dilemma. And I could really use some advice. 

A little about me :

I’m almost always romantically involved with someone. I’m a Libra, I love attention and flirting.  I’ve never really been single. My love interests have always failed- I usually choose crappy people. I’ve had both flings and long relationships. I had been a giver in all my relationships, and I have never received. I’ve dated both men and women in the past (only to realize I actually only like women) and have never “received” from anyone because of my discomfort and insecurities. So my relationships have always been sexless- or me pleasing them while I stay fully clothed and dry.

Anyway, after a pretty bad break up four years ago, and getting an awful diagnosis shortly after, I decided it was time to live my life to the fullest and be single while I’m still going and healthy (I was 23 at the time) I feel like I never let loose and had fun, plus I had no actual desire to live for long. I was depressed and reckless. I had a lot planned. I wanted a friends with benefits. I wanted a one night stand. I wanted to go on vacation and set up a Tinder and meet some random attractive stranger for drinks. I wanted to get pretty and get hit on at a bar. I wanted to slide into someone’s DMs. I wanted to have a threesome! I wanted to be young, you know?? 
So I started my single going 20’s journey. I set my eyes on a cute coworker, and worked hard to have a little work fling. They were a few years younger than me, so I didn’t expect anything more than just a little bit of fun. 

Well, we quickly fell in love and started dating. Crap. So much for being single and fun. Oops! 

My coworker, let’s call them Liz, was PERFECT. I loved everything about Liz. They were always so happy, so fun to be around, they trusted me, I trusted them- everything just came so natural. I opened up to them about my absolute darkest secrets and demons- something I never thought I’d be able to do- with no judgements at all. I felt free. I felt seen. For the first time in my life, I felt LOVED. I feel BEAUTIFUL. I felt respected, desired, trusted, wanted, appreciated. I loved Liz with all my heart. And, we were able to have sex! I felt so safe with Liz. It was amazing.
They were so good to me. We traveled the world together, my family loved them, their family loved me, we got a dog together, and most importantly- they helped me get sober (alcoholic!). They made me feel like my life was valuable and I made a change for the better. 
I went back to school, I started planning for my future, I changed my whole life around because of LIZ. 

After a while, like every relationship, the honeymoon phase ended and things started getting dark. Liz was still so good to me and I was still so happy, but as expected our sex life dulled, we started arguing a lot, the age thing started to get in the way (I was maturing a lot faster than they were), and their energy was different. It was dark. They became depressed- seriously depressed. They lost motivation for a lot of things. They became such a negative person that it started to drain my happiness. I was doing well, and Liz wasn’t. And I tried my best to help, but their energy and their attitude towards me was too intense. I started to become miserable over time. Neither of us had any friends but each other, and we hardly had fun anymore. Activities together always ended up in a silly argument where one of us (usually
me) would end up exploding for the silliest reasons. Things like, for example : Me going out with my new coworkers and playing board games and Liz not joining in or even being interested in talking or engaging, but actually sitting by themselves at a completely different table, drinking alone. It made me uncomfortable, and it embarrassed me honestly. They didn’t even try. They said they were uncomfortable and felt anxious, and I respected that and said next time I’ll just go alone because I don’t want them uncomfortable. But it happened more than once, and it was always things like that. 

Anyway, over time.. I started realizing that even though I love Liz, I’m getting older. I’m 27 now. I still haven’t done anything that I wanted to do. I’ve never been single. This relationship lasted longer than I ever expected and it  seems to be going well because our love is so strong, so I can see us ending up together forever. But am I ready for that? There’s so much more I want to experience. And Liz? Liz is 23. We started dating when they were 19. Before that, they had a girlfriend for two years. They haven’t experienced being a young adult yet either. I don’t want to take that experience away from them.

So I explained to them that I love them, and I’ll always love them. It was an emotional break up, but we both ended up agreeing that we should experience more things separately. We’re still best friends, we still share custody of our pup, and we actually still plan on moving out together- just in separate rooms. My mind is telling me if we’re meant to be, we’ll come back together one day. That the universe will reunite us when we’re ready to be together. 

Liz and I have discussed our feelings. Even though Liz is still hurt from our breakup, they’re honestly kind of thriving in a  way. I think they seem to be doing better- happier, even if just a tiny bit. The thing is we got quarantined days after our break up, so it’s been really hard since we can’t even do anything separate or together and haven’t seen each other in months, which wasn’t the plan. The plan was to hang out once a week and stay connected while also living out  lives. 

Anyway, I still love Liz. I’m in love with Liz. I can see myself marrying Liz. I don’t ever want to lose Liz, so I’ll also be content with having them as a best friend. I’d rather a lover one day, but I’ll accept best friend.
They claim to want the same, but I don’t know.

My heart is broken because over the past few weeks.. I’ve felt an extreme push back from Liz. They hardly respond to me anymore, and when they do I just feel like I’m being a burden.
I think they might be getting over me.
And I know I should be prepared for that.

But now my mind is thinking..

I broke up with Liz because I didn’t want to string them along because I knew I was having desires to be single, and I knew that eventually I’d give in to my desires. I didn’t want to hide anything from them, so I thought it was the right thing to do to be honest and put our fate in the hands of destiny. “If we’re meant to be together we’ll be together.” 

But now I’m wondering if maybe I did the wrong thing. Maybe I made the wrong move.

Do I give up such an amazing love for a few months of freedom? I don’t even want to be single for long, I just want to experience some freedom for a bit. Is that extremely selfish? 

I truly believe Liz is my soulmate, but I wasn’t ready to be with them. 

What do you think about this situation? Did I mess up?",05Jun2020,1

I will have to take my GCSE’s and miss a year of school meaning I’ll be in the year below. Now this wouldn’t be a problem had I been in school in year 10, I had to take time off with the school saying it was right because of serious mental health issues and physical health issues I have been dealing with, I did my mocks at home and got below average, I did these in exam conditions, I got like 4-6 on most of them, which is pretty bad. Anyway, I’m going to have to relearn the syllabus and retake the exams if I want to go to college, now the reason I’m saying my life is over is because I won’t be able to learn the syllabus again, learning it in the first place is what partly got me of school with the anxiety and depression, I feel this coming back to me and I’m so scared for my future, I was supposed to have a fresh start in September doing what I wanted and now that’s gone and I don’t see any way out of it this time.

Here’s my conundrum: I’m petrified that I’m going to continue to be unemployed and not be able to either renew my lease, or find a new place.

Also, since we’ve been together basically since the breakup, the reality of being so alone in this new place is really setting it.  I also don’t like it here. I haven’t had the best time basically since I got here and I keep telling myself that it’s been a bad situation since I got here. Rain, I was broke, WFH, winter, covid, now riots. It’s just not a great set up to meet new people. 

But the situation at hand: what do I do if I’m unemployed? I have a quasi friend here who said that I can stay with her and her husband in their two bedroom, but they have a dog, cat, rabbit, and something else. I have a dog and a cat. It’s not going to be fun if that’s the case.  And I can’t imagine her husband is going to appreciate it.

205,"So my (22F) parents divorced 4 years ago. My dad now has a new stable relationship, and my mom has been going on dates with a lot of guys. I rarely meet them for multiple reasons. Today,  Mom visited me earlier and said she's going on a weekend rv trip to a different state with guy #3 (she just ended a week long relationship with guy #2 last Sunday, and about 3 or 4 weeks about she was seeing guy #1). I asked her if anyone else knew she was going on this strange trip with this mysterious guy. My brother and I are the only ones who know.

She tends to move very fast with her relationships, and she's very trusting.  I've voiced my concerns throughout these last four years but she makes it very clear she's an adult and she can make her own decisions. I've been keeping my mouth shut lately but I've never met this guy. I only know his name, and I can't find him on social media. She's only shown me one photo of him, and he's wearing sunglasses. I asked her for more photos but even his name and photo I can't do much.. she'll be hundreds of miles away if this guy is a paycho and something does happen to her. What can I do for extra precautions???

I may be overreacting, but with every fiber of love that my mom possesses and shares with everyone she meets, I know that (past all the boyfriend drama) shes been through a lot.

Before the quarantine, I would go to bed at 10:00 PM and wake up at 7:00 AM (only because of school). I never took naps before, but now I find myself always falling asleep. 

I’ll just be watching a video and next thing you know i’m out for 2 hours despite trying so hard to not fall asleep. It messes my whole day up because afterwards, I have to take a shower because the nap leaves me feeling like literal shit. It may just be due to the fact that I have nothing going on anymore?

207,"The title is a massive summarization; let me explain the context and detail in the situation that I need some advice for. TL;DR at the bottom, in bold.

There were three incidents, I'll just call them the three strikes. The first strike was 7 years ago, when we were young teens. We were in a skype call and he was relentlessly shitting on my brother for no good reason. Told him enough was enough, and cut ties. I was forced back, though, because he was a friend of my friends.

Second strike happened in the middle of High School (Canadian, so around Grade 9/10, can't recall 100%). I was going through a depressed, anime-binging stage in my life. We were playing Dirty Bomb and were in a Skype call together. A bit of context, at this point in my life I had pretty much one thing I was proud of, and it was my piano skills. I was aware they weren't great, but they were all I had. I was surrounded by people who were amazing, but that didn't bother me. What did bother me, however, was when my ex-friend here kept boasting about his friend who had just recently picked up the piano as an instrument and could already play Bonetrousle. If he said that alone, I wouldn't care. When he kept comparing it to the fact that I had been playing for 7 years and still couldn't play it, and that his friend only played for a few months and could already perfectly play it, saying things like ""Isn't that crazy!"" and really rubbing in the fact that I had been playing for 7 years and still couldn't, I stepped back a bit, said ""Dude, can you fucking stop?"" and stopped talking to him for a while. Yet again, we reconnected because of my friends being his friend.

Third strike was recent. Context here is that my good friend is a DM, I had picked up writing as a rather passionate hobby in Grade 11-12, and that I had been waiting a year to play Persona 5 Royal, which I'd inevitably binge in a week or two (Something I had repeatedly mentioned to my friends, him included)

Before quarantine started, I was at his house with my good friend and his piano playing friend (he's real chill). Good friend was asleep, piano friend was cooking for himself. I was talking to him while we sat in the living room, having a ""deep"" (read: incredibly surface level) talk. In this talk, he mentioned that he was actually just waiting for me to stop being stubborn about what happened in the First Strike and reconnect with him, and reaffirmed that my brother was, indeed, a little shit. Basically, he didn't ever think what he was doing was wrong. I just nodded. Knew quarantines would start soon, and I didn't want to start shit.

Quarantine started. D&amp;D sessions were moved online. After pulling an all-nighter while writing, ex-friend decided to start a session, dragging DM, myself and piano friend in. I was incredibly exhausted, didn't matter to them though. He kept berating me throughout the session for not understanding what was going on. I was really done, can't remember what happened but the conversation derailed and I began talking about how I wanted to change the world. He piped in and said ""Change the world? [My name], you can barely do anything but write, and even then not that great"". I was so baffled I believe I stammered out a few words before going silent again. Session was fully derailed so he called it a night and I immediately logged off.

Persona 5 Royal had released, so I began playing it. Notified my friends, including him, that I'd be AWOL for the next week or two. Everyone but him seemed to understand. He hosted another session just a couple days later. I said I'm playing the game. He tried to guilt trip me, bringing his mom into it, even had his piano friend make a meme about my ""social link weakening"" because of it. Really, I wanted to cut ties with him, but there wasn't a cue. A week later, he asked again, and I declined again, to which he really went all out with the guilt-tripping, saying things like ""this will really damage our friendship"" and ""you're ditching US for a game"". I told him everything, etc. Long story short, ties were cut. He tried to act innocent, I basically ignored his excuses and said I'd had enough. Said that if I want to get further in life, I can't have a friendship like this, as I spent every day dreading the chance that I'd have to talk to him.

Now, it's been two months, and he's twice tried to get my good friend to convince me to be his friend again. Now, I'm being told by my other good friend that I should ""get over it"" with him so my good friend can invite both of us to his house. I don't know what to do. I really don't want another fucking situation where this all smooths over and I'm peer pressured back into a friendship with this guy. I really do not like him. I already have one deceptive and sly person in my life which I can't get rid of, and I don't need the one I somehow managed to cut ties with back. What the hell do I do here? What is there to do? I don't like this high-school drama tier bullshit. I have literally no one else in my life outside of my good friends, though, but even then, it's just... I really don't know.

**TL;DR - I cut ties with an Ex-friend three times in a row, each time I was forced back thanks to the fact that he's a friend of my good friends. Nevermind how he was when I normally spoke to him, each of those times I cut ties with him he'd either attacked my brother, or put down my ability to do anything I perceived myself as being good at. Now I'm being told by my good friend that I should reconnect with him so he can invite us both to his house (good friends house, not ex-friends) and I don't know what to do.**",05Jun2020,1
208,"I'm writing here because I don't know what to do. English is not my first language, so I'll try to clarify if something is not clear.

In 2013, my mom got breast cancer. It was a very traumatic experience for her, but through chemo and radiotherapy, she survived. In 2017, she got her cancer back, this time pleural. The thing is, she got so scared of the first treatment (it was very rough on her). My mother has always dabbled in alternative medicine. It has always been reasonable things (honey for sore throat, mint for nausea. That sort of thing) and she has never used those treatments as a replacement for actual medicine.

Her second cancer started and she was given an estimate of six months (without treatment). She decided not to go to a hospital and live her last months without chemo. She only went to the hospital every few weeks to have her lung emptied as it constantly filled with liquid. 

Now, here's where things got better and worse. One day, her lung stopped giving her trouble. Through more exams, we discovered that her pleural cancer had gone to her bones as well. Last time we checked, she had cancer in a few vertebrae, some ribs, and a part of her hip. She had to get a bone transplant because that bone that connects with the hip broke. She still didn't want any chemo. She had only used alternative medicine until then (shamans, some weird pill called transfer factor) and figured that her lung getting better was because of that.

 It's really bad now. The pandemic started and she became ill with something. Vomiting, high fever. We couldn't bring her to the hospital because we live in Ecuador and Corona hit us really bad. And she's especially vulnerable. She consulted her sister that lives in another city (who's a doctor) and she told us it sounded like an amoeba infection and recommended some pills for that. She fever actually went away and she got better after that, although I'm not sure if it was a coincidence (more than a week had already passed at that point. It wasn't corona either, we did check for that later). Since then, her back, hips, and ribs (all places where the cancer is) have been hurting a lot and although she did get better for a while, now she's vomiting every day, at least two times a day. She swears it's still parasites, but there's no way for us to know. She doesn't want to get to the hospital until the 15th. 

So she began doing enemas. They are enemas of plain boiled water (obviously not boiling at the moment), diluted with something called sodium chloride. She has done them for three days. I told her that it's a terrible idea but she's not listening to me. I got especially worried when she told me it's something they use to treat children with autism, too, because I know it's BS. Some time ago, there had been a case of a child who had defecated his intestinal lining because his mother had been giving him bleach enemas to ""cure his autism"". My mom told me that ""the parasites were going out"" and I saw the bowl today and I'm pretty sure it's the exact same ""worms"" the kid had. Her appetite has gone to hell these last few days and I dare to say her vomit is getting worse. I think my mom is slowly killing herself and I can't do anything to stop it. My brothers aren't in the city and can't see this happening, my step-dad is a conspiracy nut who thinks that the doctor actually have the cure of cancer, but are holding out because they only care about money. When I told him about what I actually thought was happening, he called me paranoid, ignorant, and that I'm ""just like those researchers"".

216,"So me and my boyfriend started going out in October, and for a few years hes been behind on credits. so much so that his chances of graduation this year June were 0 to none.

Then he started skipping night school, wouldn't come to school on time and would miss gym (a class he was severely behind with credits). I would try telling him to not skip night school and other classes and to come early but he would get snappy or annoyed with me.

He feels as if he is a lost cause and as if im wasting my time on him. There were moments in the past where he wanted to drop out and get a GED but he knows his mother would not approve of that and wants to see him graduate.

219,"This is an absolutely awful thing I’m going 
Through. Sorry it’s long.


2 years ago our social circle had a small house party. 6 adult women and three kids ages about 12M and 14, 13 F, sisters.

The kids were set up in the other wing of the house- two bedrooms, both have TVs, there’s a bathroom. No reason to come to the other wing. 10pm bed time and 11pm lights out, call the phone if there are any issues. 

The 12M’s mom said she would share the bigger room with her son as it had two beds and she did not like any of the sleeping arrangements in the other area of the house. 

After the kids go to bed, some people are drinking and some people are not. It is not a wild party, it’s a weeknight, we are just relaxing. As the night goes on a few of us are topless or naked in the hot tub as not everyone brought a suit. 12M’s Mom heads to bed early, a little after 1 am, She says she will check on the kids as well before bed and make sure everything is good. 

At 2 AM, i have to go pee and agree to grab more towels. I was a little  drunk, not hammered.
I was naked.

I go in the side door, covering my breasts up bc it’s chilly. Before taking one more step I see the 12M turn and look at me from the next room!! 

I screamed and jumped back out the door, upset. Some people could see what happened but everyone outside could hear me when it happened.

One of the sober women went inside and told him it was 2am and he was in the wrong area. He went to bed. He said his mother had given him permission (she had!). She checked on the girls, who were asleep.
Night went on, no more issues. 

In the morning both the hostess and I apologized to the boys mother, who admitted she gave him permission to be there.
We also made her aware that those were the reasons we made the rules that she had agreed to, and that she was aware of the alcohol/nudity before we went to bed. 

She says she understands, he mentioned it and was uncomfortable about it, but she also that they lived in a small apartment and it happens. Next time she will head home at the end of the night.

It didn’t feel like a huge deal, everyone was good, I even took her son to the movies with my daughter and I following that. 

Fast forward 4 months, the boys mom has a falling out in our social circle due to unrelated work issues. She cut everyone out of her life without warning admins hasn’t talked to anyone since.

Now, two years later, the woman proceeds to go on social media comment section of her own BLM post) and accuse me of being inappropriate with her child. This was sparked by one of the women seeing her on the street and saying “hi”.

She has made up a bizarre story about me parading around the rooms naked, despite her sons protests.
In reality there was a large Kitchen island, a short hallway, and a support beam between us for one second I was inside. I’m not even sure how much he could see! 
One of the women came to my defense and called her out, but she made the story MORE elaborate. I chose not to acknowledge it and asked no one else to respond either. 

There are 4 other people who saw the true version of events, but this is a very serious accusation. 

The other issue is the boys mother has a history of doing things like this to a much smaller degree.
To keep it vague for privacy, she gets paranoid and will force her son to take part, and her accusations have been found to be untrue. She has been banned from food assistance due to falsifying her income.

Unfortunately their family dynamic is sad, abusive and strange. CPS HAS been called on her numerous times with no results.

Also she awkwardly pulls the “race card” (shes half Greek half Puerto Rican) or “gender card” on anyone, anytime, over anything. She accuses people of putting curses and dark energy on her.

TL;Dr- Mother gave her son permission to be somewhere he shouldn’t have been, he accidentally saw me naked. 2 years later she’s made up an elaborate untrue story about the event and has posted it on social media. She calls anyone who actually witnessed the event “racist”. 

The whole point of this long post is what do I do? Can I get in trouble for this? Should I be doing something proactively? I don’t know if she will take this further or what. I am a very quiet private person. I have a good reputation and know most of the people in our town, but this is so scary.",05Jun2020,1

222,"This is going to be super light and forewarning, I’m a new house owner with little knowledge of how neighbor relationships go.

We moved into our first house a few months ago and during the quarantine, our next door neighbors invited us over for a “social distance” backyard fire for a few times. We were happy to meet new neighbors, but sadly during multiple backyard fires they kept bringing up their religious and political beliefs which happen to be very different than ours. Normally, that would not be a problem- but they were callous with their approach and wouldn’t pick up simple social cues that we didn’t want to talk about it (basically they’re right wing Catholics that think Covjd is a conspiracy) and we’re left wing liberal nuts that find their theory... absolutely ridiculous). My husband politely argued, didn’t push anything and changed the subject.

Here’s my question: they’ve invited us over for a few backyard fires now. We’ve talked about returning the favor and inviting them over for a fire in our backyard. Even though it is very apparent we are different groups of people (they’re also maybe 15-20 years older than us on top of our opposing personal beliefs), should we still bite the bullet and return the neighborly offer? I’m torn because A) I’m new to having neighbors and want to maintain a peaceful  environment with the people that live next to me but B) I also don’t give a shit about wasting time on people I know I will never have a harmonious relationship with personally if they are so against what we take fundamentally believe in.",05Jun2020,1

229,"Backstory I am 20 years old, has always been a reserved introvert and this is my first relationship ever.

So, you can get the idea the kind of person I am, I never opened up to any guy before and gave chance, mainly because of my fixed standards on a partner and trust issues. However, I met a guy on Bumble app 3 months ago and for some reason, we hit off and he asked me to be his girlfriend 3 weeks after talking. I said yes because fuck, I'm 20 and I just want to take the risk.

However, 2 days after we talk he had to go back to his country AND THEN this stupid Covid-19 happened and he cant go back here ( where he studies) truly devastating.

He got busy and made no absolute time for me, he would say he would call me but always forgets and cancels the night after. When I addressed this issue, he said he is sorry and he has family problems, he  is emotionally devastated and doesn't want to purge it on me. I told him, if he wants to go M.I.A at least tell me so I don't wonder off about his about.

So, quarreling sets in and sometimes I say things I don't mean when I'm frustrated. I decided to separate and of course he was reluctant, but he respects the decision anyway. Because of third party (my mom and my sister) I blocked him everywhere, and for fucks sake I regret the fuck out of this.

I tried reaching back to him but he is offline on all of his socials.

Yes, this is indeed a mess, because me and him got on at such a weak foundation and so do when we separate. I'm genuinely a very motivated and ambitious person, but because of this I just am unable to do my task. It's been 2 weeks since we break up and all I do is just cry. I just have never opened up and love a guy as much as I do to him. I wish we would got on together again but it seems like that would never happen.

So how do i get over a not meant to be relationship? I'm so stuck on him. like my heart isn't over him and I am so mad at myself for doing this to him when all i have to do is to be patient and stay. I genuinely do love him, but milk is already spilled and there is no turning back.

how do i genuinely move on? and get back to be motivated? knowing that my first love story is stupid and has failed? genuinely just disgusted at myself and mad. I don't know how to get myself to physically do my shit anymore. I really don't.",05Jun2020,1

231,I’ve never had what I would call a close relationship with my dad but he’s always been around. Now that I’m in uni and visiting home less he’s starting to miss me more. We have a few projects we want to work on together but they cost quite a bit $ wise (restoring a car and building a pc) so I can only do small amounts at a time on those. What are some ways we can spend time together? We don’t have too many things in common but I do want to bond. We both game but he’s strictly pc whereas I play console and very different genres. Eating out isn’t really something he’d consider as he’s very self conscious about his teeth and has anxiety in crowds. I’m struggling coming up with ideas as his interests are often the sort to give an adrenaline rush (or for me just lots of anxiety) whereas I’m a “comforts of home” type of person.,05Jun2020,1
232,"The title might be very confusing, to anyone just seeing this it doesn’t make sense, but let me explain. 

In one of my past relationships I was abused so badly that I almost took my life a few times. I knew that if I made her happy, she could let me be happy. After our separation I’m unable to accept being mean to people. I say yes to everyone and follow whatever anyone else wants to do. My biggest fear is that I would become my abuser, so I’m unable to have a say for myself, stand up for what I believe in, and follow my own path in life, and it really has an affect on me.

For example I recently got into another relationship, this time with a boy, and I hurt him. I regret it, I was wrong, but I did. What happened was we began talking less, the relationship was starting to fade, and the lack of communication reminded me of the isolation my abusive ex put me through, and I couldn’t handle it. Another factor was I was unable to say no to him. For example I sent inappropriate pictures when he asked, even if I wasn’t comfortable taking them. And the biggest problem was I totally played with his feelings. Every day he would try checking up on me and I would tell him I was happy and I was feeling good about our relationship. He believed it, but the only reason why I did this was because I didn’t want to hurt him, but I made things worse when I couldn’t handle the pain anymore and let it my emotions free. 

He confronted me, “you played with my feelings, imagine being that low of a person.” He continued contacting me, he posted mean comments trying to expose me on my social media, he was in pain and I caused it. I tried to apologize. I snapped him and wrote terrible things about myself, because I knew it would make him feel better. We were only dating for two weeks, I wasn’t expecting to kill his self esteem.

Now it’s become a daily thing. Him sending a picture of him crying, me bashing myself telling him I’m sorry and that I’m here for him. We agreed to be friends, but he refuses to talk to me, only replying with “okay.” I’ve been crying so much, I don’t get sleep, I barely eat, because I feel so much guilt. I’m a terrible person, I get it, anyone who plays with someone’s feelings is, but I can’t handle all of this sadness. 

I decided to ask my friend for advice, and she said, “well we all hurt people in our lives, and we will all be hurt by people in our lives. We have to accept it the way it is.” And it actually made a lot of sense. I just don’t know if I can accept hurting someone without totally going down a terrible rabbit hole of guilt. So if anyone can help me be meaner and stronger, it would really help. And also on top of that, what do I do with my ex boyfriend sending me pictures of him crying, how can I prove I’m sorry.

233,"I dated my ex for three years, from age 14-17. She randomly broke up with me out of nowhere. She claimed she wanted to experience the rest of her teenage years single. But, got a new boyfriend in nearly two weeks. 

To make a long story short, she randomly texted me she missed me and we started talking as friends, a year after the break up. Then, she randomly started talking about wanting to have kids with me and getting married to me. I tried ignoring it, but she kept bringing it up. I finally told her we’ll never have kids and get married. We got into a argument so I just blocked her. 

The next day she text me from another phone, I blocked that number. She got a texting app and texted me, I blocked that number. At this point I blocked her on every social media account too. She got another texting app, and I blocked that number. She made a new Snapchat and tried messaging me on there and I blocked it.

Now that she ran out of texting apps to use. She literally changes her phone number at least twice a month and just so she can text or call me.  I swear this has been going on for over a year straight. She said she’ll stop and did for maybe 4 months, but started doing it again. What should I do, I really don’t want to change my number?

236,"Posting this anonymously as I’m scared of him finding this. 

I (18F) was in a year long relationship with my parter (18M) and I loved him very much. One day he was staying at my place where I live with my mother and he had begun to get horny, while we were laying in bed together. I let him know this I was not in the mood and did not want to have sex but he proceeded to have sex with me anyways. I told him no repeatedly and pleaded with him to stop. But he didn’t. I was trying to be quiet while I begged him to stop as I didn’t want to alert my mum with the situation that was happening. He then told me he wanted to do anal and I told him no and begged him not to but he didn’t care and pushed it in anyways and it was very painful but it got him to finally stop. He then proceeded to lay down, I could tell he was annoyed with me which led me to feel bad for him and I apologised to him for what he did. 

The next day after he left, I spoke to a friend and asked him “was this rape?”. He agreed that it was and that’s when I realised what he had done to me. However I still decided to date him which is my own fault I should have ended it but I didn’t. After that situation happened I had no sexual motivation no more, I just couldn’t get aroused. He would just wake me up from my sleep just to have sex with me and he would never ask for my consent I would just lay there facing away from him trying not to cry while he did what he wanted. This continued for two months. 

I finally decided to tell him what he had been doing to me over the past two months. I feel so bad as it’s my fault I never told him what he was doing sooner. He began to feel bad for what he did to me, he would apologise, he admitted to being a rapist and even told me he wanted to kill himself for what he did. I felt so bad that I had put him through all that but due to what he did to me anytime I try anal I get panic attacks and it’s horrible and embarrassing. 

It has been around 3 months since I broke up with him and I feel great. I am finally happy. Now here’s my problem. I use humour to cope with things that happen with me but it’s only now really got to me that he could do this to another person just thinking about it made me sick to my stomach. I’ve seen so many cases where the rapist has gotten away with their actions and leaving the man/woman with no justice. I realised I don’t want him to go unpunished but I don’t want my family to know what he had done to me and I also don’t want his family to know what he has done. I’m scared of not being believed, l’m scared he’ll get away with it, scared of what people will thing/say and I’m scared of what he could do to me. I know it’s selfish of me not to report him but I really don’t know what I can do. If there was a way my family wouldn’t know about the situation I would be more than happy to confess to the police.

242,"Hi : ),

I started a job  4 months ago.  I am super grateful to be working right now and feel upset for complaining but the situation w/ my supervisor has become a bit trying and I would love some feedback/ advice on how to handle it professionally. 

I am the only one my suoervisor oversees.  And he reports to the two heads of the department.  When I first started, I was brought on to do the equivalent of his job.  But about a month into it, I noticed he kept maneuvering things in his favor.  When there were opportunities to do tasks that required communication with other departments and enabled opportunities for growth, he would do them all.  And he would then only train me for the work that was basic admin.  So my initial responsibilities kept getting smaller and smaller over time.  I am older than him and have more experience and I think he felt that taking this approach would work in his favor.  I've had over 10 yrs experience in my job and I was being treated like someone who was a novice and was only able to do data entry.

About a month into the stay at home orders, I had a conversation with him.  I told him that I was brought on for certain responsibilities and those tasks seem to be less and less.  And I'd appreciate if I could take more ownership of my original take 

And while that helped a little, I still feel like he's taking an agressive strategy w/ me to ensure my opportunities for any growth or to do work commiserate with my experience stays low.

And since then I've noticed things I say to him during our one on one meetings, he relays almost word for word to his supervisors as if it's his idea.

Is there a way to handle this professionally without avoiding him until I find a new job?

I am excited to one day have a job w/ a boss who wants to encourage growth and not try to repress my advancement.

Thanks for your tips 🙂.",05Jun2020,1
244,My first job ever was last summer working as an assistant for a notary public. I lasted 2 months and quit and just decided to continue school. I then tried out a job as a credit clerk but did not want to work with money. I then tried data entry clerk but it was for a comapny that worked directly with mexico and their spanish was a little different than mine. And my supervisor was training me on eveything for the company rather than what i applied for. So i quit as well. I then went for teleperformance but got sick and was not able to attend to training. They gave me a second chance and allowed me to go to training but the 2nd day i got really sick and did not go. I got a job at the zoo and started my first day. I was aware of what i had to do but it was a little tiring for me. When i got home i had trouble breathing and ive been feeling like this since last year. I grew up premature and the doctor said that it could be possible for me to develop asthma but idk if its that. When i went to an interview to the zoo the rain caught me and i believe that affected me but i couldn't do anything about it.

-It is sung by a female artist. She is a newer artist, someone like alessia cara or hailee steinfeld, that type of singer (I’ve looked through their songs, it’s not them, but that type of newer, younger, female artist, not Ariana grande or Taylor Swift). 
-It is an upbeat song 
-It is about friendship, hanging out with your girls, girlfriends, that type of song. Might sing about the 90s or back in the day

249,"So I’ve known this person for a good 3 or so years now. We met sophomore 
year of high school and although we weren’t instant friends at first, we slowly became close throughout the years. Hanging out everyday after school, going everywhere together, I would spend a week at their house or vise versa so much that our parents joked we practically lived together and were attached by the hip. I really enjoyed our friendship during these times. 

Now here’s the problem. For some reason, maybe starting a lil more than 6 months ago, I’ve noticed that I don’t enjoy this persons company nearly as much anymore. It feels like a drag when we hang out, like it’s becoming another chore on the list of things to do. When we do hang out I find myself becoming annoyed at quirks I once thought made them endearing. I also feel like I’m starting to notice parts of their personality that I find kind of unbearable. I don’t know if I was blind to these things at first, or the closer we became the more their true self started to show. But this person can kinda be self centered at times, and a bit of a know it all. 

I guess I’ve let the friendship linger so long because I know they don’t have many other friends that are as close, and deal heavily with mental issues. I would feel bad just abandoning them because I know they would take it as a big hit mentally. As close as we are I don’t feel that it’s right to just ghost them either. Especially because this person makes it obvious that I’m important to them, and still values our friendship very much. 

I don’t know, I feel like a terrible person for even thinking like this. There’s nothing awful they have done to me. Yeah we’ve had disagreements and small arguments in the past but what friendship doesn’t have those? I don’t hate them either, in-fact I still care for them very much despite any flaws and wish them the best in life. I just simply don’t enjoy the time we share together as much as I use to. It’s hard to let the friendship go through it’s natural cycle when the person on the other end still wants to hang out regularly and messages all the time. 

I don’t know what to do. Should I be honest about how I’m feeling and lay it on them easy? Or is this just a phase some friendships go through and I’ll get over it within time? Any advice would be helpful at this point.",05Jun2020,1

To describe it better, I feel like I'm on top of a fence, on the other side is feeling miserable and the other is just feeling good with myself.

260,"Context: I (29/m) live in Bed-Stuy in Brooklyn, NY with 3 roommates who are POC. We've all gotten pretty close during the pandemic quarantine these last few months so I've come to enjoy them despite being a little concerned that there are too many people - it's a 3 bedroom, a couple lives in one, one bathroom.

Cut to the killing of George Floyd and the ensuing protests and riots in some cities. Roommate, we'll call him Anthony (29/m), is from West Philadelphia and has been reading stories of people breaking into each other's homes, robbing each other, and some even shooting each other. Sucks. Especially since they are all black. Over the past week his concerns and anxiety has only gotten worse. He begins to talk about going home and getting a gun since he is licensed there and bringing it back here to the apartment. He brings it up to me with the belief that a ""civil war"" is going to break out. I'm immediately bothered and tell him I'm not comfortable with it and I don't see it coming to that. I thought that squashed it BUT this morning I wake up and him and his gf are packing to go somewhere and yes they are going to Philly and getting a gun anyway.

I'm furious but don't really say anything cause I'm getting ready to go to a huge protest and already feeling some type of way. I truly feel like he does not give a shit about my opinion. Not to mention that he drinks entirely too much and has an anger problem. Him and his gf have been arguing so damn much. Oh yeah, gun laws here in NYC are crazy strict. Not only am I concerned for my own safety but also for him as a black man. Lastly, he might think I'm stupid but honestly if somebody were to break in and rob us I'd rather them take all my shit then to have another person killed.

Do I have grounds to break from my lease? Am I in the wrong here?",05Jun2020,1
261,"Title basically says it all, she doesnt know im posting this. Its really sad watching my sister who is an amazing listener and great friend deal with this very burden-like situation.

I can understand being there for a friend, but this has resulted in suicide plans, literally 100s of back-to-back calls, a very manipulative on-off boyfriend who enables and instigates the manic episodes, a day in the psych ward, an entire summer of calling every hour to make sure shes not hurting herself, etc...

My sister feels responsible as a friend to be there and try to help, but the practical advice she gives is never listened to, and the care and active listening is NEVER reciprocated. My sister has her own issues with mental health and relationships to deal with, but doesnt even get to try because of this person that seems to continually make things about her, whether on purpose or not. 

Her abusive manipulative boyfriend also doesnt help, hes the kind of person that said verbatim “i love when you call me a hundred times” and ignores the calls because he loves how crazy it drives her. They breakup/makeup VERY OFTEN and the manic episodes usually stem from one or the other. 

Shes unfortunately somebody with possible multiple personality disorder. She apparently sees therapists, but relies on her friends (including my sister) to really deal with the crazy moments. Yes shes had some bad things go down outside of the boyfriend, but apparently it all started after her entered her life. 

To me, i tried comparing this to being in an abusive relationship, where then the abusive partner eventually gets cancer, leaving the abused partner stuck by their side morally, or to avoid social “punishment”. Therefore stuck in the relationship out of underserved guilt.

Ive acknowledged to her that this doesnt need to be her responsibility and she should distance herself from this person. But again she feels hopelessly responsible for making sure nothing bad happens.

TLDR; my sisters friend is mentally unstable, suicidal and becoming a much more serious burden on my sister, and i want to help her cutoff from this person without feeling guilty.

Please reddit tell me how i can help her with this situation",05Jun2020,1

But I can’t correct it every time because it won’t stop and it keeps repeating and repeating and it’s making me crazy. I love my mother so it’s really bothering me. And it’s ironic because I used to swear I really had complete control over my mind. What is happening to me and how do I stop this shit?,05Jun2020,1
264,"So there’s a family friend we barely see. Let’s call him J. The whole family met J through my (non-blood related) uncle when I was 15. J was a man in his 60s at the time. I haven’t seen him since I was 20, but he still hangs out with my uncle a ton and my cousins who are a 10 year old female and 14 year old male. 

Anyway when I was 15, J wanted to be alone with me. I thought it was weird but didn’t know what to really do at 15??? And I trusted him. So we’re alone and he tells me he thinks I’m so gorgeous and he wants a bunch of photos of me. Mind you, this is at a family gathering and his wife is in the same house but we’re alone. So he does a photoshoot of me. And that was that.

At the next family gathering (I’m still 15), he gets me alone again and whispers in my ear how he showed all his construction coworkers my photos and they all think I’m “so gorgeous”. It’s just disgusting... I was 15 with acne, braces, and a baby face. Lol not that those are necessarily bad things, I’m just getting at the point that I looked very young. 

So it never came back into my mind after it happened until 2 weeks ago. Out of NOWHERE the entire memory hit me and as a 22 year old woman I thought “WHOA, totally inappropriate! Wtf, that is not okay! I don’t even find people under the age of 20 attractive, and here’s this man in his 60s into a 15 y old?”

I talked to my mom immediately. She has always been a good mother but now... I’m so shocked and hurt at what happened. I told her everything that happened and she phoned my aunt (who’s married to Js friend) and told her everything. To which my aunt was like “oh I remember that, J actually approached me and said he had never seen a 15 year old so beautiful and asked me for permission to take photos of her” and my mom was basically like “oh ok!” And left it at that! 

So I became mad at my mother and my aunt. I was like why are you not here for me? Why do you still want to be friends w this guy?? What was his intent w those photos? Why is he looking at a 15 year old like that??? And my mom started screaming at me. It brought me to tears. She was like “what more do you want from me? I asked your aunt and that’s it.” I said “understand that it is wrong and get that guy away!” My grandma also joined in and screamed at me. She told me to stop being a “bill Cosby victim” bc I came out so late about it and that I need to get over it.  Then my boyfriend walked in on my grandma and mom yelling at me while I’m in tears from them blowing up at me (he knew about the situation) and he was like “stop yelling at her and listen to her! Be supportive!” To which my mom yelled at him and told him to never use that tone on her. Then my mom and grandma stormed off.

My mom dialed my aunt again bc she yelled, “WTF DO YOU WANT? For me to call again and have your aunt ask J about it again?!” To which I said “yes that would be nice.” My aunt contacts J and he said yes he remembers taking the pics and there was no bad intent, that’s it. And now my aunts screaming on the speaker phone saying she hates how uncomfortable I’m making her feel bc she’s making J think she thinks he’s a weirdo. Then my mom screamed on the phone, “MY DAUGHTER MAKES ME FEEL LIKE THE WORST PERSON EVER.” 

I left back home with my boyfriend after that. This was a few days ago. My family has not contacted me since, and usually my mom will text me. 

So I reached out to my cousin (27F) hoping she’d understand and didn’t believe me at all and told me how she has a wedding to deal with. I was so upset. I was like “I poured out everything to you, I am hurt by everything with the family right now and that’s your response??” She called me a bitch a that I need to calm tf down. And that she’s down with me....

This whole time apparently she was on the phone with my mom as we were texting. And my mom was telling my cousin to not believe me and that I’m driving my mom crazy and to ignore me bc I keep running my mouth to my friends for help...

I’m just in total shock, I feel guilty, hurt and betrayed. What do I do?? How to I heal my feelings?? I tried to tell them how wrong his actions were but they don’t understand. 

TL;DR: i told my mom about a creepy uncomfortable situation that happened to me between a family friend and I, and she’s mad at me.  I feel heartbroken and I don’t know how to heal bc I did all I could to get her and my family to understand but they don’t wan to.",05Jun2020,1
265,"So I (13f) have this one friend (12f) at school who I’ve been friends with for like 3 years, but the relationship is definitely toxic. I noticed this ages ago but didn’t know what to do, now I just wanna end it. We’ve had several dramas and back stabbed each other a lot, but it always ends in “becoming best friends again” but we both know it’s not true.

So basically, my favourite thing in the whole world and what I value more than anything are my birds, they are my family and I love them so much. My friend also “loves birds”, she has a couple too, but I noticed ages ago that she had sort of been competing with me, and whenever I got good attention or someone mentioned how I loved birds, she would get really mad and maybe even cry, and she would rant on and on about it to me all the time. I had to deal with this for years.

Anyway, that’s not my main problem right now, the main problem is that a little while ago, I realised she’s not caring for her birds properly (she apparently has the same amount of obsession with birds as me, trust me, that means she apparently loves them A LOT). Around a year ago, she got into to ro cheer (roblox cheerleading), it was a little hobby of hers and that was cool. She still loved birds of course, but recently I’ve noticed it’s taken over her life... Its ALL she ever talk about now, trust me, it’s worse than you think. She literally stays up till 5:00Am on SCHOOL nights just to do practices or whatever, she basically doesn’t do anything else, even school work! Any chance she gets on a school or home computer she’ll be on roblox or discord with her ro cheer friends, even if it’s like 2 minutes on the computer. This will severely effect her education and sleep in the future. But that’s another problem that I can’t fix, whatever anyone tells her, she will NOT listen. 

The thing is, birds are a very complex and difficult animal species to care for, they require as much attention as possible, especially when you have school for majority of the day. And obviously with this ro cheer obsession taking up all her spare time (she even says she doesn’t have ENOUGH time! Like wth), her birds are being kind of neglected, she cares about them I guess, like she feeds them and stuff, but the attention they should be getting is all going to her device. That’s not all, she’s been feeding them toast with butter or something, that’s fatty and unhealthy for birds! She should know that considering the fact that she calls herself a “bird expert”, she also uses dowel perches, little amount of toys, never takes them to the vet or gets their nails trimmed, etc. the list goes on. 

I mainly noticed the major thing when her cockatiel Smokey got attacked by her cat and eventually died from the saliva in his bloodstream, firstly, she shouldn’t have cats with birds anyway, secondly, he died two days later, and apparently he lost a ton of feathers, why not take your bird to the VET?!!

This is the 5th bird that has died under her care, 5 birds within less than 2 years! And it really annoyed me because Smokey was such a sweetheart, I met him and so did my Stormy and Pippin. Knowing her, she casually texted me saying he got killed.. my jaw literally dropped! I was like “excuse me?” But after she told me, she kept going on about Roblox! And she also immediately got a new bird.. This is disrespectful to Smokey. She basically forgot about him and replaced him, it’s like she doesn’t care about him and only cares about if she has a bird. 

The day she got the new bird, she literally mentioned it ONCE, wth? It was in the middle of the day too! The her I know would come rushing up to me as soon as I got to school and tell me all about the new bird. 

She’s changed, I feel like she’s lost interest in birds but doesn’t want to admit it. There are sooo many problems about her in the bird topic I could talk about, but I’ll leave it there.

Recently I started talking to my other school friend about it, and I asked her what I should do, because knowing her, if I straight up gave her bird advice she would make it a competition and be like “omg you just think you know more about birds than me and you’re just jealous”, she said I should leave it because there would be no point, my best friend out of school said the same thing. 

But today I found out that the other friend in school has been passing some of the information to the “bird loving” friend, I was told that the “bird loving friend” said I apparently copied her with getting cockatiels? I got them because they needed to be rehomed immediately! And I apparently got silkie chickens right after she told me her mum wanted chickens? She didn’t even know what a silkie was until I told her! And I’ve wanted chickens for agesssss. 

See what I mean by she makes everything competitive? I’ve decided to be mature and put an end to it. I just don’t know how, I really don’t want to put up with her bs and complaining for the rest of the year, the thing is, if I tell her, she’s gonna start a drama and the rest of the year is going to be awkward around her.. I really need some advice, should I tell her over text or in person? What should I say? Is there any way she would improve her birds lives even though she would never listen to me? Thank you so much for taking the time to read this, overall, she’s one of those people that are cool to hang around with, but not be besties with.

\-She also deliberately tries to make me jealous by planning sleepovers with our other friend RIGHT in front of me, she tries to not make it obvious though, (I’m not jealous of course, it’s just a bit ridiculous though).",05Jun2020,1
266,"My [34M] wife [34F] and I live in a pretty small one-bedroom apartment. Recently, her mother (who lives alone, about an hour away) had a fairly serious medical procedure, and had no one to stay with after, so we offered to have her come stay with us to recover, even though space is very limited here. We did this because we were under the impression that she would need assistance with nearly everything, and believed she may need to stay here for up to a month. We agreed that it would be best to give her our bedroom, and we would sleep on an air mattress in the living room. Well, post-surgery, mom is thankfully doing fantastic. She has no mobility problems, and other than some pain and fatigue seems to be doing very well. She requires almost no assistance with everyday tasks. All of that being said, she recently stated that she’ll probably stay here for a month because she was bored at home before she had surgery. She and I have always gotten along, and she’s a very nice person. However, we have very limited space here and are sleeping quite terribly. Additionally, my wife is away most of the day at work, so she’s really not spending a great deal of time with her mother anyway. I absolutely want to do the right thing here, and I would never let her go home without making sure she was ready for it.

270,"I’m 21 years old, I don’t know how to drive, and I’m *so* embarrassed. 
I have my learner’s permit, but I’ve maybe completed 2-3 hours of driving since I got it when I was 15. My parents got me a car and gave me every opportunity to learn to use it, but I just wouldn’t. Part of it was the anxiety, the other part of it was that I was really stressed in high school and wanted to just go home and relax at the end of the day. Eventually, they let my sister borrow my car one night and she totaled it (one of many cars she’s totaled by the way, still mad about that one). They just never bought me another one because I never really asked, I wouldn’t learn anyway, and I suspect they probably couldn’t afford it by that point. I just continued relying on my parents and friends for rides, which was pretty awkward but I guess not awkward enough to push me to learn to drive.

Last week my father-in-law died, and I couldn’t drive my husband to the hospital for him to say goodbye (we did end up getting there but it took longer because of me). I feel horrible about this and want to start learning as soon as possible. Today I drove my husband’s car maybe 200 feet and it ended in tears. 

I guess I’m just terrified to be in control of a vehicle that’s capable of killing a person. By now I think the anxiety also stems from embarrassment about being this old and still not knowing how; my extended family constantly cracks jokes about it.

I (19F) really love my parents and generally we have a good relationship, but ever since I went to college they started tracking my location via phone.

It really frustrates me because I feel like they treat me like I'm 12 sometimes.

This exact same thing happened with my other cat (Martina) back in 2018. They both spend a lot of time outside, so should we stop let them outside?

289,"When I was young my dad had passed away. Therefore, leaving me and my mom alone in the house. This happen while I was young, age 6 or 7. This cost her to bottle her emotions and try to blame it on someone around her. The lucky person was me who got the abuse from her. 

Since I wasn't the brightest kid growing up and no one can find what was wrong with me. She was stuck with a kid who she probably thought had no future. Every night I had homework as all kids have when they go to school. She would try to help me but it always resulted in me getting beaten for not knowing how to read or write. This resulted in me trying to spend as many nights as I could with my grandma because I was scare of my mom. As this happen I would be scare of asking anyone for help.

How she just didn't know how to control herself and the she was lost in life. Well I told her I forgive her but I never really did. I felt like I was force to give her the answer because my sister was there and I didn't want make a scene in a car.

290,"Hello, everyone. This is my first post, forgive me if the formatting is incorrect. I am not comfortable posting too much personal information because I am not sure if my partner reads through this subreddit. Also, this is more of a vent, now that I am looking back at what I wrote. My apologies for the lengthiness. 
A couple of months ago, I found Tinder on my partner’s cellphone. They swore up and down that they did not cheat and that they downloaded the app to get revenge for something I did early in the relationship (at this point, it was nearly 6 years in the past). I stayed because I felt obligated to stay since they stayed with me when I made mistakes when I was younger. I felt I deserved to go through that pain because I caused my partner pain throughout the years. Without getting into too much detail, I feel as if I am suffering from PTSD or panic attacks when I remember that day, although I am in no position to diagnose myself as I am not a medical professional. 
Ever since that day, I truly feel that I have developed some sort of PTSD because I feel that my whole world shuts down when I remember that day. I am not able to talk to a therapist right now since I live with my parents, and I would prefer for them to not know I talked to a therapist. I feel that I can’t talk to anyone in my personal life over this issue because I am certain I will only be met with judgement. I know I might get told I am dumb for staying in a relationship after that happened, but I would really like some advice on how to handle my emotions. I am sure there are some people who stayed with their partners/spouses after infidelity, what tips would you have to offer about staying after infidelity or a similar situation?

295,"(Just something I'd like to say before you read all of this, it's a long one, and I talk about a fair amount of dirty stuff in it. Just a heads up)

I'm a male, 19. My friend, whom I've know since 3rd grade is also 19, female. I dont know if I'm just being stupid or what, but I cant figure this out for the life of me and I thought I'd go here to see if anyone could help me figure out.
So me and this close friend of mine, who i shall refer to as Amy, have been friends since we were kids. Weve been each others only feiends since we met, weve had other friends, but not any that weve kept being friends with for too long. Around 4-5 years ago we started talking more openly about everything and we talked about more sexual things. We've both been more open about how dirty we actually are around the other, and it keep going in the direction till they were in a relationship and we talked alot less about those kinda of things untill a few months ago when she broke up with them. (Up to this point we both had agreed we would never see eachother in a romantic way.) Shortly after that, we moved into an apartment together and shared a room for most of that time till the past month or so. Within the first month of living in the new house me and Amy started talking about dirty things again. Amy said she would like to get a few dirty things (such as rope) so she could try out shibari, but she didnt have alot of extra money after rent and bills so I offered to get it for her as an early Christmas gift and she was ok with it, despite feeling a little awkward/embarassed about it. Fast forward to when it arrived and she was instantly wanting to do something with it, to this point she had said she was interested in someone else, and still says she is. But she was so excited that after a few days of it just sitting in the room she grabbed it and tried to do some shibari with it. I offered to help because we both agreed it ""wasn't sexual"" and it would be fine. (She was fully dressed while doing this) so I helped her by doing all the rope work and tyeing. We started by just doing a few simple leg ties while she was just sitting on the floor, and ovsr the next few times it went to leg and arm cuffs, a few full body harnesses, and even tyeing her to the bed a few times. But within the first day or 2 of doing this I started getting ideas of things i could do while she was tied up, appearently it started to become noticeable because she brought it up after we stopped for the night and went to bed. (We had seperate beds) I said I started to get the appeal of shibari and she said ""i can tell, I'm surprised you haven't done anything."" And ""I bet you would if I didnt mind"" I was surprised by that and the next time we did it after we puy all the ropes away I said i wouldn't without her ok. (For the obvious reason of that would be non-concented) she tried to avoid saying anything more but I asked what she was avoiding saying and she said ""there wouldn't be a lack of concent"" which suprised me more then i can express.
I didn't end up doing anything because she still was saying she had interest in this other person and she wanted them more, I said ok and we kept talking about more dirty things and doing a bit of shibari till the end of that first month then we stopped with the shibari. We continued talking about dirty things and it got to the point where we both expressed what we though I would do if given the opportunity back when we did the shibari and I had been tying her up. We both went into a fair amount of detail but Amy's had alot more detail and ended with me having her tied up on her bed and finishing in each hole.
We kept talking and its gone from anything as dirty as that to something as simple as just making dirty jokes, to realizing we both like everything the other does. However just recently while we were talking, Amy brought up masturbation and was talking to me while masturbating. Saying it didn't bother her when i was masturbating in the bedroom while she was 5 ft from me. I then said that if i had noticed her masturbating I would have likely gone over and done something about it, to which she just responded with ""oh, heheh"" I tried to get her to tell me what she meant by it and she refused.

I'm confused on whether they actually like me, or if they're just chatting with me. And ive tried to pry them for answers but if I start to ask they just change the conversation or refuse to answer. Am I just being stupid, or what. They still say that they've fallen in love with that person, but I'm not really sure to be honest.",05Jun2020,1

298,"I feel mentally exhausted.

Today, I (23F) had a really bad day. It’s a combination of the world’s state right now, stress from work, stress from my family, stress from how I view myself, stress about a possibility of having a disease. I was triggered by a comment my dad said to me about eating too much. I reacted by storming to my room and ignoring my mom (very mature I know). 

My mom then texted me and asked me what’s wrong and I told her. I told her how difficult it is with my dad’s rude comments, his absurd suspicions of me lying all the time. I told my mom how she is always breathing down my neck asking me if I’m on a diet, if my acne is clearing up. I told her about how work is also stressing me out. But instead of understanding me, she just said things like “oh your dad is the way he is I can’t change him. And try walking in my shoes and you’ll see how lovely you life is.” Among other things. 

I become so frustrated with her response that I spent a while crying silently so no one hears me and whispering that I wish I was never born. The way my mom reacted is so disheartening and I just need to get out of this house. Unfortunately, the virus is still forcing us to stay inside. And my work allows us to work from home now, so I have no reason to move out. 

I need help getting through to my mom. Why isn’t she understanding me? Will she ever? I don’t understand why she asks me what’s wrong and then proceeds to completely ignore everything I’m saying.

302,"I’ve always been shy since I was a kid and I always expected to grow out of it, but now I’m 18, about to go to an urban college, and I’m still scared of checking out at the grocery store by myself. 

This is always something I’ve just “lived with,” meaning, I always pushed through the nervousness and extreme planning that went into me leaving the house for any reason (even just for a walk. I have to plan the route before I go or else I’m constantly thinking about my next move and I can’t just enjoy the walk. And even then, I’m hyper aware of cars driving by and people also on the sidewalk). 

I’ve been hesitant to bring this up with my parents because their the kind of people who just think of me as shy. They don’t know how bad it is bc I haven’t said anything (a couple of months ago, I did bring it up with my mom. But that was during a time when my life was more stressful and usually bc of Covid, senior year canceled, etc. She probably just thought it was a phase). 

But here I am, months later after seriously considering if what I’m experiencing is legit (I’ve been thinking about this since Dec/Jan), and I just don’t know what to do. I’ve taken several tests online to give me a sense of where I’m at and they all say I have a high amount of social anxiety (I understand these tests are not a diagnosis, but where else can I go? I’m so lost on what I should do). 

I think the reason I haven’t brought this up before with my family is because I don’t want to seem whiny and I don’t want to “pretend to have a mental disorder.” I seriously think something is wrong tho. 

So how do I bring it up? What should I say? This is a genuine concern of mine and I just don’t know what to do about it.",05Jun2020,1
303,"So just for context, I'm adopted from China and my mom is a southern white woman who comes from a very conservative family. Despite this, she's always been very liberal. We talk about the rest of our conservative family and how skewed their views can be sometimes especially on social issues.

304,"I (20F) was diagnosed with depression \~3 years ago and have been managing it with medication/therapy pretty successfully since then (ups and downs but overall pretty good for someone who was previously suicidal). I was getting mental health care discretely through my college, and paid out of pocket for my meds so it wouldn't show up on my parents insurance. I've been treated for a while, so my psychiatrist was giving me 90-day supplies of my meds- so besides check ins (which I'm not great about doing) I didn't see her super often. Apparently in one of the 90-day windows, she took a leave of absence and did not leave contact info. With the virus going on, my college closed and I was sent home and didn't find out that my doctor wasn't there anymore until I was already home. They told me I can't get my meds again because since she left, I'm technically a ""new patient"" and they aren't taking in any more student patients during the pandemic. 

My brother (23M) is severely depressed, and has been in therapy since he was 8. He attempted suicide last year, and is home with me now. His suicide attempt hit me really hard. Since it happened I've been his main emotional support system. I love him but it's very difficult because he often talks to me about his suicidal ideations, which brings up everything I felt when I got the call that he tried to kill himself all over again. He's medicated, which they don't seem to have a problem with, but his depression takes a big toll on them - especially my mom. 

Since we were little, I never wanted them to worry about me so that they could focus on my brother. I was severely depressed in HS, but did everything I could to hide it (won't lie, did some self medicating to cope). Now that I'm home and don't have access to medication, I'm really struggling. The only way I could get meds is to tell them and schedule an appt. with a doctor under their insurance, or somehow find a few hundred dollars to pay out of pocket (which I don't have). I don't want them to think they are bad parents - they are wonderful and loving people. With one kid depressed (my brother) they can chalk it up to genetics but with both I worry they'll think they did something wrong. I've also been hiding it for so long, my mom might think I don't trust her (which I do). I just don't know if I'm doing more harm than good by telling them, and if I should just suck it up and tough it out until I can return to school in 3-4 months.

305,"Ok so I made the decision to post something  Political to Facebook recently about the current situation. There was some pretty good debate in the comments. I always welcome conversation and had some good back and forth with a couple people. One person who posted in support of my post was my moms best friend. My other friends and I were arguing about her comment and I guess she got sick of the back and forth or just didn’t want to comment any further so she deleted her comment which removed most of the thread. I was talking about it later on in my family group chat and revealed that it was gone because she had deleted it. Later on my sister texted me saying that my mom was giving her friend “an earful” and saying she was just like people in Nazi germany for deleting it which kind of irked me. I thought if she wanted to delete it, she should be able to. I totally understand getting sick of all the arguing and debating or not wanting your words to get twisted. So I texted my moms friend and just said “hey I am so sorry. I swear I didn't get my mom to get on you for deleting your comment. I totally get how back and forth on Facebook can get annoying and you don't want to come across the wrong way. I don't mind at all that you deleted it.”

Anyways I didn’t think that was a big deal but my mother went ballistic!!! She said that I undermined her and the point she was trying to make that you shouldn’t cave to peer pressure and delete your comment. She said that was HER friend and I should have stayed out of it. I honestly just didn’t want this woman thinking I got my mommy to defend me. 

So my question is, did I do something wrong here? If so, what did I do? If not, how do I handle this without causing more drama?",05Jun2020,1
306,"Long story short, I had this dom who I had known for about 2 months prior to selling. I ended up owing him over $2k which may not seem like a lot, but for someone who works part time and goes to college it is. I also help my mother out sometimes if she needs it. I regret selling my own porn with this guy because it has given me such severe anxiety. One text from this immediately gets my heart racing. Life got in the way and when I decided to confess that I owed him, he got angry and said some things that made me feel terrible. He would make it seem as though I never intended to pay him back and that I did all this on purpose. When he was telling me all these things, I was becoming so stressed and anxious that I got the feeling of wanting to hurt myself. I hadn’t had that sort of feeling for a few years, but the thought was boggling my mind when he was telling me how awful I was. I actually did start giving myself scratches secretly under my sleeve since I didn’t want him to notice nor did I have anything handy with me. There were times where I told him that I want to give him his share of the money, but would refuse and told me that he would want it all in the end.

He got a lawyer (at least that’s what he told me) in early January after I confessed and told me that I had until April to prove that I was going to give him the money. He basically made this plan for me to save up, but it wasn’t possible when it came to school or helping out my single mother. I was desperate and anxious so I eventually came to the option of dating sugar daddies. Most were creepy and I felt disgusting afterwards. Don’t get me wrong, some people enjoy that kind of lifestyle, but it’s not for me. However, once this whole pandemic started, I haven’t met up with anybody.

What sucks even more is that I’m not completely sure if all of my videos, pictures, and audio clips are deleted. He says that he has deleted them, but I don’t know for sure. The email that we used to sell is still up and so is my old reddit page. While he has deleted most of the reddit posts, some are still there. When I look at the email on google hangouts, I see that he is still active almost everyday. This makes me believe that he probably still has those videos and pictures of me and is still selling them. When I asked him about the email, he said that the lawyer told him that the email belongs to him and not me since he signed up with his information. I found that to be unfair since almost all of my porn content was uploaded on there. He changed the password on it shortly after I confessed and now I have no idea what he does with it.

I don’t know what to do. I have been crying myself to sleep on some nights and I just feel so helpless. I thought it would be a good idea to make money apart from my part time job, but I immensely regret it. I didn’t realize how messy this could’ve been for me. I didn’t realize how stupid I was being. I’ve been so stressed, depressed, and anxious because of this. The thoughts of hurting myself and being so helpless has become more reoccurring. I don’t know what kind of advice I’m exactly looking for, but I guess I just need some comfort.",05Jun2020,1

• Anything in particular we should look for during a tour? 
• Any red flags we might not know to recognize? 
• What’s the first thing gives away that the complex isn’t as nice as they say they are? 
• What should we definitely buy (that isn’t obvious) and where can we find it cheap?

So I (21) recently re connected with a girl (20) who I used to talk to couple of years ago who liked me but I was a dumb fuck and just fucked around but I was young and dumb and didn’t do anything well she got a bf and we stopped talking, but recently I matched with her on tinder 2 weeks ago, they were having a break so she could fuck anyone and she was keen, anyway we started talking again, She then she broke up with her bf last week cause he cheated on her (3 year relationship) and well anyway they broke up and we have been talking a lot and she seems pretty keen on me and keeps wanting cuddles (I know it’s probably rebound) well last night she was like things are starting to open up again (cause I was like let's get dinner one night) and I’m like hell yeah wanna get dinner one day (I figured that was a hint). she was like sure and we arranged a place to go. Today I was like wanna do it in a couple of days or wait a little and she was like “too soon!”. So I was like fair enough, she then says “she feels bad making you wait” and I’m like “nah it’s all good I understand all” I ask is that if you lose Interest please just say something and shes like I understand. She then started becoming very distant and last night she sent me a message saying :she's sorry if I felt like she was leading me on but she just needs some of me time” Here’s a transcript of the messages that followed.

Me: That’s fine I understand, Just know I’m always here just for a chat or if things change.

Her: Thankyou for understanding. But I don’t see us talking helping me at all. (I took that as she there could be a possibility of us?)

Me: I'm happy to wait cause I really do feel like you are the one (I know it's cheesy but I really do and now I look back that was a stupid thing to say but it’s to late)

Her: Aww I understand but please don’t wait, you deserve someone who will do the same.

Me: So you won’t/ do? ( I know that was a terrible response and I feel really bad for it but what is done is done)

Her: well you like me and I just got out of a Long relationship. ( she really didn’t say no so maybe another chance later on?)

We're meeting this weekend and I know he's gonna try to kiss me and I really want to kiss him too but my head is all over the place. Normally, a kiss is not a big deal for me at ALL but I know I'm going to get super attached if anything happens and I feel like I'll break if I get hurt again. I want to talk to him about it but it's a lot for someone to take in and hear and I'm scared he'll think I'm being dramatic or think I'm some depressed, overthinking freak. I'm not depressed but I just have terrible trust issues when it comes to relationships. Should I try living in the moment and just go with the flow this weekend or should I talk to him about all of this?",05Jun2020,1
313,"Some background to this story. I’m a 21 year old guy who went to a 4 year all guy high school, then joined the Marine Corps infantry (all guys again) a couple days after graduating. I just got out of the Marines a little over 5 weeks ago and I moved back home. I get take out at this Mexican place around once a week and I started having small talk with this beautiful girl at the restraunt. The first time I went into this place was 5 weeks ago when I got out and I went in there and she told me I had beautiful eyes and complimented me a little more. Long story short, after 5 more times of going in there I saw the timing was right and asked for her number. We started texting tonight and she told me it’s great timing that I asked for her number tonight instead of a month ago cause she just got out of a relationship 3 weeks ago. She told me her only days off are Sunday and Monday and I asked if she can hangout on Monday and she said no she’s got something going on. We texted about 6 more text exchanges each until it was bedtime and she said she will let me know when she’s free and goodnight. She won’t be able to hang out for AT LEAST another 10 days. When should I text her next without seeing too clingy but still showing interest? I know I sound like a total fucking pussy but I’ve went on dates with women but never been in a relationship and I would like to actually try with her. Thanks",05Jun2020,1
314,"Oddly enough, over a year ago I almost moved in with an ex but broke it off last minute. I was an anxious mess leading up to it (no ones fault) and it was overall not the best situation.

Directly after not moving in with him and breaking things off, I moved out on my own and now have a year of being alone/maintaining a household under my belt.

Next weekend, I am fully moving in with my boyfriend. We haven’t been dating for super long (I believe 8-9 months), but we both firmly believe in our relationship and that this is not the convenient choice, but the right choice.

We’ve done a 3 week trial run &amp; it went great. We know each other’s schedules (pre COVID and post COVID), set some expectations and are generally very excited to move in. This weekend I’m starting to bring most of my “easy” moving items into his house.

Is there any tips on making this go smoothly? Anything I should prepare for? Any general advice?

I know our relationship will change and this quite literally will make our relationship or break it, but I’m excited nonetheless. 

Any tips are welcome!",05Jun2020,1
315,"So recently, I’ve become aware of my toxic behaviour and am starting to make changes to free myself from the toxic mentality. 

I used to get angry easily, snap and say things I don’t mean and regret it later. I’ve always felt guilty for doing this but when when I get triggered by something it’s the easy way out instead of processing my feelings. 

I got laid off from my job because of covid and my work is taking extra long to open up, so I have some time on my hands. I am still able to pay half the bills (my bf and I live together) due to a family member passing a few years ago and me still having inheritance from that. So I figured why not work on my mental health and try and better myself while I have this time. I’ve been applying for jobs as well, for about 2 hours every 3 days and on the other days, I go through my email every morning and respond to follow ups / questions employers have for me.

My boyfriend however, accuses me of sleeping all day, since he can’t see me, I can’t prove anything. His words. I’ve offered to show him my emails, my job apps, my call logs but he refuses to look. I tried to explain to him *calmly* that I am trying my best. That he is making me feel guilty about not working and that am not just spending the day sleeping like he thinks. 

I’m scared to tell him I’ve been doing mental health exercises, writing a diary, finding new hobbies and trying to reconnect with friends ( i haven’t spoken to due to my antisocial behaviour) because he doesn’t believe mental health exists and tells me it’s just excuses. I haven’t been happy in a while and doing these things are saving me. I can feel myself changing and it feels good. I haven’t had a mood swing around my boyfriend in a while AND I quit smoking. He hasn’t noticed. Funny thing is, when he gets home from work, at 2pm, he has a nap until 9 pm. Then goes to sleep at 10 again. He doesn’t get that other people, have jobs AND cook AND clean AND work AND have a social life. He’s lucky because he expects ME to do all those things for him PLUS have a full time job, yet he can barely handing working 7-2pm at a desk job since he has no energy and no effort. 

Please. I don’t want to break up with him, but I can’t change him either. We are so invested with each other, and my family is toxic so if we break up, I’ll have nowhere to live. We have pets together and I couldn’t bare loosing them.",05Jun2020,1
316,"I’m 27 years old now and I work part time at a coffee shop with a bunch of 18-23 year olds.. I haven’t seen anyone in months and we had a meeting over zoom. It was so awkward.. One of the most awkward situations I’ve ever been in. I’m not sure if everyone was talking before I got on, but as soon as I got on. Nobody said a word. After I introduced myself, I didn’t say a word either. I can’t help but to think that they Think I’m a creep or this or that. That the sole reason the meeting was awkward was because of me. 

I think they did that on purpose to show that they all don’t like me.. I’m not sure what happened in the past 3 months since the coffee shop closed due to COVID. But since I haven’t reached out to anyone they might all think I’m fake. It seems like they all did this on purpose. I didn’t feel welcome at all. Prior to this they praised me in front of everyone for being such a hard worker. Everyone liked me. Now it seems like my coworkers collectively want me gone. This is where my thoughts automatically go.. I can’t help but to think that the meeting was extremely awkward only because of me. It felt like I was being bullied through collective silence in a weird way. The only person talking was my manager. And when she asked if we had any questions, nobody answered. It sucks because I was so caught off guard by it. I’ve worked there for a year, but ever since it closed down and I stopped talking to everyone. It’s as if they look at me as a completely different person.. Like I’m a creep and a waste of space; I honestly have no idea what I did to make them think that way of me. Am I just paranoid, or is collectively being silent toward someone something people do?",05Jun2020,1
317,"Hi! Lately, I've been feeling really sick due to anxiety, and I'm not quite sure what to do. I'm no stranger to this sensation: a few years ago it went on for so long that I lost 15 pounds in a little over a month. That was back when I had just gotten out of a traumatic situation, and my brain realized that everything was okay, so it decided to make me feel everything I'd been pushing down. 

That was three years ago. For some reason during that time, I developed a very intense fear of throwing up, which wasn't helpful when I was constantly feeling sick. During that time, I got help, but every time I approach an anniversary of a particularly bad day, that sick feeling comes back. 

I have no idea what, but something must have happened in the last three days, because I've been feeling like this that whole time. I wake up and *instantly* feel sick, then pretty much continue feeling awful all day long. I've eaten a bit of salad, some oatmeal, and two apples in the past two and a half days. I can't really bring myself to eat anything else, and can't eat until around 3:00 PM, even though I feel really hungry. 

Does anyone know how to help, or should I just wait for it to pass? I have to be *100%* distracted for the feeling to leave, and controlled, deep breathing only really helps when I feel like I might puke. 

If anyone has any suggestions, I'd love to hear them! Have a good day! :)",05Jun2020,1

321,"I'm an 17 year old female, 18 in September, and I'm in a dark place right now. I apologize if this is very long, there's just so much I need to get out.

For some background, I have faced mental health problems all of my life due to an abusive and drug-addicted father, poverty, bullying, etc and have even battled a self-harm addiction (which I beat on my own). During my junior year of high school, I discovered politics as an escape for myself since my mother had been diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer. Through that, I became a open republican. I grew up in a Mexican-predominant community and my high school was extremely liberal. In a way, I understand how this can be considered social suicide but it was something that I liked posting about. Ben Shapiro was one of my biggest inspirations (still is) and I want to be a political commentator in my free time, not even for the possible fame but because it's something I truly enjoy.

This was where my problems stemmed. I never had Twitter, and I refuse to have one because Twitter is a literal cesspool, but I heard from people that I was personal with that people began talking bad about me. That was to be expected, so I was able to tough it out and handle it. It was during my senior year when it truly escalated. I began having rumors spread about me, I had people yell at me things in the hallways when I was either walking to class or to my car after school, I received endless insults from my peers about me, my family, my own personal struggles with relationships (because of my mental health and sheer bad luck), my race (I am mixed white/Mexican but look white), etc etc etc. I had to take a 2-week detox from all social media during the beginning of my second semester because it was all becoming overwhelming. When the quarantine hit back in mid March was when, I would say, it hit its peak. I began receiving physical threats from people that I went to HS with, some even from my own colorguard (which I was a captain of), I had long-time friends that I had known for up to 5 years block me on all social media with no word or explanation, I was attacked by people I thought were close friends, I received death wishes, and some more that I can't list off of the top of my head at the moment. Keep in mind I have never said anything to warrant such actions. I am openly for immigration, only against illegal immigration, openly supporting of LGBT people, I pretty much only have republican policies. 

With quarantine being how it is, my mental health started declining again, if it hadn't been declining already during my senior year as I was losing my friends and respect and the stress of college. I have lost motivation to do simple tasks like cleaning my room, going out of the house, or even eating sometimes, lost interest in my hobbies like writing and drawing, have begun experiencing more frequent nervous/mental breakdowns, and have had thoughts of beginning self harm again to release stress and emotional pain. I felt as though I've become so alone now, that I have no one around me that truly likes me, for me, or even gives a shit about me. I've never shown it in my politics and through my encounters with people but deep down, it is beginning to take a heavy toll on my health.

I'm starting college this fall and as some know, colleges can be very liberal but I'll also be one of 33,000 students on campus. I've been wanting to join the republican chapter at my campus and expand on my social media politics but I have a huge fear of what happened to me in high school will happen to me in college. I have had to consider whether or not I should abandon my strong passion for politics and my dreams of being a commentator simply for my mental health. I have also considered using money from working in college to look into getting a therapist to better aid my overall mental health and find out how to solve my issues, since my problems are deeply centered around self-esteem and isolation (I was always a black sheep in my life). I just need advice of what to do. I don't want to abandon my strong passion and my escape from reality, so to speak, but I feel like I may have to if I don't want to end up dead.

I'm not looking for political discourse on here, nor am I wanting anyone insulting or ridiculing me for my stances. I already get enough of that in my daily life and I'm confiding in here because it's entirely anonymous, I don't want my one option of security to be jeopardized. I'm looking for advice on my issues and what to do next. Please treat me like a person here, I already get enough bastardization and vilifying from people in my personal life. I just need help. If anyone has any advice, please give it to me. I need it right now, and I don't know how much longer I can take of all this.",05Jun2020,1

There response was to wipe it off while all my things were still on the bed(pillow, blankets, sheets etc.). My immediate worry is that my things were directly under said smears and when it was wiped off parts could have fallen on top of the the blankets or pillow.

325,"As a black person, these last weeks have been sooo stressful for me. From watching coronavirus kill black people at a higher rate than others to all of the racism that is going on, I am literally drained and sadden by everything. We have been woking from home since March and a like 4 to 5 people went back in the office. A few days ago, I went to dinner with my friends and then we went to a protest. It felt great to be out there with all the people from city at a peaceful Black Lives Matter protest. For the first time, I wasn't in a horrible mood. I posted it on my instagram story and so did my friend/ex co-worker and she tagged me in a video. The next morning, one the managers followed me and watched my story and about 40 minutes later, I got a text from someone saying that manager is mad ""that ""people"" can't come in to work, but can go out to protest. if you wanted to work from home just say that, don't say its because you are scared of coronavirus""....... I was honestly disturbed by this. He couldn't even say it to me, he told a peer. I know he was telling everyone else because another middle aged nosy coworker that I don't follow and he doesn't follow me watched my story. He literally had to search my name to watch it. At that point, I blocked him from watching my story and I private my account. Not one of them have asked if I have been okay, and the company basically ignoring what is going on in the outside world. And I honestly disturbed and annoyed that it seems to be gossip that I want to stand with my community. Is it wrong for me to completely block him from my account or do you think that will start problems?",05Jun2020,1
326,"18m... soon 19.

I started lifting weights 3 years ago because i was overweight and had heart issues. But that doesn't matter now... I lost 40 kilos and more in 8 months. From that i started trying to build muscles.... I always had shit diet and i cant afford supplements.... Im at Uni so every cent counts for me.

So from new year idk.... i just started getting stronger and stronger.... Im 68 kilograms and 178cm tall... I get to around 71 kg max... So what happened...  I just got stronger and stronger each week... My diet is pretty shit. I can't afford a good diet because of financial reasons. But on the other hand i got really strong. I remember 20kilo dumbbell was something ultra heavy for like a chest exercise.. Now i was warming up with it and later hit 30 kilo dumbbell for chest exercise for an example ( i never thought i will lift a 30kilo dumbbell nor lift it 7 times lol ). As i got stronger i got compliments that im wider and larger... My chest was significantly wide. My biceps was fulfilled. But the thing that confuses me is that my weight is the same. Like i got larger a bit and a lot stronger.... But my weight is the same 69-70 kilo. Anyone knows what is happening ?

327,"I have been trying leave my small-medium sized “hometown” (I moved here as a teen) for the past 20 years. I have mental health issues (bipolar, depression, anxiety) and suffer from a chronic illness. Every time I have left it is only a matter of months before I am forced by circumstance to come back. My last attempt at moving away and starting my own life was thwarted by an unplanned pregnancy. 

Fast forward to today, I am now a stay-at-home mom of three young children, I am married to a man that I love and enjoy being with, we are financially secure. It’s everything I have ever wanted. Except our location. I feel as though I am still waiting in the wings to launch into my own life, like a high school senior, except I am now middle aged. 

I am a liberal atheist living in a town that is extremely conservative. I have been here 20 years and I have only met one like-minded person, and that person moved. The only thing to do here is go to church (Which, I don’t) or going out to eat. That’s it. I know plenty of people, but no one knows me. I am constantly biting my tongue when I am around other people. It is soul crushing. 

I try to travel as much as possible to cities I enjoy, but inevitably I sink into a depression as soon as I board the plane back home. I feel as though I’ve been let out of my cage for a moment, to experience all that I am missing, then being shut back in my cell. It’s gotten to the point that I chose not to travel this summer (before Covid was even a factor) because  I feel like it’s probably healthier to just keep my blinders on. 

My last birthday I vowed that I would not still live here by my next birthday, at all costs. My birthday is in a few weeks, and I am no closer to leaving. I have discussed this with my husband and it is like talking to a brick wall. He says the time to just pick up and leave has passed, we have children now and we must prioritize security. But, he is the only one with a job and he has done very little to try and find a job elsewhere. There is always a reason not to go. At this rate I will be here until I die, and that thought sends me into a panic. 

Now, I have decided to go. I have told my husband for the last time. It is clear he has no intentions of leaving. I’m not sure of anything, where I will live, or work, or if I’m going to bring my children. The only thing I know is I must leave now, or I never will. 

I don’t know where else to get unbiased opinions and advice, and I could sure use some. Everything in my heart, mind and body is screaming for me to leave immediately, I feel like I’m on fire. But my brain is telling me I am probably being foolish, selfish and ungrateful. So please tell me, should I follow through with my plan, or am I trapped somewhere I hate because of the people that I love (my husband and kids)?

TL;DR : I live in a place that I hate and I want to leave, but I have children and a husband. I know I can just leave. But should I? Perspective appreciated.",05Jun2020,1

330,"Hello! I am a first time poster and mainly made this account solely to get some advice on this topic. I want to experience something completely different in my life while I'm still young,

I have a good amount of money saved up (6 grand at the time of writing but likely will have 7-8 grand by the time I were to go through with anything.) And I just wanna disappear to another country for a while. But I have so many questions that simple googling hasn't really got me the answers for.

My main concerns are:  
\-Is there anyway I can do this legitimately? I have done a small amount of research and it seems like there is very little way to get any kind of long term visa without being in the process of receiving education or already having higher education.

\-If I were to do this non-legit what kind of legal actions could I face? If I were to simply travel on a   tourist visa and just ""over stay"" what are the chances of getting caught? Would I face legal action when I'd try to leave? Would it hurt me massively financially? 

\-Where to go? Are there any countries that are very lax on immigration? (preferably English speaking but not a deal breaker)  Would it even be possible to find work to sustain myself without proper paperwork? 

\-How to deal with carrying a large sum of money? I would bringing all extra money I'd have after buying a one way ticket and putting money away if I'd need to return in an emergency + any other supplies I'd need. How would I carry this money around? Is using a bank in another country an option without any kind of paperwork in the country? Carry around thousands of dollars while drifting around in another country just seems like a horrid idea.

Thank you all for any input. This is mainly just a thought experiment with myself at the moment but it would be great to hear how poorly or how well something like this could work.",05Jun2020,1
331,"So I just moved in with a good friend of mine we’re both females. It’s only been 4 days but right from the first move in date, her boyfriend has been staying over for the whole time.
Mind to tell you, I’m buying all of the TV, Kitchen tables/chairs, room decors, and even fought to get first month rent free for both of us which succeeded into saving her some rent money. 
She never offered to contribute anything! 
0 dollars.
Am I supposed to pay for all of this for her and her bf to use? 
Lastly, the funny thing is he lives upstairs! Above us in the apartment complex! He lives alone. 
Why can’t she and him just go upstairs instead of being in my space? That’s a mystery to me. 
Is she trying to flex? She’s always been extremely competitive and copies my hair and outfit to match mine. She lies about unnecessary things to get her above me.

332,"I have no talents, I try out a lot of things, but after a while I get bored of them, I don't have anything I'm good at. Multiple things interest me, but I don't enjoy them when involved, and I'm not good or pushed to get good at them. I'd just like to know what really I'm good at, what comes to me naturally. What I can live to improve on.

When it comes to labels (which I don't like, but can at least be a guide), I'm not a nerd, nor a geek, nor a jock/athlete, nor a ladies man, nor anything. My label would be human. I just exist. Was never good at anything in school just average in everything. 

It's really a concern, because as a young adult I'd like to know what I want from life, what I'm willing to dedicate the rest of my life to - even if it changes over time. But I'm just blank in that aspect. Have no clue. 

I went to college simply for the sake of getting a degree. Now that I'm done and free from a preplanned structure and control, I refuse to just get a job because of the degree I have. I want to have something I work towards everyday. 

Goals? My goals are to live comfortably, not have to worry about budgeting or not being able to afford unforseen expenses. Nothing lavish. Just free comfort. How do I achieve that? Know myself. Interests, hobbies, etc. But the problem? I don't have any!!",05Jun2020,1
333,"I have never had a job in my life. In fact when people ask me what do I do, I just tell them that I am ""unemployed at the moment"" because I am embarrassed to be blunt and say ""well I would like to work, but my dad doesn't allow me to work."" 

Not only is my father extremely strict but he also is paranoid and overprotective, thinking that the ""worldly influences"" will ""mess me up"". 

I cannot go to college, and that's something I would love to do. However it's another thing on his list that I cannot do; for one, he thinks that I'll knock up everyone there (or get myself pregnant), and that, again, I will be influenced by ""the world."" 

And most importantly he will not allow me to work. Yet he calls me ""lazy"" and ""selfish"" every chance that he gets, and yells at me. My self esteem has tremendously plummeted, and at this point I feel like no matter what I do, it will never be enough for him. So I went to my room and took a lot of pills and made a few cuts in my skin. 

I am 19 years old...I can't even have a job because he said that I have a ""bad attitude"", even though he pushed me to that point because he doesn't acknowledge or appreciate the work/chores that I do around the house, and he consistently yells, demeans, and lets me know what else I'm doing ""wrong.""   He treats me like shit, even though I show nothing but respect to him; also calling him ""sir"" and being obedient. Being the best child and daughter that I can be. He has also threatened to whip me because of this. 
 
I do not have a driver's license (therefore no car), and I've tried to stand up to him but he always sees it as me ""talking back"" to him when it's nothing more than me trying to defend myself.

I feel trapped and stuck... essentially under ""house arrest."" And all I do now is stay in my room until it's time to clean up again. I am severely depressed and I feel hopeless. He is sheltering me and keeping me from the world, and I do not know what to do. And I do not want to resort to ending my life but at this point, I feel like it's the only way out for me.

Add on: I have thought of leaving late at night by my basement or the window-- or doing so early in the morning, OR when my family is out somewhere; calling an Uber or my friend to drop the car off so I can pack my things. Plan b was to call the cops then someone to help me pack my things, IF my family were present. With the cops there they can't stop me. But I don't know if that's a bad idea or not. I have my social security card, birth certificate, GED graduate certificate, ID, debit card, and pepper spray. Is there anything I'm missing? I want to bring a lot of bags because I have a lot of clothes and other necessities. But I'm not sure if I'm going to have to sacrifice some things and not bring so much so I can escape smoothly.

334,"We have been together for 2 months, but as I moved in with him for the duration of lockdown and it's been longer than I thought, we've gotten very close and our relationship has gotten quite serious, which we're happy with.



We both have mental health issues and he told me from the beginning that an unsavoury childhood was the root of his, but only today while drinking did he tell me the full story. When he was 13-16, his mother was dating a domestic abuser. Originally he just beat his mother, but my boyfriend began to act out to bait him and purposefully get the anger taken out on him. It worked, so to protect his mother he'd get beaten, brutally, every single day. He eventually broke and told someone at school who sent child services to their house, but his mother lied and said he was making it up for which he's never forgiven her.




I care about this man immensely,  and I want to do everything in my power to keep him safe and support him. Tonight he mumbled his abuser's name in his sleep  so I woke him up and asked if he was okay then cuddled him for a while, but I don't know if that was the right thing to do or enough.

What I'm thinking is I either contact them before I actually submit and explain why I don't feel comfortable OR I insert a random string of numbers and then explain dow in the questions section what I did and then I can share it later.

I fairly certain it's a legit website because it is a link from my local college that has it's own Fire Program. It's a super small town which might explain why it's not secure online.

Any advice would be appreciated! I'm also going to talk to my parents about it too and see what they think.",05Jun2020,1
336,"Yes, I know that's quite the title. For some context, I am a high school student and during the quarantine, a group of boys I know at school and I have been periodically chatting on Discord and playing various games. I'm not much of a gamer and am bored on the standard FPS game so they asked that I joined them on Roblox instead and because of my general boredom I agreed. In any case, we played around a bit and I genuinely think it was quite fun, at least for a while. They then asked me to join another game, one on an LGBTQ Hangout, despite the fact that I knew none of them were members of said community, at least openly. This was a big red flag, I know, but I legitimately wanted to believe that friends of mine weren't going to do anything malicious so I joined. Immediately, they began to spam the chat with disgusting homophobic statements, finding creative ways to spell slurs to evade the blockers, making light of the situation revolving around George Floyd, and encouraging me to join. These are people I know in real life, people I respected, who had never even hinted at having a side like this before but things they said were absolutely vile and I was caught completely off guard. So I silently reported their accounts and left the game and voice chat, claiming that I ""had to go."" I didn't tell them how the things they said disgusted me and I feel like a coward for doing so-- I've always tried to avoid confrontations but in this case I feel like I let fear overrule my personal values. I just didn't expect to encounter people like this in real life, especially not legitimate friends of mine, so I ran away. I guess I'm simply asking for advice on what I should have done and how to proceed from here.",05Jun2020,1
337,"My parents were never truly happy together, they kind of got married because my mom got pregnant and they lived in a very conservative pueblo in Mexico. My dad was and a I’ll is a hard alcoholic and has abused my mom throughout their marriage which only caused her to develop mental issues in turn. They got divorced before I was born but my mom kept him around so that her kids could have a dad. I’m the youngest of the family and I’m often told I had it the easiest. Which I can’t deny because I grew up around the time money started to pick up in our household. Of course hearing your parents argue every night and the abuse can have its affect on you. Even after my mom finally kicked my dad out, I ended up developing anxiety and anger issues at a very young age but eventually found ways to cope and overcome it on my own because I really didn’t have anyone else.

I still live with my mom because I’m only 16 and even after all these years my parents can’t seem to let go. In 2019 my mom started arguing with my dad about the house in Mexico and who would get it, she ended up spending a shit ton of money on a lawyer because she wanted a house that’s basically falling in on itself. Eventually the case was settled and they had to split the house half and half. Now it brings us to this day where my dad is determined to not let my mom finish construction on her side of the property. Even after telling my mom that I don’t want to get involved in her and my dads petty affairs she continues to do it. She begs me to tell my dad to leave her alone but I’m too scared to do it really and I’d honestly prefer to live my life without having to worry about that. Which only results in her taking out her anger on me (not physically) and threatening to leave to Mexico and abandon me so I never see her again. It sounds crazy but it isn’t the first time she’s done that. I’ve learned to not let it get to me but sometimes it just hurts when you hear it come from your own mom. 

 I don’t know what to do... is it wrong that I refuse to get involved?",05Jun2020,1
339,"This is a repost from r/offmychest. It got buried there, waiting for approval. I'm a little desperate here, I have to see him in a few days. 

I don't know how to begin. English isn't my first language, I hope there are not too many errors.

Yesterday I visited my mom and we started talking about stuff. It was just casual conversation, switching from topic to topic. At one point we started talking about a video made by 2 moderators here in Germany. The video informs about sexism, harassment and sexual abuse. I told her about my experiences, stuff nearly every woman encounters throughout their life, I guess (catcalling, sb grabbing my butt at parties, unwanted ""compliments"".... and so on.) for me, most of these weren't traumatic experiences which is why I can talk about it without a problem. I also teach sexual education at a middle school and I am very adamant about teaching consent to both boys and girls as I think it is extremely important to understand this. 

All this must have stirred my mom's memories. 

A little backstory:  My mom and my father are divorced, they separated when I was 6 years old. She never spoke nicely of my father. It always made me sad. I already had mixed feelings towards him. I love (loved??) him because he is my dad after all. Always smiling, happy, very charismatic. And full of love for me and my older brother. He always claims how proud he is of me being a teacher and being the first in the family who went to uni. He has some major flaws though. He never paid child support for me, claiming he didn't have the money while transferring his belongings to his new wife so there was nothing to get. My mom says he is a narcissist and now I agree.

&amp;#x200B;

Well... talking about all these experiences I had with harassment stirred my moms memories. She told me about my father raping her. Not only once...He was of the opinion that he could 'take' my mom whenever he wanted. It didn't matter to him if she didn't want to have sex. She had to. She said that she thinks he might have put something in her drink at times. He had a fetish for silk stockings. She would wake up, dizzy, not knowing what happened and suddenly wearing these silk stockings she didn't wear before. She also told me that at a point they didn't want to have children yet she didn't use any birth control (I don't know why, my mum was very emotional yesterday and I believe she coulnd't bring herself to tell me every detail) and my father just said it wouldn't matter, what happens, happens and raped her. 

When they separated, we moved out of the house. My father didn't show up to help moving, my mum was on her own, she only had her parents and a very nice neighbour helping her. While getting everything out of the house, she found silk stockings all over the place. In my fathers night drawer, in the basement (??) and in many other places and she sweared to me that these stockings didn't belong to her and she had never seen them before. At least not conscious. She didn't elaborate on this. She was very emotional, understandably. I feel very sorry for my mother and I feel guilty for bringing up this trauma. She said she was able to suppress the memories for a long time but now, getting older, things surface.

I am still shocked and I honestly don't know how to behave towards my father or my paternal grandma. She doesn't know anything about this. My grandma is like a second mom to me, she is always there for me and we are very close. I can talk to her about everything. This makes it even harder for me. 

I have to see my father next week. He helps with a school project we have to finish next week (students are not involved due to corona, the project needs to be finished anyway so we do it on our own). 

I hate the thought of seeing him right now. But I can't just change my behaviour towards him, he would know that something's up and of course I can't tell him that I know. That would be horrible for my mother. 

I keep thinking about what happens if I ever get married, the tought of having him there is making me sick right now. My mum would have to see him. As I teenager I always wanted him to walk me down the aisle, now I have to gag just thinking about it.",05Jun2020,1
340,"Long post (sorry)

Hi. I’m 18f and this happened a few months ago, right before COVID-19. I didn’t think much of it but I just now realized that the feelings I have towards the event might not be normal.
So, to get one thing straight first before all this I was a 100% virgin, I had never even held hands with anyone (still haven’t). This guy (19m) was an old friends brother and when we were younger (I was in middle school) we “dated” but it didn’t really mean anything to me. He didn’t know this, I guess, and back in March his sister gave me his number.
I still don’t know if I wanted to come on as strong as I made it out or if I pushed myself because I wanted to experience sex. Basically, we talked a lot and I flirted pretty heavily. I showed interest. We set it up for him to meet at my house after he got off of work after only 2/3 days of talking. We hadn’t seen each other in years. I was way over my head, looking back. But still.
So, I talked a really big talk and once he showed up I was very nervous. We laid next to each other in bed, not touching and I couldn’t even look at him. I would sigh sometimes, and he would copy (mock?) me and count how many times I had sighed. We barely talked as well, but I told him I was nervous but that I wanted to do it. But my body was glued to my bed. He never made any moves, he said that I had to make the first move since it was my first time doing stuff like this - even when I told him I wouldn’t say no if he broke that barrier. He also talked down to me a lot, saying that I would regret it if I didn’t do anything and that I’ll look back on that night and feel terrible because I didn’t do anything. It made me feel really pressured and like shit, but I didn’t say anything. He also shamed me for talking so big but being like this in person (I admit, that was kinda shitty of me. Though I did tell him that I was nervous and shaking before he came). I’m not the best at communicating, especially with someone who was practically a stranger. After awhile I had the courage to ask to hold his hand, which he laughed at but let me do it. I thought contact would make it better, but honestly it didn’t. I was still just as nervous. We only held hands for about 3 minutes before he pulled away.
I laid there for almost 2 hours of him mocking my sighs and telling me over and over that I’d regret it before I gave in. I got on top of him, but I still couldn’t do anything. I had told him multiple times, like I mentioned before, that I wanted him to make the first move and that that would help me break that barrier easier. And I told him again that I wanted to kiss him, but I still couldn’t do it. But he finally gave in and we met halfway.
The kissing was weird, it definitely felt forced and it definitely wasn’t pleasurable. I didn’t really like it, thinking back. Eventually things got more heated and I was beneath him with my shirt off, he was touching my boobs and grinding against me. At this point we’re still kissing but I’m not grinding back or really reciprocating. I didn’t even really like that I had my shirt off. I kinda backed off into my own head, directing myself on what to do. I pushed myself to start to move with him but it felt wrong. At this point I definitely had mainly retreated into my head and was trying to calm myself down. Thankfully, my dog interrupted us and I put my shirt back on and he played on my Xbox for a bit before leaving.
We ended up going to see a movie and out to eat later that week, where all we did was talk and I went back to his place where I watched him play games on his PC. I couldn’t even get myself to hold his hand during the movie. When I talked to him about this and the nervousnesses of the first time, he said you just have to say “fuck it” and do it. Which is true, I suppose, but was really hard for me to do especially because it seemed like he wasn’t trying very hard.
We haven’t talked in 7 weeks if snapchat is to go by because I distanced myself a little to see if he would start any conversations as it seemed like I would always lead them. He only started a conversation once and once I distanced myself we slowly fell off. 
I haven’t talked to anyone about what happened but looking back it seems like I may have been sexually assaulted. During no time at my house did I give an enthusiastic yes, nor did he ever ask for my consent. I guess my texts were enough content to both of us because of how strong I came on. But I’m not sure and I need advice on where to go from here. Thank you.",05Jun2020,1

Even though I’m graduating next year, have my drivers license, my own car and all the other things and opportunities that my peers have I still feel like a child.

345,"My elderly neighbor has recently lost her husband, we do not have the greatest relationship (I inherited my home after my grandfather passed away and my first interaction with her was to tell me that she did not like him and he was spiteful by letting his property become overrun with weeds and shrubs, he was 92 with dementia and mobility issues and would not let the family help him becoming combative when we tried to help) we finally convinced him to move to a “Home” when he could not walk up the stairs to the second story of his house. So we don’t have the greatest relationship but she is still a human being and therefore deserves compassion.

352,"I need help. I’m 14 and have been online friends with a girl around my age for about 3 years now. We are close but I cut her off last July because she was making racist comments and just overall wasn’t a good person. She messaged me back in December with a long apology which it took me a little while to respond to because I was kind of shocked. I truly thought she changed so I accepted it, and we started talking and are now at the closeness point we were before I cut her off last July. 

However, after the first time I cut her off her friends attacked me. Numerous posts were made about me. I was getting messages saying that I should be raped, my pictures were posted and it was a mess. I knew I shouldn’t have started talking to her again but it was hard throwing that many years of friendship away. It was dumb. 

She has a “spam” account on instagram and she posted a screenshot of the apology the same day after she sent it basically saying that she didn’t really mean the apology and laughing about it. I know this because I’ll admit, I went through her posts (not many of them) to see if the posts about me were still up. I didn’t find that out until a little while ago because I was curious. 

She did another thing again (not to me, but I still found it gross) where she crossed a major boundary and basically most her online friends from twitter hate her. I can see their point and I don’t want to be associated with her anymore. That was the final straw and I want to have her out of my life. I am so worried about what will happen if I cut her off again. 

I’m not really doing the best mentally right now and I don’t want her friends to attack me again. I don’t want her to attack me again. I’m afraid of conflict and I know that once I cut her off the same thing that happened last July will happen again. I don’t know what to do. I’m scared, because I know she will not just have the same group of friends attack me but she will most likely have her small group of friends from twitter attack me as well.

I'm a young therapist (late 20s), and a few months ago I went and found myself a personal therapist to work through personal and professional stuff, which generally has been helpful. But, I'm now thinking about switching therapists because:     


(1) she's self-disclosed in a manner that I feel hurt our therapeutic relationship (e.g. her religious beliefs), (2) she's going through personal issues that are in my professional expertise and has asked my opinions on her situation, and (3) she told me that she talked to her husband about me and he recognizes me from community interactions we've apparently had (I have a job that's very interesting to people, and is very specific/identifiable).  


This is my second therapy experience, and both times I've been 'outed' by the therapist as in #3, so I'm feeling kind of burned. It's particularly disappointing because I know and try as a therapist to not do these things with my own clients.  


I'm mixed on whether I should switch therapists now, or wait until things settle in the world so I can start fresh with in-person visits (as opposed to telehealth); I do feel like I'm benefitting somewhat, but definitely don't want to deal with this long-term. I'm also torn submitting a formal complaint to her licensing board; I don't want her to be in big trouble, but I do want this addressed.  Honestly the emotional energy and anxiety of dealing with this and starting all over spewing my story to someone new sounds exhausting but I know it needs to happen.  


So, do I switch therapists now, or in a month or two? Do I submit a formal complaint to her licensure, or talk to her about my concerns, or just walk away and leave it be?

360,"After relying on everybody my entire life, I feel like it’s finally time to start working on myself. 

My mom raised me to rely on a man, and to stick with a man just because he pays the bills. I thought that I would never stay with a guy who treats me poorly, just because he takes care of me. 

That was until after high school, I didn’t go to college and kept getting back together with my rich ex who continued to emotionally cheat on me. 

Him and I broke up, and this past year I’ve been living with someone who also treats me like shit. I’ve stuck with him because I didn’t want to go back and live with my mom in a tiny apartment, and who also treats me like crap. Things don’t go her way? It’s off to the streets for ya. I have no family, and my “mom” is all I have. 

I’m thinking about going to college and getting a degree, because I no longer want to stick with shitty people just because they can provide for me. It’ll suck having to live with my mom for the next 4 years while I pay off my debt (bad investment choices), but I like to think that it’ll all be worth it when I finally make something out of myself. 

The thing is, I’m pretty dumb and don’t know where to start. I know that I could qualify for FASFA, because my mom makes little to nothing, and is way below poverty level. How do I make sure that I’m getting all the right grants in order to pay slim to none for college? I would start off with a community college since my grades weren’t the best in high school.

I moved in with them in order to help and take a load off of them. Mainly what I do is cook meals for everyone, get up at 3:30 am to help her to the bathroom, and help her bathe. The main source of tension is over unpacking her things. There was 30 years of stuff collected in her garage that we moved, and most of it holds a lot of valuable family history. My stepmom and I communicate very differently, and disagree on what to do with the family treasures. This has resulted in a lot of ""family discussions"" and crying. So now I am alone in unpacking and sorting though the garage full of boxes, as my dad has to work all day and my stepmom has thrown in the towel. It has been extremely challenging to live with her, especially since I am now unemployed and we are quarantined together. I feel a very deep moral obligation and desire to help my grandmother, and I would feel very guilty to leave  and dump the things I was doing all on my dad.

I was only planning on staying throughout the duration of her recovery until she didn't need nighttime assistance, maybe two more weeks. My dad wants me here, but is stuck in the middle of it all. I don't know how much more of this hellish nightmare I can stand. What do I do? 

**Tl;dr**  My Grandma hurt herself so she moved in with my family, and I moved in with them to help. Now my stepmom and I are fighting. If I move out I can't help her, and the burden would be put all on my dad. Things between us would stay sour. If I stay, I might just kill the bitch, but at least I would be here to help and I could feel good about that. What should I do?",05Jun2020,1
364,"So my mom loves trying to find ways to get free movies and shows from her fire stick. My aunt is in town and suggested a program her boyfriend pays for. She also said a $80 VPN was ESSENTIAL for the program to work. She makes a hell of a lot more money than my mom.. and when I found out, I made a joke, “That’s a nice dinner” she just made fun of it and said, “Bye.”  My sister and I are the only ones who realized how much of a shitty investment this was and got a little over the top with my mom. I just raised my voice and told her that VPNs protect your identity, not activate programs. I rushed to get a refund, and my aunt said “Well my boyfriend is a real penny pincher. He wouldn’t spend money carelessly”. I got really upset because she doesn’t understand that we only eat out twice a month and can’t afford a lot of things in life.

368,"Tldr: my dads dog (10 years old, mongrel no known breed) attacked me now she's being let into the house again and I'm angry and scared of her. How do I get over this? Please any advice or comments would help me. 

Hi so the title kind of says it all.
I (25f) live with my parents and my dad is the primary carer for our older dog. But I've had a very close relationship with her since she was a puppy and she's always absolutely loved me.

Since I got my new puppy (2 weeks ago) my dads dog now absolutely hates me. She growls at me, growls at my puppy, and when I was feeding her and patting her about 5 days ago she turned on me and bit my hand three times, drawing blood all over my hand and injuring me. It was so shocking and I'll admit I cried.

The thing is, my dads dog has a history with aggressive behaviour. She can't be around cats, other dogs or children. She actually attacked my 4 year old cousin and bit her face, not so bad to cause permanent damage but bad enough she needed butterfly stitches. my cousins mum and dad were ok about it all but it was a very scary situation. She's also not allowed around our 4 house cats alone unsupervised either because all she does is growl. 

My dad does *nothing* about her behaviour and I'm sorry to say, but he's an idiot about it. He refuses to admit she's an aggressive dangerous dog and even gives her treats after she growls and gets upset because he thinks it will make her feel better. He doesn't realise he's basically training her to be aggressive.

When she bit me, he didn't even check on me to see if I was OK. He just patted the dog and tried to calm her down. He did absolutely nothing.

To start with she wasn't allowed in the house anymore. I don't want to be around her because I don't want to be bitten again, and I don't feel safe at all having her near my puppy. My puppy is only 8 weeks old and she's a chihuahua x pug and weighs less than a kilo. She's tiny! While my older dog is around 15kgs so she's a decent size.

Now my dad has started letting her back in the house when I put my puppy to bed in her crate. The older dog is super weird when she comes inside because I know she can smell my puppy. I honestly don't feel comfortable either, but for my dads sake I put up with it.

The thing is, how do I get over this? I feel scared and angry towards her, and I'm mad at my dad too. But I just need to get over it somehow? How do I not be angry at the dog? I know it's not her fault but I can't help it.

Please any advice or comments would be amazing :( I feel awful about this whole thing.",05Jun2020,1
369,"My dad constantly makes me feel like I'm stupid and idiotic.  I consider myself quite a smart person; I take all honors and AP classes and have a 4.0 GPA.  Yet, every time that I make a small mistake, my dad makes me feel stupid to the point of me crying myself to sleep.

This all came to a boiling point today at dinner.  The counter was covered in crumbs and my mom told me to get the broom and dustpan to sweep up.  So I, doing as she asked, swept the crumbs off and into the dustpan.  My dad then proceeded to scream at me about how stupid I was for using the broom on the counter, even though that is what my mother specifically told me to do.  After him constantly condescending to me, today I just lost it.  This situation in and of itself was not a huge deal, but I finally just exploded.  I yelled at him in front of my whole family about how he makes me feel like I'm stupid and how he speaks to me like I'm beneath him.  Which, okay, was probably not the most productive way to handle the situation, but you have to remember that this is the first time I've ever spoken up to him in years.  He then decided to pull the whole ""fine, I just won't speak to you again"" card.  He then proceeded to tell me that he has more life experience and that I don't know anything.  In my opinion, is it not his fault for not teaching me these things?  As a parent, is it not his job to teach me this ""life experience""?

I'm just so frustrated.  I brought up the problem with him and he apologized, but it was very half-assed and you could tell that he was just saying sorry to get me to shut up.  In reality, he really hurts me.  All I live for is to make him and my mother proud, and every day he makes me feel like utter shit.  He also tried to pass it off as ""joking,"" which was simply not the case; I can take a joke, but I can't take disrespect disguised as a joke

Are these just normal feelings that teenagers have?  Is this just the whole ""teenagers hate their parents"" thing coming into play?  He says that I'm overreacting, but I can't help how I feel.  Every time I try to talk to him about it, he just lists why I'm wrong and why he isn't.  Honestly, it's to the point where I can't wait until I'm 18 and move out.

Sometimes it feels like he doesn't even love me; he likes to use me as a sort of ""trophy"" to show off my clubs, academic awards, etc., but the second I'm not perfect he makes me feel awful about myself.  Today he told me that I hurt his feelings by calling him misogynistic, but he talks down to women all the time; does he have any sort of right to be upset by this?  Am I the asshole here?

I'd appreciate any advice that you can give me.  Also, I'm sorry if this is incoherent; it's currently 3 a.m. and I've been crying for hours.",05Jun2020,1
370,"So, a bit of a story here, so I'm sorry of its a little long, or really long, but its important. I've always been really shy, especially during my school years. I'm definitely open with friends and friendly with people I know and like. Heck, even the people I don't like that much, I still try to be friendly towards them. I'm a bit on the bigger side (very stereotypical chubby Mexican dude, having a dad bod at not even 20 can be a downer sometimes) so dating, especially in this generations way of looking for a significant other, was not really in the cards for me. Of course I had girl friends, but they where nothing more than friends. So senior year pops in, and I'm pretty much set on things like not asking someone to prom, or even taking a stab at dating anymore, that is, till I met someone, lets call her Cozy (because she absolutely radiated ""drinking tea, reading a book next to a fireplace during a rainstorm"" levels of coziness, if that makes sense). 

I fell hard for Cozy. Now mind you, theres 2 kinds of crushes, Lustful (purely wanting to date because of their physical attributes, and nothing much else) and Wholesome (those true crushes, where you like the person for who they are as a whole), and she was as wholesome as one could get. Her personality, how friendly she was with everyone, how when you'd talk to her it felt like she was listing to every word as best as she could like she was genuinely happy to be having said conversation, her style, she was a gem in the middle of a pile of pebbles. Of course, my crew of friends were very stereotypical Mexican guys (they were loud, aggressive, joked around a lot, talked back to teachers, you know how it is, maybe) in the way they acted, but I was almost completely a polar opposite to them. I have a very stone cold, indifferent expression, thats just how I look, so people would say I gave off a very antisocial, bad guy vibe. But its anything but, I just you know, couldn't show it for the sake of fitting in. Plus, Cozy was white, which may not have anything to do with things, but you know, it could factor in on something.

I'd go out of my way sometimes to interact with her, doing things like holding the door for her before school started (our parking spaces were on the same row, so we'd always go to class at the same time) and pretty much anytime I'd bump into her, saying ""Hi"" or ""Bye"" whenever we'd pass by each other in the hall. I'd go from joking around to being a bumbling, sweaty red-eared mess (my ears get hot and turn red whenever I get nervous), barely able to squeak out a ""Hey, how are you?"" whenever I was able to make conversation with her.

As the year went by, we had a couple of classes together, but never really ""connected"" a lot per se, just a lot of nothing talk and smiles (if I can call my smile a smile, I had real bad self image issues) until, last week of senior year comes by. Prom had already passed, and of course, I didn't attend, but I felt like I wouldn't be able to forgive myself if I didn't try to let my feelings be known to her. Problem was, I'd never be able to get myself to tell her straight up. So, I did one of the most cringiest things to do for a confession, I wrote a letter. I poured out all my feelings into it, I even got her a cute looking coin purse that looked like a soft, stuffed chick (I really like cute/cozy things, so when I found out she liked coffee shops, I fell even deeper) and pinned the letter to its little wing like it was holding it. I didn't exactly state who I was, pretty much just leaving my phone number as a ways to communicate if she was ever curious as to who sent it. I put the letter and chick into a gift bag, and I skipped our final assembly just so I could leave it hanging off of her cars mirror (doing it before any of my friends showed up of course, because they'd never let me live it down). We hung around in our cars watching movies as we normally did when we skipped class (something I both deeply regret, yet cherish in a way) until the school bell rang, and then I waited to see if she'd like it. I was only able to see her grab it and read the letter, but sadly wasn't able to see her final reaction due to my very drunk, very high friend wanting me to take him home. 

Graduation day came along, and after the ceremony and about an hour of peoples families taking photos, I saw her pass by me. I wanted to say something, ask her about the letter, but I couldn't bring myself to. I told myself to wait, maybe she'll try calling the number during the weekend, or when she's not busy. Months passed, and nothing happened. I was in my first semester of college, regularly attending the coffee shop most everyone in my high school went to, and as I was getting into my car, I saw her walking up the street with some friends. My heart raced, and I panicked, jumping into my car and putting my head down as I drank my drink, again, not knowing if I should say something or not, especially considering she was with people. I left, feeling down about how I wasn't able to do anything again. 

About a year and a half later, today actually, I was going through my instagram followers (an app I rarely use, because of course, left over self image issues) cleaning out whomever I knew, didn't know, or hadn't seen in a while, and as I was looking at a page of a mutual friend, I saw Cozy's name in her mentions. Immediately I get Vietnam flashbacks about the letter, and in a small fit of courage, I clicked follow on her page. About an hour later I get a notification saying she accepted my follow request, yet, she didn't follow me back. So, I'm at an impasse. I want to message her, asking about how she's been, whats she's been up to, how has she been holding up through this whole pandemic (the works) but I also want to bring up the letter, I just don't know how to start it. I really want to state my feelings directly and put them to rest, no matter if she does or doesn't accept them. How could I talk to her? I don't want to come off as some creep, but I also want to make sure to let her know that even if she doesn't accept my feelings, I still want to be friends. I'd really appreciate any help, thanks y'all.

TL;DR: How can I talk to a girl I had a crush on about my feelings for her, and how can I try to be friends with her if she doesn't accept them?",05Jun2020,1

373,"Hi Reddit, this situation popped up very quickly and is happening in about 12 hours, and I could REALLY use some thoughts from internet strangers!

So my best friend K lives across the country (United States,) but a bunch of my friends are going to spend this weekend with K's dad out at his cabin in the woods.  I mentioned this to K yesterday, and he had of course known about it, but it suddenly dawned on him that he could make the trip out. Flights are so cheap right now, etc. 

K asked me if I could pick him up from the airport and drive him back at the end of the weekend. It's about a 2 hour drive from the airport to the cabin. I told K that of course I could pick him up, it's not far out of my way, and he's my best friend so it would be a pleasure anyways. BUT, then I remembered about that whole COVID thing. The more I think about it, the more I \*really\* don't want someone sitting next to me in my car for 2 hours, especially after they just got off a plane. And this is probably me just being an asshole but he happens to have COPD and coughs pretty much always. 

SO: Do you think I would be too much of a paranoid jerk if I told him that I've decided I don't want to give him a ride? How would you feel if you were him? Would it be weird to say ""I don't want to give you a ride but since i'm a jerk here's some money towards a rental?"" I don't know, I'm lost here, what do you think??",05Jun2020,1

380,"So this has been a problem since forever but now that I'm getting older I desperately want to solve it because it will quickly ruin my relationships by causing misunderstandings.

 Whenever I get into an argument with someone face to face specifically my immediate family (Mom and dad)  or they confront me about something, I get tongued tied and can't explain myself. 

 I will have a whole argument and throughly explain my side of the situation to them in my hand and make what I feel like to be justifiable and valid points in my head but when it's time to say it to their face I say something stupid like ""I have an attitude because you all are annoying me about cleaning and I'm tired of this family.""
 Instead of ""I am upset because everytime I clean this kitchen you all immediately come in here and mess it up, but then yell at me for never cleaning, even though it's unfair to me because you all just lay around and do nothing."" 

That's just a basic example but this situation often causes me to look like an angry person whose a jerk for no reason. 

It's really confusing because mo matter how much I pep talk myself to explain myself throughly about why I am bothered by something it always ends in failure.

It's like I physically can not bring myself to say my side of the argument that I performed perfectly in my hand. 
I'll either say something that makes me look like a jerk or just say nevermind  to the entire situation and agree with them which puts me in a more difficult situation because my family is like ""You can't just get an attitude and mistreat your family and then say nevermind!""

I personally think it's because I fear opening myself up to people only to look stupid or be proven wrong, I guess I subconsciously would rather just do something stupid on purpose then to unintentionally look stupid. Maybe it's from the lack of confidence in myself. 

Its weird because I can communicate perfectly through text but it's probably because I don't have to look them in the eyes while doing it. 
I don't want to be labeled a coward but I dont understand why I can't get my thoughts together to make a point during an argument. I just get so much anxiety to the point that I don't even feel angry anymore I just want to be left alone.",05Jun2020,1

I’m trying to make it as an **Artist** which due to everything happening i feel like an idiot for even attempting that. It’s going to be near impossible to get into new colleges with this lie branding me as a horrible person, so I'm terrified of landing in a spot that forces me into mediocrity where I become a pity story for people to look down on me for.

393,"First time posting to Reddit and on mobile so bare with me.

Anyways I'm in a inner conflict and I don't really know what to do. I have had feelings for my best friend for a year now and I really want to get over him. To provide some backstory, he is the first (and probably only) guy Ill love, and this is because he is one of the few people who makes me generally happy and has been there for me during times where I struggled. I've dated girls before and there was only one who I felt similar feelings with, however this person I can confidently say that I have fallen in love with. It is something that took me a while to figure out, but throughout my last year of hs (class of 2020) I noticed that I have always put him before anyone else. I would want to spend as much time with him as I could, and there were some stuff that he would do that would literally make my heart jump. For example, how he says my name was one of them. 

Now, the reason why I want to get over him  and not have these feelings is because a long time before I even started to like him, I was friendzoned (a time period in which I acted flirty with a lot of people and of immaturity) and also because I don't want to ruin our friendship and think about the what ifs. For example I know this person is bi and they are crushing on someone, and I never want to make this person feel uncomfortable if I ever do tell them. I'm content with having them in my life in any shape or form (staying friends for example) but people of Reddit, how do you get over someone? (I don't really want to slowly put distance because covid has already cut the time I have had with all my friends).",05Jun2020,1

395,"I have a new neighbour subletting the attic apartment of the house I live in. For context on our layout:

I live in a very old and creaky house divided into units. I am on the second floor and the girl who rents the attic has been gone for all of quarantine, she finally found another girl to sublet her unit to. The layout is a bit weird, my room is at the back of the house and has a door to the back balcony, right beside the door to enter the attic. There is also a door separating her unit from my bedroom that is locked from both sides, because of this noise easily travels. 

I have not met the tenant (I will call P) in person. Her first day here she had people visiting her in and out of the unit all day which didn't bother me too much until night came and she had what sounded like 5 people in her VERY SMALL unit, drinking, yelling, stomping and taking smoke breaks outside my bedroom until around until 1 am (this was a monday). Obviously this wasn't a good first impression, my roommates were a lot angrier than me. The next day I slid a note under our shared door in which I welcomed her to the house and explained that last night was very disruptive, I also mentioned that I am a student studying from home and because of this peaceful home is a necessity. She seemed to received this well, she texted my number that I left on the note and apologized and said she would be more considerate in the future.  

Since then she has played her music quieter, closing doors quieter and softer foot steps. This makes me very hopeful. However, every single day she has friends over, who are loud and stomping and slamming doors, including the front door which is right beside my bedroom, causing my unit to shake.  I am working on getting my GED online and I am in a time crunch, also while dealing with my own learning disabilities %100 solo, this has made it incredibly challenging to concentrate. There isn't a single quiet spot in my home to work because the whole unit is shaking. It's currently 12:15 am and she has a few people over, although they are much quieter than before, it is still impossibly to work or sleep. Whispering doesn't accomplish much when its five people right outside my bedroom 

She seems very young, like this is probably her first time living solo. However this is not a private concrete unit, it is a very old creaky house and her social habits are affecting everyone in my unit. My roommate wants to take a more aggressive approach but I want to maintain a positive environment here. She has a right to have company over of course but I worried about how this is effecting my productivity. How would you recommend preceding? I also have the original tenant's contact info, however she hasn't been very receptive of noise complaints in the past.",05Jun2020,1

 So my brother was really tired and didn't want to do chores and told my parents he was going to sleep (after 2 days) while my mom was yelling at him to vacuum the house. He said that he was tired and he would do it later which resulted in my mom yelling at him more. And apparently things got escalated and it resulted in my dad going into his room and throwing his Laptop, Phone and ipad  off the stairs. The laptop was an old one and it broke immediately. (dad threw it really hard and against the wall) the phone survived with a cracked screen cover and the ipad i'm not sure. Then he slammed the ipad against the couch (shattered the screen cover more) and chucked his laptop out the door and onto the deck.  Phone landed near our other couch and was hidden so he didn't see it. I've never seen my dad this angry and it triggered an anxiety attack even though it didn't involve me my dads action were 70% of my triggers and when I go into an attack my immediate response is to  move past the situation and go onto another one.

401,"My life has for the most part just been a monumental fuck up. I was always an outcast in school. My dad told my sister and myself that our mom cheated on him when I was in grade 5 and that he was divorcing her. Things just got way worse from there. I became even more secluded and alienated at school. I was bullied so badly by everyone that I got to the point where I was close to slitting my wrists in grade 7. Came high school and I was still bullied but this time by my sister mainly. She's got a severe narcissistic personality and I'm a pretty sensitive and submissive person. For all of high school she used that to her advantage to manipulate and mentally abuse me constantly. Came grade 11, I was diagnosed with a severe anxiety disorder and depression and was put under high schedule medication. It was, and still is, absolute hell. I've tried to ween off of them multiple times but that never worked out as my disorders would just come back bigger than ever. Came grade 12, I got my driver's 1st try and my mom gave me her old VW polo. It was an absolute beauty and I miss it to this day. In the span of only 3 months did a taxi at an intersection t-bone me and my car was a write off. What made it worse was that my sister and mom blamed it on me completely making my anxiety almost unbearable and I actually had a panic attack a few days later. We got a rental car later but guess what? Only 2 weeks after my accident, A cyclist popped off the pavement as I was turning and I hit into him damaging the car and injuring the cyclist. Both costing my dad a lot of money and again, me being blamed for all of it even though those people weren't there. We got me a new polo vivo which was great until that car got stolen right in front of me when I was asked to park it outside of the gate for 30 minutes. 2 weeks later, I then parked my dad's car in an area that my friends insisted was safe. It was my fault this time and I shouldn't have listened to them but I did anyways cause I wasn't thinking properly at all with my anxiety being at an all time high. I was there for about 20 minutes, went outside and the car was gone. I lied to my dad telling him that I was held at gun point for the car cause I just didn't want my mom and sister blaming me again. It was unbearable because of the guilt I felt and the anxiety that followed.

During the same year. I was pursuing a drumming course as it's one of my passions but came the 4th term and I just couldn't handle it anymore. My instructor was picking on me, my performance was becoming exceptionally poor which added more stress and I couldn't practice at home anymore because of noise complaints from every neighbour. I ended up quitting before completing it which fucked me up big time mentally. I never felt like such a massive failure and it caused the relationship with my gf atm to be really shit for a full 6 months. I was such a mess and my mental illnesses and really negative thoughts was all directed at her. She still stayed and I finally started to get better. This was when the tables turned and she became how I was. I unfortunately couldn't do what she did- stick it out. I was unable to deal with the hell I went through again. So I ended it.

She then found a new bf 2 weeks after we broke up who was doing the same university course as us. I had to see them day in and day out during university.

I also only realised well into my 2nd year that the course I was pursuing was not for me. I'm not in my 4th year of IT still doing undergrad studies and it has made my entire life a misery.

What made things worse was in my 3rd year, I went to Australia in the hopes of having a great time, getting a psrt time job and coming back home with money and getting away from my sister for a while. 

I was unable to find a job, things were just falling apart around me, I developed heavy knee problems and had to come back home 6 months earlier to when I was supposed to leave. When I came back things just got worse.

I needed to get new meds and that atarted a long line of different drug cocktails tjroughout the year. Each one just not working. I ended up in a clinic and end up there again only after a month. I was umable to enjoy my end of year holiday with friends cause my depression and anxiety was so high and alcohol and weed just amplifies it so I couldn't even enjoy those things anymore.

Came this year, I got my knees operates on- athroscopy. Aftwr the op, my right knee was severely swollen and less than a week later I had to go back to get them reoperated on. This time it was even worse. My knee was so inflammed and in pain that not even morphine could help. It's been 6 months of endless visits and physio and my knees still aren't okay. To add on top of it I've had to have 3 root canals and my teeth still hurt after that, I have hemerroids that won't go away and I can't afford surgery, my mental health is at an all time low and I can't do another drug cocktail mainly because my psych is on holiday and can't see me.

All of it is just a mess. I'm physically and mentally decaying more and more every single day and I'm only 24 years old. I've actually been planning on committing suicide cause this life just doesn't seem worth it anymore yet I'm looking for anything to not do so cause I'm afraid of dying and not knowing what happens afterwards.",05Jun2020,1

403,"Context.

A friend of mine recently paid a gardener to do some stuff for her. Put up a new fence, sort out patio etc etc.

Don't know too much but the said gardener has mental health issues. My friend's job involve helping out people in need so maybe she networked him through that? I dunno.

Anyways,

He asked for £200 for the job. And then things went downhill.

He turns up when it suits him, did stuff she didn't ask for and he turns up with a fence that she didn't want. His response was ""if you don't like it, tough.""

Work was left half done and when she enquired about it, he said he can't see what's the issue. As far as he's concerned it's a job well done.

Oh and the job has gone up to £350. The ground was harder than he originally thought. (I don't know my consumer rights, but is an agreed upon price kinda like a contract?)

The twist.

Apparently my friend heard him talking to his therapist out in the garden. He said he was feeling suicidal. Apparently they were talking over the loud speaker.

So now the quandary, she feels like she has no choice but to pay him £350 just in case he does something and it'll be her fault.

My advice was that to pay the original £200 as agreed. Personally I wouldn't pay him because he hasn't done the job asked of him. BUT my friend is very empathetic. I know that if he did do something, she'd blame herself. I don't think that sort of burden is worth the cost of £350.

I personally think he's punking her. I don't think people would openly talk to their therapist on loud speaker in public. And if I feel someone was trying it on with me, I would detach myself emotionally. I would believe his actions are his own.


Tl;dr I think my friend paid a cowboy builder to do a shit job and he's overcharging her and using mental health as a weapon to emotionally blackmail her.",05Jun2020,1

405,"A bit of context, I was homeless for three months. I got drunk a total about maybe 6-7 times during those 3 months, my friends would pick me up every night to ride around and share a blunt. I went to a psychiatric hospital after an attempted suicide (I started taking pills, but then stopped when I realized what I was doing. I called 911, started throwing up a little bit after they came and went to the ER. Then they took me to a psychiatric hospital from there.) I tried telling the doctor I wanted treatment for mental health, NOT substance abuse. After about 15 days, they found me a place. The doctor told me it was for mental health, but it wasn't.

I had an interview with them and found out it was for substance abuse. I sort of exaggerated during the interview and said i smoked several grams a day every day, and got shitfaced drunk every day too. I was so desperate to get off the streets, and I was scared if I denied this place that took him 3 weeks to find, that I would reach the 30 day mark and get sent to the state hospital (requirements for being admitted to the state hospital in my state is if 30 days of inpatient treatment are not effective out in the community, then an individual may be sent to the state hospital for a minimum of 6 months). I just wanted to get off the streets, I was tired of freezing my ass off no matter how many blankets I slept with on me. I was tired of eating out of trash cans. I was tired of living in fear that i would be hurt on the streets (i got robbed at knifepoint once, and kicked in the face repeatedly over money that a guy lost when he was drunk) I wanted to get the help i needed to be better mentally, and this seemed like my only option.

I went to this place and continued the lie. I regularly go to groups with guys who were hardcore alcoholics and fentanyl addicts. The counselor has admitted he thinks my problem is more of a mental health issue than substance. I feel like shit because of this. A lot of people look up to me because of the improvement i've made since i've been here, but none of them know i'm not really an addict. I have no urges to drink. I have the occasional urge to smoke weed, but its not like a serious craving, and I don't want to smoke weed right now because I know I need to work on my mental health.

I feel like a fraud and a piece of shit, like i'm lying to these people and deceiving them. None of them know truly what my ""addiction"" was like. Theres people that need this bed more than me. I've been considering leaving but the only reason I haven't is I still receive government assistance from being in foster care, and I would lose it if i suddenly upped and left to a different county.

I dont know when this issue began, but he has developed a drinking issue. Bars are not open and he gets hungover 2 or 3 times a week at least, in his dorm. This doesn’t include drinking without getting drunk and/or hungover.

It is also, as far as I know, not his behavior to hook up with people. He did so anyways when he was drunk. Not sure on the story about that though.

Due to a small medical issue, the doctor has asked him not to drink for a couple of days. He actually told me he’s just going to go back to drinking when the days are up.

Back in early this year, he ended his relationship with his girlfriend back home. They are still talking to her. She studies clinical psychology and actually says that my friend has signs of alcoholism. Though I dont know if his alcohol issue began before or after the breakup.

He has told me a few days ago, that he has started going for counseling at the uni because lately hes been having more lows than highs in a week. He has agreed to talk to me soon about his issues also.

My friend here is a great guy and great friend. But his alcoholism and behavior seems to be spiraling downwards and I can’t help but worry. Is there anything I can do to help him without being overbearing? And when we talk eventually, is there anything I can say or ask him that’ll maybe help him a little bit?

In 2018-2019 I got into the best shape of my life. But a shoulder injury to both of my shoulders ruined it and I was forced to take a step back in my workouts. I did physiotherapy for 3 months but didn't do surgery because the doc didn't recommend me getting it. 

Obviously, I had to do less, focus on rehabilitation. As such, I gradually got weaker.

Now I feel like a shadow of my former self. Not just physically, but my mental attitude is lacking. I no longer feel that big amount of drive to keep getting stronger, because now I always feel that I have to work 'within my limits' - making myself self limiting in many ways too.

Now I'm constantly being outdone by others, and I feel that I no longer live up to my name of being one of the most athletic, strong and young at heart people there is.

With this injury, I don't feel young anymore because my body doesn't respond to my will as it used to.

I am shocked that I am overly competitive, since I realised that I hate getting outdone by others. I feel like I've lost an edge over others. I feel like I have lost that drive to pursue my fitness goals.

I entered a relationship with a girl I really liked. We were together for 10 months, but near the end, I just wasn't happy with her, so I broke up with her.

The problem is, she is friends with all of my friends. She was very mad when I broke things off and accused me of many things and called me many names in the group chats we were in.

I kept my cool to move on, but some of my friends (who are all dudes) have decided they want to talk to her over me online. These were friends I considered very close to me, and it hurt me for a long time in all honesty.

But, it's their decision. it's whatever makes her happy.

But I am constantly reminded of her presence, and it makes it so hard for me to move on from her fully. I see her in our group chats, her talk to my friends, all of that sort. It makes me anxious thinking about her talking to all of my personal friends about all of the personal things I've told her.

Recently, she told me she wants to leave her partner ('Ben' M27) of 7 years, but can't because:

1. Ben is her first - fear of being alone;
2. feels like used goods - she thinks others will see her as undesirable;
3. Purchased a house with him 3 years ago - not married, but parents helped with mortgage. She feels pressured to stay.
4. there have been talks of marriage;
5.  share the same friend group, all met through uni/college;
6. parents like him as he is from a similar affluent background to her, private schooled, wealthy family, etc.

Ben is emotionally and verbally abusive. I've told her this from the very beginning of their relationship. Ben is a lawyer, and makes it known to everyone he meets. He is very harsh with his words. He also makes good money - they both do but he's just emotionally and verbally battered her. Not too sure about physical abuse - however she has told me he is quite violent during sex. A couple years into their relationship she was coerced into getting an abortion. During this relationship, I've seen Julia develop depression and anxiety. She's recently told me she's bisexual - she had developed feelings for a female co-worker but left it as that - she did not act on it. But apparently, this co-worker was the kindest soul she had met, and without knowing made her life a bit better and brighter. One a side note this co-worker was opposite to Ben - female for starters, but v humble and kind, soft-spoken, from a blue-collar family who was saving up for university/college. Nothing came of this, ever, as they both left the company.

I graduated at the end of last year with plans to work at an internship or as a casual/part-time and then go travelling for the second half of the year, unfortunately, my plans have gone to shits. I started interning full time at place x (non-private firm) since the start of the year which I really enjoy and is a pretty decent job and pays pretty much the same (maybe 4k less annually) as if I had taken a grad job. However my parents especially my dad wants to find a job in the private sector and doesn’t really like where I currently work. The issue is I strongly detest working at the places he wants me to apply for and I am still unsure what I want to do. I have a dream job which isn’t feasible for me right now but could be something I can be applying for in a few years time. 

My original plan was to work at place x until the end of the year and apply for a position above graduate level given I’ve already had the year experience interning and I’ve had experience working part-time for a year in this field while I was in uni. I wasn't going to apply for the graduate program at place x because it's basically what I doing now but my directors and supervisor really wanted me to. A month ago, I applied for a graduate position at place x as a back-up and was rejected which was a bit of a surprise for me since I thought I did pretty decent in both interviews but I didn’t put in an actual application and was offered the interviews verbally which may have had an impact on the result. At the end of the day, it’s a bit annoying but not the end of the world and I probably didn’t do as well as I thought.  My internship which was only supposed to be 3 months has been extended to 10 months so I know I’m doing a decent job. Additionally, if I am unable to find a job by the time my current internship ends, my previous job has my old position waiting for me which was a casual position (exact same pay as current internship with casual bonus) and only 3/4 days a week but it was still a pretty decent job I enjoyed and I could possibly ask for them to turn it into a full-time graduate position. 

For the past 2 weeks, my dad won’t shut up about me finding a full-time job now and keeps going on about how I don’t have a real job and saying I should’ve started working full time in an ongoing position since January (to be honest he's always been on my back about this but the past 2 weeks this has been the only thing he talks about). He keeps on going about how I wasted my life and I need to find a job asap in the private sector because they don’t want me (graduate position) at place x and when I say I don’t like working at those places he keeps going on about life isn’t always about what makes me happy. On top of this, he always mocks and makes snide jokes about my dream job and the other week he said that it was basically impossible and compared me working there to me marrying a British prince. He constantly makes snide comments about all of this and how I won't do well in the future and won't make enough money to send my kids to private school or give them what they want (yea I have no idea why this future kids thing is such a big deal for him) and compares me to everyone we know which is really getting my last nerves. If I was a dropkick and doing nothing with my life I would totally understand, but I worked part-time all throughout uni and paid all my uni fees straight up, as well as doing extra-circulars and other internships during uni so whilst I don’t have my life sorted 100% right now I think I am on the right-ish path and I know I’ll be okay. 

I know he means well but at the end of the day it makes me really frustrated and pissed off to hear him go on about it 24/7. My parents sacrificed a lot to give me a good childhood and opportunities so I understand how they're very invested in me starting my post-grad life and making money. I still live at home and I can’t really move out with everything that’s going on. I am putting off applying for anything right now because my contract has been extended until later this year and I don’t want to leave until I finish the internship especially when they went out of their way to extend it for me. I don’t pay rent or any bills but I transfer basically 70% of my pay as a ‘loan’ to my parents so they can put it against the mortgage/credit cards but the money is mine if I need it someday. I don't really know what to do with him and I can't reason with him because he won't listen to anything I say and always goes on about he knows best and he's been alive for 30 years more than me and how I don't know anything about how the real world works.",05Jun2020,1

423,"So an old friend of mine that I've know for years told me back in January that we have nothing in common anymore and that she didn't want to spend as much time around me. She wanted to make new friends and I just wasn't good enough for her I guess? She explained that she wanted someone to be close with that was in the same grade as her (she's a junior and I'm a sophomore) so that she could relate to them better.

Her and I were practically siblings though like I used to go to her house all the time, I called her mom ""Mom"" and I even had my own blankets and stuff at her place. And not only that I was basically a (very unqualified) therapist for her because she refused to talk to her actual therapist and only wanted to rant to me at 2am. 

But that ended up being a double edged sword because while it was nice to know she trusted me more than anyone else it was mentally exhausting for me as well considering the fact that I'm NOT A QUALIFIED THERAPIST IM LITERALLY JUST A KID IN HIGH SCHOOL. Seriously she had a lot of very serious issues such as depression, anxiety, PTSD, insomnia, ect. that I was not prepared and educated enough to help her with. So I just used to stay up all night with her most of the time fearing what would happen if I left her alone.

But yeah she eventually broke up with me. But in a friendship way?? If that makes any sense. 

Now she's texted me after I've finally accepted that we weren't going to be friends again and moved on. She wants to try being friends again because apparently she didn't actually mean what she said even when she restated it for me 3 different times over the course of 4 months. In her 3 paragraph text she said that she never knew how much she really relied on me and that she missed me and the fun we used to have together. 

WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO NOW??? I will admit in the beginning I really missed her especially since she was one of my only 3 friends I had. But now I'm hanging out with more poeple and honestly my mental health has improved as well. I don't really want to go back anymore. But I want what's best for her too because she used to tell me that our conversations were what kept her alive for a while. I never really wanted much else other than to make her happy again.

Please please please help me I have no clue what I should do!! Any advice at all would be super helpful and if you have any questions I'd be more than happy to answer them! Thank you so much and have a great day/night!",05Jun2020,1
424,"I am a female, to start. My entire life i’ve had a very low low sex drive for the average person. I’ve engaged in some contact with people to that degree, but it didn’t really do anything for me. Still a virgin, too, and don’t plan on changing that. It is just that these acts make me feel bad. 

On the rare occasion that i do feel sexual arousal, i either act on it or repress it because i hate how i feel after when i act on it.

428,"Hi,

  
I started a new job in an executive position working from home, as at present in the UK we're still in a phase of lockdown. My manager also started working from home a month after I, and ever since they started, they've made it seem like I am incompetent.

&amp;#x200B;

* I'm often left waiting for them to get back to me to sign work off - because of this, I missed a deadline by three days with another department, they sent messages one word at a time, which I read as being quite patronising, and it's just really difficult to get a response from them at other times. 
* If I try to call, they don't answer, and then they immediately set their status to busy, and send me a message a few hours later, which in my opinion, isn't good enough.

I don't think I'm being too needy; I get on with work independently, and it's just the sign off I need or the permission to execute my plans so I can get on my way, but I can't do that because of the lack of communication.

Does anyone have any advice on what to do?",05Jun2020,1
429,"**Background.** I am a university student and I have moved back in with my parents because of COVID-19 and I have been spending more time within the presence of my parents and I have noticed a decline in my dad's intellect. 

**Example 1.** On one occasion, it was midnight and I was walking from the kitchen back to my room and I heard my Dad walking towards my direction. It being dark, I hid behind the wall and jumped out at the last second, scaring him. He jumped back and let out a gasp but he seemed to have reacted somewhat slowly. He said ""You got me."" I said ""Yeah."" Him: ""How did you know I was coming this way?"" Me: ""I heard you come in through the door."" Him: ""So you heard me and you decided to jump out?"" Me: ""Yes."" Him: ""So you heard me and you decided to jump out?"" Me: ""Yes, I heard you from the door."" Him: ""Well you totally got me."" This is a rough recollection of what happened and might not be very useful. The point is that it took him ten seconds to understand the situation. 

**Example 2.** On another occasion, he brought in a package for me. He started reading the mailing address from which it was sent. He did not just say the street name. He read the address completely. I do not even know if he realized that that was the address as he read it.

My mom has also told me that my Dad is having a hard time remembering things and I have noticed this as well. A few weeks ago, he helped me create a LinkedIn profile. Just a few days ago, he asked me if I had a LinkedIn. He totally forgot having helped create it.

This worries me intensely. My dad works as a businessman and he seems to be getting slow in his intellect. I am worried that this may turn out to be Dementia and I don't know how someone with Dementia can hold a job which requires constant communication. I am fearful that my Dad will no longer be able to work and will require assistance from social workers.

**Question**. What should I do? My mom told me that I should take my dad out to exercise. If his memory seems to be decaying, how much can really be done to prevent it from getting worse? My mom tells my dad to take prevagen whenever it shows up in the commercials and he denies that he needs it. Based on the conditions that I've described, what do you guys think?

I'm awful at empathy and I  speak very bluntly. I am planning on asking my sister, who has knowledge on biology, to speak with him.

I study philosophy myself as a hobby. How do I tell my Dad that he needs to start reading in order to help his brain? Can reading philosophy really do much at this point? How much can exercise do?

431,"I recently dated my co worker for a few months and we broke up about a month ago. In my opinion we didn’t really “date “ it was more like we fucked a lot and did relationship things but we weren’t in a relationship. Anyways we ended things in the first place because he was really depressed and needed space and wasn’t ready for a relationship. Ever since we ended things he would text me every single week to start an argument. It would be over something stupid like once he accused me of flirting with our co worker in front of him (I really didn’t ) or if he heard something I said that he didn’t like or if I “treated him differently “ at work. And ofc I would text back. We keep blocking and unblocking each other. It’s like we can’t let each other go. Every argument he starts it also starts with “I’m quitting and blocking you”. And when I argue back he gets defensive and brings up something he’s going through. It’s not all him ofc, 99 percent of the time he texts me first . I do text him time to time when I need a friend because of my depression or when my mom kicked me out I went to him with that, and recently I texted him I missed him as a friend. But this past Tuesday he texted me a whole paragraph about how we can’t stay friends and how he’s quitting and he just can’t talk to me even tho he cares about me and that he’s blocking me and that he over heard a conversation I didn’t “want him to hear “ . I spoke to him about it and said we’re both toxic for each other and that I wasn’t having a conversation at WORK that I wouldn’t want him to hear but he said that he heard I moved on and fucked another guy (in no time did I say this ) and when I told him I’m letting him go he mentioned his grandpa is dying and started venting about that. I feel like I need to be here for him. But every time I try to be here for him he pushes me away but then he always comes back to make sure I’m still here . My co workers think that I’m obsessed with him because I can’t let go but he doesn’t let me go either.Seeing everything that’s happening to him is breaking my heart but idk what to do.

They were to say the least objectively not that good looking but I didn’t care I fell for their personality and charm who they were.

They rejected me.

I’ve never been rejected and never felt that way about anyone before in my life! I mean this, so the rejection literally broke me. Since then I don’t feel sad but I’d like to stop thinking about them constantly everyday every hour it’s insane!

I’ve tried everything I’ve picked up several hobbies got a job tried getting into shape, exercising, doing tasks around the house, tried mindfulness activities, talking to new people. But through it all I’ve thought about them through all the activities and through all the motions.

It hurts me a lot that they’ve rejected me and I can’t contact them again that’s not a choice because I’ve removed them, so I can’t get closure and I know that they just don’t like me at all theres nothing new there.

Then she outright tells me that we can't talk anymore, and she ghosts me. She than came out a lesbian.

439,"We are both students, 25 and 23M studying abroad in a different country than ours. He’s destined to go back home in a few months time.

I dont know when this issue began, but he has developed a drinking issue. Bars are not open and he gets hungover 2 or 3 times a week at least, in his dorm. This doesn’t include drinking without getting drunk and/or hungover.

It is also, as far as I know, not his behavior to hook up with people. He did so anyways when he was drunk. Not sure on the story about that though.

Due to a small medical issue, the doctor has asked him not to drink for a couple of days. He actually told me he’s just going to go back to drinking when the days are up.

Back in early this year, he ended his relationship with his girlfriend back home. They are still talking to her. She studies clinical psychology and actually says that my friend has signs of alcoholism. Though I dont know if his alcohol issue began before or after the breakup.

He has told me a few days ago, that he has started going for counseling at the uni because lately hes been having more lows than highs in a week. He has agreed to talk to me soon about his issues also.

My friend here is a great guy and great friend. But his alcoholism and behavior seems to be spiraling downwards and I can’t help but worry.

440,"TLDR: 2 of my relatives are leeches on my parents house and they have been for around 4 years. I would like guidance on how to go about kicking them out.

Over the past 5 years I have lived with my parents and grandparents but I have since moved away due to completing uni. One close relative has lived with us on and off due to circumstances like he’s had bad luck with jobs or under the excuse of wanting to spend more time with us (relative A) (40+ M). Recently another family member has moved countries and is trying to find his feet here (relative B) (45+ M). The problem is relative A, while I’m giving him the benefit of the doubt, he does nothing but play video games, eat all our food, smoke weed and is a general waste of space. Once maybe every month he will cook dinner for us but this is after he’s rinsed my parents dry of money because he “has things he needs to pay off”. He has no bills at this house, they don’t ask for rent, he smokes weed constantly so we’re sure that’s where 95% of the money they give him goes and whenever we ask him about moving out or anything of the sort it turns into a shouting match and no one wins because he just goes back in his room to play more video games. We have recently had large renovations on our house and neither relatives have made the slightest effort to help out, there’s construction, painting, even moving boxes that they could lend a hand to but they decide that whatever they’re doing is much more productive, when it plainly is not. We have more faith in relative B to get back on his feet when the pandemic is over but still, he’s making plans implying he’ll be staying with us for another 3 or 4 years. My mother loves them both very dearly and she sees that they aren’t pulling their fair share but even when relative A gets a breakthrough with his jobs, all he does is go to different countries without telling us and travels, none of it goes to repaying my mom (he owes her in excess of $20,000) or helping out in any way. My moms plan was that I’d always have a room at the house, no matter what but since they’re unwilling to leave or aid themselves in any way (their friends are all sick of them and won’t let them stay with them).

449,"I (18F) have an amazing (18M) boyfriend that means the world to me and we have always communicated how we’re feeling, thinking, etc. But there’s been something on my mind and I don’t know whether I should tell him given the fact that it was months ago. 

During our senior year, we had a school trip that included my best friend, boyfriend, and his ex girlfriend that my friend hated. Now I never want to be the jealous girlfriend since they had dated in sophomore year and I know that my boyfriend loves me. Somehow, I got a room with my friend, another girl, and the ex who we’ll name Sam. 

I didn’t want to deal with any drama so I made sure that my friend and her made up which they eventually did and are friends today. I think Sam is a very very friendly girl and an amazing person. 

However, after we got back from an activity, Sam groaned and said “Ugh, I kept seeing my ex boyfriend stare at me when I was in my bathing suit, it was super creepy.” This destroyed my self esteem but I didn’t want to start a fight so I went to the bathroom and started sobbing. I was completely distraught and it eventually got to the point of Sam hearing me cry and asked me what was wrong. I explained to her why I was upset and she got this “oh shit” face and immediately apologized. 

I said it was fine and said how I didn’t want to be nasty since she didn’t know we were dating. She apologized again and called herself a piece of shit before asking me to not tell him what she said. I said I would and thought it would be done with it but today my boyfriend was going through his old things and found a little box that Sam had gifted him when they were still dating and it made me remember all of it. I didn’t say anything but it made me a little uncomfortable but I didn’t want to ruin his birthday.

He’s a very sweet and understanding guy and Sam is a wonderful girl but I’m afraid telling him this will hurt their small friendship. I also don’t know if Sam was maybe lying but it’s made me self conscious of my body, especially when I’m in a bathing suit.

453,I’m a Junior trying to get through high school as best as i can. i’m trying my best to endure everything to be able to get through all of this. but i just can’t. my mental health has got more messed up during this academic year. the people around me at school are horrific. my parents always argue and i have no one to reach out to. and whenever i try to reach out to one of my friends they ignore me. i’m very stressed and i don’t really know what to do to be less stressed about school. and i don’t know how to stop my parents from arguing either. whenever they argue it makes me so frustrated and my mood is down instantly. i really need some advice on how to cop with these stuff right now especially that i’m in quarantine with my parents at home 24/7. and i also want to know how to cop with the toxic people around me at school. thank you and i’m sorry for making this a long post,05Jun2020,1
455,"M20, in college. I had a great internship this summer but it was cancelled. Now I'm back at home and debating whether or not to go back to work at the factory I've worked at for the last two summers.

It's pretty good money but it's really difficult work and I wasn't planning on going back so I don't really want to. But my parents are starting to breathe down my neck for not doing anything, but they aren't forcing me to get a job (mostly due to covid-19). Money-wise I'm alright, I have quite a bit in savings so I don't need the cash but it would certainly help me with not needing as many student loans.

The next problem is that in the factory I really liked working in one department (janitorial) because it was easy, but I hated working in manufacturing. So there's a chance I get manufacturing again and it gave a real mental and physical toll and I don't want to go through it again. If I get janitorial I think I'll be fine but I don't think I can find out what department I get before I'm hired and that would be taking a risk.

I'm also still concerned about Covid-19 because my state opened up too early a few weeks ago and still we still have a lot of cases (we've been getting like a dozen a day).

My other plan was I was going to spend the summer on hobbies, like I wanted to pick up writing and learning the guitar, but I haven't had the motivation. In the last three weeks I've barely touched the guitar and

In the first instance, I met this girl at a library and struck up a conversation with me and exhibited all the signs of interest: smiling, maintaining conversation, head tilt, playing with hair. She honestly didn't have a cell phone so she gave me her school email. When I tried to strike up a conversation with her she just told me she doesn't want to talk to me.


Another girl I met and struck up a convo with exhibited the same cues: smiling, playing with hair, interest, and she gave me her snapchat when I asked if she has any social media. When I tried messaging her over snapchat she just blocked me.

All these experiences have fucked up my self-esteem even worse. I've always struggled with insecurities about my appearence and I'm interpreting these events as basically confirmation that I'm ugly and that no woman will want me. When I try to be confident and outgoing I ultimately get fucked over. Post-covid I don't even plan on getting a date.

459,"Hi.
I work at a social media agency, and of late i know for a fact my time spent on social media is becoming unhealthy and toxic for me.
I have tried various things to limit my time-
Making a separate work account.
Using only instagram web.
Using apps which block you from opening social media at specific times.

However, since i'm using it all day for work, i inevitably just end up checking my own account, or using the work account to look at memes etc. I also feel like i'm missing out on opportunities to talk to new people since instagram is primarily how that happens these days (been 4 months of lockdown in my country).
I also need to remain abreast with trends and current topics on social media so I do need to check in and see whats happening. But before I know it i've just wasted hours. 

I just don't know how I can continue to do my job well while my mental health suffers. Any advice would be helpful, thank you.",05Jun2020,1

462,"tldr; last 3 months i've been unhappy with my boyfriend. we've had quite a few arguments and petty spats, my friends think we should break up bc they think he's toxic, questioning my feelings for him and having trouble letting go if breaking up is what i should do

sorry that i wrote so much! this is actually shorter than what i originally wrote. anyway i'm 17F about to be 18 in 9 days actually lol but anyway, whats bothering me the most right now is my relationship with my 18M boyfriend. these last 3 months since we started quarantine have been awful. that first week of march was the last time i saw my boyfriend (until 3 days ago) these last 3 months our conversations have been so dry and boring. i guess it's quarantine but even before it was getting like that.  (also i have terrible memory and can't remember everything in detail so i'll try to give the gist of it) for context, my birthday in the next week and a half makes our relationship 8 months long

to continue though, i have dealt with body insecurity for about 7 years now. i've grown a lot and improved a lot but i still go through periods where it's like i have absolutely no confidence. i got into one of those periods around the same time quarantine started. i was having a real low point with my confidence and of course turned to my boyfriend for comfort. this turned into an argument and he twisted my words and flipped it back on me. i conceded at the end of this argument because nothing i said really got through 

the next argument is the worst one we've had in my opinion. i hated every part of it. what he said, what i said, how he made me feel, how i gave up at the end, how i still feel resentful about it. basically one of my (formerly my boyfriend's best friend) friends is a photographer. he did a shoot with a girl who does onlyfans. this made my already diminished self esteem become even lower. especially when i saw he was following her. now, i wouldn't have a problem if she was just a regular girl, but it made me uncomfortable because i was to assume her private account just held half naked pictures of her on there. that was a boundary i tried to set. i personally didn't see a point in following her since that's all she posted. i brought it up to him just calmly asking if he could unfollow her since i was uncomfortable with it and wanted to set that boundary. he went OFF. he got so pissed saying he doesn't wanna deal with this stupid shit (i told my friend he said that and he told me it sounded like he was calling my feelings stupid shit) and said he saw it as controlling. he told me if i couldnt handle my feelings to the point where it doesn't kill me for who he follows then i should find someone else. he said he would unfollow her and he actually did at least. i ended up conceding this argument too. i told him i didn't have a good reason for why i singled her out (he follows pornhub or whatever) and that i would work to improve my self esteem and i didn't want us to break up over something stupid. and i told him i love him. as i type this right now, i still feel that resent and pain. the way he talked to me was awful and my friends think he disrespected me 

i felt alright after for about a day after the argument ended until i fell into a deep depression (i've struggled with depression for 2 years now) for about 3 weeks. it was because of him and what happened. there were a few petty things after that where he upset me and a few arguments where i brought up his temper when we begin to discuss things because it makes me feel awful and afraid to tell him my feelings. he said he doesn't get pissed off when i tell him my feelings, just when i don't talk to him about it sooner and let it manifest. but it doesn't feel like that's it. in our few last arguments i almost broke up with him but instead i tried to talk things out and make it work. i've been doing that for 3 months and i've been unhappy for 3 months. in one of the last ones i worked out all of my overthinking (it plagues me unfortunately) and my mindset improved and i was actually happy but it keeps going back and forth between being unhappy and happy. most of the time it's unhappy. i've had my best friend tell me to break up with him, 3 other friends, plus his ex best friend (photographer) they think he's toxic and that id be better off without him. sometimes i wonder but i'm afraid to be without him. i grew such an attachment to him. but i've also never cried over someone so much and felt so much pain before. i question if i still love him or at least if i should just let go 

before i made the final decision on breaking up with him i wanted to see him again to see if maybe it was quarantine adding to this stress. i saw him and we barely talked for the 4 hours i was there. i felt a bit weird being there with him and just sat there thinking for a while while he went on his phone and computer. we ended up having sex because he initiated it. i felt even weirder afterwards and then he took me home. i have felt weird since that day. it's like i feel that i should break up with him but that one part of me wants to fix everything and stay connected to him. should i finally break it off?",05Jun2020,1

464," Hello I'm a 18 year old male just about to be out of high school. So some background on me i come from a Ukrainian house hold me being an immigrant from Ukraine now living in Canada. So my household has always been strict on working hard to get what you want. But recently i've just lost all motivation to do almost anything, and when I say anything I mean anything. like in all my grades up to grade 10 i used to be a 90% + student and like i didn't really have to work that hard for that grade. Now don't get me wrong i was by no means a fucking genius but i would say i was somewhat smarter mostly due to the fact that i used to do extra homework at home that my parents would give me so i was usual a bit a head of the class in things like math and science. But recently i just lost all motivation to try at all. Like i would not be able to focus on doing homework outside of school and when shit was assigned i would almost never do it but i just would not know why. It was like a twitch has been flipped in my head kinda saying ""ahhh you don't need to do this, fuck it"" so i would end up just never doing it. Even though i knew i needed to do it and like it's not that is was hard most of the shit was very easy and i knew it would take me 30 min max to do it and i would get a good grade on it but i just would never do it. But the stuff I did hand in I would always get around 85-95% on it with minimal effort on my part. and that's where it kinda started, once i stopped doing good in school my mental health just declined and no matter how hard i would try and fix my mark i just couldn't find the motivation to do it. Basically after that I would start to fall into deep sets of depression. Where for 3 weeks i would be fairly fine and then something would just flip and i would go for 3 weeks just not caring about my life at all to the point of just shutting myself out from all my friends and family and just kinda idling through those 3 weeks not caring about my life and just thinking these thoughts of how good life would be without all this stress in my life. And i had a lot of stress in my life i almost never argued with my parents but once this shit started happening i argued with my parents almost weekly and like my parent were not even that bad i would say they were fairly normal parents but this arguing with them would just pill on a lot of stress, school would make me stress even when i barely did anything in it, my friends were the people that wouldn't stress me out but after a while being with friends just stopped helping when i realized that most of the people i hung out with weren't my real friends they were just people that i talked to and that's it. Now during this whole quarantine I did find the real people that i can call friends and they are loving people that i care about and they care about me. But i just was never a person that could talk about my feeling to other people face to face so i would keep everything in and just never let it out. which that could be a big reason for the bid spikes of depression i am having. So because of these spikes of depression I would just stop taking care of myself. Like i would still shower and do all the normal shit but the state of my room would get worse and worse with each passing day and at the end of these spikes of depression i would clean my room top to bottom as to like show that im back into a normal state of mind i guess. But I'm here to ask if all this that's happening to me is just like a phase of still being a teenager and that it's normal or is there something that I need to change and if there's a way of getting my motivation back to do stuff again? If you need clarifications on stuff just ask I'm a fairly open book. I'll be really happy to hear what advice people have for me and thanks for reading this even if you don't end up writing a comment. Sorry if this just sounds like a big rant that makes no sense.

465,Im currently living with my boyfriend that I've been with for the last 4 years and for a long time now ive been thinking whether or not it's a good idea that i should leave and start a new life in a different state with a couple of my closest friends and begin my career. I'm having a hard time deciding because even though I love him so much and it's hard to imagine life without him I can't shake the feeling that leaving would finally get my life going on something different for the first time in a while. I can chose to be with him and continue living in a long lasting relationship  or be on my own. The reason it's been hard making up my mind is that after talking to him about this he brought a lot of memories and a lot of the things we promised to do but never did and it's been heartbreaking thinking about leaving because I too want to make all those memories with him but at this point I'm wondering if I'm just sticking around because of all the things he's been saying and that's why I can't decide whether or not I should go.,05Jun2020,1

I'm an aeronautical engineering student. In march I started my final year internship and it was a perfect fit for what I intended to do with my career.

My boyfriend has OCD and has intrusive thoughts about various themes, one such theme is the fear that he will turn into a pedo/is one and just doesn't know it. The rest of his themes never bothered me, I just accepted they were OCD, but I just can't get over this. I question him almost every day about it. I relentlessly ask him rapid fire questions to see if he will reveal he is a pedo without realising it. Other than the intrusive thoughts, I have literally no reason to suspect anything, he has spoken out about his boss creeping on 18-21 year olds, his friend for saying something creepy about wishing a 15 year old ""could be just a few years older"", is the kind of person that can't watch documentaries on pedos cos they are too sad/distressing, he finds women calling their man ""daddy"" gross, he let's me use his phone, laptop, social media whenever, I know his passwords,  I could go on.

He was being a little too nice and he started to compliment me, saying that i was really pretty and so on. Then things started to get sexual and I knew it was wrong but I went along with it. I had a sexual relationship with him for years. When i went off to college I completely forgot about him but then around my second year at college I remembered and started feeling really guilty. I am completely ashamed of what I did but I cant help to think that this is my fault. My boyfriend says that I should report him but I feel like its not right since I was aware of what was going on. I would really appreciate any advice.",05Jun2020,1
487,"Since my childhood my parents have been fighting (not in a mature way) by screaming each others lungs out and there has been scenarios that got more than out of hand. Today they still fight and I'm almost 20 and still cry when they fight. Is it some kind of trauma or is that normal?

489,"I've fucked up real big this time. 

Short story: our university used some real weird program to monitor our webcams and computer during the online exams for covid19. My family is getting ruined day by day as time passes for this covid, we are losing almost all the money we have (i'm not even sure we'll be able to afford my fees next year, which aren't even that high or anything) and i can hear the voice of my parents getting darker and less optimistic with very little I can do. 

The only thing that always gave them a little hope was that i was in a good study field and that my grades and skills were really good and getting better the more i studied. They never asked help from me because they wanted me to just study and focus on my future, not their present. I of course took this extremely seriously and dedicated myself fully this semester even if the organisation and systems were harder to manage and very confusing for many people including the professors. I persisted, studied all day till it was time to sleep. Started to have heavy anxiety without having ever had it before. I'm not sure if it was just stress or just anxiety I don't know the differences so well i'm sorry, but i know that in the last days i considered having 2 panic attacks a day as normal. I was (still am...) sleepless and I was responding harshly to my family in the last day because i was just too much overloaded, but ""fortunately"" they are family and just understood me much more than what i deserve.

 

Then a few days ago it was time for my first exam of the semester. I was prepared as hell and just wanted to do good in the first of many exams i will have all summer. 4 days before i registered my identity to the app that control us and they said that the identity was confirmed, but 25 minutes before the exam should have started me and a few other my colleagues received an email saying that our identity had some problems and we weren't registered and had to do it again (and the site said that some identities can take up to 48 hours to be confirmed). Wrote to the teacher and she said she was sorry but the system was so confusing she couldn't have done anything about it and we had to not do the exam (which would have been an extremely failure this semester where we have all summer blocked with lessons and exams).

I had the worst panic attack i've ever had. Didn't know what to do and just lost control of my actions. I know it sound like the excuse of a retarded person and even I think that so much that now i just hate myself, but i replied to the guy i thought was an employee of the app saying that (not in a nice tone) they could have sent that any f\*\*\*ing time that wasn't 30 minutes before the f\*\*\*ing exam and now i wouldn't have been able to do the exam for something i could have been warned days before. 

Then 2 minutes before the exam start the teacher write again and say that we can do the exam and that the app was just a little dumb and said us we weren't ok when we were. At the same time the guy i wrote replied kindly saying more or less the same things but added that ""there is no need to be a jerk"" I didn't apologized to him immediately because i had to time since i had to take the exam. 

&amp;#x200B;

Then, yesterday evening it turns out the worst thing that could have happened. The guy wasn't from the app, but was a technician from our uni that was helping their back end and reported me to the department director. Now the director will talk to me tomorrow afternoon and I have no idea of what to say or do. I just hate myself, my life and don't want to be kicked out by the only thing that keep my parents from considering themselves the worst failure around.",05Jun2020,1
490,"This thing just keeps sitting in my head and blocks all my creativity and productivity.

I was about to start my studies in her city, but was planning to move when Covid was over (I have class via Microsoft-Teams, so I didn’t need to be there), when I suddenly met her online. We shared a lot and both felt quickly deeply connected. I told myself „f*** it“ and moved two weeks ago into this strange, anonymous city which has like 30x the site of my hometown. I was convinced I felt the right decision, but after our second date she told me she doesn’t feel the spark, the spark she expected to feel all the times we talked on the phone (we usually talked 2-4 hours/day without a break). It came completely out of the blue and hit me hard. 

Despite only knowing her for roughly two months, I can say I never felt this connected to a girl. Her offer of a friendship is very difficult for me, as I don’t know how I would react if gets another bf. On the other hand I know just two other people in this city and really don’t want to lose her completely.

Two years ago I lost my mother to leukemia and I never knew my father so I became out of a place to live.

She is from a relatively conservative Caucasian family and both her parents are proud republicans. At first they seemed very respectful of our interracial relationship and even after I moved in with them, they still continued to treat me with kindness. I would always beg them to wash the dishes after dinner and to clean up the tables to thank them for giving me a home but they always insist that I am their guest.

Ever since Cvoid I lost my job as a Furniture salesmen at Ashely's and I have been staying home for a majority of the day.

Since I've been staying home for a majority of the day now, I have started to see a side of them that I hadn't before but I try to pretend like I didn't. One time I heard her dad refer to me as a ""Nigger"" in an argument with his wife over how their daughter was still working but I wasn't. They also said some foul things about how I probably would rather have the unemployment checks every week than to get up and find a job a again. This is all behind the doors of their master suite and I am not supposed to have heard any of this.

I have no intentions to violate our social contact with each other by committing these unjustifiable acts, but her parents think that I will simply because they see other blacks do it. In fact my very store was looted and I don't even know if I'll even have a job after this situation.

I was trying to defend that kid saying that she doesn't know where he got it from, but she kept insisting that he must have looted it or stolen money to buy it or he stole things, sold them and then bought it with the money. During this argument her father grabbed his shotgun and pointed it at me yelling ""I'm going to kill you nigger, you greasy black looting motherfucker"" and I was so scared for my life that I sprinted out of the house. She called me later apologizing on behalf of her father but I have been too scared to go back since. She continues to call me asking me to come back and I want to see her again but I don't know if I will be safe in her parents house.

493,"Long story short, I (M, 20) ran away from home when I was 17 because I couldn't stand my father. I remember growing up with him being a detached father figure and saying some ugly things now and then, but in more recent years he turned out to be a lot more abusive. He began insulting me and no matter what I did, he was still angry at me. I got good grades, worked part-time and had friends and hobbies, but it was never enough for him. At some point he began hitting our dog and in two occassions he hit me too. 

My mother left him a couple of years prior when this sudden change of personality happened and she said it was because he was stressed with his work. But he works on his own and from his own studio space so he doesn't have any contact with coworkers or anyone that isn't a client of his, so I never understood how he could become so frustrated with just that. We tried to discuss the problem with him several times but we couldn't do anything about it because he got angrier

This is all in the past now and I live at my friend's house, who has a loving family that accepted me in. I work part time and contribute to the house, help with the chores and am saving up to get my own apartment. But every now and then I'll remember my father and what he did to us and I feel a deep frustration and hatred for him. I wish he would understand the things he did to us and how they marked me for life. 

I'm trying to leave this feeling behind and focus that hatred into energy to be more productive and actively become a better person but it keeps clouding my mind. Every time I think about him, I get very angry and anxious and I hate it. What should I do?",05Jun2020,1
495,"I (21) have a 7 year old sibling who is full of life and love and happiness. She's just like any other 7 y/o who wants to play and color and explore and have fun and she's so so full of energy. I love her so much and she's currently the only joy in my life. 

The thing is, I'm the total opposite. I mean I haven't been to a professional but I think I might be depressed. I don't want to do anything, I don't want anything out of life, I wish I could not be here anymore. I genuinely struggle to do anything. I find it hard to get out of my bed or brush my teeth or do the smallest thing ever.

So when my sister tells me to color with her or to run around and play hide and seek, I really really struggle. Now I'm not an asshole I do get up and play around with her, as hard as I find it. I try and create games for her, we bake, we color, I really really try. But after I've done this like 10 times a day I just can't anymore. 

I don't want her to get affected by me, I don't want to bring her spirits down, I feel really really guilty when she asks me to do something and I refuse, and I just don't know how to deal with this. I tried explaining to her that sometimes I might feel tired and not be in the mood to play but she's a kid and I shouldn't put the weight of my struggles on her. I don't want her to spend all of her time playing alone. 

Just in case you tell me to talk to a therapist, I will once I can financially and once covid is over. And once covid is over of course she'll be able to play with her friends and people her age again. I'm asking for advice on what to do until then. I tried us doing common interests, but I've lost interest in anything and everything and I can't find an activity I could give my all to and to my sister.",05Jun2020,1
496,"TL;DR at the bottom

Hey guys, first post ever on Reddit here, and I wish it was under better circumstances. First, I'd like you guys to know that English is my third language and I just got a concussion (I'll get to that), so I'm sorry if some of this doesn't make much sense.

So I (23M) have been living with a couple (let's call them Will, 30M and Ashley, 32F) and some other guy (Andy, 29M) for a while now. I didn't know them beforehand, but we get along well, except for some mild disagreements on minor things.

Now, Andy and I tend to stay up all night and sleep in the morning, because we work in bars, so we're always being careful not to make any sound when we're awake at night. Will and Ashley assure us that they never hear us and that we don't bother them From what I recall, maybe once I woke Will and Ashley up over the last few months, and it was inevitable (dropped a plate or something).

Anyway, last night, I was minding my own business, and at 5am I went to bed and closed my bedroom door. About 20 minutes later, Will sends me this aggressive message to tell me not to slam the door, that I have no respect for others, etc. I apologize over text, and offer him a sleeping pill so he can sleep, because I know he sometimes has a hard time going to sleep. Now, I might have been a bit arrogant, but this didn't prepare me for what happened next.

Seconds after he sees my response, he barges in my bedroom where I was getting ready to go to bed, and starts yelling at me and cussing me out. At that point, this wakes Ashley up and she tells him to stop yelling because he woke her up. I agree with her and try to get him to lower his tone, and this just made him go ballistic. He starts throwing punches at my head, throws me on the floor, gets over me and keeps punching my head. Me being the nonviolent person that I am, I don't know how to protect myself so I just try to block the punches, until he finally stops. At that point I'm trying to catch my breath, but Will somehow mistakes it for laughter, so he starts throwing punches again, until Andy finally wakes up and gets to my room to separate us.

I spend about 30 minutes trying to calm down, call my mom (the only thing I thought of doing), Andy stays with me while Ashley is tearing Will apart in their room, mom gets to my place, takes me to the ER, I have a concussion (my 4th ever, but first due to violence) and the doctors had to check for cranial fractures (luckily I didn't have any). After leaving the ER, my mom and I go get my stuff from my apartment, and Will is there, tears in his eyes, apologizing profusely to me and my mom, saying he doesn't understand where that came from, etc.

My whole family (as every latinx immigrant family) gets involved, everyone wants me to press charges, the younger ones are already gathering friends to go beat him up (don't worry, not going to happen). The thing is, Will is from another country (European G8 country, not gonna specify which one for his sake), on a work permit, and pressing charges would most likely send him back to his country prematurely and prevent him from ever coming back. I kinda feel like his own guilt is enough punishment for what he did, and he is now so scared of himself that he won't do anything like that again.

THE QUESTION: considering all, should I press charges and get him deported, or just let him be and let his own guilt punish him?

TL;DR: I make a noise and wake up my roommate, he goes ballistic, beats the shit out of me and gives me a concussion, then apologizes profusely.",05Jun2020,1

500,"So for a little bit of background, I(f22) live in an apartment with my boyfriend(m23) and our roommate(m22).

Initially when we moved into the apartment together, we all agreed that we would clean up after ourselves instead of trying to split up the chores. This was last August. Since then, I can count on both hands how many times my roommate has done really any chore around the apartment. Me and my boyfriend have tried countless times to talk to him about making sure he's doing his part when it comes to chores, but to no avail. We've both tried talking to him one-on-one, we've tried talking to him together about it, we've even tried to write him a letter about it. Each time he always says he'll do better about keeping up with his chores, but he never follows through.

We also have two cats. One of the cats is mine, and the other is my roommates. We only have one litter box, but between me and my roommate we decided he was going to be the one to clean the litter box. As you may have guessed, he almost never cleans the litter box, so me and my boyfriend now take turns cleaning the litter box to try to keep the apartment from smelling.

When it comes to kitchen chores, me and my boyfriend are the only ones that even attempt to clean the kitchen. All of the dishes we use are mine, but my roommate will use them all, put them in the sink, and then try to gaslight us, telling us that they're our dishes and that he ""always washes and puts away the ones he uses by hand."" This, is obviously not true, since the cabinets are always empty (the dishes are used so often that its nearly impossible to keep up on leaving everything clean).

He never sweeps the floors, he never vacuums, he takes the trash out only once in a blue moon, etc. You get the picture.

Lately, this has gotten even worse. He's stopped buying cat litter completely, he doesn't buy his cat food very often anymore so I have to feed his cat my cat's special diet food (which is expensive), and he's completely stopped trying to clean anything in the kitchen at all.

The big kicker though, is that over the last week my boyfriend and I have been trying to locate the smell of some rotten food. We've come to the conclusion that it's coming from our roommates room, and we don't know how to try to talk to him about keeping up on chores, since he hasn't listened to anything we've had to say to him in the past.

All three of us are unemployed because of COVID-19 right now, so especially in a time like this there should be no reason that the chores aren't being split evenly.

How should I go about this?",05Jun2020,1
501,"Hi all, not sure if this is the right place for this but I'm a bit desperate for advice. I (26F) and my boyfriend (35M) are living with another couple from Italy (25F/25M). We didn't know each other before moving in together and we've been here about a year.  It's a flatshare so neither of us owns the place or has more rights to it than the other couple.

My partner and I try to evenly split chores, although I do tend toward doing more of them because I work less than he does. But he's still very willing to help clean up, and anytime I ask him to do something, it gets done. This other couple is the complete opposite. In a year of living together, I've seen her (let's call her Mia) cleaning every week (bathroom, vacuuming, sometimes mopping the floor) whereas he (let's call him Mario) has vacuumed ONCE and cleaned the bathroom ONCE. He will do odd jobs sometimes like unclog a drain or change a lightbulb, but that's it. Being around them more since lockdown set in, I realized that she often does all his dishes, does all his laundry, and will cook more often than he does, so it's quite an unequal distribution of labour in their relationship. They will go grocery shopping together, and as soon as they set the bags down in the kitchen, he goes upstairs to smoke a joint while she puts everything away. It's that bad. 

Since lockdown started three months ago, my partner has continued working outside the home (minimum 50 hours per week, often more), I've been WFH full-time, and my two flatmates have been totally out of work and at home 24/7. Let me repeat, NOT WORKING AT ALL. Obviously the flat get dirtier a lot faster, but I don't see them changing their cleaning routine (i.e., Mia cleans once per week and Mario does fuckall). I've started cleaning the common areas more often, but I'm growing more resentful by the day, seeing Mario do NOTHING while I work a full time job, get my yoga teacher training on the side, AND keep the house clean. 

My boyfriend told me last night that he tried to talk to Mario about this a few months back, saying, 'Hey, we should help out more, it's not fair for the girls to do all the work.' To which my flatmate replied, 'You're telling me, man - but that's just the way it is in Italy.'  

Hearing this last night pushed me over the edge, and I am raging mad. I can't even look at Mario today. I am really burnt out from work and lockdown in general, so I think my partner and I need to confront Mario about this before I totally lose it on him. Any advice for how to handle this conversation would be much appreciated. I'm very apprehensive but I have to do it for my sanity.",05Jun2020,1

I have been friends with this girl, who I met online in a little writing community, for many years now, and we've built a strong friendship. We've seen each other at our our highest and low points, though we've never been interested in each other - it's been a purely platonic friendship of support.

A few years ago, she began to date a boy who I will only refer to as G, who was very sweet and determined at first, a lovely partner to her passion, but a year into their relationship, things turned sour. I don't want to air our the dirty laundry here, but all I will say is that they were extremely rocky, and there was some cheating involved on G's side. It was very hard for her, and I had to support her a lot during that time. 

Eventually, after a long stretch of time, my years of advice for her to gather the strength to leave him worked, and she did, but little did I know that this was likely the wrong option; she was so deeply in love with him that when he left, her depression lingered, then worsened. Worst of all, he continued to pressure her to get back together with him - I suppose he assumed she was in a manic phase and didn't take the breakup seriously.

I tried my best to support her, but again, as our contact was long distance, I could only help so much, and she was in love with him. She was motivationless, and just felt desperately lonely without him. I urged her at the time not to go back to him, to seek professional help, but the professional help in her country isn't excellent, and the best treatment they had would entail taking her out of her writing education program entirely, meaning she would have had to start over several years of education again, so she decided not to.

They got back together, much to my dismay.

There were days he was sweet, I suppose, but ultimately it came crashing down again. During their breakup, she pursued another boy as a kind of rebound in hopes of forgetting her issues, but that didn't lead anywhere, and she regrets going after him. Now, in their current relationship, G blames my friend and accuses her of cheating (which of course I disagree with: they weren't dating!) But again, it's not my relationship or business.

It all came to a head when she removed me privately from her contacts list, then remessaged me days later, apologising and saying she did it because her boyfriend doesn't trust her to talk with other guys. She asked to add me back as a friend on the condition that we couldn't message each other.

Well, I made a promise a long time ago I'd like to always be open to support her as much as I can, so I accepted. But I'm starting to think: am I just being stubborn with this promise? Should I be leaving her to her own responsibility? Is there more I can do about this boyfriend, who doesn't seem to listen to reason (nor speak english, by the way, so even if in a fit of rage I were to get involved, which is against my policy of getting involved in other people's drama/relationships, he wouldn't understand and she'd probably suffer for it)? Should I even be so heated about this or am i simply getting nosy?

I don't know what's left to be done; she can't live with him, she can't live without him.",05Jun2020,1

522,"The last time I had a friend in my life was when I was a junior in high school barely turning 17. (Im currently 20). I had a very close friend circle through out all of high school. I was pretty sociable back then. Although my closet friend out of all them, him and I had a falling out. That fall out then spiraled me out of all my social ties. Because they were closer with him. Since then I haven’t been able to build any forms of friendship. 
I am a full time college student but i noticed everyone i try to make friends with either just use me for the class or they stop me talking to me after the semester ends despite my attempts of making it work afterwards. 
Sometimes people from high school I was not friends with back then. They randomly hit me up due to social media. We usually talk and build what I believe is something good. We hang out and talk for a couple of months. Then to later out of the blue they straight up just start ignoring me when i invite them out or text them, until weeks and weeks go by and i finally get uncomfortable vibes of oh they obviously don’t like me. So i give up my attempts of contact. 
I generally don’t know why no one seems to like me. I know i always been kinda a little bit of an outcast with my style and my i suppose “quirky personality “. But that shouldn’t create me to have such a problem with making lasting friendship.
This has always been a strong theme in my life since i was a kid. My earliest memory of this beginning as young as 5th grade. So many broken friendships, happened after that. I lost hopefulness in finding that movie cliche best friend that you see in almost every show/movie. Someone i can depend on and just go out with and build memories with.
I generally believe I am not a bad person. I don’t have a toxic personality to create people to be so drawn from me. I been in a very connected relationship with my current boyfriend for the past 2 years now so i know its possible for me to have healthy relationships with others.
I generally just feel so sad sometimes. Like i understand and appreciate, that i have someone in my life (my boyfriend). But sometimes I think about little things like, “who is gonna be my maid of honor if my boyfriend and i get married in the future? “ Or “who will i have if i lost my boyfriend?” Things along those corny lines. 
Also another reason why i feel upset is, after while of this pattern. Its becomes something i am self aware of and insecure about. It happens so much that, I cant help but think maybe it is me? Maybe i am a horrible person? As a teenager I was very depressed. I was very fake and lack self esteem due to all the broken relationships and past. 
I tried so hard to have the “prefect personality”. And would barely be myself. I stopped doing that a while ago after i lost my high school friends. But now as an adult I understand how damaging that was to live like that, and i don’t want to go back to that feeling. Its not healthy I do not want to live filtered and constantly pick at my personality and self.
Although maybe I just have bad luck and its not me? The thing is ill never know because no one has ever been real with me and told hey i dont like you anymore because of blank. They all probably think ghosting me is just a nicer way of getting rid of me. Although its very stressful on not just me almost any human’s mental health’s and confidence. It lingers in my head, and i will always wonder what is wrong with me? And why does it keep happening?

I am looking for support and the opportunity to see if anyone else has gone through this. Has anyone met their celebrity crush and ended up sleeping with them? I met Stephen Jenkins of TEB when I was 19 (he was 47) and we spent a night together, in his limo, at a bar, then back to his hotel room walking hand in hand through the city.

Well I ended up cheating on my boyfriend of 3 years at the time with no intention of doing so. But it was like I was hypnotized and numb. After leaving Stephen's hotel room I wandered the halls dazed and confused..even forgot my room number. The last thing he said to me was ""tweet me"" with a blank stare. 

I was heart broken and for years felt so alone. I couldn't stop creeping his social media, thinking about that night, and felt immense guilt/disgust. I couldn't talk about it with anyone except my boyfriend at the time who couldnt get over it. We broke up eventually.

Also the thought of how many girls he sleeps with like this...you don't want it but he's your celebrity crush. I still to this day think about it and find it difficult to listen to their music and I was obsessed. Can anyone relate? Why did this experience hurt me so much. Most likely because cheating goes against my values...and I was in shock. It really messed me up.

543,"TL:DR at the bottom! I'm so sorry if this is bad english and it's very long.

So I (F15) always dreamt of being a doctor ever since a kid because saving peoples lives is such a heroic job and science fascinates me. 

My family consists of my mom, dad, aunt, and me. My parents are very hard working people and I have full respect towards both of them, but here is where the problem starts.

Since the age of 12, I went through an event in school that changed me completely (not too comfortable to share) and I became extremely cautious and sensitive ever since. My family knew that the sensitivity existed but never really cared about it.

The sensitivity had a huge effect towards how I'd feel towards many things, but if we are talking about grades, I'd consider something lower than 85% a failure. I started to feel as if I am unable to develop this skill because I am not ""worthy"" of it, for example I quit badminton, biking, every foreign language I try to learn, etc etc.

My parents then start to tease me about these things, because I had the ambition to restart a ""skill"", but no motivation. For example they would say, ""You? Seriously? You would do that? You can't even do *insert something else I'm bad at"". They don't look as harmful, however to someone like me, it really hurts. These things are also very frequent from both parents.

This is where the line of no motivation and procrastination is drawn. One time, I simply said ""I'm so tired."" Then my mom lashed out.

M: What?
Me: Hm?
M: You're...Tired?
Me: Yes, I have been working on my physics project all day! I'm going to get a snack.
M: You're so selfish!
Me: What? We can share a sn-
M: What is wrong with you?! You're tired? You're so lazy, you've been doing nothing all day and I have to work hours upon hours to pay for your school tuition and this is how you pay me back?! Don't cry, you're so weak if you cry.

As of now, I am in tears and she continued for the nest roughly 30 minutes. Then my dad joined in and shouted at me continuously for the next hour or 2. Then my dad brings up the mental hospital.

Now, I never ever self diagnosed myself, nor looked deeply towards mental illnesses unless it was for a project. This is because of the culture ""if you're a teem and you have depression, you're faking it!"" I did suspect myself, but those thoughts always fade away because of my aunt. She's convinced that every person who has mental illnesses or are a part of LGBTQ don't deserve to live, which is absolutely bullcrap. She always said I am crazy if I ever bring this up and would always say ""If you're ever sad, just forget it. You're supposed to be a happy girl""

After my dad said that, my aunt went crazy mode and called me many insults if I go there, and how my entire future is ruined and my mom is laughing. 

This all ended in me admitting how stupid and lazy I am (even though I didn't want to) and now I feel like a failure and I definitely don't deserve to have a great career like a doctor.

What do I do when I'm losing interest in my biggest dreams? 

TL:DR = Event happened and I'm sensitive, Parents scold me for very little things, Aunt called me crazy for mentioning mental illnesses, Slowly losing interest in being a doctor. Help?",05Jun2020,1
544,"  

Hello everyone, I might need your help.

I (26f) have an older sister, who has 2 kids. 

My sister (33) has married a man last November in 2019. We did not have much to say to each other back then, also because I got a bad feeling about him before they got married. I only talked a few times with him before November. I also got the bad feeling because my sister´s daughter (12 years-old at the time) didn´t like to spend time with him in general and she became more and more quiet. My sister had a few boyfriends before, but normally they would forever leave some time later. In the end I more or less quit contacting her. Then around December I found out they got married, because my mother talked to me on the phone about it. My mom told me that she has seen my sister just a few days before, but with bruises on her arms. I did not believe that at that time. My mother also told me that my sister had born a second child, a boy from him.

Around January 2020 my sister wanted to go drink a coffee together. I agreed. We talked about our relationship and all in all had a very good talk. So I went to see her in the new flat and met her husband. I tried to make amends for not talking to them before, helping out the rest of the day with the new little kid/baby. But then they somehow started to have an argument. They talked it out right in front of me, with him getting more and more angry and starting to call my sister a bad mother and wife and that she has to listen to him because he is the man in the household. I began screaming about how he can talk like that to my sister and he started standing right in front of my face, warning me to not speak up. I started to feel very scared. They continued arguing and she basically confessed that he had hit her before, that he has threatened her, but that she did not go the police because then she loved him. She talked about how she did not love him anymore and to get a divorce. He was very angry. The baby woke up and started screaming too. I urged my sister to get out of the flat but she would not leave without the baby. He blocked the door and told my sister that she was not allowed to leave. So I tried to calm down the situation and tried to make it sound like that my sister and I would be coming back (I lied, I wanted to go to the police). But he started to calm down and let us leave. The car is right in front of their house and balcony, they live on the ground floor. But when we got to the car he, like a maniac, jumped off the balcony in front of us, landed, and threatened me again. I screamed to get away from me and had the phone ready to call the police. He backed off, and I looked at my sister for confirmation. But he started talking to her, I could not hear it I was too shocked, and she went inside with him. I called after her, but she didn´t respond. So I didn´t call the police and went back into the flat again too. And we just ... talked it out. 

At this point I want to tell you that I feel embarrassed about my behaviour back than. I had never seen ""fighting"" in a relationship like this before. But it was not just fighting. He was, and still is, mentally and physically abusing my sister, and has done so for almost 8 months now. 

Since that incident I tried to talk to my sister on a regular base, helped out with the kids when Corona hit hard and he was visiting his sick mother in Libya. He could not come back from February to mid May. At that time I had my old sister back, she was more relaxed than ever before. But since May, my relationship with my sister had gone south. He came back and often took her mobile phone away from her; one time when she said that she would be visiting me on that day she did not answer me for over two hours. Then a message came that she could not visit me, and that she did not hear my (three) calls. The next day my sister came around noon to talk to me and we realised that he wrote that message last night in her name. 

I don´t know what else I should write here. It happened so much the last months and my memory is starting to get hazy. I just feel so helpless and I am starting to get angry at my sister too, because she clearly sees the error in his ways but still stays with him.

Lastly I want to say that we haven´t spoken to each other for almost two weeks now. I am not visiting them anymore because I do not want this guy anywhere near me. So I wrote her a message that I love her, but that I will always worry about her because she is still living with him etc. She wrote back that I do not have to worry and that everything is fine. 

What else can I do?",05Jun2020,1

I don't want to quit my job right now because in the current situation my income is very important. But I don't want to tell my boss the news about the project because I won't get enough teaching hours for the next year and my salary depends on it. I don't know when exactly I will go so having some guaranteed work up until that moment would be nice. 

And at the same time if I tell them in autumn when I know for sure I am going, all my teaching hours should be somehow quickly redistributed between other teachers or they'll have to find another teacher quickly (we're living in a small town so this could be a problem).

560,"Hello, I would like to apologize in advance for any broken English that might appear in this block of text. I'm told I'm usually pretty good about writing well in English, but I am very upset right now and I worry I may screw up every now and again.

Basically, I was laid off from my previous job due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I spent a few months at home feeling totally useless until recently when I applied for, was interviewed for and got a job at a company where I was promised a decent paycheck (for my age, anyway) doing work in the semiconductor field. My adopted parents both work in this field, so it felt like the right move for me since my parents both have made pretty great money doing it historically.

After my initial new-job jitters, I was actually pretty excited for the new opportunity. I finally felt like I wasn't in deep financial trouble and like everything was going to be okay. I had everything figured out. I stayed up and pulled an all-nighter one night in order to get myself back onto a regular sleeping schedule (I had gotten pretty bad while at home, self-isolating) and decided to get something to eat, as like a victory meal of sorts.

As I went to pick up my food, I felt my phone ring. I didn't recognize the number at first, so I let it go to voicemail. When I got home, I listened to the message and, low and behold, it was a temp agent asking me to call her right back as soon as possible! We'll call her Mel. Mel wasn't just any ordinary temp agent, though. She has history with my adopted father. She has gotten him some jobs before, and he had always proven to be a hard worker. She even was in the process of trying to get him into a new job as we speak. This is important, and I'll bring this back up later.

I decide to call Mel back later on the next day, as I'm still tired from pulling an all-nighter and didn't quite think of myself as being fit for making decisions regarding work at this moment. I sit down, try to take one fucking bite of my food, and she calls back. This will be the first dead giveaway of the hell that will ensue over the next few days.

I answer the phone in the vain hope that she might stop calling me and let me eat my fucking dinner. She tells me ""I have a good new opportunity for you! Have you accepted an offer from another job yet?"" and at this moment, I pretty much realize that I'm not going to get out of this so easily. I tell her ""Yes, but feel free to make a better offer."" I was offered $15.50/hour at the job I had already accepted, and after some deliberation, she figured I could be making upwards of $18/hour at this opportunity that she had for me.

Naturally, I'm intrigued. $15.50/hour is more than I've ever made before. $18/hour is even better! So I ask her ""What's the job?"" and she tells me... the name of the company. And she tells me ""This is where I got your \[step\] father a job, too. You don't need a background test, you don't need a drug test, you can just start on Monday. Does that work for you?"" to which I reply with ""Suuuuure.""

I should mention right here, that my tired ass self was pretty much thinking: 

*""There's no way in hell that they would hire someone without a drug test OR a background test without at least calling the person first. That would be BEYOND stupid. You wouldn't want to hire some child diddling heroin addict if you weren't even sure you liked them as a person... right?""*

Well, she tells me she'll call me back. She tells me the job is picking and packing, which I guess is just moving boxes around. This is already not looking good, this sounds like a dead end and very boring job. And I must wonder why doing something like this is going to cost $18/hour. Turns out, it's twelve hour days, during third shift. 18:00 (6:00 PM), to 6:00 (6:00 AM). So basically the worst possible kind of days you can possibly work. And I will be doing nothing... but moving boxes... all day. ""But don't worry, Yuri! It's a great job! People say it's a lot of fun. It's hard work, but you can make it here!"" Yup. I can make it by moving boxes all day. Fan-fucking-tastic. Thank you, Mel.

Now I did tell her ""Wait, I'm having second thoughts. I would like some time to just think this through as I did just accept another offer-"" and she pretty much cut me off saying ""Nonononononono don't do this to me, I stuck my neck out there for you on this job! Why!?!? What happened?""

And ordinarily, I would have just told Mel ""Well I'm not saying no, I'm just saying I need time to think about it."" or even ""Well tough shit, that was your own bad decision."" on a bad day. But... remember how I said she was working actively with my step father looking for a new job? It just so happened to be at this company she was trying to hire me at, too. I worry that if I screw Mel on this, I might screw my step father via proxy. I don't think I could do that to him, I know he doesn't enjoy his current job and I'd hate to think that I was the reason he had to stay somewhere he wasn't happy.

My going plan at the moment is to not even tell my other job that this is happening, and just try out this third shift job for a little while to see how I like it. Give it a week long or so crash course before my scheduled start date later on this month at the first company. But I'm open to any better ideas. I'm... just aggravated at this whole scenario. This couldn't have happened at a worse time.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I was accepted and hired for one job, but then was in-voluntarily hired at another that I don't want, that I feel I have to work now because the temp agent who got it for me works with my step father, and I don't want to potentially screw over my step father by screwing over the temp agent and not taking the job she had for me.",05Jun2020,1

563,"So basically my BF has gotten an offer to go the Isle of Man and get a working permit and everything with very little hassle. Living in South Africa, this is basically a free ticket out of the shit show.

The problem comes in with the fact that we live together, and I (admittedly stupidly) have become very dependent on him. If he leaves, I lose my home, my job, will have to leave my college, I lose my pets, and I lose the love of my life. I will either have to move back in with my abusive parents just so I can try to make it to work and college, but without reliable transportation it will be very difficult. I could move in with my father at the other end of the country, but colleges there are a lot more expensive. I don't earn enough to pay for my college, rent, food, transport etc on my own.

I don't want him to go. I want him to stay, and just wait for me until I'm finished in 2 1/2 years and then we can go together, but he doesn't want to miss this opportunity. And I'm so lost about what to do. Do I go to my mom and her abusive boyfriend, do I go to my dad? Is there some possibility I would be able to go with my BF to the Isle of Man? And if I do, how do I continue trying to advance my career? Any advice would be really appreciated.

566,"I’m sorry if this is not a sub for it, but I couldn’t find an appropriate sub about body image or issues for it.


I generally like my body and have no problem with wearing form-fitting clothes or my partner seeing me in a lingerie or underwear. I’m relatively confident, healthy weight, average looking. I am content with how I look with or without clothes.


But if I even think about swimming suits I get panic attacks and start crying and instantly feel ashamed and grossed out in my body.


I suppose it has a backstory: I was an anxious 15/16 yo on vacation abroad with her family. I didn’t hate my body, but you know, typical insecure teenager stuff and I just felt comfortable wearing shorts that come to my mid thigh and swimming bra or tank top. 

My family decided that a way to make me accept my body was forcing me to strip to my bathing suit and parade through a long beach with my dad and little sister to a designated area for beginner swimmers (my sister was learning and dad wanted me to help hold her or sth). I begged them with tears in my eyes not to force me, that I could stand in shallow water with my shorts on, anything. My mother (a woman with severe body image issues who loves calling out how others look, never wears a swimming suit and is overweight) told me to love my body and stop being a drama queen and making such a big deal.

So I stripped to my swimming suit sobbing and having a panic attack (at the time I did not know what it was) and walked what felt like miles (but was probably 5 minutes lol) covering my chest and butt trying to make myself as small as possible. I full on ugly cried until I couldn’t even see what was in front of me. When we entered the water and it didn’t stop, my dad sent me back to my mother, angry at me for making a scene.

I run back, put on my clothes and have never ever worn a swimming suit since. I haven’t bought one since. I can’t look at one without having an urge to cry and hide my body.

I am usually confident. I like and accept myself. People looking at me at the beach are not a problem.

But whenever I even think of a possibility of wearing a swimming suit, even in a changing room or as a test at home, I go into full on hysteria and feel like my body is the most disgusting, vile, repulsing object on earth.


Summer vacations are coming. I love sea and beaches. I want to learn how to swim and be comfortable and enjoy vacations with my boyfriend like a normal person.


But even looking at possible loose, long swimming trunks for surfers makes me cry and shake. I feel like I could go in my normal bra at the beach and have no problem, but if it’s a swimming suit, even way more covering than my normal underwear or tank tops, I feel sick.


Has anyone (especially women) experienced something similar? Any way I can combat this? I don’t want to be the weird insecure girl that has to hide herself at the beach. I don’t want my boyfriend to be embarassed of me and my weird behaviour (even though he’s very supportive).
I’ve attended theraphy for years (as you can imagine, my home life wasn’t the most accepting environment) and almost all my other issues are gone or under control. I talked to my parents how this incident affected me but they just told me to get over it.

Olofcourse as with most things there are exceptions. But I think genuine people are very very difficult to find. People that would put u in front of them.

Loyalty and trust mean a lot to me. I wish it were true for the rest of the world. 

But now because if this, I'm trying to get a stronger mindset and way of thinking. One that allows me not to care, feel or need other people. 
The mindset I'm thinking of is, become like them. Stop being good, hurt others before they hurt you, think only of your interest and dont care for anyone except yourself.

574,"Ever since I can remember, the neighbors next door have been constantly yelling at their kids. And I don't mean just raising their voices, I mean shouting to the point it's impossible to ignore it, I even heard threats years ago.

The main object of their anger have been the oldest son, who is now about 22. When he was a teenager, during these disgusting fights, I could hear the youngest girl crying in distress over and over again. When she got older, she became, just like her older brother, the object of their parents verbal abuse. 
Unfortunately we got used to it, and being young myself (I'm now 24) I never thought I could do something about it. And for the ""let's mind our business"" rule, the adults that could hear them didn't do anything about it.

When I turned 21 I left home, and of course as I was busy with my life I forgot about them. But now that I moved back because of the Corona crisis (lost my job etc) I have the ""pleasure"" of hearing them again. This time, their oldest son is too old to be dealing with the parents shit, he has got a job and he's independent but I worry about the teenager girl.

I fear that she feels lonely in that hostile environment, she probably doesn't trust her parents and is very unhappy. 

I'm about to move out again in two weeks, and I want to do something for her. I want to write her a few words of encouragement, I want her to know that it won't always be like this and that things will get better. 

The problem is, I don't want things to backfire. I don't want her parents to believe that she wrote herself a letter to ""prove a point"" to the parents, so they could see how horrible they are. She would get in trouble because of me. Also, I don't want her to fear that someone is kinda stalking her, someone who knows what's going on in her life. 

I could sign the letter, but I don't want these people to start trouble with my own parents. I'm moving out, so I would leave them alone dealing with what I've done.

578,"I have a younger brother back at home in Chicago and I am in San Diego. He's 29, lives in an apartment with one other person and in a shitty situation.

He lost his job with all of the stuff happening and hasn't made a penny from his minimum wage job since March. For context only - a long story short and aside from the main point, he is ineligible for unemployment, doesn't have health insurance, and hasn't filed his taxes due to a variety of reasons, so he did not receive stimulus check either. 

He's obviously behind on his financial responsibilities and my family and his friends are not in a situation where they can provide much help, aside from the occasional meal or $20.

Being unable to pay for anything is taking an obvious toll on his mental health. On top of that he has the violence, looting and riots on his street every night since the protests started - another source of significant stress on him. He called me crying because he was hearing gunshots outside and is too scared to even walk his dog.


I spoke with him yesterday via video call just to check in and he has developed some sort of shocking and very pronounced stutter or speech impairment over the last week. He mentioned that it started during an argument with a friend, but I didn't want to pry too much. It's not like a little trip over a word or pause in speech, it looks like a full on brain tweak. He can't finish sentences, his face winces up, and it can take 5-6 seconds to get a word out. It's very very very concerning. He has no history of speech impairment.


My family has a deep and widespread history of severe anxiety, detrimental mental illness, and other issues that seems to have impacted my brothers a little worse than myself. For myself, I was in a better situation when symptoms started to show and I was able to start treatment with my mental health before anything was OOC. It allowed me to stay on track and land a good career. My older brother is very hostile and has distanced himself from the entire family, and ended up in deep financial trouble and addicted to heroin. My younger brother seems to be on the same path, just at a slower rate. 

At this point I am unsure if he's ended up on drugs and this is a symptom, or if he is under so much stress and anxiety that his symptoms are manifesting as this ""stutter"". But either way from my perspective he either needs to be in the hospital for a brain scan, or in the hospital for a detox.

I'm thankfully in a situation to where I could offer some financial assistance this month, hoping it would bring his stress levels down a bit. But I don't want to just send cash in the case that this is drug related. I'd rather directly pay his landlord, or his bills.

All of that said, he obviously needs access to therapy and medication but is unemployed, uninsured, stubborn and proud. He also needs financial assistance.

585,"I (25/M) and two friends (let’s call them Ryan and Joe 25/26M) were planning on moving in and renting a place together. Now we’d been talking about this for a few months but the plan was they’d move into my place which I currently share with another roommate, since it’s a 4BR place and the other 2 roommates were gonna move out soon, and we’d all move in together once that happened since their leases were both up. Now we all live in the same neighborhood, and our friend group is roughly a dozen people who mostly live in the area too. Yet it didn’t happen and I think it fucked up our friend group permanently. 

So I have to give the whole timeline here so  it all makes sense. We’d been at joes place the week covid started where they’d been acting IMO like assholes to me, in that they were calling me out on stuff I’m ok with joking about in our immediate circle of 3, but I don’t like it being mentioned in front of 10 or so people. Basically like when you feel you’re the butt of all jokes the entire party in front of people you don’t know well. And this had been going on for a few weeks prior, so I was at the end of my rope. So I called them out on it and they didn’t react well (we were all pretty drunk so that didn’t help) but I was under the assumption we’d buried the hatchet when we sobered up the next day and spoke, since another  friend was there to mediate that night (Ivan for the story). We’d also been friends for 2 years and nothing like this had happened before. 

Fast forward to next Sunday and I make a pretty innocuous comment that morning that my one friend is a broker, and could probably find us a better spot in the neighborhood for a good price. Doesn’t really go anywhere with either of them. I’d had a shitty day and was pretty stressed out, so later that afternoon Ryan says something glib/similar to the previous weeks comments and I tell him to piss off because I was super stressed and didn’t need him giving me shit. I apologized later and assumed again the hatchet was buried. 

that Wednesday, we’re all at my place where one of my roommates who was moving and his girlfriend invited us to play board games. During the game we’re chatting and it all seems normal and we’re chatting about moving in soon, as if we’d rebutted the hatchet. However, when I’m taking the trash out Later Ryan and Joe are chatting pretty heavily about something when they’re leaving but I don’t think anything of it. 

On Saturday, they come to my place and say that they’d signed a lease together, and to rub salt in the wound, it’s across the street from my place. Needless to say it didn’t go over well and we had a pretty big blowup (again, we were all pretty drunk), which rehashed all this shit the weeks before and Ivan the mediator wasn’t there this time to solve it. However, imo this didn’t really solve anything but it led to basically a stalemate of Joe/Ryan v me where we're cordial but not friendly. 

Now before covid and all this happened we hung out all the time, now it’s been maybe four or five times since (this took place late March/early April), and we weren’t necessarily the best on social distancing, so that isn’t an excuse. And while I’ve talked with Joe and we’re more of less ok, ryan and I are basically still on Cold War footing and haven’t resolved anything. And as a whole it’s not resolved either. 

Since they got their new apartment, I wasn’t asked to help them move in, haven’t been invited over, and my one roommate whom I still live with says it’s super awkward when he’s been around us 3. His friend who wasn’t part of our group but we like also agrees. And last year, Ivan got put on a ‘blacklist’ by Ryan and joe because he was a drunk ass at joes family beach house on July 4th (I missed it since I was in Europe). He says they’re doing to me what happened to him, but he got back in their good graces after 6 months or so. Obviously throughout this whole story I’m not blameless at all, but now that I’m out of the inner circle, is it even worth bothering to get back in?

TLDR: friends and I were planning to move in together, had some spats that never got resolved, and now they’re shunning me like what happened to another friend, but warmed up to after a while. Worth it to stay friends?",05Jun2020,1
586,"Events happened a few months prior but feel that its appropriate to post anyway for the sake of future occurrences. 

Year 2 Uni student here- randomly paired with a dormmate who was apparently new to the country (immigrated couple years back). Although things were awkward at first we managed to get along pretty well and became pretty good friends. 

fast forward many months later I noticed that things went from friendly conversations, the occassional eating together, hanging out, to a more annoying trend. To put it short- he has a tendency to follow me everywhere. Whenever I would go to study hall to complete schoolwork he would follow me there (which I don't mind too much honestly). But what gets on my nerves is that even in a completely empty room full of tables and chairs he would follow me to the exact same table and set his stuff down right next to mine (he has ALOT of stuff and the desks are not big). I've had to tell him off nicely every time but he keeps at it every time. I mean, these study halls are enormous and can literally occupy 1000+ students without being too crowded. 

Also, when we are together in the dorm, seated at our study tables, my slightest hint of movement, whether that be getting a writing utensil out of my rucksack or opening the wardrobe underneath the table to fetch a book, would trigger his immediate attention. I mean he literally jumps in his seat and glares at me, and will always ask ""whereabouts are you going?"" To which I would respond ""Just getting a pencil, book etc."" In the event that I am going somewhere, he would always pack as fast as possible and follow me out. Even when I'm going to the restrooms he would promptly say ""me too"" and follow me to the urinal next to mine. 

Odd thing is- I initially thought he wanted social contact, but whenever I respond to his ""whereabouts are you going?"" questions with ""I'm going out with some friends, you're welcome to join"" he would always refuse. 

He is a very good friend but I feel like I have no privacy whatsoever. I am followed everywhere from study halls, bathrooms, campus eateries, etc. I have sat down and kindly reminded him that we need to respect each others' privacy and personal space, to which he would always seem to initially agree but would forget the next second. I don't know if this is due to a cultural difference (I'm from the UK and he's from India), and I don't want to offend him in any way. Please advise.",05Jun2020,1

590,"hey everyone. i am 20(f) who had just recently cut off my closest guy friend due to emotional burnout. ever since i was 14 - being the prime “soundboard” of my friendships was a huge personality trait for me. i sought any chance i could get to prove my friendship to those i kept around me; i listened to traumas/problems and would do the best i could to support them, and 95% of the time i was successful. 

so here is some background info: 
i had met him at the age of 14-15 (he is also the same age as me), and he was quite troubled. helping him was a challenge but i stayed as close as he would let me and would always put my all into helping him. unfortunately this became extremely toxic early on because he wasn’t very reciprocative. i chose to ignore this for most years of our friendship because i learned to care about him, his wellbeing and safety regardless. when we were young; he always used to tell me to “wait for him” because he promised he would do so much for me, he just couldn’t at that time, and so i waited. he seemed to improve as he met this girl, and they ended up dating. she was his first and only serious relationship and it seemed to have helped him improve slightly (although that relationship wasnt healthy whatsoever due to his continuous wrongdoings) currently; they are broken up and he is a mess, even though its more of a break (just longer than their regular ones) due to her wanting to better herself before continuing the relationship

fast forward six years; i’m here helping this guy who only seems to be digging himself in a deeper hole. i spend hours and hours of my time on the phone with him giving him rounds and rounds of new advice every time. i know his situation very well so i’m able to be practical. he asks for help and guidance but doesn’t take any of it. this has been going on since January i believe. 

he drinks himself and drugs himself away and has been doing very stupid shit since his breakup (eg - got arrested &amp; now has to pay 15k+ in lawyer fees). i care(d) about him so much and thats why i would stay up with him and talk to him, text him out of my way to make sure he was okay and unharmed, be his shoulder to cry on, always answer my phone when he calls and always get back to him if i dont, offer to do things financially etc just to see him partially happy and most importantly - safe. 

everyday he would call me with even more bad news than the day before and it would just give me so much anxiety and sadness. i wouldnt be able to sleep because i would be scared that he was hurt. i know how much his family cares about him so it would break my heart knowing maybe i couldve brought these tendencies of his (somehow) to their attention so that he could be guided by a heavier influence and hopefully stop putting himself in dangerous situations. i cried so much when he told me he got arrested and could face prison time. i started to feel helpless and unstable and started to feel as if i was taking his burden onto my shoulders. i continued to push it through because i didn’t want to be a bad friend.

a week later he picked me up and we hung out for an hour, we got pizza and parked somewhere and all he could talk ab that whole entire hangout was him and his relationship (which is all we really talk about lol this isnt a friendship at all its always been about him). he said he will kill himself or hurt whoever he has to in order to get his ex back. i retaliated and asked “but what about others who care so much about you? dont you consider them?” and he just looked me in the eye and said he doesnt care about everyone else nearly as much as he cares about her. 

i was really hurt to hear him talk like that, i have taken endless amounts of negativity and anxiety throughout this period and he knows i have. but i wish he could of just semi lied and said he cares about others too (hes lied to me before and he choses now to be extremely blunt lmao) just so maybe i wouldve found a loophole in continuing to stick by his side. but after i heard that; i was done. hearing him say that made me realize he doesnt care that i worry about him and that it takes a huge toll on me. so i had shown zero emotion for the rest of our time together until he dropped me off at my home. i had told him i didnt want to continue the friendship anymore - so i blocked his number and any way of contact. its been a week and i go through rounds of confusion about it all.

am i a terrible person? for the record; he has abandoned me in times of need (especially when his life goes uphill) which makes me feel better because ive been nothing but supportive toward him. but now its really impacting me and if he doesnt care about his safety or wellbeing i feel like i shouldnt either. i shouldn’t be crying or anxious for someone else. and it definitely feels wrong to be doing all of this when the burden he knows i try to handle isnt even acknowledged/cared about/or considered.

TL;DR: extremely unstable friend going through relationship issues - now doing dangerous things like drugs and getting involved w the police - im trying to give advice because help is asked for even though advice is not taken EVER - emotionally burdened and the other person is aware but doesnt care - tired of feeling like a person of convenience and not an actual friend",05Jun2020,1

592,"So basically I've been friends with this guy for a little while now, we hang out a lot because we're basically roommates. We do tons of shit together but I've mostly thought of him as a little brother.

Recently he got fairly drunk on the weekend and admitted his feelings for me. It got pretty awkward after that because I was just not interested and it was kind of weird knowing all the shit we'd done together and then finding out that was how he felt the whole time. The main thing is that he's very immature, both physically and mentally and equally important its illegal. Bottom line, I just can't think of him that way. I want to let him down easy but he barely remembers the conversation because he was drunk, but he still knows the gist of what he said. How do I get the message across without upsetting him?",05Jun2020,1
593,"I just want to preface this and say, I like my job, I’m very grateful that I have a job during these tough times and I’m looking for advice on how to approach this situation. 

In December of 2019 I started a new job as a Marketing Coordinator. I was getting paid a salary (not hourly) and the company culture was that we would stay until the work was done, so I would stay a couple hours late about once a week. 

Since March 20, my team and I have been working from home due to the pandemic and this is when things start to get a bit questionable. 

So about a month in, 3/6 of us on the team were told we were being put on a wage subsidy program due to a lack of budget (the company is driven by sales and they have been lower due to COVID) which means we would have two subsidy days a week where we’re being paid 75% of our daily pay. On those days, we aren’t expected to work but we’re expected to monitor our email and handle any emergency requests that may come in. I thought that was a fair solution. 

This is my problem, earlier in the year my grandmother passed away, her and I were very close and it hit me pretty hard so I took about 8 days off of unpaid leave. I later noticed I was only getting about 60% of my daily pay on my subsidy days and when I asked HR they said the 75% we earn is based off our total earning from Jan 1, 2020 to March 15, 2020. So essentially I’m getting paid less because my grandma died. 

On top of it, the subsidy days are treated like normal days. I’m the only person who does graphic design/video on my team so all graphic projects are directed to me (it’s usually about 50 ongoing projects for me at a time which feels like a lot). So on those days I basically work my full job for minimum wage, sometimes even working late. When I first brought up what was expected of us to my boss (40sF) she basically went on this spiel about how sometimes you just gotta do what you can to help the company (is it crazy to want to be properly compensated for my work?). I feel like I’m being taken advantage of because we also pay about $15,000 a month to an agency to help us with bigger projects. I don’t know how budgets work and how easy it is to move around money, but I feel like they could afford to take a couple thousand from there and pay me and my coworkers the proper amount. 

I’m young and fairly new to the company I don’t know how to bring it up to my boss that on those subsidy days I’m getting paid about 60% of my daily salary and I’m being overworked! I don’t want her to think less of me and I don’t want her to think that I’m unreliable but at the same time, I think it’s getting too much for me to handle. Another thing that is bothering me is that I’m working off my personal computer when all of my other coworkers are working off company computers. I’d appreciate any advice on how to tactfully bring up how I’m feeling to her. 

Thank you!

TLDR; I was put on a wage subsidy program to be paid 75% of my daily pay due to COVID (because of my grandmas death, I missed some work and am getting paid about 60% of my salary on those days as a result). Not supposed to be working our usually jobs on those days, but I am. How do I approach the topic with my boss?",05Jun2020,1
594,"Bqckground: My parents are the nicest people in the world, we moved in with her because our last neighbors were into drugs and things were scary. We figured we could help her out with mortgage payments and just household chores in exchange for a place my parents and mom especially felt safe to live.

 Fast forward barley 8 weeks of living together and my sister has stopped taking care of the house, my dad does everything for her and she never says thank you, I clean on my days off and she could care less, she makes us take care of her husky puppy because she is never home, in her room with boyfriends or goes into her bedroom at 8pm to sleep. She wakes up at 530 for work and lets the dog cry for a half hour before she takes her out while everyone is asleep.

We tried bringing these things up to her and asking her simply if she could take the dog out first thing in the morning, and why she can't help us take care of her dog, and that we feel like we have to do everything. It didn't even last 5 minutes before she started screaming and punching the wall. Not long after she told all of us to get the fuck out if we didn't like how she acts. 

My mom wants to at the very least stand up for herself and not be treated like that and so do I. My dad on the other hand would rather let her speak to us that way and ignore everything until we find a new place. It hurts my heart that he is so broken by everything that he is willing to let his daughter treat him like that.

If anyone can help figure out ways to talk to her, or what we can do to make the situation better for ourselves I would appreciate it so much. We are terrified to wake up every day and I've missed a day of work because I had a severe panic attack on the way simply from worry.",05Jun2020,1

I do not discuss topics of politics or religion at work due to being a touchy subject and everyone has a right to believe in what they want. I work with mostly republicans and that is okay. In light of recent events I have notice the up in comments against BLM, democrats, and race. I feel everyone is entitled to their opinion, but lately it has gotten really really bad. Since this I have looked back on past encounters and previous conversations that I have heard in front of me, and it is  down right completely inappropriate. I feel very uncomfortable at work, and sometimes I will chime and say ""that't not very nice"". I mostly stay silent. It honestly stresses me out and to hear how much my coworkers hate me and my views is somewhat upsetting to me. I am just looking for a way to address this issue without offending anyone. I am not sure if I should report to HR, my boss, or to the coworkers directly.

I've been with this group for just over a year now. they're my ""main friends,"" if that makes sense.

The first couple months were golden. I thought for sure they'd be long term. but now Im very, very much on the verge of ditching them.
There's four of us including me. Let's say, A, B, and C. B introduced me to her friends (a+c) and we all became fast friends.
I'm a quiet person, so they really forced me out there with them. they made me more outgoing, energetic, top of my game. things were going wonderfully, more people were talking to me, everything was fine. until this past November. After they did a vile thing, and I had to go along with it or risk the same happening to me, I started to see through the cracks, and they noticed my change. So whenever I said something the girls didn't like, A and B would verbally attack me over the internet and wouldn't stop until I was in tears. this was on a monthly and sometimes even weekly basis. it just keeps getting worse. the most previous shit on me fest? it was because I was zoned out not listening while they were talking. and they said because of that I was a shitty friend and an even worse person, and to ""stop being such a pos bitch and don't zone out on us."" A has never been very supportive of anything I do, and B goes with what she says. The final straw happened the other day, and now I get visibly upset/shaky even seeing a message notification from the only girl that still talks to me from that group. Our friendship is over. They're hypocritical assholes. but would it be smarter to wait to tell them until the school year starts so there's at least an attempt at finding new friends first?

We take temps and we sanitize time clocks between each user, as well as sanitizing hand-contact surfaces around the bathrooms and break rooms every hour. I started three weeks ago and I work with two girls who, I only realized yesterday, are using our temporal thermometers to scan peoples’ wrists to get lower temps so that they can let them inside.

I am scared that we let in people that had real fevers. I was only able to stop one worker from getting in. This worker stated that they had been fishing with another worker in the factory. 

I went to my boss (of the janitorial company) but she suffered an injury recently and she knows that if she fires the two girls that she will have to work until the positions are refilled. Obviously she doesn’t wanna do that, so she’s ignoring the situation.

He has always been super nice and i do enjoy talking to him since we have a lot of common interests. I don’t have any irl friends that are gamers, so it’s nice to talk to someone that is also into that. 
However, while we were talking i did notice that he seemed to be very discreetly flirting with me, but i always just brushed it off thinking he didn’t mean it in that way. It was definitely not in an inappropriate way, just very subtle. 

Yesterday we were talking as usual when things got really weird. I was talking about how i’ve been having a hard time finding a job (mainly because of corona) and he told me something like “this is gonna sound weird” and then suggested that i create an onlyfans if things get rough... i was definitely a bit taken back by that but i just kinda laughed it off. After that he told me that he has been wanting to get into doing videos online... which i guess means he wants to do porn or explicit videos? 

I was really taken back by him saying that.. so i just kind of told him that he can do whatever he wants and stopped responding to him after that. I mean i don’t have any issues with that, he can do whatever he wants. I just found it weird that he would tell me that. 

Today i messaged him to tell him that what he said yesterday was weird and made me really comfortable, since we barely know each other. He apologized very seriously and told me he didn’t mean for it to sound weird or anything like that.

612,"I’m an absolute fuck up of a human being 23f.

I’m already an anxiety-ridden pos, so please spare me the comments on how wrong I am for getting to this point in my life. 

I am not joking when I say I’m a fuck up. 

I was always good in school, but come junior year of high school I just let go of all ambitions to get good grades. I come from a middle-eastern family so the shame still follows me to this day. 90% of not getting good grades was completely my fault. 10% my dad being verbally abusive on a daily basis, if not with me then my mom or sister, and the occasional physical abuse. I had very low self-esteem from bullying ing middle school and my grandmother calling me ugly a lot of the time. My mom is still hard on me for my body even though I’m a 125lb 5’3’’ woman. 

It’s very hard for me to gage how difficult my life was at the time because I don’t really have an idea what “normal” is. No ones family is, so I feel bad saying I had a difficult time especially when my family is upper middle class and they afforded me whatever I wanted. I just didn’t apply to schools because I knew that I wasn’t going to get in, so my plan was to go to a regional college (I don’t know if it’s a community college it has a med school attached to it. I tell myself it’s not to make myself feel better) and then transfer to this university’s sister school’s main campus. 

Anyways, I ended up doing that, my grades weren’t phenomenal, but I got As in all the classes that pertained to my major. The summer after I had 2 internships. I got accepted to this school, and when I went I basically flunked my entire first year at the school. My parents don’t know about it and I never plan on telling them. At the time I lost my best friend, the closest friend I’ve ever had at the time, by loss I mean like a break-up, and we “broke u” in a cruel manner. During this time I gained 30 pounds and was very obviously depressed. I tried different medications until I just stopped.

The summer before my next year I gassed myself up to go very hard because I wanted to get good enough grades to study abroad the next summer. I did. It was really weird thinking about it now that I’m in the state that I’m in now. I got a membership at orange theory and would go basically every day to work out and then go to my classes, and I didn’t necessarily ace them, but I got above B-’s in all of them. I come back from my study abroad trip in the best shape I was ever in throughout my life, mentally and physically. I got all As in my classes abroad, walked everyday, made new friends, etc. the natural serotonin was amazing. Now coming into my senior year, my first semester was good as well. I signed up for next years classes and took everything I needed to graduate, despite basically being a complete failure my sophomore year. 

The beginning of the semester I am doing tremendously. I am on top of the world. And suddenly, I just stopped. Stopped going to class, stoped giving a shit, stopped doing anything. The shame of walking into a room with people who knew I missed even three classes was so disappointing I would literally tremble from anxiety thinking about going into class the next day. So I didn’t. My parents think I graduated. I planned on making up for it by taking classes the summer after. I didn’t do that as well. I slept all day, I would take two benedryl a night just so I can sleep as long as I could so I wouldnt have to face anyone or anything. I come home from school. I find a job as a paralegal. I do that. I take the LSAT, get a pretty low score. The summer is here, I’m taking online classes to finish my degree, and I’m not doing too well in that either. 

My parents think I’ve applied to so many law schools, and I actually tried to but because I have a tuition I cannot pay off my university refuses to send my transcripts to apply. I tried applying for a student loan but my credit is too low and need a cosigner and don’t have anyone in my life that would do that for me to be honest. I’m writing all this and it seems like I’m nonchalant about this please know I cry on a daily fucking basis, I resent myself, the amount of times in the middle of the night I think about just jumping off a balcony makes me cry as I write this but I’m too much of a coward to do that too. I feel like I’m just a sentient being occupying too much space for the Earth and don’t deserve that. What really made me crack though is yesterday my boyfriend (doesn’t know much of this but he knows I’m depressed) invited me to his house for a barbecue. His dad asked me what my favorite memory from high school and college were. I answered, but in the moment I almost felt like ditching and just crying. 

My bf is way too overqualified to be attracted to anyone like me. He’s a graduate of uc Berkeley, I’ll just leave that there. Thinking about what my favorite memory was so heart wrenching. I know people always say, “ fuck high school, I want to peak later in life” yeah that for me is heightened ten fold. I don’t have a good memory from high school. I just don’t. I regret so much that the word instantly just brings tears to my eyes. I didn’t go to football, basketball, or any games in high school or college. Both of them were athletic schools. I didn’t join a sorority in college, and I didn’t have many friends, honestly I don’t know gif they’re really my friends they haven’t talked to me this year. I’m a loser. 

The worst part about this shit, the shit that keeps me up at night, the shit that I crave the answer to so much is WHY DID I JUST STOP GOING TO CLASSES LAST SEMESTER OF MY SENIOR YEAR? Why did I do that? I had it going so well. 

It feels like I’m not in control of my fucking body. I’m so ashamed of myself I’m scared to let anyone know of this. I come off as a very intelligent person, I can carry intellectual conversations, I read, I can speak 4 different languages, 

I’m not stupid. I use to refuse that I was stupid, but I’m getting to the point of where I think I am. Anyways, I just wanted practical advice. I just wanted to know why I suddenly dropped all of my priorities out of nowhere especially during a time when for me, life was good. Is there a disorder or something? I want to fix it, I am so disgusted with myself I’m doing so many weird things. I want to break up with my perfect boyfriend because I feel like he could do so much better it feels like a joke that he chooses to be with me. He doesn’t know about not graduating but he knows that about past struggles. I can’t even use my dad as an excuse anymore, he’s mostly good to me now.

So I (22F) and my boyfriend (27M) are due a baby girl in September, all going well. Now my MIL is the absolute spawn of Satan and is horrible and manipulative and gets away with whatever she wants. 

A bit of background, me and my boyfriend were together for a year a couple of years ago then split up, both getting with other people for a few months. We then had each broken up with the people we were seeing and started talking again when we found out the girl he was seeing was pregnant. After a rough couple of months we decided we would be together (as there was no chance of my BF and his Ex getting back together) and we’d just take things as they come. The whole way through the pregnancy my MIL praised me for how great and calm I was being as she had pointed out she and many would have run for the hills. 

Now my MIL’s parenting skills are something we don’t agree on. I work in a nursery and have done for 5 years so I have a pretty good idea on children and babies and how to bring them up, whereas she is a smothering type of parent who lets all of her kids sleep in bed with her up until they were 13 (BFs younger sister is 14 and still sleeps in bed with her and always has). My BF doesn’t have much idea about babies and will always listen to how I would do things and such. 

So when the baby came last August we were getting along fine until she started to undermine me and my BF on what we should be doing when the baby was with us, telling us we were wrong in whatever we were doing. Now my BF is very close to his Mam and can’t see a problem with the way she used to speak to me because “that’s just what she’s like”. She buys all of her kids affections and spends an ungodly amount of money on all three kids just so they’ll go and see her or do something for her. 

We often went through stages of not speaking and then being okay until not long after Christmas when I had took my BFs baby to see my family for 30 minutes (with his permission) so they could see her and give her Christmas present etc. I had left my phone in the car and when I got back in to take the baby to our house I had calls and messages from his MIL asking where I was even though my BF knew exactly where I was so when I had got to my BF she was there and shouted and screamed at me the second I walked through the door for not answering my phone. I asked who the fuck she thought she was talking to and stormed out and we have barely spoke since. 

We found out I was pregnant at the end of January with a surprise (obviously not great when he has a 4 month old but what can you do). She still hasn’t spoken to me since finding out I was pregnant but seems to think she’ll be able to spoil this grandchild like she has the others. We’re in the middle of buying a house with some funding from my parents who have been amazing all the way through, lending us the deposit and paying for a rewire/new kitchen/ new bathroom for our house all costing up to 10 grand. Now I don’t want my MIL seeing my baby and I don’t want her in my new house as she has been nothing but horrible and makes snide comments about me and my family and to top it all off she smokes in the house, so even more reason for my baby not to go into her house. 

What do I do?? My BF obviously thinks I won’t go through with her not seeing the baby but I’m not budging as I don’t want my baby around that.",05Jun2020,1

616,"I guess I don't know how to take it. I'll give you a little background before I give the situation. I'm black. Well half black. That's besides the point. I've been with my wife for 8 years, married for 2. My father in law grew up in an environment where he wasn't fond of black ppl. When I first started dating his daughter, he was upset and made threats to his wife that he would shoot me. I first thought it was what every father thought once someone started dating their daughter. I was then told he not fond of black ppl. At one point his wife told her daughter to break up with me but as time passed, she realized that wasn't right and couldn't be around the hate and threatened to divorce. They split for a while, he finds God. They get back together and he apologies to me. I was raised religious but am not no longer but feel like if religion makes u a better person I'm all for it. Years pass, everything is smooth.

Now for the situation. He lets us use a generator because our power went out for a couple hours and we needed to keep the fridge on for my wife's breast milk. Afterwards, he comes to pick it up and when I'm helping him haul it in his truck. He then says I heard your dad a bad day. I'm like oh really, haven't talked to him in a couple of days. He said, ""yea several people were calling him nigger.""

I stood there for a quick second and I'm like, ""I'm kind of surprised you said it.""

He stands there for a quick second and goes, ""yea it's crazy what's going on down there."" I think he was oblivious to what he said, or he just didn't care.

Am I wrong for being offended? He said it since he was told to him as such, but like even if that's in conversation, is that shit justified?

I want to text him, but frankly, i dont know what to say at this point as he didnt call me one, but still, I feel like I should let him know I dont appreciate him using that word.",05Jun2020,1
618,"I’m new to reddit, I’m a big time lurker and I have this predicament so to speak. I was debating on whether to put this on r/AITA but I already know I am but anyways here’s where I need advice. 

Some backstory:

My bff (45f) and I (37f) have been friends for about 15 years. We met when we lived in the same housing complex. We both had 2 kids(at the time) and our youngest girls were a month apart in age so we hung out often. After a few years I moved a few towns over and we lost touch for a little while just due to our lives being busy. 
She moved 2.5 hrs away and I went up to visit a few times (she doesn’t drive) she met this guy on a dating site or something and I went up to being her town to our hometown to meet him. They hit it off pretty well and started dating. He was a dick. Very controlling and mentally abusive. They got a house in the town she was living and they lived there for a couple years. They decided to come back to our hometown. Well “Dick” didn’t like me, not entirely sure why but whatever he was a dick. Anyways, they were together for 5ish years and when she finally left him she had nothing. Being the friend and person I am I put a cell phone in my name for her. I put it on the lowest plan available. For a while I was covering her portion of the bill. She had youngish kids and was looking for work again and I didn’t want her to go without a phone. The last few years she’s been paying the bill mostly on time and always in full. Sometimes pay days don’t line up with bill due dates but overall it’s being paid so I had no problem covering it for a few days. 



When all this worldly stuff started she fell behind on the bill again, I understand, she is a waitress, the restaurant was closed and she had no income coming in. She asked for some help with getting unemployment. Since I work seasonally I’m often on unemployment and can fill out the reports in my sleep. I said I would help her with it. I needed some banking information from her so she gave me her login info. Out of habit I automatically save passwords etc in my phone otherwise I don’t remember squat. (This is where I come in as an asshole) I saved her banking info on my phone. 

We were talking a couple weeks ago and at some point she brought up the phone bill (it wasn’t due till the 1st) she asked if I could wait till her unemployment came in. I said that was fine. Then she said “well maybe I should just pay it now, I have $ in my acct” I told her whatever works for her, I could wait the few days if needed. So she didn’t send me the $ then. A few days after the bill was paid I sent her a text asking about the bill. She told me she couldn’t pay it right now, that XYZ company took out 3 months of payments that were supposed to be deferred and that she couldn’t even cover her rent. I told her ok no problem. But (yup I’m an asshole!!) I logged into her bank acct and can see she has $ in it. Not a lot but enough to cover the $60 phone bill and have a $100+ left over. Plus her rent was paid, in full. 

So I’m not sure what to do. I don’t like being lied too (no one does). There’s no reason to lie to me about it. I’m extremely understanding and will help when and where I can. But if I confront her I have to admit to being an asshole for looking into her acct. So here I am looking to all you wonderful redditors lol 

TL;DR - BFF lies about not having $ to pay her phone bill that is in my name, I’m an asshole for looking at her bank statement and seeing she does have the $.",05Jun2020,1
620,"I need advice. Short version- I have 25 years of experience for a very technical industry, but I still feel like I’m under qualified for my new job and I’m not sure what to do. I wake up every day having a panic attack that I’m going to get fired for not knowing what I’m doing.   I can’t tell if this is just anxiety/imposter syndrome or if I should quit before I get fired. 

More detail: I’m experienced in my field. I have been a senior director of marketing, managed teams, got big projects done, worked with CEOs of big companies to get results. I’ve achieved a lot and have lots of business experience in my field. My strengths are writing, presenting, and strategic planning for marketing and brand campaigns.  A few years ago I took a job that over time, I ended up hating for a big company.  I started out fine but was squeezed into doing very administrative work. A big wig there had it out for me and was  borderline abusive (insulting me in meetings etc and undermining my work.)  It gave a big blow to my confidence.  I wanted out of the company and tried to get hired anywhere else.  

When I got referred to a role at a highly respectable company in my field I jumped at it.  The company is frequently in the media, and the job is in their media and communications department.  My specific job is to get a particular business group more media exposure.  

It’s an awesome team and job and has and tons of potential.  My problem is two fold:

A) I really understand marketing, and the business, but not media relations.  People told me while I was interviewing that as long as I understand the business I could figure out media relations as I went along.  I do know a few reporters, written press releases, and I’ve helped out with plenty of interviews in my many years in the field.  I’ve just never had a job where my whole job is to get media exposure.

B) the job itself is really new and all over the place, so I’m not stepping into someone else’s role who can help guide me.  It requires me to jump in with both feet and pretty much as a solo operator to make things work. I have no direct reports and my boss is extremely hands off. There is no direction for my expectations other than “figure this out for us” and “get us more press.”

When I interviewed for the job I told everyone that I didn’t have a long list of media contacts but that “I know a few of the right people.”  But The truth is I’ve never had to actually pitch a story without the help of a PR agency.  I was so desperate for a job I thought whatever happened I could just figure it out. 

It’s now been a month- I have a plan together and some good ideas, but the actual act of getting media placements is so foreign to me.  Oh yeah-  and I onboarded completely remotely because of the pandemic! 

I wake up every day in terror that I’ve made a huge mistake.  Because we are all remote I have to be a total self starter from my computer and phone to get answers to my questions and feel involved with the team, and try and do this with confidence and calm.  But Every day feels like I’m just lost.  Even though the people who hired me knows I wasn’t a super seasoned press person...I think they assume I know more than I do and I feel like a fraud.

I can’t lose this job.  I have to make it work.  I want to apply myself and figure it out but I feel like there is a spotlight on me and not really a safe way to learn as I go.  

Thanks for the advice.",05Jun2020,1

627,"Brother in law passed away and it's likely the family has little money.  So my wife is already stating we may have to pay for most of it.

Can I voice my opinion to my wife and the family on what we should/shouldn't pay for and how others should help, or should I just let my wife run with it?

Back story - We could pay for it if need be, but i'm not sure that entirely fair.   Brother in law didn't take care of himself and pretty much made his kids hate him.  While i'm guessing one of the kids will be the executor, they don't have any money either, and the parents are retired with just enough to get by.

On the flip side, my wife is one of those, 'we'll just pay for it because it's easier that way' kind of people, and is controlling so would rather pay and control then share the cost and decision making.  While we both work, i feel like we've worked hard for our money and shouldn't just spent it so easily.

To restate - considering the details, should I just accepted that we may have to pay something like $5k to $10k or should I push back some?   I want to support my wife, i don't want to cause trouble in this troubling time, but i want to be smart about this as well.

He decided to feign ignorance at the comment and texted saying ""I don't know what you're on"".

Due to me being scared of conflict, I didn't read the message till the day after. The topics in the group chat have since moved on.

Do I speak up and rekindle the topic that he's racist? There's people in the group chat that explicitly know what he said to me - but I reckon they won't support me given how antisocial I typically am.

Expat American here. A group of us are planning on holding a fundraiser to help with bail bonds for protesters. The question is where the funds would best be allocated.

I've also heard of a few Southern states doubling bail bonds so that's an idea. Resistancemaps.com has a great list of organizations which we ccan directly donate to and that's fantastic. But.

645,"Now to start it's really important that I mention that this isn't intended to be a ""poor me"" post or that my problems are bigger than what the black community must be going through right now. In case it matters, I consider myself a slightly right than moderate libertarian. I hope we can all view this post from the standpoint of basic human interaction without political hard feelings.

My best friend growing up has developed very strong left wing view points through the years, largely fueled by some other guys we went to school with. He came from a very Christian/Right Wing background which he hated and he felt comfort with these guys. I've watched them completely change his identity as a person throughout the years, mostly in regard to his interests and how he interacts with people politically.

For the longest time we didn't let this get in the way of our friendship. Sure we've had many debates over the years and several have gotten ugly but at the end of the day we accepted the fact that it's okay to disagree. 

This brings us to current day post George Floyd incident.. I guess I should go ahead and explain my view on the matter: Yes I agree that George Floyd was wrongly killed and deserves justice, I also agree that black lives do matter but I take issue with some of the behaviors of the established group Black Lives Matter. Mostly their failure to condemn violent rioting and lack of presence for black on black homicide. This friend who is no longer talking to me is self admittedly communist and as far left on these matters as possible. He believes in the total destruction of property and businesses for a cultural revolution and viciously attacks people on Facebook for thinking any differently. An example of this is when somebody we were both friends with shared a video of a homeless man's mattress being burnt to ashes from rioters.. He got SO angry, not because of what they did to this man but because he thought it was disrespectful to the Black Lives Matter movement. Me and him had a few basic back and forths about the current day situation but nothing too ugly. Which takes us to yesterday when he messaged me out of the blue saying nothing but ""Black Lives Matter or All Lives Matter?""

Now personally I don't side with either because I think it's a stupid nomenclature battle that divides people even more over something they're basically both agreeing about, that nobody should be wrongly killed. I told him this, along with my grievances about the Black Lives Matter movement and said of course I agree that black people's lives matter. He said ""No, without any variation of the phrase. Can you say Black Lives Matter?"" To which I responded ""I'm not going to be indoctrinated into telling you what you want to hear, if you want to have a conversation then lets have one."" 

He wasn't having any of that and basically said that he needed to morally stop talking to me and if I changed my mind I can text him because he will be blocking me on all social media platforms. Well a day or so has gone by and I was getting ready to tell him that I was sorry for hesitating on saying ""Black Lives Matter"" but at the same time an ultimatum isn't the start to a healthy conversation and we need that the most right now. I noticed that the only social media outlet he forgot to block me on was snapchat, so I asked him for his number on there and said I had things to tell him. He then proceeded to block me on there and I also noticed that his roommate ""our childhood friend who's very much the same way and helped influence him"" had deleted me on facebook. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm turning to this group for advice on how to deal with being completely disowned over a disagreement. I'd understand if I didn't care about black lives but I've been very consistent in saying that I do. I'm somebody who's very prone to anxiety and it's through the roof right now.

646,"My ""best friend"" of 15 years told me she's jealous of me because i didn't lose my virginity and that im pursing further education. I helped her so much in school. She never gives me advice or talks, and im always the one doing the talking. She only admitted all this after hearing about me getting suspended from school due to low grades( and depression, my father passed away). I even helped her get back into school, however she didn't want to put the effort on her part. She says its too expensive(1500 per semester) but she spends money on video game systems, makeup products and games(she has xbox, nintendo switch etc).

I feel bad she says she was jealous because the past few years have been really hard for me at school, with losing my parent and having multiple surgeries, what could be there to envy about?She's been so quiet with me these past few years because she was always jealous me. I always wanted the best for her. She has no friends except me. Ever since covid 19 she hasn't messaged me once to ask about how i was doing.

I always used to message her first to as how shes doing, however she tells me that she doesn't like when i don't reply back to her messages. Like if i forget to reply back to her, she NEVER replied back for example saying ""ohh did you read my previous message"". However its okay for her not to reply to my messages after i reply back.

She's jealous of me for being a virgin, but what does she want for herself to feel better? Does she want me to get raped or something jeez. She doesn't even have children. Also she told me if she gets married she doesn't want me to see her husband because she gets jealous easily. We were ""best friends"" but she says were not best friends anymore and just friends, that really hurt me but i still wanted her as a friend in my life.

Should I be happy she actually told me the truth? Or should i be upset. I don't know what to think. Should we remain acquaintances? I was stupid and i said ""its okay"" but its been on my nerves. I really trusted her and it hurts knowing how she really felt during the hardest time in my life. I want to say something about it to her but i don't know what. Thanks for reading all this, appreciate it. Would like some advice on what to do. 

She admitted all this after i lost everything.

648,"I have been sexually assaulted 3 times and I blame myself. 
 
Bit of a background: my Dad and my stepmom kicked me out when I was 19. I had no job, no money and no place to go. I had a boyfriend I met at a bus stop. We lived with his mom for a while then we moved in with his dad for a bit. 
 
My boyfriend was violent, his whole family was. I moved out (I tried and failed to get a restraining order). I moved in with a friend I worked with. He was older (he had a daughter older than me). I was 21 now. I moved into his room at a rooming house. That first night he told me I could sleep in the bed and he’d sleep in the chair. I woke up in the middle of the night and he was on top of me. He saw I was awake and gave me a dirty look and got off of me. Most people would leave but I had no place to go. 
 
Thankfully I eventually got away thanks to a kind police officer who gave me a card for a place for abused women. 

 When I was 22 I got married (very quick courtship). My husband forced me a few times. But I’m narrowing it down to two because two different kinds of forcing. As I previously posted, he used to tickle me. I’d tell him to stop but he’d continue until I was crying and begging him to please stop. Then he’d be aroused him and he’d have sex with me. I wouldn’t protest anymore because at least he wasn’t tickling me. 

 Then many years later we were goofing around and chasing each other. It suddenly became serious because I stumbled on to the couch. He held me down and forced his penis into my mouth. Then he complained...in front of his brother, days later about my teeth hurting him. I fired back that something like that can happen when you force someone. 

  I never left him. He got sick later and I stayed by his side and took care of him until he died. 

 Now I hate myself. I’m glad I was with him because he was a hard person to be around and if not for me he’d only have had his brother. Actually not even that. I risked my life driving straight through from Texas to Wisconsin overnight for him. 

 I hate myself and I want to die. His death actually lead me to a wonderful man who I love very much. I don’t feel worthy of love.

653,"The title might be very confusing, to anyone just seeing this it doesn’t make sense, but let me explain. 

In one of my past relationships I was abused so badly that I almost took my life a few times. I knew that if I made her happy, she could let me be happy. After our separation I’m unable to accept being mean to people. I say yes to everyone and follow whatever anyone else wants to do. My biggest fear is that I would become my abuser, so I’m unable to have a say for myself, stand up for what I believe in, and follow my own path in life, and it really has an affect on me.

For example I recently got into another relationship, this time with a boy, and I hurt him. I regret it, I was wrong, but I did. What happened was we began talking less, the relationship was starting to fade, and the lack of communication reminded me of the isolation my abusive ex put me through, and I couldn’t handle it. Another factor was I was unable to say no to him. For example I sent inappropriate pictures when he asked, even if I wasn’t comfortable taking them. And the biggest problem was I totally played with his feelings. Every day he would try checking up on me and I would tell him I was happy and I was feeling good about our relationship. He believed it, but the only reason why I did this was because I didn’t want to hurt him, but I made things worse when I couldn’t handle the pain anymore and let it my emotions free. 

He confronted me, “you played with my feelings, imagine being that low of a person.” He continued contacting me, he posted mean comments trying to expose me on my social media, he was in pain and I caused it. I tried to apologize. I snapped him and wrote terrible things about myself, because I knew it would make him feel better. We were only dating for two weeks, I wasn’t expecting to kill his self esteem.

Now it’s become a daily thing. Him sending a picture of him crying, me bashing myself telling him I’m sorry and that I’m here for him. We agreed to be friends, but he refuses to talk to me, only replying with “okay.” I’ve been crying so much, I don’t get sleep, I barely eat, because I feel so much guilt. I’m a terrible person, I get it, anyone who plays with someone’s feelings is, but I can’t handle all of this sadness. 

I decided to ask my friend for advice, and she said, “well we all hurt people in our lives, and we will all get hurt by people in our lives. We have to accept it the way it is.” And it actually made a lot of sense. I just don’t know if I can accept hurting someone without totally going down a terrible rabbit hole of guilt. So if anyone can help me be meaner and stronger, it would really help. And also on top of that, what do I do with my ex boyfriend sending me pictures of him crying, how can I prove I’m sorry?

655,"I’m an American currently in Australia, and there’s a BLM protest tomorrow where I live. I’ve been watching the protests back home and I’ve been feeling very frustrated because I want to join and show my support. Obviously tomorrow is an opportunity to do that. 

However, weeks ago my friend and I made plans for me to come stay the weekend with her and her (older) parents—she’s supposed to pick me up tomorrow. Even if I managed to go to the protests before she picked me up, I’m worried about the possibility of picking up Covid and spreading it. My friend (who has some immune system problems), her parents (who are older), and my housemate (who is doctor for kids) all have varying degrees of risk.

I feel selfish for wanting to go to the protests, then frustrated since I badly want to participate and the virus numbers in Aus are quite low. Maybe my fears about passing on the virus are unjustified...but if not...I don’t want to be responsible for that.

657,"So I (15f) became friends with this guy online (17m) and we really hitted off. After a while we caught feelings for each other. He (let's call him M) asked me to be his girlfriend after 1 day of talking, and I said I just wanna wait a bit and get to know him, coz its moving really fast. He was  very respectful and cool about it. 
We talked for about a month, and he said he rly likes me. He would mention things like ""when we meet up"" and ""when we move in together"" which kinda freaked me out, coz we had been talking for *literally* one month. We live in different continents, mind you. 
So the person who introduced him to me was a very good friend of mine, let's call her C. C and M have been like best friends for a long time, they live like an hour away from each other. She was recently in hospital, and came out yesterday. She couldnt go back home, so she was gonna stay with M for a while. M picked her up and shes staying with him and whatever. She kept telling me how horny she is, and ""I might as well give my body what it wants ;)"". 
I was kinda concerned, seeing as she was staying with a guy I'm talking to (we arent even dating, idk what we are) and his parents were away for the weekend. C and I were talking, and she said shes so horny and ""was on the hunt"". 
I asked who she was thinking of and she went ""well I dont wanna catch Rona and M is here soo"". 
I was... taken aback. She was the one who introduced me to him, and she'd ask how the 2 love birds are going etc. She knew we were... involved. I just brushed it off for now, trying not to work myself up about it. I woke up this morning and talked to M. He seemed normal and all was pretty normal. Later I spoke to C, and she said ""I got news btwww"" and I thought maybe she can go back home or something like that. She then proceeded to tell me that her and M slept together last night.

660,"My parents moved to the US in the 70's along with a number of extended family members from my father's side. They've been spread across the US ever since. Through my memory my family has moved from middle class to upper-middle class. Before I was born they were poor students.

I have no doubt my grandmother on my father's side wasn't nice to my mother, that is par for the course where they came from, but she died twenty years ago. If my extended family was mean to her I never witnessed it. My mother is obsessed with the idea that my extended family led by my grandmother has used black magic to make her miserable over the course of her life. She thinks whenever they visit they leave spell tokens, etc. etc. to hurt my side of the family. Anything bad that has happened is a direct result of their meddling. If I lost a job it was because the extended family was against her. They couldn't sell their house for as much as they were hoping, the house was cursed.

Her belief to this effect has just gotten worse over the years, and far more elaborate. Cousins are being sent overseas to learn the craft and carry on her torment, etc. etc. She won't give hugs because they'll use it as an opportunity to do something; no one can visit her home or they'll cast a curse. The most embarrassing part is she no longer bothers hiding this belief. She will outright accuse people of this. She will mutter and complain at family functions about how my grandmother used to cast spells. My aunts will gaslight her, and one of my uncles got angry and snapped at her when she started making comments about his mother. My father just bears it and ignores her. She is increasingly mean spirited, and embraces it. She thinks her continued survival is in spite of them.

I know if there is a family function she will insist on going, and she will persist in acting out. This is mainly because my sister and I are too 'naive' to see their evil ways, so she needs to protect us. We've tried talking to her. We've told her that her outbursts are embarrassing to us. We've tried to point out that a wedding or a baby shower isn't the right place for her to air her grievances regarding our long dead grand mother. We've asked her to try to keep it to herself or if she needs to say something, that she should tell us and no one else. But she doesn't care, that she is 'too close to dying to let them keep walking all over her'.

Does anyone have an idea of how I could get her to be less crazy? Or get her to moderate her crazy? Or finally convince her she doesn't want to be around the extended family? I like my family, but she has driven a wedge between us and them, and she takes great pride in this.

Edit: Forgot to add, I'm a 33 year old male. I don't live with my parents, but I speak to them daily. This has been happening for a while, but a conversation my mother had with my sister made me realize how much worse she is getting, and I thought I'd ask for help.",05Jun2020,2

I don’t know what happened honestly but I just started not even being bothered to maintain friendships after a while anymore. I can make good initial conversations with someone, and then I’ll give up along the way. It’s embarrassing to tell someone you have no friends and I dread someone asking me stuff related to this.

I had one close friend in the past few years, that I cut off. From there, I moved towns many times and it may be hard to believe, but I was bullied in all three places. I think being alone made people pick on me more because I didn’t have anyone to stand up for me. Someone kept calling me the odd one out and it was a terrible time for me overall. 

Once these people had asked me if I wanted to hang out with them from class and I ended up sitting in the canteen with them, only for people from the year above to be making fun of me from a distance. I once had people from my class taking pictures of me walking home and laughing about it but I was alone so I didn’t say anything. This other time, this guy kept saying HAHA You have no friends to me and it was humiliating. Another time someone said they will be my friend even though I am brown. This was a few years ago but I still remember everything.

I don’t want to be clingy and I want to be able to have my own friends. This has been one of the biggest things I have been worried about actually because I know that will probably be a recipe for disaster.

I don’t know if I have become a toxic person overall myself either because of stuff that happened to me and if I’m the one that pushes away ever single opportunity to make friends and whether this is going to impact my relationships in the future.

- Ever since I was a child I was the shy and quiet type who barely has anyone to talk to.

- Ive been teased and bullied about my weight and how I am “fat” but when I look in the mirror I dont look that bad as people tell me

- I used to be bullied alot when I was 11-13 for being chubby which makes me feel insecure about my body

- Now that I am 16 (nearly 17) I have lost some chubbiness but im always teased by my parents, especially my dad. Whenever I walk past my dad he always comments on how I have a “fat belly”,bigger than his which really bothers me because I get really insecure about it. Sometimes I even hold it in when walking so I look less fat. He also comments on when I eat cake or biscuits when I have a cup of tea and says those are what making me fat. The thing here is im not eating tons of it, maybe a slice or two. 

- Because of all this I dont like and never take my shirt off or wear shorts in public which exposes me alot and I wish I could but I can never get myself too because I dont feel comfortable wearing it. 

- I do blame myself for being this way because i’m not into sports or working out. However I want to get into shape but cant get myself to because I hate being around people when going to the gym. I have alot of social anxiety problems because of strict parenting and struggle to communicate with others at school, being the loner etc.

So to start off, to make a very long story short, my mom and dad divorced when I was 7 or 8, my dad was remarried within a year and a half and my mom got remarried within a couple years.

When my mom remarried she married a man we will call him Shane. Shane and my mom ended up having a baby not far after they married. Let’s call him Mike. Mike, my brother and I are 10 years apart. 

Around 11 years old my step dad Shane and I would be alone in the house everyday from 3:30 when I got off the bus til about anywhere from 5-8 pm at night when my mom and brother would come home from work. During this time Shane started to do and say inappropriate things to me, he would purposely not wear underwear in front of me so his own penis would stick out, he would get undressed in the garage (he is a mechanic) and run to his room naked with me in sight, he was emotional abusive, he would fill my dinner plates with mounds of food and make me eat every bit even if that meant stay up til 10 pm) he took the locks off my doors. He would call me into his room while having porn of his computer screen. 

He was not a good man. (Also side story he is the father of 7 boys, from 3 different women, ages varying from mid 30s to 3 years old) 
My mom had no idea because he acted like the picture perfect guy in front of her but turned into the worst man when she wasn’t around. 
At the time I was still trying to figure out what was going on and I really didn’t fully understand the situation to even recognize how awful he was treating me. So I never told her. 

That went on for 4 years, until I moved out of her house and into my dads unexpectedly. Everyone knew something was up but didn’t pressure me to talk. Until one day my meme caught me in some words I said about Shane that sounded a bit weird, she wouldn’t let it go (we even missed church, and I’m from the south if you know what I mean....)and the truth had to come out. My mom left him immediately. 

She moved her and my brother out and eventually went on to a neighboring state where her mom was. I chose to stay behind with my dad but supported her moving. 

So all of that being said, I still grew up with my brother, but not like a normal brother and sister I see him 2-3 times a year. But for long periods of time. 
When we are together, he mentions his dad (keep in mind his dad is a dead beat who barely remembers to call to say happy birthday, he pays no child support, and barely holds down a job or a steady place to live and he’s in his 50s) any time my brother mentions his dad I either a. Try and end that conversation as fast as possible b. Don’t respond to the statement at all. 

But where my mom gets upset with me is SHE will bring Shane up to me (in front of him) and say something about him and I’ll be negative with my response. She gets mad because anytime we talk about Shane around people that’s not just us I am negative no matter what. My brother has confided in her asking why I hate his dad and she “covers” for me. She says she doesn’t want anything to make his already bad relationship with his dad even worse by showing that we hate him all time(because we do) She says that’s still his dad and he’s to young to understand the situation. But I think it shouldn’t matter. 

So here’s where I’m asking for advice am I in the wrong for being negative about my brothers dad in front of him? And for not seeing the problem in me being negative anytime Shane is brought up. I don’t go out of my way to say hey mike your dad is a piece of shit. Nor am I negative when he talks about him directly to me. I only speak negatively on it when SHE or another adult brings him up.


Edit post: I don’t ever mention my sexual abuse around my brother. My negativity that I say is just in every day conversations like her mentions Shane was supposed to cal my brother and he didn’t.

Edit: I am now 23 and my brother is now 13",05Jun2020,1
676,"I am really confused on what I need to do. My online ex bf and I have been very open about everything with each other. That was our special bond. But since  I thought we weren't together anymore, it's no longer appropriate to talk about those stuff. He became a bit distant because of that and he didn't talk to me for 2 days. he said he wanted to still chat and be open but I told him I don't want to because it makes me hope that he loves me. But he clearly said he can't love someone who is so far away. He did however say that I can be his real gf once I move to his country. I felt that our relationship was a bit one-sided and that I was expecting so much from him when in fact he was very straight forward about things.

I think I should just stop talking to him since it's obvious he just wants to chat when he wants to talk about those stuff. Should I still reach out or just let it go?",05Jun2020,1
677,"
We started talking and first met because of a game we both like, and we met on another website for that game. This was a few months ago, and we have been talking a few times a week almost every week since then.  
He has always been super nice and i do enjoy talking to him since we have a lot of common interests. I don’t have any irl friends that are gamers, so it’s nice to talk to someone that is also into that. 
However, while we were talking i did notice that he seemed to be very discreetly flirting with me, but i always just brushed it off thinking he didn’t mean it in that way. It was definitely not in an inappropriate way, just very subtle. 

Yesterday we were talking as usual when things got really weird. I was talking about how i’ve been having a hard time finding a job (mainly because of corona) and he told me something like “this is gonna sound weird” and then suggested that i create an onlyfans if things get rough... i was definitely a bit taken back by that but i just kinda laughed it off. After that he told me that he has been wanting to get into doing videos online... which i guess means he wants to do porn or explicit videos? 

I was really taken back by him saying that.. so i just kind of told him that he can do whatever he wants and stopped responding to him after that. I mean i don’t have any issues with that, he can do whatever he wants. I just found it weird that he would tell me that. 

Today i messaged him to tell him that what he said yesterday was weird and made me really comfortable, since we barely know each other. He apologized very seriously and told me he didn’t mean for it to sound weird or anything like that. 

I’m not sure what do here? Maybe i’m overreacting?",05Jun2020,1
678,"For the first half the year my Spanish grades were net bad. But in the second half, things began going downhill fast. I wasn't doing well at all, I stopped doing the work, I didn't pay attention and I was depressed. The teacher hated me and never helped me even when I go to her and ask her, she never gave me a chance. People keep telling me the only way to do well in her class is to kiss her ass, but I'm no brown noser, I'm wasn't going to act like an idiot and treat her like a god just to do well in a class, (because of that bullshit). She's the first person I actually hate.

In the last marking period, I had to turn things around, or else I would fail her class. I began working my ass off to do well in her class, I would do all the work, I would do everything she said. But last week we had what is potentially the last test of the year. I studied my ass off during the days leading up to the test. I would go to her extra help sessions whenever she had one. I did everything I could. Everyone around me did everything they could. But in the end, it was all for nothing. I'm bombed that test.

Now I'm going nuts trying to figure out what went wrong. How did I mess up this time? and what the hell do I do now?

Please I need help.

Thank you.",05Jun2020,1
679,"so first ill start with how I got into this mess. so I’ve been employed and worked for the same employer for the past 9 years doing labor extensive work and so one day at work I heard a pop in my right forearm followed by a severe pain in my palms! I immediately mentioned it to a fellow employee that I might have just hurt myself. in these situations when dealing with muscles and in a labor extensive field sometimes it just be a small tear or pull so you kind of have to wait for swelling to go down and see if it improves. Well in my case it never improved it stayed a constant. I notified the foremen in charge that I injured myself and  I needed to file a injury report. upon telling the foremen this information he began to argue and ask "" is it really that bad ! "" as if it would be such a burden to fill .

shortly after I went to the hospital to get it looked at by a professional who then recommended I go on light duty. And be placed on a waiting list to see a specialist. well my company decided screw the light duty just put him back to work same position same job that created the injury. forced to carry out my same job until I could be seen by a specialist , I would go through stages of swelling and tendon issues throughout the year battling both tendonitis and blown tendon sheath and would report to my supervisor that I could not operate and work that same position any longer but still he insisted i had too. Instead I get ostracized by fellow employees for not being able to perform. and belittled by higher ups that I just have weak wrists and that I’m complaining. then I catch this awful flu in November while working and it almost killed me I had to drive myself to the hospital with symptoms by myself after a 16 hr shift just to get tested and them tell me its negative for flu meanwhile I’m have insane flu symptoms I thought I was going to stop breathing. this was all while working in isolation in the Canadian wilderness. Where I returned to work while still having full symptoms because we have no paid sick days or sick days for that matter.

Fast forward its now February,  covid 19 has hit Ontario peoples are scrambling to find out how bad this virus is. we hear about the covid spread on the news and on media how its spreading and getting worse we imagine what it would be like if one of us had it and had brought it to work. What were the odds. Just then a co-worker mentioned his wife has it and he had just got back from a cruise ship and he somehow made it through it sit in that vary seat . they allowed him back to work and we were all sent home and told to quarantine for 14 days. we are then notified to apply for employment assurance and or benefit’s during this absence of work. I then applied to e.i and was put back on this service. immediately upon being home i started to show signs of illness whether it be from over exertion from working with the injury i then lost 30lbs . day 8 arrives and we are told the guy was tested and he was negative at the time . my supervisor calls us and tells me I have to resume work in Saskatchewan 2 provinces over and that i have to leave that following Sunday . I asked them if any of the policy has changed on regards to covid 19 because I am not in a state I can risk more illness . I was told nothing had changed in regards to covid 19 policy, so I respectfully refused . days go by and the same person constantly hounds me to return back to work but i ignore the call caused I don’t want to be forced into having to go to work where I can possibly come into contact with the sickness. with the weight loss and work related injury I just couldn’t put myself in the position to risk it. I’m then told I have lost my spot and position where I had worked and cant have it back if I return .
 weeks turn into months and my health does not improve so I call to get tested for coronavirus and receive a appointment. remember the news and reports of this virus are constantly changing as these days pass so I get the twist anyways but realize I probably needed the antibody test to late. the nurse was very aggressive in letting me know it was the wrong test but since I was there swab away!
Now remember I still have injury in my wrist but now my sebhoric dermatitis is acting up and I get eye pain neck pain and pink eye. As my e.i dwindles and I’m stuck wondering what I’m going to do. how am I going to make it. times have gotten really tough considering i was very athletic and in shape and 189 lbs now 154.
later on my test comes back negative . times get even harder and now I’m worried about employment and how am I going to fend the virus off my injuries and the labor extensive work I wasn’t supposed to be doing in the first place. I decide I’m going to have to bite the bullet and ask to return to work. I’m now blacklisted from returning to my previous position and am no longer allowed to work and out of spite am put on a waiting list to be contacted by a supervisor .
its now may 22 and two days before my 32 birthday and still no answer on what going on from HR nor supervisors nor health departments...nothing. out of the blue and what seems like a miracle my specialist calls about the waiting list I was on and wishes to see me . then covid 19 strikes again and he can only do an video assessment and based on his opinion states my injury tendinitis with a dash of snapping tendon. He requests I hand in wsib fac and functional abilities form ect.. so I then forward the papers and information to my specialist who then waits days to tell me they aren’t filled out properly so I ask what needs to be filled out so i can recommend it to my safety supervisor since they clearly don’t know how these forms work. I text him telling him they have to be filled out then signed by me but refuses to respond.
its now June 3rd no work , negative covid test , still sick, no antibody test, no work, employment insurance weeks are being used up so when winter comes because I’m seasonal I wont make next winter. ill be out and have nothing. I also live with a dependent and we both live on this one salary. 
That same salary I’m no longer in position to acquire to keep my house from folding in on mortgage. I’m  left here pondering my fate. how will I get through this?  ! Cant go back to school cause I got Bill’s so I cant even get work good enough to keep my livelihood.

so there yah have it! that’s my story! I don’t know if people are going through as rough of a patch as me. If  you do happen to read it  and relate just know you’re not alone!
TBH though I thought this kind of shit didn’t happen in Canada.

P.S I HAVE NO PARENTS OR IMMEADIATE FAMILY!",05Jun2020,2
680,"Hi fellow redditors! I’ve decided to post here in search of advice. I’m 28/F who enjoys playing videogames and making other people laugh. I’ve been working in hospitality as a bartender for the past 11 years. Long story short I left home when I was 17 due to domestic abuse and parental alcoholism and decided to go study computer sciences in another city. (I always wanted to study psychology but was always told that I’m naïve and not being realistic and that I’d never make it so I let it go) That didn’t go very well as I moved in with my godmother and her husband (unemployed parents-couldn’t afford rent) who a few months in, started to come into my bedroom to watch me sleep (had to pretend I was sleeping but in reality I was wide awake and petrified) and started touching me where he shouldn’t, amongst many other things that there’s no point in bringing up I’m sure you understand. My godmother was outraged when she understood what was going on and threw me out on the street. I was always very shy and I didn’t speak up even though I should have. My granny knew but told me to keep quiet because my dad would get very violent when he was drunk and he would have killed him.  I’ve got a history of abuse that’s left some deep scars, but I pursue self growth like there’s no tomorrow and I’m finally starting to heal after all these years. My studies went out the window of course as I was suddenly left without a permanent roof above my head, so I had to get a job in hospitality. Living in Greece, that was my only option back then. 
I’ve been working in hospitality ever since as a bartender. Due to the coronavirus of course, I’m out of work until October and down as a furlough worker which means I still make money but it’s just enough to get by. Have been trying to come up with alternative sources of income when a friend recommended, I should start streaming since I like to play so much. I enjoy playing overwatch and have been trying my hardest every day to get good.  But I don’t like the broadly known stigma that female streamers have created. And I feel it's something that could help me as well by getting me out of my comfort zone. 

So here’s the important bit. My journey through depression has made me understand a huge sum of things about life and how humans function. They are so many that I wouldn’t even know where to begin. I’ve combined my experience with reading books about psychology and through finding the courage to face my fears I’ve become a stronger, more resilient person than I used to be and my emotional intelligence has sky rocketed. I’ve always been an empath and very sensitive to other people’s feelings, but being where I am now I feel like I can actually help others do the same. I want to make people feel good. 

So here’s my idea. I want to create a “safe haven” sort of stream on twitch where people who are depressed and lonely can come by and chat, share what’s bothering them and play and have fun with me. I want to create something I wish I had when I felt alone and scared, something that will give people hope. And I also like the idea of having at least a small chance of making some money on the side as things are kind of rough now. (I decided after all these years to go after education again- doing a small lab tech course so I’ll finally be making enough money some day to help my family out, so getting a full time job now will jeopardize my studies). 

I feel like my purpose in life is to help and heal people. Do you guys think that something like this is viable and would stand a chance against *gamer girl bathwater* types of streams or am I silly and naïve for wanting something like this? I’m very open to constructive criticism (or any type of criticism for that matter- when you’ve bullied yourself for years you cant get bullied yo 😉 ) so feel free to speak your mind.
Thank you for taking the time to read this. Have a lovely day.",05Jun2020,2
682,"okay so i met my absolute dream guy and he clearly likes me too, he’s trustworthy and he’s overall pretty darn perfect. however, i’ve had bad experiences with toxic relationships/friendships so i push people away whenever i develop feelings and i try to convince myself that those feelings aren’t real (i.e. i don’t let myself get butterflies which i had previously) even tho i know that’s bs. the easiest way to explain this is that i can’t admit i like a song (not even in my head) bc i’ll get bored of it/not like it anymore.

anyways, i’ve noticed those feelings start to come up and i don’t put effort in to our conversations bc i don’t want to admit that i like him bc i know he likes me back and that’s so scary to me as that means it could actually go somewhere. but i want it to. it sounds confusing ik.

however, i know that once i pass a threshold then i will be all in and fully commit (which i’ve kind of started to do now as i deleted all dating apps i had).  normally i’m not into relationships but he seems worth it.

684,"Went through my girlfriends phone last week after getting curious found some messages on Instagram, from her ex, some messages were talking that they still missed each other and some dirty talk this was while we were together for 10 months in a serious relationship, about 2 years from right now there were messages she sent to him to come to where she lives to have sex with her and do some dirty things to her, he lives in another state so she was asking when he would be coming to near where she lives, he said he would be coming around next month for one day, but she said she was working, then the messages stopped for 7 days and my gf said “I miss you” the messages ended there, till 2 months ago she wished him a happy birthday and he said thanks. Finding these messages now I called her out on them and showed her the messages, she said the messages from 10 months after we got together, she wasn’t sure if our relationship was going to work so she was talking to him, which I believed we were fully committed saying we loved each other so much. She then said she was horny when she messaged him 2 years ago asking for him to come over to have sex, she cried and apologized and swore she never had sex with him since we’ve been to together almost going on 4 years, should I trust that she didn’t? She said she’s not talking to anyone else and wouldn’t cheat on me? But can I trust her now after she has done this?",05Jun2020,1
685,"Spoiler: Yes, I am depressed.

My grandmother died. She suffered a lot before, and I saw her corpse. She died among loved ones, sure, but jests.

My landlord assaulted me. I had to defend myself and get the hell out of dodge just three days ago. I'm living an hour away from everything that's familiar to me, with family. I'm so ashamed that it came to a fight with this psycho.

But my friend....that hurts more than anything. She was one of, if not the, best friend I have. I brought her into that house because she needed a place to stay very, very badly. She called the cops for me when that nutjob attacked me, and had my back all before it happened. But now...she has no where to go. So she's going back to her horribly Abusive ex. I've been begging her to not go back. Get a room with me, or couch surf until she finds place.... I'm not officially begging her to stay with me (though, I'd like that)....I'm begging her not to go back to him. She told me what this guy did to her and I genuinely am worried he's gonna kill her. 

I've been begging her to a point of where I said something in panic that betrayed her trust and she took it as 'blackmail'....but I didn't mean it like that; I was only trying to wake her up. She hasn't gotten back to me in half a day. I have no idea what's going on but I'm assuming the worst. I know I hurt her. I miss her so much already....yes, there are 'more than friends' feelings involved. I don't care about that right now.

687," So I (18M) was friends with a coworker (19F) and we were pretty close. Anyway after a while of being friends i caught feelings and just told her because it was eating at me. I got what I expected which was i don't see you that way and she just sees me as one of her best mates, that's fair enough she doesn't owe me anything. Now because of the lock downs we haven't seen each other for about 2 months. I just wanted some advice from you guys on if i should reach out to her? I know with rejection it normally makes most sense to just cut contact but I don't know because I did see her as a good friend before I even thought of her that way so I don't know whether its worth trying to salvage the friendship and I guess i wanted to hear if any other people have had a similar experience and whether it went to shit fast or worked out okay.

Also i'm pretty sure i'm over her so i'm not expecting anything to come from this for if any of you think i'm being one of those mugs who hopes she changes her mind lol, like if she turned around and said oh i like you now id be willing to give it a shot but i'm not sitting here thinking of her like that non stop anymore i guess lol.

This is all kinda new to me as I was never interested in having a girlfriend before as i felt i wasn't in a good mental state but i'm feeling much better recently hence the attempt.

688,"I live in a 3 family apartment with my girlfriend and daughter. The two tenants below us have significantly larger families (8+ and 5+ people) and produce a lot of trash/recycling. We only have 2 of each bin for all 3 families so needless to say they fill up quick. On a weekly basis the bins overflow to the point where things just get piled on top and the bins can't even close. Anything that can't be thrown on top ends up next to them in the yard. My landlord obviously wants to keep the property orderly so he asked if I could handle taking care of the bins each week in exchange for a decrease in rent. We will be starting to pay $900 a month starting this month. My responsibilities would be to take down and bring up the trash bins every week (the yard where they're kept is raised up from the sidewalk up a split set of stairs) and to keep the yard clear in regards to the trash. Also let it be known that nobody sorts or breaks down the recycling so I have to also do that to make things fit. I have a pretty decent relationship with the landlord so I don't want to name a price too high and be greedy/insulting but I also don't want to lose out on a price too low. I was thinking between $100-$150 a month but I'm looking for advice. Thank you!

TL;DR: my landlord asked me to handle the trash and recycling bins for my whole 3 family apartment in exchange for a rent decrease. The bins constantly overflow so I have to handle everybody else's trash to take the bins to the sidewalk. We pay $900/month so I'm looking to name a price for him",05Jun2020,1

696,"My boyfriend \[30M\] of almost five years left after a fight we had two days ago and hasn't texted or called. The original fight was due to the fact that we have been having communication and intimacy issues where he shuts down instead of talking to me \[29F\] about what is going on. Two days ago I tried to talk to him about the original fight (which happened almost five days ago) in order to fix the issue and he kept saying he didn't want to talk about it, but when I asked if we should just pretend everything is fine and he also said no to that. I then asked him what he wanted to do and he said he was unsure which made me become very frustrated and angry. I made it clear that I needed to know how he wanted to deal with this so we could find a solution that worked best for both of us and he became pretty angry at me. So I left the room to give him space (usually the only thing that helps when we argue hence why this is now a five day fight), but then a few hours later he told me that he wasn't sure if he wanted to be together anymore. I gave him space and began packing my stuff and organizing things just in case. I wanted to be prepared to leave as soon as possible to not drag anything out if he was going to dump me. He left our house and has been gone for two days now. It's not unusual for him to leave the house for an afternoon after a fight to collect himself, but it has never been this long before. 

We live together about eight hours away from our hometown so us breaking up isn't a small thing because I would need to move home to my mom's house and find another job. I'm not sure what to do at this point. I want to work this out as I truly care for him, but I feel like the way things have gone the past couple of days has shown that our relationship isn't healthy and I can't force someone to talk and fix things. I strongly believe that couples should be able to talk through issues regardless of how uncomfortable the situation is so this has been really difficult for me to be left wondering about what is going on. In the past he has dumped me a two previous times because he will get so worked when we have a conflict that he will break up with me for a few days only to apologize and say he wants me back. I don't know how to approach this situation in a healthy and positive manner. I haven't texted or called him because I don't want to pressure him about the situation anymore than I might have, but I also can't be stuck in limbo. Anyone have any advice? Do I just take his silence combined with him saying he was unsure if he wanted to continue our relationship as him actually breaking up with me? Do I just leave? Do I just leave him alone and wait for him to come back? Any support or help would be appreciated.",05Jun2020,1

There are very few jobs available in Alberta, so I would most likely need to move. The thought of moving to America as an Asian scares me, but I'm having trouble finding viable places in Canada.

I still need to upgrade my driver's license to be able to even apply for the lowest job at a funeral home, which I won't be able to do until I'm nearly done my diploma anyway. 

I feel a lot of pressure in both decisions, and I appreciate any advice.

TLDR;

Should I move provinces/countries and find a big girl job by the time I'm 20? Will I feel trapped? Does time frame after earning a diploma matter to employers? Or should I travel and take my time?",05Jun2020,1
698,"Now I know this persons a blackmailer but hear me out.

So about 6-7 months ago I sent a nude to a person posing as a female who I got to admit made a pretty convincing fake account. Now once I sent it and realised how stupid the move was I told the person to delete it and they said they did and threw a big fit about how they aren’t that type of person etc. now this person is a literal psychopath whoever it is boy or girl (99% chance a dude) had very very good manipulation tactics. They’d give off the impatient entitled sorta bitchy attitude where if you questioned the who they were or their legitimacy they’d immediately pull back hard so that they can lure you in again. Me at the time being stupid and horny didn’t think much of it. After I sent that nude they sounded pretty sincere in the fact that they wouldn’t show it to anyone (yes even for a blackmailer). So 3-4 months past with me thinking it was cool which it was but then I had got a message from them again on Snapchat. I didn’t delete them off of it as I thought it would keep the sort of truce in effect and they wouldn’t hold any sort of remorse (I barely used Snapchat anyway). Then they started a graceful chat again I thought it would be harmless but eventually they brought it up again saying if I wanted to meet them I’d have to give “her” what she wanted first. I couldn’t do it again I refused to be this persons pawn. So I tried to plead with them as they threatened to send the photo to my family members. I knew this person had some sort of empathy as when they got a little sour that I refused to give them what they want, they said they couldn’t do it to me as I was too nice. But then I guess their horniness took over and they started threatening again and as I was pleading I asked if they are going to expose the photos. They said I don’t know maybe if I feel like it because I was make them irritated. Eventually “she” said just block me. I asked her if I did would she expose the photos and they said who knows they might because I was annoying them. As dissatisfying an answer that was I decided to just block them and hope for the best. So like 2-3 months go by and nothing happened so I thought this person finally let me off. 

But just today this person messages me on Instagram on a message request so they can’t see that I’ve seen it. Saying “hey I just wanted to apologise” and “let me know if you get this yeah” 

What do you think I should do in this situation do yous believe this is a sincere apology? I haven’t written every single detail as it’d be too long but me being the one knowing everything about this situation I do believe there is some tinge of sincerity in this apology. I’m just too afraid to reply as I believe it might occur all over again. Or maybe if I don’t it will too?

Any opinions?",05Jun2020,1
700,"I have been separated from ex for 2 years.  We were together for 13 years never married with one daughter.  We have a parenting plan without a calendar.  We have been splitting 50/50 every other day successfully until the pandemic hit.  He is a bit extreme and is a hypochondriac.  He doesn't want to get the virus and is worried about my daughter and I catching it and him catching it from her going back and forth.  He won't watch my daughter unless I totally isolate for two weeks each time we switch.

I have been watching her since school transferred to homeschooling.  My work is looking to reopen soon.  I am trying to decide if it is best for her to go with him while I work until school starts and be completely isolated.  He will not agree to go back to our regular schedule of switching off every day even if schools resumes regularly.

He has multiple homes and allows me to live in one in exchange for child support.  He won't put this in writing and threatens to kick me out when we disagree on things.

So to keep a long story short my (26f) brother-in-law (24m) just started seeing a girl(24f) and I just had a bad feeling about her from the first time I met her. We are also roommates with brother-in-law. She seemed kind of rude(ignored me when I said hi to her), a little shady and I found it rather strange. So being me I did a little digging and turns out she has a boyfriend. She's messing around on him with my brother-in-law and naturally I told my hubby(26m) because it is his brother. Hubby asked him about it and he seems to think  she is in the middle of breaking up with her boyfriend which simply isn't true by the looks of it the boyfriend works night shift so she spends the night with in-laws then goes home in the morning to her boyfriend.

704,"
So, I’m a 17 year old dude who recently lost around 60 pounds and had a sort of “glow up” for myself. I grew up overweight and unattractive and now I think I look fairly good and healthy. All of a sudden, I started getting some attention from a girl. A girl that I had a small crush on for a little while but kind of forgot about it until she messaged me out of the blue one day a couple of months ago. We started talking quite a bit and we really meshed. We both have an interest in music, we both watch tons of movies and we share a hatred for communism lmao. Anyways, we talked SO much for around 3 months, and it progressed from small talk to some obvious flirting and I asked her out on a date. She said yes, but maybe a couple of days after, he ex boyfriend begged for her to take him back, which she did. Her ex is not the greatest guy, but if she really likes him I understand, I just can’t help but feel sad for how this all worked out. I truly liked her a lot, she was the first girl to even show me the time of day and it felt awesome to get attention from such a great girl. I can’t help but still have feelings for her and I don’t even know what to do. I feel sad and lonely as ever. I can’t really talk to my friends about it because I don’t trust them to keep my secrets. I just feel frustrated with how things work out for me. Every time I feel like something is working out, something has to go wrong. For the past WEEK every night I’ve had an awful nightmare where something goes incredibly wrong. I feel like I’m going through a breakup where the relationship never even happened. I’m just sad, I feel anxious about everything going on around me and barely anyone even knows about any of this, and I don’t want to say anything. I already miss talking to her because ever since she got back with her boyfriend, things haven’t been the same. I truly was excited for what was to come and now I just feel like I have nothing to look forward to anymore. I feel hopeless",05Jun2020,4

708,"This is a bit of a long one and I hope this belongs here but I am trying to explain my situation and inner conflict. TL;DR at the end. Also on mobile. 

My (26f) best friend (25f) is visually impaired and while she can read and use a zoom feature on her phone it isn't easy and can be tedious depending on how the site or app is set up. I got into reddit awhile ago through recommendations and seeing stuff on YouTube (YouTube addict but also becoming more addicted to reddit nowadays). I like to play those videos that read out reddit threads and such so she can experience the stories, information, and conversation without it being a pain for her since we spend so much time together and live in the same apartment.

The thing is I see a lot of anger towards this type of content on reddit itself and I also get annoyed when the stories aren't credited (especially if they don't read the comments much) or they cut off certain things. I wish reddit had a text to speech option on the app since even mispronounced stuff she can figure out with context (those crappy videos that use speech to text but don't fix the pronunciation has made it a necessary skill) and it would allow her to browse and click on titles or something to find stories/thread she is interested in for herself.

But until that becomes a feature we are stuck with the videos and I need advice. While I try to watch channels with actual people, sometimes those don't come out as frequently or they don't have what we are looking for in the type of stories we want to listen to at the time (or their structure is annoying and doesn't read the way she prefers). Also the algorithm just recommends reddit videos that are the ""spam"" type even when I try to primarily watch personal creators so sometimes they autoplay. I don't like the clickbait thumbnails and hate the channels that just pump out the text to speech videos without quality control but sometimes they have interesting ones/themes she wants to listen to and I don't want to discourage her interest. 

I feel conflicted as I love reddit and completely understand people who are frustrated at those who exploit their writings and mass produce it for ad revenue but I also want my friend to be able to participate with me and see the site how I do. She actually likes reddit now and (while we listen to videos while doing things around the house/hanging out, aka when sitting and reading it isn't as convenient) when I find something funny/interesting she asks me to read it rather than brushing it off. She will even have me try to find the post and upvote or comment if she wants to but since not all (or even most tbh) have links looking up each one is tedious if I wanted to give them an upvote or something. So I need some advice.

1) is there a way to have ad blocker on youtube on your phone so if I do decide to watch one of the channels that I usually try to avoid (or have a habit of not crediting the writers) that I wont give them ad revenue? Is this ethically sound? 

2) are there channels that you recommend that have better practices and credit authors (or even link the threads for the viewers) or participate so it isnt just spamming out videos without doing anything with them?

3) is there a text to speech app that works on reddit mobile? I wish the app and site were more accessible for those with vision disabilities or made it just easier to sort through if someone had that problem. She really likes it and the ""culture"" but it was discouraging for her for awhile because when she tried it it was just not as enjoyable for the amount of work she had to do to make sense of it all and she felt left out.



TL;DR I use reddit videos on YouTube to allow my friend who is visually impaired to experience (and nurture her interest in) reddit but due to the ethical issues and frequently voiced disdain of some of those types of videos I want to know if there is a way to avoid supporting the spam channels without missing out on the sheer number of stories and subreddits they cover? Are there creators you can recommend that reddit doesn't despise? 

Also suggestion for app/site feature to make it easier for vision impaired to click titles (or a speech button next to titles) on threads on subreddits/the homepage and read it via text to speech.",05Jun2020,1
709,"I'm 19 (M) now, and I live with my uncle at the moment. I'll be going to college in August but he wants to follow me there. I really don't mind if he comes along as long as he's not as overbearing as he is now. He literally won't let me do anything on my own. I want to learn to cook, clean and generally be self sufficient but he won't let me, he insists on doing everything himself. If I try to do anything on my own he gets angry and tells me he'll do it.

I've tried explaining to him that I've been an adult for a while now and I'm not going to rely on him forever but he refuses to listen to that. He tries to tell me that I don't rely on him for everything, but that's just simply not true. The only thing he lets me even help out with is dishes, he lets me clean those. He won't let me do laundry, cook, even sweep/mop. He won't even let me clean up if I spill something.

Another example just from today. I had to go pick up my cap and gown from my school, the school's like a 10 minute walk away but he insisted on coming along. I told him it would be faster for me to do it myself but he refused to let me go myself.

He says that he doesn't trust me to do the stuff on my own. The thing is how's he ever going to if he never gives me the chance to prove myself? What can I do here?",05Jun2020,2
710,"So, I have a boyfriend (18 M), we been together for three years now, I love him, but I think he doesn't love me anymore

You see, for about a couple of months he said some things that made me feel really insecure, like, I'm pretty sure he doesn't want to make me feel bad, but it still hurts and I don't want to tell him what things he says that make me feel bad because the last time I told him something about it he was answering like a whole week ""I can't tell you anything because you get sensitive"" whenever I asked for his opinion on something not related to what bothered me

And now, recently, he insist me so much to have sex with him, and I really don't want to, I don't think am ready and I'm really scared of pregnancy

So as I don't want to have sex with him, he says stuff like ""Then you let me have sex with other girls?"", or something like ""Sometimes my loyalty is a curse"" and that really makes me sad because it makes me feel like I'm not enough

And now I'm feeling even worse, the past week he said he felt like he was cursed, when I asked him why he said so, he told me ""I hate to be loyal, I got to be with a cute girl with a good heart, but she doesn't want to have sex, it makes me feel like I can't get whole things and I just get halfs"" and that made me feel like garbage, but didn't say a thing, I was just like ""hah"" now everytime he says he loves me it feels fake and it hurts

I know I'm not what he wants, I know he wants me to be someone I can't be (or he loves an idea of me), I love him, I want him to be happy, I want him to be with someone who is enough for him

But I don't want to break up

Not for me, not because I can't leave him go, if he isn't happy with me anymore I'm willing to let him go so he can be happy with someone else who he can love and loves him back as he wants

But he's been going through rough times, and even if right now he's doing ok and getting better, I don't want him to be sad anymore, and this is where I don't know what to do, I don't know if I could even talk with him about this without him getting hurt or sad somehow, and I been considering to stay with him until he decides to end our relationship

712,"So I’ve been having real body issues lately. To me I seem no different then what I was a year ago but everyone I knew kept telling me I was losing weight. Getting really skinny, etc. fading away. And they were right cause I had weighed myself and I was only about 100lbs after being 140 for the longest. I didn’t work out at all. 

I let a boy effect the way I saw my body. I saw that he would screenshot and save his friends of his that were girls pictures or he would secretly take pictures of other girls asses. I tried to explain to him my boundary and asked him if he could not do that kind of thing out of respect for me and these girls. Cause some of them I would meet in person and I couldn’t be comfortable with the thought of knowing my boyfriend would masturbate to these girls pictures. Be it a booty pic, a pic of them with there tits maybe being exposed/cleavage, beach pictures, them prolong there ass out. 

And I guess it just mentally fucked with me. I don’t even feel comfortable enough to send him my own nudes because I’m like he pretty much just likes anything what makes me anymore special just cause I am the girlfriend? Yeah he keeps mine but he has way more pics of his friends instagram pictures. 

PEOPLE HE KNOWS!!!! That’s what bothers me the most and I don’t know how to not let it bother me and it just continues to happen and I know I do it to myself by looking on his phone but I’m like come on dude why tf does it have to be the girls you fucking know and I just don’t know how to feel about it. And the only time he ever makes me feel body confident is during sex. But yes he will say things like I’m gorgeous, beautiful, cute 

But he’ll comment on my outfits and say oh that’s a lil too sexy so I can’t wear this or that. I can’t post a beach picture or anything too revealing because it’s too sexy. And he’ll say stuff like I just wanna keep you all too myself when I’m like how come you don’t really show me off?

If I wanted to I could go to college and get nice a job or go to trade school or something, but I’d rather leave my parents as soon as I graduate high school and just start working and move rent with a friend. I’m gonna be honest and say that they do have reasons to be mad at, like when I said fuck the police to the school cop. And have been caught with weed at school, and a vape. Also caught with weed at home smoking several times and indoors. Everything besides the police thing has happened within the past 12 months. I started feeling like this in 8th grade and really just progressed, I’m in the 12th now. I stay in my room all day and get high and sell weed not because I want to, but because they won’t let me get a license and get a job. I barely hang with friends because there’s nothing to do and I’d rather be relaxing in my room trying to get money.

715,"Hello. I (25M) just lost my job. I had been at home for the last three months due to the corona virus (I worked in carpentry/construction) but I was making my usual pay thanks to a loan from the government. It was fine as I was able to work on other projects, I draw on my free time, and very much enjoyed a break from the craziness of life and catch up on projects I've been putting off. But my boss called me today to inform me that the last check from the loan went out earlier this week and that I won't be brought back.

716,"I live in an apartment complex, and I have to start by saying my loud neighbour lets me use his unoccupied car bay for an additional vehicle of mine. 

Although, beyond letting me use his car bay, my neighbour is good for nothing. He’s overweight, smokes every hour and watches tv between the hours of 6:30am and 2am. That’s right, he watches TV about 19 hours per day, seven days a week and has been doing just that since I moved in over a year ago and other tenants say he has had the same lifestyle 5+ years. 

The issue is his tv is very loud, so much so I can make out every word in whatever he is watching, and I must sleep with a fan on each night to provide some white noise to sleep to. 

My moral dilemma is that, although the guy just mooches off the government and has no life I want to rip out his tv antenna cord which runs along the exterior of the building (almost like some unethical experiment to see what he would do without his one source of entertainment in his life), but my moral side says I should leave a note saying to turn down his tv between the hours of 11pm-7am.

However, I've been unable to shake an increasingly intensifying sense of existential dread due to my work responsibilities. I've been averaging about 2-4 hours of sleep a night for as long as I can remember now. I've tried taking a couple days off here and there to give myself time to refresh, but even on my ""off"" days, there is still an expectation for me to be plugged in and available.

In addition, all of the progress I've made over past several years to manage my anxiety issues have been erased in a matter of a couple months.  


For context, I'm a mid-20s single guy who lives alone. I don't make a ton of money, but have extremely low cost of living (tiny studio apartment) for being in a major metropolitan area. Currently able to to live off of roughly half of my monthly income, the rest goes directly to savings. I have enough saved to last me a year from next month at my current financial burn rate. 

I don't have anything lined up at the moment, but would like to get into more a creative field and could take the time to practice/build a portfolio doing volunteer work.

Now I find myself still thinking about him everyday, it's been 2 years, a pandemic and he doesn't leave my mind. I know he's not worth it but sometimes I think maybe I should've given him an explanation? maybe I was not showing enough interest to meet him too (I never texted first tbh) idk I really want to get over him, he still had me on his ""close friends"" list on ig until last month, he even told me once that I could stay at his house one time we were partying at a club that is really far from my house, he insisted a few times when we first met that we should have a coffee someday but I always told him that I was busy.

722,"To start this off I would like to explain how I got to this point. After highschool I went away to college and after one year I realized school just wasn't for me. During the last month of my last semester I was googling stuff I could do with my life so when I went home to my parents and told them I wanted to drop out of college, I could have an actual plan. This plan was to become an apprentice electrician.

&amp;#x200B;

Suprisingly they were proud of me for realizing college wasn't for me and having this plan and thought it was a good idea. In the matter of months I got a job working in the city near me and I did it for a couple of months. In those months, many of the people who were there for many years never had anything good to say about the company and pretty much told me to find something else.

&amp;#x200B;

I then got a job in my local union and had been working there for 8 months before Covid19 happened and got laid off. Ever since I have been collecting unemployment waiting for them to call back. The thing is, I don't really want them to call back. In this time I realized how miserable I actually was working these jobs. I hated waking up in the morning knowing what types of work I would be doing. Pretty much, every day I was miserable inside. When I got laid off it was almost a relief.

&amp;#x200B;

My dues to the Union are due this week and I have to pay them if I want to stay in, but I don't know if I want to. My parents will be livid if they find out but at the end of the day this is my life.  As the only real back up plan I have right now is getting a job at a restaurant or something when they start to open up again. Some of my friends are servers and make really good money. My mom's best friend is a server to this day. I think that will be something I enjoy and make good money at while I either figure out what I want to actually do with my life or continue being a server for a long time.

My friend who is 17  has been living with his aunt for a ver long time and she’s kinda crazy but this seems to be the last straw and she’s threatening to kick him out we’re extremely close and my family has offered to let him stay here but his aunt says no and she may be sending him to his dads who lives about an hour away he’d prefer to stay here with us but what can I do is there anyway to have him stay here with us?",05Jun2020,1
724,"My dad is an alcoholic, always has been always will be it seems.
I’ve had countless of arguments and messages with him asking him to stop drinking etc.

Anyway, yesterday I had enough. 
Me and my sister go round to my nan’s each night (where my dad lives as well) to help her get into bed, as caters are ridiculous expensive and it’s easier if we do it. It also allows my nan to go to bed when she wants rather then when the carers can get there. 

We normally end up chatting at stay til around 11/midnight. (We get there at around quarter to ten)

Anyway, my dad constantly argues that we shouldn’t be there and we shouldn’t stay this long, and he finally yelled at us for being there and continued saying we don’t care about him etc. Because I don’t tell him about uni.

I ended up crying in the downstairs toilet because I hate it when he’s like this. 

I find it difficult talking to my dad, honestly he feels like a stranger. He’s partially deaf so it’s hard to talk to him because he doesn’t wear hearing aids or learn sign language, so I have to yell or repeat myself to talk to him. So trying to tell stories about university or what’s being happening is hard. 

Anyway, normally he doesn’t remember what has happened and acts like nothing did happen, but the morning after I got a apology over text.
This is what it said:

I want to say sorry and apologise for upsetting you last night I just get so worried about two lovely girls in the car going back home late at night I know you’re not 14 anymore and next week you will be 21 but it doesn’t stop me worrying about you so I’m truly sorry xxx

He sent basically the same message to my sister.

I just feel so meh after reading that and I don’t know what to say. Any advice would be helpful?

I wish I could just ignore him, but he lives with my nan so it’s hard to.",05Jun2020,1

726,"My boyfriend claims he has been trying to look for a job for the past six weeks now. I know of maybe a handful of times he has actively looked, because he rarely even talks about it. He says he's going to do online teaching but for the past two weeks, the excuse has been that he needs to clean his room. He's had a lot of time to do this already. What I have noticed is he takes a lot of long walks, or has a lot of time for his spiritual life and pray, leisurely activities etc. But when it comes to job stuff, he's taking small jobs - like working on something that pays very little - ignoring suggestions I make pretty much - and working on projects that *could* pay some time. It's his life, but I can't ever move in with him until he gets some steady income. I'm fine with it taking a year or so for him to get his shit together, but for some reason, my attraction to him is dwindling. I feel like it shouldn't take this long and I feel like he is getting in his own way with excuses and laziness.(This is going to be long btw) Meanwhile, I'm working double shifts just to try to go visit him (we are long distance) The other thing is that because I'm working so hard (and honestly right now it's not even for extra money), I'm tired, stressed and anxious a lot of the time. I don't feel lovey dovey. I don't miss him while I'm busy. I honestly just want to sit back and watch one of my own shows at the end of the day. I don't want to video chat him or call him or watch one of the movies he likes. But the thing is he has no respect for my schedule. He kept me up late - choosing a movie that went over my bedtime. And then I couldn't sleep - insomnia kicked in - which caused more anxiety. He claims we can slow down after all that, but he also says I'm condescending and mean about the way I told him about how I felt. I \*really\* didn't think I was - but he goes on about how heartbroken he is, how he's sorry I feel the way I do, and how he wished he knew I wanted to wait to move in with him... (which honestly I didn't think it could be instant anyway with the circumstances.) And he's also halfway checked out of the relationship, himself, when I'm talking I notice he doesn't always listen/acknowledge. Sometimes it feels like it's very much about him and whenever I try to assert a boundary, it ends up being that I am mean or condescending or rude. Or he acts like a victim. Which I personally think is abusive. What's weird is how he said he did nothing but be understanding when I related my stress to him .... but the thing is he was until I asked him ""Do you really understand?"" He decided I'm condescending at that point. And he still sticks by that.

There's also a lot of little things about him I'm noticing that bother me - some red flags include: loving to argue/troll on the internet, using spirituality as maybe an escape or taking it seriously to the point where it runs his life (i.e. dramatic statements, social media posts, etc.), looking upset when we talk but saying nothing is wrong (definitely a lie) and when I ask him what's wrong he doesn't want to get into it - his choice. I'm sure he has stress, too. He has a tendency to talk bad about people - his friends, his exes. (I was smear campaigned against before we were dating which he said was based on a misunderstanding.)

Also, he has the tendency to turn off his phone or to walk away from arguments when something gets said that he doesn't like.

And then take ""sad naps""

And lose more job hunting time

I will add that we both have mood disorders.

The relationship also evolved at a rapid rate. We went from talking to him falling deeply, madly in love with me. I was falling for him, too but I also feel like there are just levels to all of that. It went from talking to, in love, to an urgency for me to move to his state. (Which honestly costs money and takes time to prepare for.) It also helps if he has a steady income, which he also kind of lied by omission about when we were first met and even when we dated. It went from he has three jobs, to two jobs, to just one that barely pays. It went from he makes probably as much as me, to half of what I make to not even half of what I make. If I had known how bad it was, I would have thought twice about getting in a relationship with him. It feels like a trick. He has lived with his parents most of his life. Like, honestly, I'd like someone who has it just a little more together. When I visit him, we'd have to stay in a hotel that I'd be paying for...

Not to mention he says he hates long distance. So, if we can't really close the distance, he's only going to be miserable. I worry sometimes he's looking for another mom or something. Someone who can pay the bills or whatever. I really don't want to be that. I am not going to let him financially abuse me like that.

Not to mention how he says he's loved me more than he's loved anyone, that he crossed oceans of time to find me (A blatant Dracula quote which he admits) - like he's convinced we were together in past lives. I always wondered if I was being love-bombed or rushed into the relationship.

I don't know if I want to break up - but I do know it all needs to slow down. I feel sick to my stomach. I was single for a whole year before we got together and I got used to my alone time, having a little more freedom. But I was also ready for a healthy relationship should it come along. Sometimes, I feel like we are very healthy - we can communicate a lot of the time. That's what drew me to him in the first place - he was an open communicator and still is. I won't just say there's all bad things in the relationship. But I will say that things have felt weird for a couple of weeks. Very up and down.

I expressed how I felt and he's totally upset. I almost want to say this is a guilt trip. Because when I let him know how I was feeling, I wanted to let him know minus judgment. I was also kind of pushed to talk about what was bothering me before I had time to formulate thoughts - something he does often. He gets too upset and doesn't give me time. He panics. Then gets upset when it comes out ""mean"" or ""condescending."" I hardly had time to think out what I wanted to say in a proper manner. Sometimes I just feel trapped.

I often have made poor choices in love. I worry he could be another covert narcissist. At the very least, he has toxic traits. Another example is how when he apologizes for something, he expects me to be over it quickly. Or how he gets mad about something and then he can go from that to instantly ""I'm not upset anymore. I'm over it."" So I guess he thinks I should be, too. I take way longer to process things than he does and often question whether he stops to think about things at all. I can't shove things under the rug like that. To me it feels like shoving something under the rug rather than actually cleaning up the mess.

I will also add that this isn't the first time stress with him has kept me up late and made me miss work. This could affect my livelihood. He doesn't even have a concept of a work schedule - the need to sleep early. The need to be productive in the day time, working. The need to save time together until the weekend.

I don't have a real TL;DR but if I had to sum this up - I'm feeling really weird about my boyfriend lately because he's jobless, lacks motivation, and his struggles often bleed into our relationship. I'm less attracted to him and I've been in evaluation mode for the past couple of weeks now. Things are just starting not to feel right. I also worry he guilt trips me, gaslights me,  love bombs me and has other toxic traits I don't know that I can deal with.

I guess advice wise, I'm just wondering if this sounds like I'm in an abusive relationship again? Or could this all be worked out? For context, he does have bipolar disorder. And I do have generalized anxiety disorder and possibly PMDD.",05Jun2020,1

729,"Hi Reddit,
So I (23F) am trying to figure out how to support the BLM movement. My current predicament is that I live in Los Angeles and have no contacts here so going to a protest would be a bit dangerous for me which is completely wrong because if you are peaceful it shouldn't be a problem. I also don't have a lot of money cuz moving out here was incredibly expensive and I'm still paying off a bunch of loans and credit cards. The other issue is my dad is a police officer (he is one of the good ones who thinks that every cop that uses excessive force on anyone is a disgrace to the uniform and should be punished to the fullest extent of the law. He has also fired many officers for discrimination. He and my mom have taught me to love people based on who they are and not how much melanin they have) But because of this (even though a lot of people wearing the uniform are an absolute disgrace) it's really hard for me to perpetuate cop hate. I do not want to do nothing because I want to be the change I want to see in the world. I think about my friends that come from different racial backgrounds and the thought of anyone hurting them for something as trivial as their skin colour makes me sick and angry. I just honestly do know what to do to show my support. Any advice or recommendations would be appreciated.",05Jun2020,1
730,"Just some background info, I'm in a low-income neighborhood, and there has been a growing crackhead epidemic, not to get into the specifics but there has been a drug circulating causing these guys to just gather on a property and take over it. I live next to 2 properties that are being reconstructed or worked on and currently have no one living in them. The crackheads have basically taken over these properties and live in them, smoke on them, and just chill all day on them and the owners have no idea. They used to walk through my backyard and neighbor's backyard constantly but our landlords have put up a wired fence but you know crackheads, where there is a will there is a way. 

Recently, one of them has gone into the entrance towards our backyard and took a dump. That was the last straw cause that is just foul. I always see them from my window in the morning and night, when I go to my car even when I take a step outside. I recently thought of ways to mess with for my amusement but have not acted yet. Basically I need help coming up with ways to mess with them and bring this problem to an end.

On the messing with them department, currently thought of planting a speaker that will somehow play random noises, maybe just an annoying one or a random scream even maybe a police siren to get them to scram. Maybe even a stink bomb?

On the serious department, I have started gathering evidence such as videos and maybe even the suspected dealer's car but I'm not too sure how to navigate the legal system, I'm sure I can make a complaint or something. Also thought of contacting the owners that own the properties but as u can imagine they live nowhere near here and are not around. Is there anything else I can do to help bring this problem to an end?",05Jun2020,1

I probably should have been more concerned when he mentioned it the first time. now he's at the point where he gets jealous of other co-workers being around me or even if he sees my boyfriend and I together.

733,"I literally can't take this anymore. I wish I can go back to my hostel away from my family. I am so stressed right now. All this work from uni, my life problems, my miserable living condition. I sometime wish i can die, i wish i had cash to fix my broken life. My parents literally don't understand each other. My dad always want everything to keep going according to him. He keep saying stuff and keeps ordering . It is so annoying to me. I always say to myself ""I have a fkin brain too. I can think what is right. "".  On the other side, my mom is literally not the smartest person when it comes to communicating what she wants. She talks to her selve just like a typical brown mom and exadurate the point. It usually ends up with her crying and going to sleep. And TBH my aunt, grandmother and other relatives are mentally ill. They  literally love to fight. I can literary see them using my dad right now. And once dad run's out of money and is of no use to my relatives they will throw him away. Its not the first time this is happening it happened before with us in 2010. But my dad is blinded by his family love. I am from a middle class family from a 3rd world country. Since my uni is in another city I live in a student hostel. People and my class mates always ask me ""why don't you go back home? Why do you stay even in Eid(biggest festival in our religion )? "". I even heard people saying   ""he never leaves his room and doesn't even go home to his family, he will die in his room too probably "". What they don't know is how much more do i have to suffer if i go back home, how much more do i have to be stressful, how bad the living conditions will be. We literally are a family of 6 living in a 2 room flat with bath and kitchen squeezed in to call it a home. My only hope is education. I literally work hard, killing away all my teenage dreams, killing away all stuff I find fun. Just so i can make enough room and time for education. I just want to leave my country and go to a better place. Where i can be happy, have a better Living standard. Ahhh my life is fked up. I want to escape. But for now i just want the whole situation to be less stressful. Idk what to say to my parents. I can't even tell you guys all the stuff. It's really really complicated. My dad is 60 and have health issues like diabetes and high blood pressure. My mom doesn't think logically, she does it very emotionally. I don't want my dad to be used by my relatives. The more i think the more i feel suicidal. Idk what to do. For me it ends up in ""its okay you are not ugly, you aren't dumb, it ain't your fault things are like this. God is just testing you. One day God will give you what you want. Just keep working hard and try your best to achieve what you want. It's a learning experience. Make sure you don't make your kids go through the same.

735,"Ok so my brother had been dating this girl for a year and a half and it's always something with her always. She has depression, suicidal thoughts, manipulative, and all around a child. Whenever a crisis occurs and it can be big or small my brother comes running to her side. If we are hanging out or made plans he drops everything and leaves. It's happened multiple times and treats me and my family like second class citizens. We have tried to tell him all this but he always says we have to be patient with her, her home life sucks blah blah blah. Ok yes it's sad but I dont want her crazy homelife mixed up with my peaceful sanity. He also cooks for her, cleans for her, does everything for her and she never helps. He is basically her maid but he doesnt see it that way because he says he wants to do it for her. Even when they fight he thinks it's his fault all the time because didnt ask her how her counseling went or he can say one wrong thing and she flips her shit. He is changing and all of us see it and are worried about him. I dont think he would break up with her even if he wanted to because he would be afraid she would hurt herself. They talked about moving in together and getting married and having 4 children. I'm afraid if he does marry her he will be the one to do everything and she will be to depressed to do anything. He was already not doing good in school and just barely passing because something would come up and he would run to her side. Since the whole covid thing came up he isnt going to school or looking for a job. He is spending all his savings just to take care of her. And what's worse is she has money from unemployment and her dads suicide around maybe 10,000 dollars and he still pays for everything!

737,"(And yes this is similar to something I posted yesterday, but its slightly different because I wanted to see if it made a difference in what people would say)

(Just something I'd like to say before you read all of this, it's a long one, and I talk about a fair amount of dirty stuff in it. Just a heads up)

I'm a male, 19. My friend, whom I've know since 3rd grade is also 19, female. I dont know if I'm just being stupid or what, but I cant figure this out for the life of me and I thought I'd go here to see if anyone could help me figure out.

So me and this close friend of mine, have been friends since we were kids. We've been each others only friends since we met, we've had other friends, but not any that weve kept being friends with for too long. Around 4-5 years ago we started talking more openly about everything and we talked about more sexual things. We've both been more open about how dirty we actually are around the other, and it keep going in the direction till they were in a relationship and we talked alot less about those kinda of things untill a few months ago when she broke up with them. (Up to this point we both had agreed we would never see each other in a romantic way.)

Shortly after that, we moved into an apartment together and shared a room for most of that time till the past month or so. Within the first month of living in the new house me and her started talking about dirty things again. She said she would like to get a few dirty things (such as rope) so she could try out shibari, but she didnt have alot of extra money after rent and bills so I offered to get it for her as an early Christmas gift and she was ok with it, despite feeling a little awkward/embarassed about it.

Fast forward to when it arrived and she was instantly wanting to do something with it, up to this point she had said she was interested in someone else and started dating them, and still says she is. But she was so excited that after a few days of it just sitting in the room she grabbed it and tried to do some shibari with it. I offered to help because we both agreed it ""wasn't sexual"" and it would be fine. (She was fully dressed while doing this) so I helped her by doing all the rope work and tying. We started by just doing a few simple leg ties while she was just sitting on the floor, and over the next few times it went to leg and arm cuffs, a few full body harnesses, and even tying her to the bed a few times. But within the first day or 2 of doing this I started getting ideas of things i could do while she was tied up, appearently it started to become noticeable because she brought it up after we stopped for the night and went to bed. (We had seperate beds) I said I started to get the appeal of shibari and she said ""i can tell, I'm surprised you haven't done anything."" And ""I bet you would if I was single"" I was surprised by that and the next time we did it after we put all the ropes away I said I wouldn't without her ok. (For the obvious reason of that would be non-concented) she tried to avoid saying anything more but I asked what she was avoiding saying and she said ""there wouldn't be a lack of concent"" which suprised me more then i can express.

I didn't end up doing anything because she's still dating this other person and she wanted them more, I said ok and we kept talking about more dirty things and doing a bit of shibari till the end of that first month then we stopped with the shibari. We continued talking about dirty things and it got to the point where we both expressed what we though I would do if given the opportunity back when we did the shibari and I had her tied up. We both went into a fair amount of detail but she had alot more detail and ended with me having her tied up on her bed and finishing in each hole.

We kept talking and its gone from anything as dirty as that to something as simple as just making dirty jokes, to realizing we both like everything the other does. However just recently while we were talking, she brought up masturbation and was talking to me while masturbating. Saying it didn't bother her when i was masturbating in the bedroom while she was 5 ft from me. I then said that if i had noticed her masturbating I would have likely gone over and done something about it, to which she just responded with ""oh, heheh"" I tried to get her to tell me what she meant by it and she refused, saying it was nothing. And to top that off she said that she told me she was masturbating ""to see what my reaction was"" which she's said she's almost done other things for that reason in the past.

I'm confused on whether she actually likes me, or if she's just chatting with me. And I've tried to pry her for answers but if I start to ask she just changes the conversation or refuse to answer. Am I just being stupid, or what. They still say that they've fallen in love with that person, but I'm not really sure at this point to be honest.",05Jun2020,1

740,"I'm going to try to condense this as much as I can so it is not one giant post. My brother got himself involved with my now sister-in-law a little over 12 years ago they have been married for 10 years. 
She has systematically taken advantage of my family for the entirety I have known her. 
I could see the red flags from the first day I met her. She was rude, condescending and very materialistic however, my brother didn't listen to any of us. To compound things my family being Greek they allowed them to live in the apartment next door to our own apartment. Throughout the years she has done nothing but verbally abuse, emotionally terrorize all of us. My brother is no angel himself. He is exactly like her, he is very manipulative and will gaslight everyone around him. She ended up brutally beating him with a metal water bottle in 2019 while she was driving and had their kids in the car. She filed a false police report which she later retracted her statement because child protective services got involved. 
My main concern right now is my mother. She is very meek and submissive and has suffered the absolute worse emotional abuse from my sister-in-law this week. It has been vicious telling her to go fuck herself etc. screaming at her. While my mother over the 10 years has funded her entire existence and raises her kids. They have no responsibility in life. They dump my nieces over here for 6+ hours at a time to have time to do ""house work"" when all they do is lounge around and then come back and expect my mother to cook meals for them, feed their children, bathe them clothe them etc. 
Which brings me to the question I have for this community. I am leaving at the end of July to move in with my fiancee because I cannot stand the toxic environment anymore. I need to empower my mother with knowledge and information. I did some background checks which my job allows me to do. I found that her family has extensive criminal history and money issues. Furthermore, the most suspicious thing to me is her mother listed herself as a resident of the apartment that my brother and sister-in-law currently reside in (they do not own it, my parents paid for it).
Does anyone know how to find out the origin of why she put that residence down? Do I email white pages and ask them when was the origination of this filing?  I am truly stumped I need to know that I can leave this information in my mothers hands when I leave so I can rest easy that she will not be taken advantage of anymore.",05Jun2020,1

After that, numbers lightened up and staffing was no longer a problem. Heck, even PPE for the most part became somewhat of a minor issue!

But my spouse and I are still leery of covid lingering and were dreading the day I would have to return to work because of the danger it might present to our infant child. We set up a changing station at our front door where I would dump my uniform and sanitize my personals like wallet and cell phone, and to shower immediately after getting home and designated an upstairs bedroom as an isolation room.

Since the lockdown most of my classmates just didn't study or payed attention to the  online classes.But it all changed when the teachers annonced that we are going to make exams based on the online classes.

Firstly there were exams based on multiple choice questions,one of my 'friends',kept asking me to do with him,I messed up and gave him the answers.

But this week the exams need written answers,not multiple choice ones,and this 'friend' is asking me to do it with him.I don't know how to politely decline it,because he will probably write the answers exatly like my answers and probably the teacher will notice it and I studied really hard for this exam,in my opinion it would be  unfair if someone who  didn't even read a single letter from the book get good grades.

The different names for them were Jame3, Stan and Jame2. the reason im asking about this is because its starting to get *weird.* I began talking to myself more often. It began when i was 8 and i started talking to myself, making a new identity named Jame3. Jame3 (at first) was trying to convince me to kill myself and burn down my house aswell as to stab my parents. He started changing though when Stan came and didn't speak much. 

Stan was, at the beggining, the same. He was very violent and told me to kill everybody and sometimes i would even think about it. I mean i could *see* the dead body of the people. It was horrible. Imagine being a 11 yr old kid (as i was at the time of this) and have multiple dreams and thoughts about killing friends and family then cutting off their limbs or burning them. In a dream that was the worst one i had ever had was where i drowned a a 14 yo girl and shoved her body in a box. It was horrifying. 

Jame2 just appeared recently. A little time before that Jame3 began sweet and happy. Stan became way less violent aswell but we wern't as good friends as me and Jame3. 

Jame2 was the most violent and insane thing ever. He told me to do horrible things. I kept a knife in my room and i dont know why. He told me to stab myself in the hand as he said ""it will kill me, Stan and Jame3. You will finnaly be happy.""

744,"Like a lot of people I was furloughed from my job a couple of months ago. Our managers advised us to apply for unemployment until we opened back up. I did and I eventually got the card in the mail for my benefits to go onto. More on that in a minute.

I’m fortunate enough that family has been helping support me as well; they usually send me enough money to make sure I at least have my rent covered for the month, anything beyond that is on me to cover with what I make at my job. Since I’ve been furloughed, they’ve increased the amount they transfer me to help cover the difference, and I am very grateful.

Now, I’m a bit of a dumbass. When I got the card, I didn’t activate it right away. I read the “valid thru” date on the card, and for some reason my brain went “oh, since it’s for unemployment it’s a temporary card. Since you have to file unemployment regularly, that’s the month and the day it expires. That’s pretty soon, so it’s kinda silly to activate it. They’ll just send me another one after this one expires and I’ll have to do the same thing again. I’ll just be more mindful in the meantime.”

Of course, that’s not how cards work. That expiration date is not the month and the *day*, it’s the month and the *year*. Meanwhile, I’m still filing my certification for unemployment, wondering why the benefits aren’t showing up in my account like an idiot.

So I finally called to activate the card today. Turns out, it was all just sitting there. And now that I know it’s there, I don’t know what to do with it. If I transfer it to my account now, my family will justifiably wonder where it came from. If I call them to explain what happened, I’m going to feel incredibly stupid and guilty because they’ve been doing more than they needed to to help me, when I could’ve just done the simple thing in the first place over a month ago. And I certainly don’t want to spend it without explaining what happened, I feel like that would be wrong.

749,"(I apologize for the long winded post and my grammar) 

We have been off and on since last year. I have been belittled in public, manipulated into thinking I’m a bad person; or that I’m crazy because she says that everything is fine and promises me things. There have been times where I have felt that I had been lied to, she constantly projects and says that I’m cheating. I could be with friends, and she will screenshot where I am via snapmap then send it to me asking “who are you with?” “I will never talk to you again!” “You treat me like shit.” She starts arguments when friends of hers who I don’t know are around, and I get emotional. I feel she wants that to happen to embarrass me in front of them. I know this sounds paranoid, but I feel like this person has made me feel this way. I feel I have to be now. My friends and family do not like her, and in fact both of my parents cried because they were extremely worried for me when we got back together.


We broke up in the fall of 2019 and I wanted to remain friends. She texted me one day and said that we should be friends with benefits. I thought, “ok cool, yeah let’s do that. Where’s the harm? We’re friends, I guess.” Fucking dumb stupid man moment. Weeks later she says that nobody loves her, that she wanted to kill herself, nobody cares about her etc. I was genuinely scared that she would do something to herself; so I told her that I loved her. Wow, do I feel like a fucking idiot. I’m also scared because I’m worried how I will be made out if I leave again. She often says that she knows a lot of big important people and I think she does that to intimidate me. One of her male friends threatened me last year that he’d crush my windpipe so I could never sing again if I ever did anything to make her upset. I am a session musician, singing is how I make my living. That was scary. Anyway, I’m confused and I’ve been having night terrors because I’ve been so stressed. I’ve even contemplated taking my own life, but I know that it’s not the answer. It would hurt everyone.",05Jun2020,1

I had to go to counseling to try sort my head out, the bullying was that bad. Me and him still talk and I know that I want to get back together with him, the only thing I ever struggled with in the relationship was the lack of loyalty I felt from him due to him remaining friends with a girl who mentally destroyed me.

751,"Hi reddit, I'm new here. 


 Here's the situation. I have an older dog (6yo) and recently i adopted a stray puppy (February). He was living in the streets for his first month and someone posted on Facebook asking for a home for him and i ended up adopting the pupper. He started out shy and sick but we managed to care for him and he's happy and healthy now.

 Now he's about 5 or 6 months old and he's bigger than my other dog. Problem is, he likes to bite. I know it's normal for puppies to bite and everything but he's so big that he started to hurt me and my other dog. My other dog bites him back every time and the pupper seems to think they're just playing.

 Today i got really scared. He bit my arm (i was wearing a hoodie) and wouldn't let go. I screamed mostly out of anger but he didn't let go. I had to slap him in the back to make him stop.

 He just brushed off and kept playing by himself with his toys. 

 I went inside and saw my arm with two bruises that i didn't had before. It doesn't seem much but i was wearing a thick hoodie. My arm is in pain and i don't know what to do.

 The vet said he will stop that when he gets older but I'm afraid for my older dog. If he realizes he's stronger he might kill him.

754,"Pros/Cons of owning a dog in College

Hello! I’m making this post to see if anyone has any pros or cons about owning and caring for a pet while in school. 

Here’s the situation:

Coupled with past issues surrounding anxiety and depression, I have also been negatively affected by the virus and things going on in the world today, and I am looking into getting an ESA (Emotional Support Animal)- in the form of a small dog. I will live on campus and have an on campus job in the fall as an RA (Residence Assistant) and ESA’s are allowed, but not regular pets.

I don’t go to parties very often, so this wouldn’t be an issue for me. I’m often in the dorms and because of my new position on campus that’s where I primarily will be.

756,"I am 28(m),and grew up in a religious household. My sisters and I were beaten with a bible inscripted 2x4, fists, and constant emotional attacks that provoked one of my sisters into seizure and panic attacks(likely due to her being forced to eat her own vomit because she had an eating disorder). We were also kept from society through homeschooling so we did not know any better and conditioned to think that this is the way people are, ordained by god. I have even been through sexual assault with a family member and immediately told my father who laughed at it and made a very crude joke and was never spoken of again.
My parents are “justified” by god to “discipline” their children and see no way wrong with their parenting skills and I already see aspects of abuse when I Do happen to come for a visit.
It took me the better part of ten years to move on from that past and it led to many, many bad choices. I am not ashamed to admit that all of us kids got seriously fucked up. 
My fear is when removed from the home that the kids will be split up or put in a worse living arrangement. It is not as if they have bad living conditions, they are well taken care of when it comes to basic human needs, but the rest is my concern.

There's a couple in this group, I am starting to have a more close relationship with both of them, a one on one kind of thing. 

With the quarantine I have lost that one on one thing with the girl, but her bf is telling me that he misses me a lot, that he wants me to be his bff and kind of obsessing about it. 

The last thing was him telling me that he was feeling bad because his previous girl friend didn't want him to hug her. He tried to hug me once and as a joke I didn't let him. 

I'm really done with the hole hugging thing, I think it's not a big deal and it doesn't need to be forced. If it happens sometime is fine, if not , is fine. Is not a fundamental part of the friendship. 

He is on medication because of the depression he suffers due to his obsesive disorder. I didn't know he had this condition until two days ago.

759,"The whole conflict is about getting a drivers license. I live in germany and culturally its seen as an important step in gaining independace but its also quite expensive. 

I personally do not strongly desire to get one because I don't think I can trust myself to operate a vehicle and would prefer sticking to public transit for the most part. Theres also the question for how long cars will stay relevant for personal transportation. Theres also the bad timing of the current situation since going to a driving school would not equal social distancing.

My parents have seen it as a very natural thing to want and have not actually asked me whether or not I want to but started telling me about a year ago to save up for it. I complied since I didn't want conflict and trusted they know about the utility of it wereas I never experienced being independant of the bus shedule or asking them to drive me. I didn't spend most of my pocket money for the past few months.

It may also be important to mention I live in a very small village and the next shop is 3 Kilometres away and only sells groceries. I'll live with my parents for at least 3 more years until my job training was finished. So I would basically be stuck home for that time outside of busrides I research the day before. I don't intend on clubbing or other nightlife so I don't have much reason to leave my village after the last bus left.

Today my mother got a bit accusatory in my eyes as she talked about when we would go to a driving school because she complained about me sleeping late (I did intend to go there to get registered today but my parents were busy for the time when all of us were awake) and an argument ensued. In the heat of the moment I told her that none of this was my idea and she was the one insisting on me getting a drivers license.

I was afraid of what my mom would say if she ever found out, and I was confident with my sexuality (ironic I know) at the time. I think we both knew cause we’d just give each other this look as we lied down together during break time.  

We drifted apart on our third year due to lack of effort to make communication and we never had classes together anymore. 

Then senior year, at our extracurricular activities, she would stop by the desk our friend and I only sat in. She would talk to me and I was surprised she would go all this way to speak to me since she made a new best friend and only hung out with her. Around fall, she reached out to me on social media. It was exciting and yet interesting to talk to her again. 

It’s strange. If I ever look at other girls, or talk to my current girl friends, I don’t feel that way toward them the way I would with this friend. I wouldn’t even think of ever being in a gay relationship with any girl other than her tbh.

764,"Howdy, I've been in a weird situation the past few months and I dont know what the heck to do. I (20yo) started dating my bf (24yo) 7 months ago and its been great, best relationship I've ever had. The weird thing is my sister is convinced he's lying to me about his life. My bf is on the path to be a theoretical physicist, he has a bachelors in physics, I think bachelors is what its called, tbh I don't understand college and the different degrees very well ngl lol. So anyway when I first told her what he's doing I just repeated what he always says ""working on getting a PhD in physics and philosophy"" I didn't know the details of his schooling or work situation all that well because it didn't really matter to me. A few days later she tells me she's done all the research and says the school he's going to doesn't have a physics department and she can't find him on the alumni list and he cant try to get PhDs in more than one field (I have no idea if thats true and maybe my bf just mean a minor in philosophy because that's what he did for his bachelors.) So it did kinda freak me out but I trust my bf a lot and I asked him about it. Well he's not currently in school, he works at a college, the college my sister said didn't have a physics department. He says its this kind of program type thing where he teaches intro physics there and he's also given access to other physicists and a lab. The lab isn't at the university so it makes sense my sister couldn't find info about physics there. He says it's a new program (its basically a paid internship, thats what it sounds like to me) thing they started doing and he took that because he moved back to his moms, which is where we live, to help her out after he finished his bachelors and it was a near by opportunity. He says he wants to start applying to start getting his PhD. Again I dont know how that stuff works but my sister has said ""you dont just start getting your PhD"" I guess there's a speical process to it and for some reason she's just assuming he doesn't know that and is bullshitting me. She's tried to say she knows just as much as him about physics from taking basic physics classes but she's basing this off some texts of me trying to relay info from him. She's a biochemist btw and her husband is an electrical engineer I think, some kind of engineer. So they are familiar with the science field obviously but based off some misunderstanding on my part she's completely convinced he's lied about going to college and working at the other college. I've shown her that he gets alumni association emails from his college and she said that doesn't mean much. And honestly I dont want to pester my bf too much for proof because thats so insulting. She's already questioned his knowledge multiple times and been very rude. She wont let him stay over at his house because of this which is upsetting for me because if I want to spend time with her, like for my 21st birthday, I couldnt bring him and I'd want him there celebrating with me. Its also just super frustrating and horrible having your sister convinced your bf is a big fat liar about a major part of his life. He's very annoyed by it and also hates the obstacles it puts us through. She has repeatedly said stuff like this ""There is no equipment at ----------!! They dont have a physics department!!! Theortical physics research isnt just sitting around talking about stuff the run models and such that require extremely powerful computers"" but I've looked into it and there is Theoretical physicist, experimental physicists, and even computational physicists. Theoretical physicists DO spend a lot of time talking about theories and writing out their own mathematical equations and such, they don't spend much time in a lab or on ""super computers."" If anyone here is in the physics world and could help out with the explanations of that that would be great. But any advice would be nice. I know this is super long and I apologize, there's a lot to this and I've tried to keep it short.

766,"my birthday was yesterday and i just turned 21. all my life since 7th grade ive never had friends or a friends group. was scarred in 4th grade from this group of girls and i think that fucked me up? im fine socially ive just never made friends. maybe i havent made much of an effort consciously or subconsciously either because im just dumb, or because im just under the impresison nobody wants to talk to me. rising senior in college, and all the people ive tried to be friends with really end up not lking me and talking about me behind my back and just stop hanging out with me. only including this since it might be important?

the day before my birthday my mom and i had a bad verbal fight. i feel as though ive been verbally/emotionally abused all my life by her. she started going to counseling after she came after me in a literally naked fit of range and smacking me. thats besides the point. she also wont believe that the husband of her childhood best friend is a pedophile creep and felt me up/groomed me/stalked me/tried to get with me. its a habit in this family to just not talk about anything and move one with life. 

now the advice im wondering about - i feel like ive never had support, especially the ordeal with my moms best friends husband since nobody believes me (dad or brother or mom included), and a petty point but also with my veganism/plastic-free beliefs since highschool. im not pushy about it but itd be nice to feel acknowledged once in a while or have a vegan meal with everyone occasionally instead of being berated but whatever.

also, sitting with my mom, dad, brother and his girlfriend at my birthday i felt very ignored even when i tried to speak up. and so it was mostly silent or was just my mom talking to my brothers girlfriend. i really dont know if im just not carrying conversations enough in my life? if i need to take more initiative?

whenever im talking to my dad, who im closest to between my mom dad and brother, hes mostly just yeah ""yeah ok"" then starts talking about what he wants to talk about. he's the type of person that will only hear what you say then start talking about what they want, is the best way i could explain it.

maybe its because of all this, maybe because im just stupid, but i feel like i might be dangerously socially inept? i feel like im good with making friends, and having friendships, but it has always ended up where the other people end up not liking me or using me or just ignoring me - and i promise im not too clingy and try not to be too annoying. i feel like i dont talk enough sometimes, and people think im boring, but then when i do talk a lot, the other people either act annoyed or dont respond in kind so i feel like im burdening them or something.

770,"There is almost a 100% chance nobody reads this but I just need to rant and get this off my chest to someone other than my parents. Also, I know the title is confusing, but just bear with me and my spelling mistakes and grammar mistakes.

Background: As I said in the title, I am a 13-year-old male. I have to admit, I have been struggling with weight issues my whole life and am a slight bit overweight. I am also starting to get pimples on my face as almost all teenagers do, those things are important in this post. 

My parents are really nice and hardworking people. They are both lawyers so you can imagine that they make pretty good money. We have a very comfortable lifestyle and I wouldn't want to change much about it. The problem has been starting recently, I'm not sure if they notice it or not, but they make backhanded rude/offensive comments about my weight and appearance (including my pimples.) 

The part I don't like though, is they say that if I don't lose weight, then people will bully me in school, except they are the only people who talk about my weight and appearance. It's so frustrating because they are making me really start to hate myself and my body. I know they love me but they are so mean without even being aware.

I would tell them, but they are starting to become super stressed having been cooped up for so long. My mom is also starting to have little mental breakdowns, where she will scream over the smallest things and I don't want to make her sad or make her have more of those. 

So Reddit, can anyone offer some advice or a nice way to lay it down without making her sad or honestly, without making me sad. Thank you for reading this, your friend who may become depressed in the future!",05Jun2020,2
771,"I posted this onto one other advice subreddit last night but got no response, I'm trying here now. This isn't a karma grab, I promise, I just need an outside opinion on this.

I will start by saying I made an account just for this, because... I dont know how to finish that sentence, I'm not embarassed by this, but I'm ashamed and feel a little bit stupid for it, or for waiting so long. Im 26m, and the incident happend when I was 9-10, in Northern California. My 4th grade teacher, Mr. B (I dont think he deserves to be anonymous but I dont know if I should put his name) made me his class favorite. We would play german dodgebal, he would make paper balls and showed us how to squish them really hard and would have paper ball fights with us, then one day he took a diary from J (the girl I was little kid dating, i like you, i like you stuff...) And read it first to himself, then to the class, I remember this and a bunch of other stuff super vividly. He read some normal stuff out loud of her recounting her day, but then he got to a part that said, ""and I have a huge crush on....."" And he left off the name. J was so red, she looked at me and put her head in her arms.. And I felt like crying and yelling all at once. This was bad, but was just a start of what happened after..

 This is the part where you realize why I made an alt to post this...

My mother was a teacher at the elementary school, and one day when she was dropping me off at the before school day care so she could setup her classroom, I bursted into tears crying and I couldn't speak, and refused to leave the car. I dont know why. I have no memory of it, or why. I just know my mom still talks about it to this day. 

Then one of my classmate's families came forward, call her A, and filed a police report that Mr. B had molested A. I would often stay late in Mr. B's classroom, as my mom trusted him, but after my mom heard the news she wouldn't take me back to that school. I was enrolled in the school my dad worked at to finish 4th grade, and the rest of elementary school. But that day in the car with my mom, I don't know why cried like that. I'm emotional about things in life, but not to that extreme, and certainly not at that age.

Mr. B was aqcuitted for lack of evidence or something, my mom is unsure of the reasoning , but he did jail time awaiting his trial, and I am certain something happened. Its been years now, but there's still so many unexplained anxieties, and I feel like this has something to do with them.

I just need an honest opinion, Mr. B, J, and A, all live in my hometown still. I moved away a long time ago, but feel I left with some demons. Anyway any advice helps.",05Jun2020,1

Yesterday I received and email from a hospital saying that I should pay 10k dollars from an accident I had 2 years ago. At that time I was covered by an insurance so I thought they were handling things by themselves and I was actually out of the deal(I noticed they were emailing each other). 
I called back to the hospital complaining, because I didn’t receive any update on this for 2 years and the case and now they’re billing me for this, I also told her that I don’t think it is how things work, that she has to deal this with my Insurance and I would get a lawyer if this affects my credit score. The email I got had a thread of the conversation between my insurance and the hospital and the hospital didn’t reply with the bill for 1 year! I wouldn’t be covered by the insurance by that time. 
I don’t know what to do from now on, I contacted the insurance and told them to solve this and keep me out of this. Any advice?

784,"Hello there,

I just recently finished secondary school, and will now move up to college. Ive always stuck with people who liked dark humour (that includes racist jokes ect.) , and I really want to change, but it seems as though I cant get rid of it. To many people the jokes that I laugh at would appear as extreme, while to me they seem as funny. Of course, when i laugh at these, I would never think that way in ''real life'' (if that makes sense - ie. public), I think racism is wrong, but its just something in my head that makes me laugh at it. I think the main source for this is the influence of the majority of people at my school, and Im scared that this is irreversible, and my sense of humour will always stay dark/racist like that. I really want to change as Im going to meet new people , and Ill come off as an outcast. I know many of you will suggest that i stop hanging around with those people, but its gotten to the point where im scared that new, normal friends wont be able to change me as im just constantly used to the dark humour.

Today is a sad day. :( I’m staying between my own house and at my boyfriends house for quarantine during COVID, and we just woke up at his house, in his bedroom, when his mom knocked on the door. Before she could get anything out of her mouth I could tell something was wrong before she started to tear up and choke on her words. Right then I knew it had to be her father. Yes he’s old, but he didn’t have COVID or anything. He was staying at a home for the elderly so I’m not sure yet what happened between the time he was at the home to him going to the hospital. And I think emotions are too high right now to ask those type of questions. Anyway after she told us that he died in the hospital last night and my heart stopped. Then she just closed the door and that’s when I started to tear up and I just wrapped my arms around my boyfriend and I just couldn’t stop repeating how sorry I was. My boyfriend isn’t one to get super emotional over anything but this time after I hugged him, he went under his bed sheet covers to hide his face, where I think he just needed a moment to himself maybe to cry. Then he got up, got dressed, and gave me a kiss on the cheek and left the room to go talk to his mom. I just feel so awkward here, because obviously I’m not apart of the family it’s hard for me to understand the exact same pain my boyfriend’s mom is feeling, but I have met their grandpa before and now I feel so damn lucky I did before today. :( What do I say to his mom today as a message of condolences?

794,"Hi, I'm a senior in college about to graduate with my political science degree. I was originally going to pursue law school, but I didn't like the law oriented classes I took and I simply don't have the backbone to be an attorney. I then talked to a few of my professors and realized I really liked the idea of getting into academia and being a professor. I am extremely passionate about this subject, and I would love to teach others. So I'm now in the process of applying to grad school.

However, I noticed this field is heavily saturated. In order to get a full time job you have to be extremely flexible and willing to move anywhere. I would like the ability to chose where I live. Especially because my partner would like to return to our hometown after graduation and stay close to his family. That being said, this job would make me really happy, be somewhat stress-free, pays well, and gives me enough time to raise a family and have hobbies outside of my career. I want things to work out with my partner and I would like to stay close to my family, but I'm also really excited by this job.

795,"(Just for context I am fourteen, and this has nothing to do with life advice or anything, this would just make me feel much better given all of the current situations, and if you don't know a lot about games, here's a heads up, this probably won't be very good for you to answer. You can also skip to the bottom for the summary.)

So to start off, I originally found out about the DOOM franchise through the soundtrack for DOOM 2016. Ever since then I've been in love with everything DOOM related. My parents don't exactly like violence or gore, so they don't know that I like DOOM.

I want to be able to play Eternal because I think it could relieve a lot of stress I currently have. My mom's landlord just basically kicked us out and made a false police report with no evidence as to what she was saying, (She said my mom threatened to shoot her, but she doesn't even own a gun and she's against guns, but is fine with them in games.) so now we have to move, and it's been hard finding a place that isn't too expensive. But anyways, when I get stressed I can get angry kind of easily.

To combat my anger I've just been watching some gameplay of DOOM Eternal with no commentary, or listening to the soundtrack. It actually calms me down pretty quickly. However, I usually am left disappointed afterwards, because I know that realistically I most likely will only be able to play any of the DOOM games when I'm 18, since my parents most likely wouldn't even let me play it when I'm 17 because they are so against violence and gore.

Because of quarantine things are pretty slow and boring as well, and I feel like I need something energetic and fast paced. Eternal fits that criteria perfectly. I also feel left out, because every single one of my friends are allowed to play Mature games that are honestly more violent than DOOM Eternal. I feel as if I am missing out on something great, because when hanging out with my friends, I've been able to play Mature games a few times, and most things in those games have been the best experiences I've had in a game.

Now let's talk about the violence. In 2018 when I first found out about DOOM, I was 12. The violence and gore didn't bother me then, it doesn't now. However I've always hated gore in movies, and some other games, so it's not like I've been desensitized to violence like that. In fact I have a hard time even killing a tiny bug and I always try to save them and put them outside if I find one in the house. My parents think that if I see stuff like in DOOM Eternal, I will be desensitized to violence and I'll want to kill someone. Which is not even remotely true. I'm absolutely disgusted by the thought of killing someone in real life, and I physically recoil any time I see some awful gore in a movie. Especially when sharp objects are near someone's eye. I can't stand that. However I'm perfectly fine with the Cacodemon glory kills where you stab it's eye. I'm not really sure why though because that goes against everything I said about sharp objects near someone's eye.

The thing that I also don't really understand is how I'm allowed to play some Mature games, like the Halo franchise, and the Half-Life franchise. Although I suppose it's because those aren't as violent? I'm not too sure. Also my friends, and even my parents say that I'm mature for my age and that I'm like an adult in a child's body.

Another dilemma I have, which I consider to be quite a big one, is that I have two devices I could play it on. One is a garbage laptop that constantly freezes and has a graphics processor that is Intel CORE i3. And the other is the Xbox, but that's in the living room, so if I was allowed to play DOOM Eternal, if they walked in they would see it and probably be annoyed every time I play it, but then again I could play it when they are at work so they wouldn't be annoyed.

I could also get my sister to get it for me, (She's 18) and have her tell them that she wanted to play it and stuff, because she liked the music or something since she plays music and listens to music all the time, and I could play it when they are at work and not home or whatever. However, she doesn't really play any games often and when she does, it's definitely not a violent one, or a shooter, so it would probably be suspicious and they probably wouldn't even like that she ""wanted to play it"" or whatever.

Anyways, that's really all I have to say.

Pros:

1.) It can relieve the massive amounts of stress I have on a daily basis.

2.) I need something that isn't slow and I need to feel energetic.

3.) The music is great.

4.) The violence doesn't bother me/I'm not desensitized to violence if I play it still.

5.) I have the money to pay for the game.

Cons:

1.) Either play with bad graphics on my trash laptop, or play on the Xbox for everyone to see.

2.) My sister could get it for me but that would be suspicious and I have the risk of getting caught.

2 and a half.) I wouldn't be able to ask them if I could play it, and then have my sister get it as that would be even more sus.

Any comments about anything that could help would be great. Thank you for your time.",05Jun2020,1

Our message was workshopped by multiple people, and then finally passed on to the exec for final approval - he changed a few things about the original, like instead of mentioning black people or POC, and made it a general message about systemic racism as a whole without addressing a specific group. I didn’t call this in to question as we work alongside other orgs who set rules in place and assumed this was probably omitted do to some kind of guideline or something and went ahead and posted it. 

Here’s where the issue is... Late last night a woman commented on the post saying how disappointed she was with how we worded our messaging and should have mentioned the racism towards black people instead of just general racism. I made the mistake of deleting the comment to deescalate potential arguments because it was very late and I wouldn’t have been able to constantly monitor the post over night. I had every intention of bringing it up to my bosses the following morning on wether or not we should edit our post/make some kind of apology/pull it down all together since we really should have spent more time on the messaging and really made sure it reflected our values. She ended up sending them a lengthy email before I could speak with them the following morning.

I feel awful for removing her comment and my act in doing so basically went against what the post was about (standing up for those who have been silenced) by doing just that. If I were in the right head space I should have reached out to her via dm and asked what we could do better... She ended up sending a lengthy email to the head exec (I have not seen it) regarding our message.

I’m waiting to discuss this with my bosses at some point today and I’m SO ANXIOUS to hear what they say. I made a mistake and I’m not quite sure how to correct it... I made the org look bad. I plan on apologizing and owning up to what happened, but what else can I do? I’m panicking because I’m afraid I may lose my job and that I painted the org in a bad light... I feel sooooo bad 😰",05Jun2020,2
798,"I was introduced to a girl by my cousin who told me that the said girl was looking for a relationship, So I added her and then as the kids nowadays say I ""shoot my shot"" at the said girl and I said ""Hey what's up"" I was expecting a response but I didn't even get seen, which was okay I guess but I heard from my cousin that the girl said that I wasn't ""sweet"" enough in my message so she chose not to respond at all.

800,"Hello, my name is Tyler.

I'm 26 years old, single, and have no college education. 

Two years ago, I made a mistake, making it hard to move forward in life. My mistake resulted in a conviction of a class B misdemeanor theft. This crime is considered ""Moral turpitude"" which disqualifies you from any good jobs, and it can never be removed as far as I know.

If I were to pursue an engineering degree, would I even be able to find a job with my record? Could my GPA in school be a factor in a hiring decision? What other possibilities do I have as far as education?

Long story short, I went abroad back in May 2019 for 10 months. Unfortunately, I had to return back home (Canada) due to Covid. 
Before I left, I was employed at unionized branch (great benefits, great people to work with, leaves, hours, pay) for 2 years as a secretary. I learned a lot and gained personal growth when I was there. Now, a job posting for payroll at that branch has come up. I do have all the qualifications and I know they will take me back as they told me that before I left. 
I'm still wanting to travel but since Covid started, I'm not sure when that'll happen (2-3 years at least).

805,"Ok so I’m currently a few days away from being 19. Last summer while I was 18 I fell for a persons lies over the Internet. Ended up almost being assaulted. 

Eventually like a few weeks before lockdown started I told my guidance counselor because I really trust her. I told her about a bunch of other incidents like that, that have happened to me. She told the principal and she told social services. 

They want to do an investigation about it even though I can’t tell them a single thing about this person. But they don’t really care about the creep who lives near me and keeps “accidentally” touching me. 

My guidance counselor rang me today to let me know that they have rang the principal and someone would be speaking to me soon. I never wanted this to happen. This is the last thing I ever wanted. It took me six years to start to open up about all this stuff to someone that I really trust. Now I have to speak to someone I have never met before in my life

806,"I'm 25 (F) and I've been in a relationship (29, F) for 10 months and while I'm happy with her and in love with her, I have this thing in my brain in which I can't seem to integrate her in my life, in the sense of introducing her to friends, family, etc... Its like for some reason my relationships don't ""mesh"" with the rest of my life. It happened in my previous relationship too, but that was a long distance situation so of course in that respect she was kept quite separate from the rest of my life.
I don't know what's wrong with me, but the idea of hanging out with her together with my friends and family and having her properly ""inside"" every aspect of my life gives me so much anxiety. Honestly I think it might stem from having been in the closet for a long time, like I'm used to keeping my ""gay life"" very private and suddenly I'm facing the meshing of the two lives, if that makes sense.
Then I think about my future and my dream has always been to specialice in psychology abroad, in europe or the usa... and I also want to marry and have kids in the future and somehow those two things I want seem... Incompatible? Like I know they aren't, but in my mind they don't mesh together, its almost like visualizing two different futures. Like one future of me alone in an apartment abroad working on my career, and then another future with her and kids running around lol, and I try to picture them in one same thing, one same future and I can't.

809,"I [16F] have a huge crush on a boy [19M] from my church that’s been there since December 2018. I might even go as far as saying I’m in love with him. I’ve been wanting to tell him badly lately but I just can’t get the gumption to do it. I know it’s something to do in person. 

I had a dream last night with him in it (nothing sexual). This made my urge to tell him even stronger. I don’t know what to do.

I’ve come up with a few things I could say, and I wrote them in my notes. But I’ve deleted them because I’ve always talked myself out of telling him. 

I have two friends [16F &amp; 15F] that I’m aware know because I’ve told them. One of them knows him personally and one doesn’t. One of the friends said I should wait until he matures a little more and gets his life together, but I’m afraid once that happens he’ll already be in a relationship and I’ll regret not telling him. 

Age is a concern of mine also. He’s 19 (turning 20 this year), and I’m 16 (turning 17 a few days after he turns 20). 

What should I do? I was thinking of texting him and saying I have something to tell him, but it needs to be in person. 

I understand it might be difficult to give advice not knowing the whole situation, but I’m trying my best not to disclose too much information about both my friends and my crush for their safety.

It’s going to be difficult as before my parents have found out about a past suicide attempt and ridiculed. My father as also told me before that he believes that depression is made up to sell pills and to just “be happy”. My weight is constantly mocked and due to that I’ve developed a habit of binge eating resulting in my eating disorders [ bulimia and a habit of chewing food and spiting it out]. When I was in the seventh grade I began cutting. Around this time I tried to reach out to a school counselor about my depression but she told me I was just merely sad and I was fine.

817,"I  (F, 27)  don't even know where to start. There is so much going on in my own life and just in the lives of Americans right now. And I am just so emotionally fatigued and I feel so helpless.

Everyone stuff:

Protests/Riots: I am liberal. I am in support of BLM and I went to a peaceful protest the other day. It was really special and I am glad I participated. But being where I live, there is no escape from seeing what's going on every single second. I can't just turn off my social media and take a break. Every night when I go to sleep I hear helicopters, shots, explosions, bangs. The doors to my apartment and nearby businesses had to be boarded up. Even the military is here now. I walked my dog and there was an Army Hummer on our street... It feels like the country is on the brink of civil war with how divided we are. And we are a joke that the world is laughing at. I try to be involved online by commenting on posts where people say #allivesmatter or say the US is the best country in the world (it's not), but then I get bullied over the internet by supposed ""patriots"", even when I say things in a kind and productive way. Some guy called me a ""racist bitch"" when I was explaining BLM and then he continued to harass me over messenger and in another post other people bullied me to the point I ended up deleting my comments on a post about how America isn't the greatest country by harassing me and saying awful things about me. I try not to let strangers hurt my feelings but it's quite difficult when I am not in a good headspace. I recognize there is only so much I can do related to all this-vote, educate, and donate. But other people are exhausting me in addition to everything else in my life going on. The ""patriotism"" and racism is overwhelming. So I can't even imagine how POC feel, I am just a White woman trying to do my part and help.

COVID-19: I am an extremely social and physical person. To thrive mentally, I need to talk with friends and family. I need hugs and kisses and just any physical touch. I live with my wife and obviously get some of that from her but I can't get it from friends and family right now. I have social comfort but not physical comfort from them. I am extremely close to my family and can't even hug my mom, dad and brother. It's been like this for three months. For the first two months, I was so scared of getting sick or getting others sick that I wouldn't even visit my parents outside. We are so far away from a cure. Fauci says we will have a vaccine by the end of the year. I hope that's the truth but that is also 6 months away. I miss my friends. I miss hugging my mom. I miss traveling. I miss going to the gym. Going to a restaurant for a good meal. This is a lot. For me and for all of us. And it's super frustrating when others won't take it seriously but I don't want to be a Karen and tell them off. I can't do much about COVID but here is what I do: wear a mask everywhere out of my home, attempt to stay 6 feet from everyone outside of my household and my corona crew (2 friends and it's a long story), see my family every weekend in their backyard, try to stay in touch by text or Zoom, workout at home, walk my dog, do my work from home and do all my schooling from home.

Personal Stuff:

Grandmother: My grandparents live elsewhere but were visiting my parents when everything went down and there area became a hotspot so they ended up staying. About a month in, my grandma (94) fell and hit her head. Long story short she had to have brain surgery which she luckily survived. She was in the hospital for 3 weeks and we couldn't even visit because of COVID-19. She came home and I got to see her in my parents backyard but she wasn't herself and we are unsure if this is permanent. About a week or so later, she wandered off under my grandpa's (92) care in my parent's house and fell on a small step and broke her hip. She went back to the same hospital, got a rod inserted. She survived but she is still in the hospital. Again, we still can't visit. I know she doesn't have much time left on this earth and I can't even see her until she gets out. And it probably won't even feel like I am seeing the real ""her"" and I won't even be able to hug her. We are very close so this has been extremely hard on me on top of everything else. In addition, it has been very hard for my grandpa and my parents who have to take care of her. They have talked about putting them in an assisted living facility but won't do so until we can visit them and the nursing home policies across the US right now are that visitors are not allowed and residents are confined to their rooms. Assuming Fauci is correct, we cannot put them in a home for at least another 6 months is my guess. So it's a lot on them and my mom is like one of my number one confidants and I don't want to stress her out. I have offered to help them but I know it's not a good idea to go into their home right now. 

School and Work: I feel it's worth mentioning I have a full-time job and I am in graduate school part-time. Both have gone remote. I have no problem with this. I have been able to sleep in and I can do work from home no problem. However, I am currently doing my practicum which involves giving others therapy and I am stressed with that because I have to take everything I have learned from all my classes thus far and put it into practice and I feel extremely self-conscious. I know it's what I want to do but apparently everyone feels the same in the beginning of it. Is this the right career for me? Will I ever do a good job? Will my clients leave bc I am not good enough? Can I be effective at separating my own problems from those of my clients? How long will it take till I feel comfortable with this? Currently, before each session, I get super anxious and then after it I pick every single thing I did apart. Why did I do this? I should have said this? My point being I have a lot on my plate with that. Thankfully work is slow in the summer and my team is awesome. I am a little worried about budget cuts across the board bc of the economy, but I am okay for now.

Wife: This is the most current and largest concern right now. It requires a lot of background. 

Wife Background-My wife has severe ADHD. A few years ago she developed an issue with her meds and now she cannot take stimulants. She finds a lot of self-worth in her career and it has been a mess as of late. She had a great first job after several years of searching after university. But some stuff went down and she ended up getting fired. She searched for a job in her field for 2.5 years after that. She had gotten a temp-to-perm position and it didn't work out and she lost that. A few months later she got an amazing job with a huge company. We couldn't believe it. It's been about 5 months now.

Wife Current Job-She was doing okay while getting the hang of things at work besides the many late nights but they went remote and working from home as been a huge problem for her with her ADHD. There is something about physically getting in her work clothes, walking to her office, and just being in that setting that helps her concentrate and be productive. Also to note, we live in a 675 sq ft studio apartment. For 2.5 months we have been together in the same room with no break from each other. We also have a puppy. It was evident within the first few weeks that things were going poorly so her bosses set up a meeting with her. I told her to tell them she has ADHD and ask for accommodations. They gave her accommodations and things were going better but they were starting off by giving her lower level projects. Things weren't perfect but much improved. There was a day where there were 2 people out and things were really busy and she got overwhelmed. She got in trouble and they put in more accommodations for her. I'd say it's been about 3-4 weeks of this and it's been all lower level projects. At a certain point she snapped and decided the accommodations weren't enough. Our friends were nice enough to let her setup a workspace at their house and she ""commutes"" over there everyday now. It's been nice because she is not as stressed and I am not as stressed because her work is not in the room with me. This has been going on for almost 2 weeks and from what she has said, things have improved. But 2 days ago she had a check-in meeting with her two bosses and they said they are not seeing her do enough of what is required of her and they gave her a memorandum saying if she can't amp up her productivity, she is going to be fired. She is extremely on edge now and obviously I am too. Even though we are physically distanced during the work day, she has been texting me a narration of her workday today and it hasn't been a great one from the info she is texting me. I feel helpless and I feel like at this rate she is going to lose her job. I called my mom for emotional support and just starting bawling to her. She said she would deal with my wife and I should try to take care of myself. But I feel guilty that I am so emotionally drained that I cannot seem to deal with my own wife and my poor mom will have to take care of my grandma again when she gets out of the hospital. It may seem like I am overreacting perhaps? But after years of her being fired and then having to go on long job hunts, I am terrified of that again.

My Thoughts on Job-I hope she makes this work and doesn't get fired because getting a job in this economy with her record of ""fires"" would be disastrous. She has not been able to maintain a job due to a combination of her mental health issues and her learning disability. On one hand, I want her to keep this job because it's great pay. And if she loses it, she will have to go on unemployment, she will feel awful about herself, we will both be in mentally not good places, she will be job searching again (for who knows how long), and I will be the sole provider of the household. It's a lot of stress on me and I don't want to have to ask my parents for help. At the same time, this job has caused her nothing but stress. When she was in the office she was working sometimes till 10pm at night. And now working from home, she is constantly stressed because she can't keep up and is so close to being fired. So on the other hand, I ask myself is it even worth it? I told her to focus on making this job work and if it came to it, we will come up with a Plan B. I have started thinking about Plan B. My thoughts are while she is talented in her current creative field, the jobs she will have are all going to require an extremely high level of executive functioning that she may never have. It's all about deadlines, perfection, and speed and it's just a lot for anyone, but particularly someone with ADHD. That's why I have thought that perhaps she would do better in a field where it was a lot less of that. I thought about something with her hands like a trade, but that takes a while to get training in. We have also talked about IT. She is so good with technology. Where we live they have these free workforce training programs in IT. If she could get in she could take some free IT classes: fundamentals and get her CompA+ cert. They also provide job counseling and help with resume writing and getting them connected with jobs when they finish. And it's a quick program. I feel like in IT it's very needed and you can get decent pay pretty quickly. It's more about fixing the problem rather than creating things. Less deadline oriented. I feel like it may be good for her. And after her track record in her current field, it may be impossible for her to get another job in the same field. 

I don't know exactly what I am asking for here. I guess, does anyone have any suggestions for keeping my sanity? Am I doing something wrong here? How can I help while maintaining my emotional bandwidth? and what are your thoughts regarding my wife's career path? I am just so at a loss. We have been at this for over 3 years and I just want her to be happy and stable and have a career she can be proud of and successful at.",05Jun2020,1
818,"I hope I am doing this right. A friend said reddit would be a good place to ask.
So here it is- I have a dog who is injured really bad and needs to go to the vet. I finally got paid and have money to take her but my mom won't.
She said to get my ex step dad to do it (they are going thru a divorce at the moment) he agreed to take me but then backed out because of my mom.
The dog is not licensed yet and that's the main reason my mom says she can't take her because we have other dogs licensed at our house and apparently it would be to many dogs. But the other dogs that are licensed are going to different homes (they were a litter of 5, only keeping 1- who is hurt)

820,"I've noticed that my mind has a tendency of clinging to negative thoughts, especially in my romantic relationships. When something comes up that I don't understand or wasn't expecting, I tend to brood over it. Not necessarily in an obsessive sort of way, but it sort of becomes an underlying thought that is always in the back of my mind until the issue resolves. Unfortunately, a tension develops  in my mind where I recognize that something is wrong, but because I'm not being told what the issue is (or I've been given an unfulfilling answer/non-answer); I go into a state of limbo where I start to think back to prior failures and how likely it is that I'm going to repeat that process.

&amp;#x200B;

I kind of doubt that my struggle becomes apparent to the other person though, as my main trigger is when the other person goes silent. As you might imagine, I have had many failed romantic endeavors, and the effect of those failures has snowballed into a general feeling of dread anytime something comes up in my relationships. The feeling of foreboding used to happen in all my relationships, but now it only happens in my romantic ones.

823,"I(M20) feel terrible just writing the title of this post, however I don't know what my options are when my father eventually passes away.

To give some context my uncle(M60) is the older of two siblings, my father(M56) being the younger. My uncle has learning difficulties and a whole host of other medical issues that are treatable but only when he actually accepts the treatment which is difficult to get him to do to say the least. (We can't even get him to have a flu jab most years)

It is evident that my father was born to be the caretaker to his brother, and while he has a life outside of this with my mother and I, he isn't a happy man. He is constantly stressed and short tempered when dealing with my uncle, which is understandable but I do feel sorry for him. My mother takes some of the responsibility for him as well but he doesn't make it easy and he is mainly my fathers responsibility.

I don't know how long my family will last, my father has a huge list of medical problems that he is treated for and does as the doctors say but there is still the chance of a random heart attack or stroke due to his weight and conditions.

That leaves my mother and I as the main caretakers for him, I have three brothers however two of them we haven't seen in years due to family arguments and the last only visits on birthdays and Christmas.

When my father passes away whenever that is the responsibly will probably fall to me to look after him, I couldn't put my mother through it and my brothers won't take any responsibility for him at all because they have their own lives and don't really give a damn apart from the visits.

Here is where my issue begins, I don't want to take my uncle into my care, I love him but after seeing how my father is in just his day to day life I can't end up like that. My father would fight tooth and nail for my brother and I would as well if he needed my help, but every day I seem to become more like my father and I don't want to end up with the burden of my uncle's care in my life to have it leech onto my life as well. It already ruined a large amount of my fathers life and makes my mothers hard, especially as he gets older its only going to get worse.

I CANNOT abandon him, I don't have it in me to leave him alone because he is at the end of the day family. Whether he is a burden on my life or not I will need to do SOMETHING to make sure he can live out with whatever he needs when he gets older.

So Reddit I come to you to ask, what can I do to make sure that both myself and my uncle can actually live our lives without me needing to take him into my direct care? I am currently a student so there is no way I can for the immediate future, maybe when I have more money I could put him into sheltered accommodation but until then what can I do?

I cannot willingly let myself become my father. Its not his fault he was put into this situation by his parents.

I am a D cup, my mother is an A cup. I don't even own a strapless bra because they have never worked out for me in the past. My mother made me feel uncomfortable in my own skin and more self conscious than I already am.

825,"I have chronic acne ALL around my T-Zone, especially my chin, and around my jaw and ears. (Yes I’m aware of the GODSEND subreddits r/acne and r/skincareaddiction ) My mom has been a consultant for years after a messy divorce with my dad. She believes Arbonne built up her confidence again (which it did) and that it will magically cure my acne (which it hasn’t). 

Like myself, she can be very stubborn and doesn’t like being told she is wrong. I’m very educated on MLMs and no matter what I say, she believes Arbonne will cure my skin. We don’t have health insurance that covers anything more than an ER visit. I’d make an appointment to a dermatologist and she refuses to cover the fee. I am unemployed, a full time student and university athlete, and don’t have the means to pay for it myself (esp. now with the pandemic). She will push products onto me that don’t work or make my skin worse. I sometimes find the products I’ve saved up for in the trash.

826,"I’ve been friends with this person since late elementary school. We met on the same baseball team. In the time since, we’ve never had a break apart. We never went to school together, but we always played video games and hung out. We even kept this out through college. However, things have turned for the worst. I’m almost always the key contributor in conversation when hanging out. It’s not like he just sometimes has an off day. He just doesn’t ever bring anything to the table. I feel like I ask an endless number of questions to keep the vibe alive.

Much worse, he treats me differently based on the situation. In one on one, he’s always respectful and acts like a good friend. When we hangout with our other four friends, he does everything possible to turn the crowd on me. It’s small stuff but I then become the punching bag for the entire experience. I had a tough childhood and criticism and being the target strains me much harder than some people. It brings me really low. I’ve tried everything from not giving a reaction to fighting back, it never works. I’m always the target without fail. He just loves to get the reaction out of me. 

When I think of my other friends from different groups, I always feel happy when I’m done hanging out with them. They build MF up and don’t do petty things like tease me all the time. Lastly, before you say he’s not really a friend, he doesn’t believe that. He just asked me two months ago to be his best man. If anything he’s just a bad friend. I’ve had enough and thinking about just cutting him off with no explanation. I would try to talk this out buts it’s been going on for years. The key is this group of friends brings out the worst in him. It’s a hard decision though because we’ve spent years being friends together. I’d love some advice here.

832,"So here are the people involved: me (19/M), my best friend ""Susan"" (20/F), and Susan's younger sister ""Bella"" (18/F) \[we all go to the same college together\]

So Susan and I met this past year of college but we have become really close friends, so much so that I would even consider her my best friend. Let's just say that we have been through some serious shit and each of us has been there for one another so we have a pretty strong bond (one that I do not want to ruin). About a month before we had to move back home for coronavirus, she introduced me to her sister Bella one day when we all happened to be in the cafeteria at the same time (it was not a setup or anything, just a casual thing like oh btw you should meet my sister) and I immediately had a crush on her. Obviously it didn't seem like a huge deal to me because crushes come and go all the time, but that's neither here nor there... Anyways I have hung out with both of them a decent amount, and even during quarantine we have Zoom calls with each other to catch up every so often. 

My feelings for Bella have grown a lot and I really like her, but there are so many things going through my mind about this whole situation:

* I live in another state as them, so I won't see them in person until we move back to school in September so idk if I should wait to say something in person or not
* I also have NO clue if Bella even likes me (sometimes I get the feeling that she might, but she is also just a super friendly person so i don't wanna get my hopes up)
* my friendship with Susan is so important to me and the last thing I want to do is make things weird or ruin our friendship
* I want to tell Susan but I have no clue how she will react (and whether or not she would approve of me being with Bella)

I want to tell Susan first about this whole thing because for one, I need some insider info about whether Bella even likes me or not, but more importantly I need to make sure that Susan is ok with everything because her friendship means so much to me. Also, I feel like this is a totally different situation than the typical situation of liking your GUY best friend's sister. I just don't know what to do and some good advice would be much appreciated :)

I am planning to move out with my girlfriend we are both 29 into a house which we are buying together, we have been together for 2.5 years and really happy and until lockdown we saw each other everyday. We planned to buy a house under the shared ownership scheme in January however my mum convinced me to pull out (am glad she did now tbh due to costs and fees etc). Now we have found a place which is going to be completed around March 2021 we are both in excellent financial positions and can easily afford the mortgage and bills etc.

How do I tell my mum that I am moving out, she and I are close she only has me and my younger brother as I don’t know my dad so when I move out she is will have my brother however she does have some minor health problems and has recently been made redundant. Atm she cooks for me and does my washing for me. She is also against me moving onto the estate that we are going for as it is 30mins away from her.

I am worried about her being able to afford for me to move out however I want to move out and stand on my own feet, get a dog (which I have been allowed), possibly have start a family I just don’t know how to approach it",05Jun2020,1
834,"Throwaway account and I do apologizie, english is not my first language. Also, sorry for long post.

I've been struggling my whole life with myself - I've been running from responsibilities, dodging them and doing everything I can to avoid work and consequences of anything. When I was young, I often skipped school, didn't do nearly any homework and always got away with it. My parents tried their best to discipline me, but to no avail. Everyone always told me I'm exceptionally smart. I've learn how to read way before anyone I've ever met, whenever I really put my mind into something I had way better grades than everyone and I've always hung out with people way older than me, because I felt better among them. Schools quickly adapted to my behaviour and stopped trying to force me to put effort into studying and actually attending school and instead made bargains with me. I had extreme absences, because I didn't want to get up early in the morning and they send me to various competitions. I've won many of them and that was enough for them to let me pass.   


I believe these things only reinforced my inner problems and made me better in getting away with my irresponsibilities. I've learned how to fake ilnesses, make great excuses and generally I'm good with getting away without other people even realizing I'm lying. I believe I'm not a bad person, because I realize, that what I do is wrong. And I feel bad. However, before you judge me too harshly, whenever there were other peopled depending on me (school group projects etc) I've always done my part. On time and I tried my best. The only person suffering from my irresponsibility was always me and I tried my best not to put strain on others.  


I was always certain, that I'm just lazy by nature and that it got reinforced by my own mistakes and lenience of school system, so I took two part time jobs. Both of them were physically demanding. I wanted to see whether I can actually work or I would quit. I didn't quit and my supervisors were extremely satisfied with me.  


So I shifted my self-examination towards PC gaming. I thought that maybe I'm addicted to PC games - I spent most of my days playing on PC. However, the more I was thinking about it, I realized that PC gaming is form of escapism for me. I'm running away from the guilt that I feel, because there is something I should be doing (work around the house, school things etc). When I play, I'm able to push those feelings out of my mind and just... play. Not caring about the world around.  


I'm currently 22 and I'm in my last year of uni (universities in your countries might work different to ours, so don't be surprised by the age). I study marketing and I work as a freelance copywriter. At first, the idea of marketing was appealing to me, but after two years of studying I realized that it's not something I want to do. I shifted to copywriting (I dont do copywriting in english, dont worry) and it worked out for me. It was fun, people loved my works and it seemed as a something I could do without leaving my house. During coronavirus lockdown, however, I stopped working and my habits with dodging everything started taking control of me once again. It took it's toll on my school duties aswell. I stopped reading my emails, I havent been on facebook for two months and I didn't send school projects that I actually completed. I just couldnt force myself to send emails to the profs with the work. Even thought I invested my time into doing the projects. I'm honestly lost. I don't know why I'm the way I'm. I'm scared to read my emails, to log in to facebook and explain to everyone why I vanished. I will also have to extend my studies thanks to this.  


Honestly, I really don't know what to do. I can't seem to come up with any solution or anything. I don't understand why I'm the way I'm. Has anyone dealt with something like this? Any advice, please? I want to change, but I don't know how.",05Jun2020,1
835,"So recently I found out that $300 went missing from me and as a 15 year old that’s kind of a lot in my eyes. But using Common sense I knew my mom took it. When I confronted her she would change the subject or just straight up lie. 2 days later my dad asked me for $50 and I gave it to him because he said he’ll pay me back. He then stated that my mom was “saving it”(my $300), but then I asked my self why would she not tell me that in the first place, and also it’s not her responsibility to save my money.

Due to the whole COVID mess, places are still not open so he would be inside of our house for several hours for at least one day.  And COVID is also the reason why I’m a little wary of having visitors in my house.  He has resumed flying all over the place for work already, so he’s been in a bunch of planes, airports, and I’m sure other public places with lots of people.  And to boot, he’s the polar opposite of a germaphobe (I know being overly germaphobic isn’t healthy, but he’s opposite to the point where he could probably afford to be a little more conscious), which isn’t something I’m comfortable with under current conditions.

840,"Around three months ago I (M19) met a girl (18) here on Reddit and we have become very good friends. We trust each other with our lives... I have a lot of admiration and respect for her, because of everything she went through. I tell her everyday she is already a winner, and we are not afraid to say we love each other.

But I know she doesn't love me like I love her... We have alredy had our ups and downs, but she can't get over her former relationship and this pops up during our conversations very often. I feel like the third wheel... She really seems to love the previous guy, but he cut all the contact with her... She obsesses about meeting him again and I can't help but feel desperate about the possibility that she would either hurt herself even worse or throw me away if he did say yes.

On top of all of that, we both have emotional issues that are hard to talk about and control, so our conversations are usually just one of us venting. But I feel so useless knowing I'm not able to wipe away her tears and make her happy... I don't know how to proceed. Ever since I met her I have spiraled down a pit of despair and sadness. I wanna say I love her for real and those aren't only words that I spit out now and then to make her feel better, but she has a hard time believing anyone could ever love her.

Fast forward a few months and I'm discussing the current situation of everything with my friend group, and one person talks about economic collapse and I tell them that I don't believe that would help anything. Then another says that they understood our local government tear gassing people because ""they stayed too late"" and they would be ready to go home too and I told them that it wasn't justified. 

Then we continued discussing it very civilly and it was almost to a close then one of my friends sibling said ""Yo whats up with your post lately? The ones were you say your tired of people selling stuff like avion right after v starts selling arbon and the one about tye protestors staying to long after v said that when it starts turning into riots people shouldnt stay and get tear gassed""

And then I said ""Oh, the Avon one was just like y'all are making me feel old lol, there's an 18 year old selling some kind of hair product on Instagram and a 19 year old selling essential oil I thought it was an old person thing 😂, and ours wasn't a riot, and it wasn't about her it's mainly other people. Some people on my Facebook said ""they should've just shot them all"" like dang, how inhumane do you gotta be"" 

They kinda just brushed it off, then the discussion got to continuing and came to a close. But it got to bothering bothering me that they felt like I would rather say something about them in posts so I said ""And guys if I say something that bothers you, tell me

We've all gotten to the point in our lives where if something bothers us we should say it, we're all adults now. 

I've decided if I don't like something y'all are saying, I'll say it to your face (ie me telling A economic collapse is not what we need right now, and telling V that tear gassing people in our town was completely uncalled for). If you can't say what you mean you may as well stay silent""

I told my dad this and I'm still actively searching for jobs that only require me to work during the day and/or have set hours. My dad got mad at me because he said I was being spoiled and lazy and coming up with excuses because I was trying to find a job that would allow me to continue doing band stuff. That's a big issue with him because he's accusing me of being spoiled because as a teenager I shouldn't be so picky and should be grateful to get any job and that the rest of the world has to figure out how to balance work and home life and that my band stuff isn't a job because I don't get paid. I told him that just because I don't get paid for the band stuff I do a lot of it is not something that I can just skip out on and it's a huge part of my life and will continue to be. The teaching will eventually turn into a job when I graduate high school next year and hopefully go to college.

In my past relationship ( first relationship ) at 24 my ex was clearly still hung up on his ex but would deny it. I gave him the benefit of the doubt and in the end when we broke up he finally admitted I was there to fill a void. I was basically second best. 

This still angers me especially as I lost my virginity to him. To be honest I still haven’t forgiven myself for that. But alas I learnt a lot from that relationship about what I want. 

My current boyfriend that I met 2 years ago is great. He’s a lovely guy who has been serious with me from day one. The only thing is early on in our relationships when we spoke about our pasts he mentioned he’s had 2 girlfriends. He regrets the last one but his first girlfriend that he was with when he was younger - around 22  ( 4 years long ) he said that they were just too young at the time and that nothing went wrong. It fizzled out and that if they met when they were older things could have been different. 

It makes me actually wonder - am I second best, am I a place holder - what if she came back now that they are older &amp; more mature. To be honest these insecurities have been bothering me and Puts me off the relationship. 

I have brought this up to him and he’s said that he’s happy with me, and that if he wanted to stay at the time he would have stayed with her that he doesn’t think about his exes. But I’m not sure. My ex said the same things.

Chances are my mom won’t see one, in fact, she’ll get angry if you mention seeing one. When I was younger, she used to make fun of wanting me to see one. Recently, she wanted me to go to see if I have anger issues (ironic, I know), and I kinda want to through - huge tantrum (like stab my hand or thigh because I’m angry or slam the door on my arm so it breaks) so that she’ll have to take me to see one, but then I’ll pull a “I’m not seeing one until you see one” thing. At the same time, I’m scared if I stab myself CPS would get called and blah blah blah. 

I want to see if there is a more easier way to get her to see a psychiatrist (I’ll see one too), I just don’t want to have to bring it up, then for us to have a giant fight (I hate it when she’s angry it kinda gives me anxiety and makes me cry [its not as bad as you think though]) because she actually looks down on people who take medication regarding mental health (my sister it taking some for her mood disorder and didn’t tell mom). Any ideas?",05Jun2020,1
856,"Before Covid-19, I landed a new job on the other side of town. I found a new apartment that'd put me closer to the office, and signed a contract and put down a third of the deposit. The room is small, but I didn't expect to have to work from home. 

Then the pandemic happened. The move was postponed a couple of months, I stayed at my old place, and now finally it's supposed to go ahead on the 14th. But I finally got the dimensions of my new room, and it's so small I'm not sure how I can comfortably work and sleep in there. I was planning on getting a loft bed and putting a desk underneath, but the ceiling is too low. 

My current flatmates would be happy if I stuck around, and I'd save some money as well (lose the bit of deposit, but save on moving costs and furniture, etc) but I feel awful about backing out so close to moving day, when my new landlord has already waited two months for me.

865,"So I’ve looked around on reddit a lot but never posted so please bear with me if this post looks weird

I’m a 19 y/o, and I live with my mom, dad, and younger sibling (17). We have an older sibling (22) who lives across the country, but is coming back soon for a while. As for the reason I made this post, it has a little bit of a complicated background.

Up until now I’ve never had any worries of my mother cheating. It never occurred to me it was a possibility in this family and it never seemed likely. However, last year she did something (nothing bad but I want to keep this vague) that, idk, made her want to do more and make more friends and go out more. Honestly, we were all happy to see her so happy and lively. But one person she made friends with, let’s call him D, has been a sort of source of drama. Long story short, there was a bunch of drama with him revolving relationships and other things and at one point he told my mom he was in love with her. She has willingly told all this to me and my younger sibling, though she asked us to keep our father, who has a history of mental illness and has been going through a rough time recently, out of it so as to not stress him. This, while uncomfortable, made sense. This has been going on for months. As we got into quarantine, my mom has been refusing to Really social distance and has been constantly going out to see friends, including D. It has been super frustrating for everyone else in the family, esp considering my dad’s health is not the best. They’ve actually fought over this, and me and my sibling are honestly on my dad’s side because it’s his health on the line not hers. She’s also told my sibling that if one of us gets sick she’s going to couch surf for a while, which would literally leave my dad, the immunocompromised one, to take care of us.

Now, the straw that broke the camel’s back. Two days ago, someone close to my mom’s friend died. My mom went to comfort her and that was all fine. Yesterday she told us she went back. At one point though, she accidentally bag-dialed my sibling and my sibling heard a man’s voice. When asking my mom if she was with D, she denied it, and explained she had been with said friend and the friend’s son. However, my sister said the person sounded kinda like they had an accent, which my mom said he didn’t. Then she said it could’ve been the movie they were watching. It all made sense, we laughed about it, and then it was done.
However today, D came over to help with something, since he had promised he would. My sibling had never met him before and so this was the first time they heard his voice. They confronted me privately saying they didn’t want to confront our mom, but that they were at least 75% sure that was the voice on the line.

I want to believe my sibling is wrong, but I genuinely trust their opinion. And if they’re right, then the only reason I can think of as to why our mom would lie is that she’s cheating, or at least doing something equally shady. Paired with her recent disregard for the rest of her family, it feels super wrong, and I don’t know what to do. Like I said, I’m only 19, and I have no idea how to go about this. I don’t know if I should try to find more evidence or not, or how I would even do so. But my mom is already hurting the family and if she’s cheating then I don’t want to excuse her any more.

TL;DR my moms been acting kinda strangely recently and disregarding her family and my younger sibling thinks they heard the voice of her friend who’s romantically interested in her over the phone.",05Jun2020,1
866,"Hello everyone. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm having a dilemma, and talking to others about it isn't getting me anywhere. 

It's about my(26F) cousin (25F). For a background story, we have been very close since we were kids. She's like a sister to me. Now, we're from Puerto Rico, but on my paternal grandmother's side there's a bit of racism. My cousin has very straight/wavy hair with fair complexion, whereas I'm dark skinned with curly dark hair. For this reason, she has always been the favorite, I've always been treated as a ""bad influence"" over her, even though I'm the nerd of the family and my life is not perfect but I'm already independent. 

Her parents lost a baby (stillborn) before her, so they basically sheltered her to the extremes. She wasn't even allowed to go to the movies with anyone without her mom or dad being there. This obviously caused her to lie and do things without her parents knowing, even having sex at early age (13-14) with a 28M (which I was almost in shocked when I found out but she didn't pursue any legal action because she consented, even though I told her she was raped). She got pregnant at 18 with her still boyfriend (he was 24 I think at the time) and her mother basically just wanted to take care of her kid. All this sheltering, a horrible partner (he has cheated on her, left her alone in an apartment while taking their kid with him knowing she was stuck there, and other abusive stuff). 

I feel like shit, I've tried talking to her, she's very depressed, anxious but her parents see me as the bad one still because she met her partner through me (they've been together 10 years, you can do the math). She admits she is in a bad situation, but won't leave her partner. She has tried finishing anything in university, but she does not have a car and I was willing to help her but our schedules where completely different. 

Everyone in her life is extremely controlling of her to the point where she thinks she is in the wrong and that she is useless. And two years ago, she got pregnant again, and called me to see if I could take her to get an abortion because she did NOT want another baby. I lost contact with her in the process, because her partner basically made her move in with his mom, and she proceeded to keep the baby. The baby was stillborn at full term. 

She tells me she is in with a psychologist and psychiatrist, as she has tried to commit suicide multiple times, and while pregnant she swallowed many Ambien pills and was institutionalized in a psychiatric hospital for two weeks. 

Now, her partner was fired for trying to steal some masks and gloves boxes at his work, but he told her he was just laid off because there was not enough production (he works at BD). I know this because my uncle worked with him. So, she's been lied to, been mistreated, taken advantage of, and she's so hurt emotionally that she's numb to everything and just listens to her partner and mother. 

I don't know how to help her. She even resents her kid who is 6 years old already. Nobody allowed her to love that kid, she was told from the beginning how to do things in a controlling matter. I've notice that when she's with him she gets annoyed when he needs something, it's like she's disconnected emotionally from him, which I know is PPD but she has never been treated correctly. 

Every time I try to do something I'm stopped because ""is none of my business"" when she basically writes to me/calls me for advice, help and many other things. I feel like crap, she's like my little sister. 

I'm sorry for the long post but I just don't know what to do. Any advice I will be grateful!",05Jun2020,1
867,"M20, in college. I had a great internship this summer but it was cancelled. Now I'm back at home and debating whether or not to go back to work at the factory I've worked at for the last two summers.

It's pretty good money but it's really difficult work and I wasn't planning on going back so I don't really want to. But my parents are starting to breathe down my neck for not doing anything, but they aren't forcing me to get a job (mostly due to covid-19). Money-wise I'm alright, I have quite a bit in savings so I don't need the cash but it would certainly help me with not needing as many student loans.

The next problem is that in the factory I really liked working in one department (janitorial) because it was easy, but I hated working in manufacturing. So there's a chance I get manufacturing again and it gave a real mental and physical toll and I don't want to go through it again. If I get janitorial I think I'll be fine but I don't think I can find out what department I get before I'm hired and that would be taking a risk.

I'm also still concerned about Covid-19 because my state opened up too early a few weeks ago and still we still have a lot of cases (we've been getting like a dozen a day).

My other plan was I was going to spend the summer on hobbies, like I wanted to pick up writing and learning the guitar, but I haven't had the motivation. In the last three weeks I've barely touched the guitar and

After the advice I got I told my brother I don't want no part in what he's doing or to mention what he does and he backed off and even let me keep the stuff he bought me when I said I'd give them back. 

Even though I don't get involved with his shady activities I'm still affiliated with him. Every time his friends (that I've met before) see me they always say hi to me, I don't mind that but it's got to the point where people I don't even know will come up to me and ask if I'm ____’s sister or ask if I know him, I just say no just in case because I can't tell if they're one of his friends and I don’t know how they’ll react if I say yes. In-between now and my last post another one of my brothers friends has been arrested and I'm getting increasingly worried that he's next and I’m getting tempted to help him again so he doesn’t get arrested. 

At the moment since we’re on lockdown my brother’s hardly around, he goes on his daily walk but then doesn’t comes for hours, personally and I don’t have much reason to go out but when schools go back soon I won’t have a choice, I don’t want to ask my brother to protect me because I don’t really want to be seen with him at the moment but at the same time I’d feel more comfortable with him around.",05Jun2020,1

876,"I (31f) have a best friend, Isabel (31f). She is an amazing person, we've been friends for 18 years through all the important milestones of our lives: both our sets of parents' divorces, first boyfriends, high school, uni... She even saved my life when I tried to kill myself 6 years ago.
In February, after trying to conceive for almost a year and a half, my partner and I found out we are expecting our first child in October. Despite not being religious, I have decided to follow my family tradition and have our child christened sometimes next year. To me the figure of godparent has to be someone who's gonna be there for my kid, a stable presence, someone they can always count on and ask for advice throughout their life. 
As much as I love Isabel, right now she is not that person. She is constantly ""all over the place"", changes her mind about things and people every two seconds, she has a talent for putting herself in complicated situations and has a passion for drama. One day she hates her job and wants to drop everything to become a nurse, the following day she wonders whether she should move city for a guy she bearly knows, then she would jump on a plane and disappear to Bali for a month. She jumps from one wrong relationship to another without thinking and is heavily affected by each of them for months. Also, at the beginning of my pregnancy, after the initial display of happiness, she disappeared for almost 2 months because she was too caught up in some drama of hers she hadn't even mention before. Despite knowing that I already had had a miscarriage in 2018 and was therefore terrified that anything could go wrong.
After much thinking, I asked one of my closest friends, Julie, to be the godmother, and she enthusiastically accepted (and even made me cry a bit). Julie and I have known each other for 8 years, we never had a problem and she is one of the people I admire the most in my life. She is funny, smart, witty, she always says what she thinks without being a bitch (which I consider one of the rarest and most precious qualities in a friend), she has her head on her shoulders, she is getting married next year to her boyfriend of 11 years, knows what she wants in life and works hard for it every day.
I know Isabel will be hurt, she gets easily offended and is generally very touchy and sensitive. I cannot stress enough how much I love her but I can't see her being a serious influence on my child's life unless she gets herself and her life in order. How can I tell her that she won't be my child's godmother? Should I be honest and almost surely offend her or go for a white lie and make up some excuse?",05Jun2020,1

878,"Hey everyone, I'm a 20 year old male and I've been worrying a bit about something for a while. I've noticed some things about my body that I want to see a doctor about. I've noticed some if these things a while ago, like months ago, and some more recently. The issue is that going to a doctor isn't really an option right now because of everything still going on.

My alternatives are calling or doing a web call, or something like that. I feel like calling wouldn't work because I can't really describe, in detailed words, exactly the stuff that I want to show the doctor. I wouldn't really feel confident in my explanation. My other option is through a web call. Which at first sounds fine, but the stuff I want to show the doctor isn't really easily accessible to be shown, if that makes sense. Like, the web cam wouldn't be able to show what I want to show in good enough quality, and a doctor touching or feeling the stuff I want them to check out would be the most optimal.

So I've decided to just wait things out, and just keep a list of the things I want the doctor to check. I've tried researching my situation for days, and got no where except more stressed. I can relax and cope with what's going on, but I'm just wondering if what I'm doing is good, or if I should be doing, like, something else.

880,"So I have these two friends (we'll call them C and R) and they've been dating for as long as I've known them. They are going to get engaged soon but have been planning their wedding for a long time before that and always told be they wanted me to be the Best Man. I've more or less considered the three of us best friends and they've told me they considered me the same way plenty of times before, so when they first asked me ages ago I was ecstatic and accepted immediately.

Some time back though I had some dumb shit go down with another buddy of mine and I realized that I was the doormat friend. I started thinking critically about the way this person treated me and I realized that I didn't like it one bit. C and R were supportive throughout it, but since corona happened and I was forced to distance myself from everybody, it dawned on me that C and R didn't really treat me too differently.

Now, this other bud was objectively way worse, but I've realized that C and R do a lot of the more little things that also make me feel like shit. I guess I don't really know how often friends are supposed to talk to each other but C and R rarely text me, I usually have to reach out to them first or else we'd go like a month without talking at all, maybe even longer. Our go to activity is going to the movies every so often but I don't know if that really counts as hanging out since we just go home right afterwards. We are all still in uni currently and I ended up joining a club that they were already in because it was the only way that I knew I'd see them at least once a week, but a couple months in they had stopped showing up regularly anyway. And this is basically what our relationship has been like for years, though last school year (2018-2019) I did regularly go to their house for dinner once a week so there was that also at least. 

I think part of the reason that this is affecting me so much too is that for the past two years I spent the majority of my time being depressed and alone in my dorm. I was so often very lonely but I didn't really talk about it or tell anyone because I wanted people to hang out with me because they liked me and I was their friend, not because they felt bad. At the time, the fact that we didn't hang out very much didn't really register as a bad thing necessarily but I couldn't understand how my roommates and their best friend groups would actually come over and hang out and go places and have video game nights and groupchats that people actually talked in. I reasoned it to just be my fault for not being socially competent enough to make that kind of relationship happen. And the thing is, they have other friends too, and I'd always hear about the activities and stuff they'd do with those friends. I try not to dwell on it, and I don't try and weasel my way into those activities because I don't want to be clingy and I figured if they wanted me there they'd invite me. They aren't really people that like it when others just invite themselves to stuff anyway and have had problems with friends like that in the past so I didn't want to add on to that. I just can't help but, I dunno, feel some kind of way about the fact that they seem to be actually doing stuff with these other people. Sometimes I'll get invited, but only when I happen to be there already in a ""you can come too if you want"" kind of way.

Like I said before, it's only just now that I'm learning that I should be matching the energy that other people are giving me as opposed to giving everyone 110% no matter what. And after I started to try and apply it everyone in my life, I realized that looking from an outside perspective it doesn't really seem like C, R and I are best friends so much as casual bros. After a lot of time for forced self reflection, I think I always kind of knew that. They aren't bad people, and I get the feeling that from their perspective, we are that close. Like they decided that I was their best friend and from then on it was just a given constant. Like the best friend on a sitcom that's only in the episodes where they're needed but their closeness to the protagonist never wavers and never needs to be worked on. But I think that they do think about me, I just exist as a hypothetical often enough in their heads that the closeness is still maintained for them. They also sometimes do very nice and thoughtful things for me. They always bake me a cake for my birthday, and a few months ago when I was having a rough time they brought me a goodie basket. This isn't really a me specific thing for them, but most people I know don't do stuff like that for me at all so I feel really lucky when people do stuff like that for me. I just can't shake the feeling though that we weren't really best friends, my standards were just exceptionally low and I had never experienced anything better.

So swinging back around to the point: At this moment, I don't think either of them would be the best person my wedding. They'd be in the wedding party but I think my Best Man would be my best friend from high school who I'm still close to and talks to me nearly every day and checks up on me and stuff. And because of that, I want to back out of being the BM at their wedding because I don't think it would be fair to let them place me at such an important position in their lives if they don't mean the same to me. I'm just not sure though if I'm being rational or if finally admitting to myself that I wasn't satisfied with this relationship is just making me so mad that it seems that they aren't good friends in my head. I don't want to let them down or make them have to change their entire plans though, and I especially don't want to burn bridges and realize later that this is actually is what best friends are like and I lost people that I loved because I thought that not fitting into the version of friendship that I had in my head meant that they didn't love me. I need an outside opinion, does this sound like a good relationship to you?",05Jun2020,1
881,"I’ve always had a strained relationship with my mom but that doesn’t mean it’s always bad. It’s good most of the times actually, but I just never know what to expect. I used to think it was because of me, that I was being a brat (probably was), that I was a horrible, immature person who just needed to grow up. Now that I am growing up (20F), I’m starting to see that it wasn’t just me. My dad confirmed it to me today, when had a bit of a deeper discussion about my mom and how she reacts sometimes.

I described it as “it’s as if she needs to get you before you can get her. Like a bully.” My dad agreed.

She always leaves the argument before you can get a word in. We never apologized to each other once either, because she just leaves. 

The other day I asked her to stop using the n-word just to tick me off because to me it’s not a joke. Never was. She got really defensive, although she declined being bothered by it. Then went on to rant about my generation, then hurt me by saying my dad’s girlfriend will watch me get my graduation cap on (really intimate moment for me) because she knows I don’t want her there. I don’t like when strangers sees me cry and I know I will. I didn’t want to further this ridiculous discussion so I got up and went for a long walk. It was either walking away or having her ignore me for 3 days. There was no reason to bring my graduation up.

The other day I said I just really needed some alone time in my room. Even the sound of the door opening would probably annoy me because I was just really drained. Her response was to roll her eyes and say “don’t worry, I won’t even look at your door. Am I allowed to close the window (next to my door) or does that make too noise? Hm? I won’t even make a sound!” Then she didn’t talk to me for the rest of the day.

I’ve really come to rely on either not being home, or when I am home I’ll just kind of day dream the day away. I never know how she’ll react, even to simple comments or requests. I’m not even allowed to ask when dinner is ready. I often ask to make my plans fit with dinner.

I mean, is it best to just walk away? I’ve only learned to apologize a year back and I would really like to do it more. But there’s no way she’ll apologize and if I do it, I know she won’t even look at me, and it’s still really hard for me to do. There’s no way I can defend my case, rationalize with her or end the argument without one of us having to leave. I honestly hate it because it’s uncomfortable as hell. But is there anything else I can do? Biting my tongue and leaving doesn’t seem healthy 

Side note: ever since I bought AirPods, I have them in my ears constantly. I love listening to music but it’s also easier to walk around the house listening to extremely loud music. That way I kind of have an excuse to ignore her, and I’m aware that she talks to me sometimes but I just continue doing what I was doing and hope she leaves it alone? She can’t really tell that I have them in because of my hair. It’s the only way I know how to deal.

Side note, side note: I haven’t been home since Sunday pretty much, and now she just came in saying I should tell her if I have a problem. She then said I’ve had mood swings the past week. I immediately wanted to say I just respond to her, however she talks to me. But I didn’t wanna get in a fight so I just said “I have been happy but I don’t appreciate when she talks to me in a mean tone (idk the English word)” to which she got defensive and blamed her tone on me. I know she didn’t really want to know what my problem with her was, or she would get offended.

I just don’t know what to do. I want to move out already but it’s too expensive",05Jun2020,1
882,"Hello. 

First time poster, sorry for the mistakes. I am 21f, a month away from graduating from uni, and today I got rejected from what was my dream job in the final selection stage - a graduate program where i could experience lots of different sides of the business, while traveling through europe. They told me I was a really strong candidate and excelled in all the tests and personal interviews, but at the end they didnt see me on the long term in the company, whatever that means. 

Now I just feel like crying, cus I believe that no job would have made me as happy as that one would have, and do not know what to do next, cus every job position I read does not motivate me at all. Moreover, with the corona crisis, i am extremely anxious cus i know that the economic recession that is coming is going to be harsh, and its literally the worst time to enter into the labour market.

I don’t believe that i can give up, cus at the end of the day, i will need a job to eat. However, I do not see myself happy on the long run.

Any advice on how to re-find motivation?",05Jun2020,1
883,"My mother sat me down today and told me the truth, I never knew my father and honestly it hasn't bothered me too much because I kind of knew that was something I didn't want to touch on. 

I always suspected this was the case because when I was around 8 maybe I asked my mom who my dad was and she refused to tell me his name. When I kept pressing her she told me he touched her in a bad place and went to jail. I left it at that, I never thought much about it at the time but as I got older I suspected it. 

Now this isn't what the advice is for although it's important. The problem is my mom told me she feels as though Im pushing her out of my life and honestly it's true. I don't tell her anything about my life, my friends, work. I don't show her pictures. I don't know why I do this and I just can't seem to stop. Maybe I feel like a burden because of what my father did but shouldn't I feel closer to her? For protecting me and not getting an abortion... I don't know why I'm the way that I am. I enjoy being alone and keeping to myself but my mother is getting angry and hurt and I don't want that. But a part of me just doesn't care and I can't shake it. I don't care about people, only myself and I'm scared that maybe I'm becoming my father. I don't know who he is or what he looked like but I can't help but feel like I'm acting like him and its concerning. 

How do I become more open with my mother and people in general? Please help I appreciate negative and positive feedback.",05Jun2020,1

888,"I am fairly concerned with my future, and am in need of some advice. For context:

I am a 21 y/o Canadian Orphan just graduating fresh out of University with an Honors BA in Game Design. My parents died when I was very young, leading me to live with my Grandparents, who have raised me up until this point. Two years ago, I met my partner, whom my Grandmother avidly hate, prompting my Partner to strongly dislike them back.

While I questioned putting this in r/relationshipadvice, my issue seems to be coming from my lack if direction in life, with the added context of being stuck between two polar opposites. Both parties do genuinely seem to care about me and my best interest at heart, but have vastly different ways of approaching it.

My Grandmother, amidst all the troubles going on, wants me to stay with her, break up with my Partner, and pursue a second degree, something that will take two years and money I do not currently have. My Grandmother is impossible to deal with (I know that's a fairly overused and often exaggerated term, but it does apply here), and while I understand where she's coming from, I won't be able to get anything relevant to my field (which I haven't even gotten my foot into yet) until next year, when a Master's Program for my field will be made. Although I lack the money to be able to do this and any drive to do, she is adamant about it.

My Partner, although understanding of my situation, adamantly wants me to move in with her just an hour beyond the US border (She's in New York, I'm in Ontario). While I am a dual citizen (Canadian/American), the idea of making a drastic change, let alone one I understand my Grandmother will actively despise me for, is daunting. I only have a modest amount of money (for a University Graduate), and, I'll painfully admit, am not very ""life prepared"". I've never lived on my own or taken on a lot if big responsibilities, am fairly spineless (as per this struggle) and not the brightest, making a monumental change sound extremely daunting.

I'm not sure what is the best course of action to do. Any of my actions to support one angers the other, two years of trying to get them to get along has not worked, I'm not sure if I'm even going to be able to get a job in my field, and I'm not sure how to live normally let alone under such drastic circumstances.

I could go back to school for another degree or my Masters, stay here and upset my Partner, move in with my Partner and upset my Grandma, try to get a job in my field, get a general job... I'm, lost as per direction, and riding this out passively doesn't seem effective.",05Jun2020,1

890,"
There’s this guy that I’ve known for a couple of months and he’s the brother of a good friend of mine. When I’m with my friend she’s always telling me how good me and her brother would look together and that statement alone already puts me off to the idea of starting anything with him but I still wanted to try. We’ve texted a couple of times but never seem to be able to keep the conversation going for long enough and last week he slid into my DM‘s again and this time the conversation was going rather good. So we texted for a couple of days and he immediately asked me to have a call and I really thought it was supposed to be a phone call but when he called me it was through video chat and I was so uncomfortable. I didn’t want to do it but I didn’t want to disappoint him. I didn’t want to hurt his feelings because I had already seen him once in real life and I kinda said something that hurt his feelings. His sister(my friend) was trying to get us to talk and trying to really force a imaginary relationship on ne and I didn’t like it so I told everybody loudly near me and he heard it and was in a bad mood the whole night so I didn’t wanna hurt his feelings again and accepted the video call. We video called three time. The first two calls went really well actually, he was a funny guy and I really liked our conversation then the third time, mind you he called me three days in a row and I’m actually not a person like that I don’t talk with my friends every day, like that’s not how I am but since I kinda liked him I just accepted you know I wanted to see what he wanted to talk about. Prior to the video call he had told me that he was in a bad mood that day so I wasn’t really sure what he wanted to talk about. During the video call he really gave me a strange vibe so let me explain what happened. We didn’t actually talk that much but every time he said something he was always complementing me telling me : you’re so pretty, you’re so beautiful, your laugh is so cute, you’re so cute, I like your smile, he said that to me the other two days too but this time he was telling me all the time and you can complement me but like not all the time because first of all it loses it’s meaning and I told him to stop because it made me really uncomfortable. During the calls he’s always saying things under his breath and sometimes I catch what he saying but sometimes I don’t and when I ask him to repeat it he’s like oh no no don’t worry about it. His sister has told me some weird things that he’s done in his past and that’s why I’m also apprehensive of him but I wanted to give it a try. However I really notice now that he’s weird and always saying dumb shit like he dead ass asked yesterday if it was OK for him to have me as his phone background because I was his crush. He dead ass told me after seeing me once and texting a few days that I was his crush and I was like sorry but I don’t have these feelings hope you understand. So he asked me if it was OK to have me as his background and I actually didn’t believe what I heard and asked him to repeat and he was like no it’s ok and I was like why would you want that and he’s like yeah because you’re pretty and then he’s like “actually I’ve had you as my background for a long time”. That creeped me out so much. To have me as your background when we’re not even friends, when we don’t even know each other. He even told me to change mine to him lmao as if I would ever do that. I told him he didn’t have that right and he said “yet”. Then idk why I think I wasn’t talking or not showing my face and he said I should talk and I said why and he said that he always misses me and my voice. I was like how is that possible and he said it’s true. That’s when I told him that he’s strange as hell but he didn’t understand why so I told him like I find it strange him saying he misses me and my voice and telling me I’m pretty all the time so after I told him that we stayed on the call without saying anything and suddenly from the corner of my eye, cause I wasn’t directly looking at the camera, I see tears coming out of his eyes and that guy had positioned the camera directly on his eyes like definitely on purpose for me to see I tried to ignore it, pretend I hadn’t seen but eventually I asked if it was because of what I said. He said it wasn’t and I told him I’m sorry I don’t want to lie to you and let you live in your fantasy world. I just say it how it is and how I feel. So we ended the call him telling me to text when I feel like it. So we haven’t texted lol.

891,"I’m using an account I am certain my parents or friends don’t know about.  I also don’t want to reveal my age, so I’m just going to say that I am a teenager.

I don’t have bad parents, at least I don’t think I do.  They provide a lot for me, and we aren’t rich but we aren’t poor either.  I also am pretty close to my parents, probably because I am an only child.  I’m probably closest to my dad overall, but nowadays, I’ve been getting really close to my mom.  I just have been noticing a lot about both of them.  This is stuff I never picked up on as a kid, because I was blind to my parents being wrong.  I’ll mainly talk about my dad, due to the fact he has the most issues in my eyes.

My dad can be scary at times.  He is good at arguing, and has temper issues.  He lashes out at me and my mom when we do things wrong, but luckily he doesn’t do it that often.  He talks bad about a lot of his friends, and my mom to me.  He tells me all of my mom’s flaws, while at the same time saying he loves her uncontrollably.  He tells me that his friends have really awful issues, and then fails to try and help those problems.  It always makes me think that he’s talking bad about me behind my back, I mean, he does it to his own wife.  I never confront him about these issues I have with him, mainly because after he does these things, he acts nice to everyone again, and I end up reluctantly moving on.  He’s only made me actually fear him once.  I made him upset, and he actually locked me and my mother outside, until we did what he asked us to.  I really had to go to the bathroom, but he refused to let me back in until I lied about having “lady problems” (he hates everything period related, and even refuses to buy pads/tampons, but that’s another story).  I locked the door when I went to the bathroom that time (I usually don’t, idk that’s just what my family does).  My mom was completely angry at him, and she actually confessed that he has been disrespectful to her in the past.  I told her after breaking down that I fear that one day he’d let his anger take him too far, and end up lashing out at me, her, or our family dog.  So, let’s talk about that period stuff I mentioned.  He hates periods.  Absolutely hates them.  He refuses to say period and instead calls it the disabled list.  He has told me in the past with full seriousness that he will never buy me pads/tampons, even if I were bleeding down my leg.  My mom puts up with it, but I absolutely am livid about that.  It’s just disrespectful to women.  He has told me this in the past, that he thinks women who show an excessive amount of skin are all “sluts” who are asking to be sexually assaulted, so that made me mad too.  Lastly, let’s cover politics.  He and my mom are both very conservative (my mom isn’t as much, but still).  I do see some of their views as true, but I also understand and agree with more liberal views.  Every time I try to share my own views with him, he constantly questions me, and tries to shoot down my arguments, rather than just respecting them and moving on.  It makes me scared to share opinions to them, and others too (I’m pretty much a doormat oof).

I just don’t know.  What do I even do?  Every time he hurts me, he apologizes, but never actually stops doing his bad behaviors.  I feel like I’m trapped in a circle of being hurt, then brought up and apologized to, then hurt all over again.  I said at the beginning I was closest to my dad, and that’s true.  We both have similar comedic interests, and both share a sense of humor.  He’s actually really nice when he isn’t acting up at me and my mom.  What do I do about my parents, but mainly my dad?",05Jun2020,1
892,"So - a bit of background. I’ve been doing CrossFit for about 4 years now, and with the pandemic I’ve lost my motivation to do it. As well, I’m not as interested in CrossFit anymore.

So, I want to quit CrossFit until the pandemic is over and I can go back to the gym. Instead, I want to focus on my Powerlifting and some gymnastics skills. I have a workout plan and everything. When I bring this up to my mom, however, she refuses to let me quit CrossFit, stating that I’ll “get fat” and that “powerlifters are unhealthy” as her reasons, with no ability to back this up. 

My mom seems to expect I’m going to be some CrossFit legend or whatever, because she refuses to even let me take a rest day. I have to fight with her to not do CrossFit when I’m injured. CrossFit is turning into something I dread, and that I try to avoid at all costs, which I hate. I used to absolutely love CrossFit.

904,"So I’ll start from the beginning. I F(21) reunited with my high school acquaintance in my college when I was a fresh man as she was, we had the same classes and pretty soon we bonded together and became inseparable. More than half way into the first semester she showed me the guy she was crushing on, let’s call him Jay. He didn’t know about her crush on him and I jokingly said to her. Oh I’ll tell him, she dared me to do so and I did. 

So I walked up to him and said “my friend has a crush on you” , he glanced at her at smiles and walks away

Days roll by after that and they become pretty close, she always told me what an absolute gentle man he was and I was happy for her, I often joked around with her and say “maybe I’ll crush on him” stupid I know but I thought she knew well that he wasn’t my type, given he was handsome but I can I tell you, I “had” a thing for guys with rich parent (don’t judge me please, I was young and stupid) I thought she knew this, how wrong I was.

I have severe concentration problems for lack of a better way to put it, I have never been able to pay attention in class, my attention span was no more than two minutes so I never understood what was being taught in class and I never ask because I didn’t like that type of attention, I told her about this and she said I could join them whenever he tutored her, I was glad, she was a good friend. 

I started showing up for the lessons and he carried me along by asking lots of questions, I don’t pay attention but I understand quickly, faster than she did and then he commended me regularly. I think that was when it all started to go South. 

I have what you’d call a foul mouth, I cuss a lot and used profanity’s without hesitating, yet I’m a virgin that hates being touched and didn’t show any skin (which people found as paradoxical), I also have what other people called unique opinions and I was pretty loud when with few people. That being said I made friends pretty quickly so I soon became friends with Jay, I’ll like to point out that at this point they weren’t dating, just really good friends and he made it clear that he had a girlfriend he was very much in love with. 

I digress, forgive me, Jay soon found that I was very quiet among the rest of his friends that will soon become my friends too when ever we where walking back from class to our dorms and I was quiet he’d leave my friend to come ask why I was quiet. 

I usually shrugged it off. Sometimes he’d try to keep me company but I always urged him to go back to my friend and keep her company as she’d be alone without him.

This continues until one day we where out reading and she wouldn’t talking to me (if you are still reading, thank you) 

I knew very well she had intense mood swings so I just let her be thinking she’d bounce back. Lol. She was normal with everyone else except Jay and I, she won’t even let him tutor her. Later that night she told one of our friends that I was flirting with him and possibly in love with him and he’s in love with me too. 

I was shocked to the core, I didn’t sleep a wink that day. I did not like him, I tried to convince her about that the next day but she wasn’t hearing it. Jay spoke to her a day after that and I thought he had gotten through to her. She apologized and everything seemed fine. 

The next semester rolls in and it’s a rollercoaster of her ignoring me, checking my phone when I wasn’t looking or gaslighting me. She constantly humiliated me in public, by this I mean I could be talking to her in the presence of other people and she’d totally ignore me or yell at me. I stuck around because she constantly apologized and we always found a way to make up. 

I’d like to add that for peace to reign I stopped all communications with him completely but this did nothing to help our relationship, she still found a way to blame me when things got rough between them. My grades dropped drastically for this because I couldn’t find a tutor that could keep me up to pace.

Sophomore year rolls by and I’m like fuck it, ghosting him isn’t helping anything, not our friendship or my grades so when he spoke to me I answered with my usual upbeat attitude, I didn’t think he liked me and I sure as hell didn’t like him because he had a rather large appetite for girls and they swarmed to him alike so I was cool with being just friends.

This infuriated my friends even more and she ghosted me too, during this period Jay and I became rather close and though I wasn’t in love with him, I knew he loved me, I also knew it was temporary because that’s just who he is so I never let it extend past friendship. I made another female friend during this period, let’s call her Zee. I was pretty content but I was her only friend so we found our way back to each other. 

The rollercoaster ride of emotions continued with her but it was less this time, one time she threatened to kill her self if I don’t send her all the text between Jay and I. Of course I obliged, she apologized quite profusely after that and we went back to being very much like star crossed friends. (See what I did there? Star crossed lovers?)

She would ignore me when ever he pays special attention to me which was very often, he also starred at me frequently and always complimented me, to which she’d try to imply that I was ugly or make insane assumptions. I’d like to state that at this point they where not even friends because she pushed him away, while I could bare her gaslighting and all he couldn’t keep up with it and she was angry at me for it.

Anyways junior year rolls by and everything was going well, not once did she push me away, there where times where I knew she was unhappy about things but she kept it cool.

Now we are back at home and she seems very aggressive towards me, telling me how much I make her feel like a bad person and how I make her feel like she doesn’t deserve anything good from people, and what not, she said I need not pretend and make her feel bad about herself and I could be honest about my feelings towards her.

I have felt nothing but love for her (I’m straight, just friendship love), I stuck by her because I knew she had a good heart but she also gave me tons of anxiety. 

She said she didn’t care if we where ever friends again and I could start by removing her from my Snapchat. I told her if she feels that way about herself she shouldn’t blame me which is about the meanest thing I’ve ever said to her and I said if she didn’t want me on her Snapchat she could remove me. 

She removed me and that was it for weeks, I called her a couple of days ago for closure, she said to forget about everything and that she accidentally removed me from her Snapchat. LMFAO. It’s almost impossible to make a mistake like that. 

I tell her we need to talk and she tells me she’s watching a movie and that she’d be free by 2 am because she has to sleep first. I told her that’s fine but I’d be asleep by then. We haven’t spoken since. 

Yesterday she asks me on ig what my Snapchat handle is so she’ll add me back. I gave it to her without saying anything else. 

When she spoke to me I could here the anger in her voice, I don’t know what to do now, do I talk to her?
Ghost her? End things? Apologize? Honestly I’m tired of everything. What would you do if you where in my shoes?",05Jun2020,1

I tried calling and sending an email but no response and I can’t go in person due to COVID-19. I’ve been out of college due to depression and anxiety and than OCD. I was there for two semesters at the time but always had a mental breakdown and I didn’t finish my semester nor took finals due to stress, depression, anxiety and OCD. So I have zero credits and start from zero. I never fully dropped out of school I just stop attending classes and been out of college for three years. I don’t know how much I have in debt now. But I’m feeling better through therapy and now it’s more manageable but I was supposed to go with my mom to Colombia in August but with COVID 19 and the Colombian government said no international travel until September. My mom wants to change it to December and return in early January but the first two weeks of December if I’m enrolled will be the end of the semester and finals. My mom said she’s going to change the flight for December tomorrow. And I want to return to school but The college hasn’t reached out and it’s all by email and phone (Which I did both multiple times) but they haven’t responded. Most likely I have to wait until the spring 2021. I’ll be 24 by than and still not sure on what I really want to do in terms of careers or passions or what path to take in my life.

During that period I shared some COVID-19 rules that would “stop” one of them bringing their boyfriends over and another from bringing their sibling over to sleep over. The sibling would becoming from another country and would need to self isolate for 2 weeks here (which was not discussed). 

I told them I don’t care but they should take care of the hygiene. But I ended up being the bad guy. 

Long story short. For the past two nights they have been watching the show without me. Today I finally asked if they were still behind and they had an awkward look on their face, I shook my head and laughed. Bitches.

926,"So I met this girl online, and we’ve talking to each other for a little over 3 months and we’ve just been clicking on every level. She likes everything I like, she has the same views as me, and it’s just crazy, I’ve never met someone so similar to me. So after a month or two of us talking we both confessed that we did have some feelings for each other. But keep in mind we met online, so she’s somewhat far away from me (I’m in Kansas and she’s from Georgia) and the only way is long distance. But in her past, she’s done it before and she told me how it affected her (she overthinks, gets anxiety, and stuff like that) lots of negative effects. So we were in an interesting position. So it was all smooth sailing for the most part, until this Wednesday where she said she doesn’t really know how she feels about me anymore. That hit like a truck. I had a wave of emotions come upon me and I instantly began wondering what happened. I had tons of affection for her, and overall just had a major connection with her, and I feel like that just made it worse. So we talked about it and she kind of said she just lost them. That hurt. But honestly, I feel like I was the reason for it to happen. So little insight about me, I don’t like slow replies and she wasn’t the best about reply time and I always got onto her about it. Like I’d hound her and I thought nothing bad of it, but now looking back, I feel terrible for it and feel like it had a play in the incident. But anyways enough of that, so after she admitted to being sort of confused about if she had feelings or not, she friendzoned me. Yikes. And I guess I’ve been in some sort of shock for the past few days, like a couple weeks ago she had feelings and they just disappeared. I don’t want to believe it, but I’ll eventually have to swallow the truth. So since Wednesday, I’ve been like a walking corpse, I’ve felt empty, sad, disappointed in myself, and overall so many things. I don’t know how I can get back to the norm. Like thinking about the idea of her being with another guy makes me sick to my stomach. And I’ve just been having lots of obsessive thoughts and etc. I’m just being torn from the inside at this point and I don’t know what to do.

I really think of little things so no one has to clean up after me. For example I wash the plate/utensils I use right after so dishes don't pile up. But people around me like my elder brother just breeze through life doing the bare minimum-he'll always leave his dishes to be washed by whoever. He does this in all the time, like he is free of responsibility for anything. It really annoys me how genuinely inconsiderate both my brothers are. They'll play football in our yard, when everyone is sitting nearby and not mind the ball so it constantly almost hits me or someone. They won't play something else or shoot in the other direction because they don't just care. At the same time I'm jealous and I wish I didn't feel this overwhelming burden of responsibility.

929,"Long time lurker looking for some advice on dealing with neighbors and also just need to rant a little - 

So the backstory is I just moved to a new city recently (I am located in Ontario), and for well over a month I have been dealing with asshole neighbors playing loud music during all hours of the day. I am working from home, and I usually wear headphones at all times of the day, but there is very heavy bass in their music, and also a lot of the time its *really* loud so there is basically no escape from it. 

I've tried several things to resolve this problem, in the order of 

* Communicate with said neighbors, after which they turned the music down for a little while and then it was business as usual the next day
* Reaching out to condo management a few times, who told me 2 weeks ago that they are preparing a legal letter to the tenants of the unit but so far I haven't had any updates.
* Reaching out to the super who has been kind enough to call them and ask them to quiet things down at my request, but he is not on-site at the moment so they can basically ignore his message
* Reaching out to Bylaw who basically told me that there's nothing that can be done at this time, given COVID, since I live in an apartment and they are not able to come up for a decibel reading.
* Communicating with said neighbors again, who basically told me that they didn't appreciate me going to condo management ( I didn't tell them this, but I guess it's easy to guess ) and that I can't stop them from ""living their life"" ... I considered this but their way of life is intruding on my daily life (and probably lives of other neighbors, both super and bylaw told me there's been complaints about them before and they told me themselves that they were almost evicted before), so I don't think I'm wrong to complain here...  
Anyway, I told them I would call Bylaw but they said Bylaw wouldn't do anything to them, which they are right about, so I guess they are pretty experienced assholes.

It's been a really distressing month and each day is getting worse, so today I finally lost my temper and threw my shoe at our shared balcony wall when they started blasting their music from the balcony (My mistake, I know). Argument ensued, everybody got mad, but nothing really happened except some yelling back and forth.

Well during this exchange I found out they are moving in a month, and they basically told me to be prepared to ""enjoy"" my last month with them, not in a threatening way but more as in they are going blast their music and do whatever they do whenever they want since there's nothing I can do about them in a month's time (super told me eviction takes 60 days, they know this as well)

Really sorry for the long backstory, but I am so frustrated at this point.   
To be honest, I'm really tempted to mess with them and give them a taste of their own medicine, even though it's not really my place, and I really don't want to be like them and end up disturbing other neighbors the same way. 

Is there anything I can do to save myself some headache in the next month?  
What should I do? Am I just totally fucked with only my keyboard as an outlet for my frustration?",05Jun2020,1

932,"(TLDR below) So one of my friends does commissions for art, and he has a discord server for his followers which he asked me to mod because I'm one of his few irl friends from school. Initially it started out great but things are becoming more strained, due to various things:

&amp;#x200B;

1. One of the rules is ""refrain from being political"". One of his followers asked ""what's up everyone"" and people gave various responses, and I replied ""lol nothing much, there's a protest at the park nearby"" and everyone jumped on me for being political. I asked my friend for his input, and he came in and said that politics are not allowed. I did not share any opinions, I simply stated there was a protest going on and people took offense to that for some unknown reason.  

2. Another follower of his went on a rant about why she thinks the claims of Trump being ""homophobic, xenophobic, and racist are wrong and \[she\] hates people who think that"". My friend did not respond and was silent, even though I deem that to be a political statement. When I told her, ""hey, please be considerate and dial it back a tiny bit, because things like him saying the 'Chinese virus' has indirectly affected me and other Asian Americans"". My friend immediately responded by tagging me and said ""remember you should refrain from politics here"", ie. directing his message towards me instead of her.  

3. Now things get tricky here. This fan seemingly has a crush on my friend. He knows this for a fact and stated in private he does not like her but ""it feels good to be liked"" and enjoys her attention.  When she edges into rule breaking territory, he doesn't really stop her either. The girl has picked up somewhere along the line that I know my friend irl and does not like me for that fact... especially after my friend revealed in a drunken rant that he regretted ""not getting the opportunity to date"" me back in high school. He apologized for the awkwardness he caused after he became sober and I honestly don't know how to feel about that.

I know the general advice is ""privately talk to him and express your concerns!"" but I don't know what to do or say. He doesn't have many irl friends left, and I'm one of them. I don't want to hurt his art business either by stirring up controversy but I don't feel comfortable either. Please advise.

TLDR: Modding for my friend's art business discord. He seems to hold double standards and his ""refraining from politics"" rule has only been enforced with me even though I personally feel I wasn't being political at all. One of his fans has a crush on him and does not like me, and somewhere along the line he make an awkward rant about ""not getting the opportunity to date"" me back in high school. I feel uncomfortable and don't know what to say to him.",05Jun2020,1

940,"Hello everyone today I woke up to a smell of burnt metal. At first I thought it was because yesterday I was barbecueing with my friends outside of town and I though that smell was because of the barbecue smoke. Now I decided to go and take a shower this morning but when I left my room my apartment was full of smoke. At first I thought something is on fire and wanted to call the fire department I rushed to see if someone was in the apartment because I live with my parents, and my dad was just sitting there didn't even realize the whole apartment was full of smoke. I rushed to the kitchen and thankfully nothing was on fire but my father decided to make something to eat and forgot about that he left the metal pot on the cooker. I immedietly turned off the cooker and opened every window in the apartment. Everything is ok just now the whole apartment smells like burned metal. Is there a way to get rid of that smell.

941,"Sorry for bad grammar, please tell me if a part of my story is unclear. Throwaway account.

I (F16) live with my mom, dad and sister. When I tried to tell my parents that I had mulitple mental problems, they basicly laughed it away. To give a bit of backstory of myself, I got bullied for 6+ years, a syndrome which blockes me from doing sports and I cant do a lot of jobs. I have mulitple mental problems including depression and im in therapy for it. My mom kinda tried to help out but she only talked about the miss of her father who passed away (Which I 100% dont blame her for, since it must be hard, but I dont think its fair that she can ignore my mental problems with that excuse for almost 3 years at this point). My dad doesnt care at all, neither does my sister. They obv like her way more then they like me. We are twins but shes smarter, the more social one, didnt get bullied and is in every view better then me. She goes for a far better job (she wants to become a teacher, while im an gameartist) and my parents set her in the front with everything. When I mention my feelings about this they scream at me. My online friends hear her screaming at me a lot and they are in a discord call with me while im typing this out. One of the 2 guys is my ''boyfriend'' (Their is an agegap, not important for the story but we arent allowed to date until im 18) They are the only people I currently have and show that they care about me. I dont have a place to go since im not allowed to go to my bf until im 18. I currently have no idea what to do and im done with mutiple years of ignorance and the feeling of being the useless kid in the house.

Any advice?",05Jun2020,1
942,"Tl;dr at bottom.

This one has a good bit of back story, so buckle up.

I have a myriad of disorders. Both medical and mental. But mostly mental.

However, my medical problem is mainly a chronic illness. I'd rather not specify, but basically it effects me cognitively, I have random spikes of pain and aches, I don't have a lot of energy, and overall my body is really bad at being a body.

I was diagnosed about two years after something triggered it. It had been dormant for a long time before that, and when it was triggered it was a pretty sudden change in me that a lot of people around me noticed. At the time, my family and I thought it was best to focus on my chronic illness and then work on my mental illnesses. We thought it'd be less stressful and easier for me to manage. I still stand by that.

So, the good news is, in the past two years since starting treatment, I've gotten way better. It is a life long illness, so I'll never really fully recover, but I can function pretty well and actually keep up relatively well with a lot of my peers most of the time. Of course, I still have bad days but they don't discourage me. Especially because I'm well enough that my treatment my come to end soon because of how well I'm doing overall.

The bad news is, as my chronic illness is becoming easier to live with and managing, my mental illnesses are rearing their ugly heads again. I think my chronic illness just made them generally less noticeable, like sure, some symptoms were definitely amplified, but a lot of them were suppressed, I think. 

An example of this is, before my chronic illness got bad, I used to have anxiety attacks everyday at school (I was diagnosed in highschool) around the same time. When they didn't happen, I'd worry about it and have an anxiety attack because of it. That stopped happening as my chronic illness got worse. I think I was just so drained from school, I just didn't have the energy to. By the time I would've usually had one, I was ready to sleep.

As I've gotten better, my anxiety (and other mental illnesses) has gotten worse. Or maybe just more noticeable to me. I'm not sure on the why, really. But I do want to start going to therapy to try and cope with it. I've had more anxiety attacks and ""episodes"" I guess we can call them and they've been slowly getting worse since last summer.

I scared to seriously bring this up to my mom though. I'm 19, I've never had a job (I was looking for one when around the time I was diagnosed, but doctors told me not to, it'd be too much stress on top of treatment and school), and part of me feels I should wait until I can afford a therapist.

My mom has had to pay for all of my appointments, medications, blood tests, even college (I'm in college now), everything since I was 17. She's never complained and she's told me to not worry about it, but I still feel bad that I don't really contribute at all. 

We're not struggling financially or anything like that, but I feel really bad at just the thought of asking her about getting me a therapist because I know that's expensive and she's already done so much for me. Again, she's never complained and has always told me it's not a problem, but I feel like by asking I'm abusing her kindness.

Especially because she doesn't know that my mental illnesses have gotten worse. I've hidden it (this isn't the first time I've hidden stuff like this, usually it becomes bad enough that I have to see someone and get diagnosed) because I don't want her to worry too much about me, more than she's bound to anyway. 

But because she doesn't know about that, I feel like in asking, it will just seem like I'm overreacting, ungrateful, and wanting to waste much of money because of it.

·

Tl;dr - My mom has paid for everything for me, from medical stuff, to college tuition. I think I need a therapist but I can't afford one. I don't know if I should ask my mom or wait until I can afford it on my own because I don't want to take advantage of her and, how nice and supportive she's been through everything.

What should I do? Should I wait until I can pay for it? Or should I bring up getting a therapist to my mom?",05Jun2020,1
943,"As the title states, I would like to work on a project. I don't want to go into details, but this project does require developers other than myself. So far, I've acquired the help from my younger brothers, who can definitely help in this project, but there is the help of one other person I must recruit.

This person's basically essential to getting the project done quickly. My brothers can do what he does, but he does it well. He's also good at managing the portion of the project he works on.

But there is a problem in having him work on this project. This person was previously my ""friend."" He was very manipulative towards me and has used me. He's taken so much of my childhood away because he insisted I only play with him. He's pulled so many stunts and is favored by everyone around him. Obviously, I broke away from his grasp and am now free.

But by having him work with us on the project, he will take as an opportunity to rebuild his one-sided relationship. He will try to seize me once again. 

TL;DR: I really want to work on this project. Recruiting other help isn't easy, especially because this guy listens to me as the manager of the project. He knows I'm in charge. The issue is rebuilding a relationship with said guy.",05Jun2020,1

The only things that make it hard for me is the fact that I still love her and she is currently seeing or talking to someone else.

She lives with my mom(59) and I(21) in NV but she's unbearable. My mother drives her around to the Dr's and other places because she's unable to drive. My mother even babies her. Recently my sister has been mean. She talks very aggressively to both my mother and I whenever we ask her for something. 

Ex. My boyfriend is working night shifts and my sister shares the bedroom next to ours. She slams the doors and stomps all over the place so I ask her nicely if she can be a little quieter because my bf is trying to sleep. She got really defensive and kept asking ""why"" even though I gave her a good reason. Which, I thought, she would understand because she's always sleeping and so I try to keep quiet whenever she asks. 

She also talks like this towards our mom. My mom is nice to her even though at times she can be annoying. One of the biggest problems is my mom being her chauffeur. My sister wants to go out sometimes, but my mother comes home tired with her arthritis flaring up, and my mom isn't up for it all the time. Recently, my sister has been joking aggressively with my mother and she doesn't like that. In my sisters eyes she says joking around with mom isn't fun if I can't say bad words or show off the middle finger. I tried to explain that she can't do stuff like that because its our mother and she doesn't like it. 

My mom has gotten her therapy but my sister quits all the time saying she doesn't want to do it. My mom has to argue with her all the time to convince her to go. They don't want to help my sister out because she quits all the time. Now, with her new therapist she can't see because of Covid-19. 

My sister also doesn't have any friends so she stays home all the time. When she does go out its with our aunt or her bf. I always tell my sister to be nice and make friends but she always responds with ""I don't need friends"" or ""why should I"". 

The only way my sister acts nice is when she wants something. Its taking a big toll on my mother because she just wants to rest and not be stressed with my sister and none of my family can stand being with my sister for long periods of time.

953,"Hey everyone, I have no idea what to do with the current situation.

I live with my mom and my dad, while my brother is currently busy trying to move out with his girlfriend + working, so he isn't home a lot. We have only one car that my father uses it a lot to go to work, so my mom and him have to plan when she can go out to shop for grosheries and other stuff (like hospital visits).

My mom is extremely sick, she has a very severe form of arthritis . As a result, she often has pains in her joints and laments often that her bones ache. She is incredibly stubborn and HAS to do everything herself because she is convinced that she is the only one that does it the ""right"" way , even if I'm always available and try my best to beat her to it when it comes to chores.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, the problem is that tomorrow she has to go groshery shopping and she has to get some results from the hospital, but my father will work all day and my brother is at work too. She wants to go via bus, which is still dangerous (she is at risk for COVID-19), and she doesn't want me to go. I am young, strong and don't have an illness that targets my bones, so of course I said that it would be stupid for her to go but she doens't want to listen to me.

She only spoke to me because she knows that if my brother knows that she wants to go do all this stuff he'll get BIIIIG mad and will probably try and take the situation is his own hands, which nor she or I want because he is very stressed with the move and work and he's alrady sleep deprived as it is. My father is not in the picture because he can't do much, he needs the car for work and that's it.

Everytime a situation like this happens, I usually have to race her, which sometimes means getting up at 5 to get out the door before she does, and all this is honestly ruining my life. It's like looking after a toddler, but this toddler knows what she is doing. The worst thing is that she is smart, she knows she will feel sick when she gets back home, but she wants to do it anyway. She HAD to talk to me to get information about the bus, and she knew I would have refused to tell her if she was honest about her intentions, so she got the information out of me in a very sly way and now that she has it she wants to do whatever. I told her (in the most authoritive way possible) that I would be the one to go, and she said that she would ask my auntie for her car, or talk to my dad tomorrow morning. I smell bullshit.

My choises seem to be: 

* let her go and PRAY that my brother doens't learn about it and she doesn't have a stroke on the way home
* wake up at 8 am, get dressed and ready, stay on the lookout for if she tries to sneak out thinking I'm asleep and sprint for the door
* tell my brother what's happening, endure my mom's rage for ""betraying her trust"" and witness my brother have ANOTHER problem

&amp;#x200B;

I'm SO tired of her bullshit, because of her behaviour I'm always on the lookout for when she goes out. She never wants help and then I have to listen to her in pain saying how much this bone or that bone hurt. I know that saying these things might seem like I'm an asshole, but most of the pain she has is brought by herself after DAYS of me fighting with her. I have to race her to every chore in the house, otherwise she will do it herself and then lament how tired and hurt she is.

He's never gone under clothing or touched my pussy or anything, but he has been groping my chest and ass over my clothing and has stroked my thighs when I had a skirt on. I have tried wearing less appealing clothing but all that does is get him to tell me to dress ""sexier"". I have asked him to stop, and he said he would, then a couple days later was up to the same stuff.

The thing is that I don't want to tear my boyfriend's family apart over this, so I'm rather torn as to what to do. Obviously this is wrong and illegal, but I don't want to go to the cops over it because my boyfriend has had a rough life and his dad is basically the only remaining link he has to his family. This isn't his fault and I don't want him to suffer the consequences. As such, I'd rather fix this in a way that's nonviolent and doesn't involve telling people. I'd also prefer to fix it in a way that doesn't involve threats, as I fear he'll do something worse. I'm a virgin and rather scared of him going too far, despite him not having done it before.

Anyways, I’m now heavily considering going to a local college where I pay only 10k/year out of pocket, but holy shit does the thought of going to that school depress me. It has no prestige, and the social scene is meh, plus the program isn’t that good but it’s okay ig. Wtf should I do?

972,"Hi All,

I have lost a lot of weight recently by virtue of exercising like mad. I've also stopped eating out, drinking, and cut back significantly on junk food. The issue I am having now is with how I eat. I have been working like mad, but have been plateaued for months. I have no problem with choosing decent groceries, opting to make a meal instead of takeout etc. My issue is that when bad food is in front of me I turn to a pig. Actually, any food. Once I start eating there is no stopping. Over the last few months I've tried to emphasize getting enough protein to feel full, but that hasn't stopped me. I can have all the best of intentions, but once I start eating I find it difficult to stop or to know when I've had enough. I can't keep any sort of indulgent snack food or treats in the house because I know I will eat them all quickly. It'd be nice to buy a package of cookies and only have two at a time. What I do keep around is sensible (pop-corn, low sugar greek yogurt, oatmeal, fruits, veggies, etc.) However, I find myself just blazing through that stuff. I start a new job that will be permanently remote so I really want to get this under control soon. Even though I've found a temporary solution with healthier foods, I'd still like to get it under control so that when I'm around junk food I can have a sensible amount. What are some ways I can stop when I've had enough, better know when I'm full, and keep myself from mindless snacking?

&amp;#x200B;

It's worth noting that I do not believe I have an eating disorder, I think really it has more to do with the boredom of working less and being at home all day. I also used to use tobacco so there is some element of oral fixation as well.",05Jun2020,1

My friend thinks that my girlfriend still wants her because she still watches our mutual friend's streams and she doesn't cut her communications in her socials, but the only reason for that is she is watching me, not my friend.

981,"TIA, a little background 

I studied business administration when I was in university, I wanted to run my own business, specifically a restaurant. (Today I know restaurants are very hard to make profitable and you definitely don't need a degree)

I ended up not graduating because I got sick. I went to work as a bartender instead. I'm now 31 and in the middle of covid my career has 0 stability. In the past 13 years I've been had every job in the restaurant industry, I've worked in sales, sales management, politics, customer service, data management and I always end up going back to the service industry.

Working in an office makes me extremely depressed, and in sales and politics constantly arguing with people about why what we have is a good thing, drained me and I constantly became disenfranchised with the quality product and political party I was pushing. 

Restaurants, hotels and other hospitality based businesses always made me feel like I was actually selling something people wanted, and I knew that I provided the best guest service people could get. 

Now with covid and being out of work I am feeling the harsh reality of the situation, and I've even been offered promotions at work but I turn them down because with the way tips work, I make more money than my bosses. 

So I guess what I'm asking is, has anybody been in this situation before, and is there a stable career field or field of study that might make me feel the same way I feel when working in food and beverage? (Guest service, problem solving, not boring and repetitive, proud of my job)

What‘s the problem? Well my attitude towards this situation changes so much depending on what mood I‘m in. It‘s always between: Ah whatever, just let her go, still try to be respectfull
and: Ah, I should probably ask her if she noticed our friendship go down the drain. I notice how it makes me feel unhealthy at times  it‘s like sometimes I thinn I should talk, sometimes I just leave it. But when I do interact with her in some way, then I notice how much we changed. And that feels really unconfortable.

Hope you get what I mean, I have some sort of syndrom where I value the way she interacts with me deeply, but I tell myself it‘s not that important. But then at times, I really do feel It‘s important.

Sometimes I also have another feeling: I really don‘t wanna talk to her about how I value the friendship, because I realize she shouldn‘t even deserve to be friends if she doesn‘t invest. But I also don‘t feel like being absent or ignoring her. (We spend a lot of time in a group)

989,"A lot of my boyfriends friends are quite sexist, making remarks and jokes about women etc that my bf never joins in on, but he doesn’t call them out on it either - something that I’ve spoken to him about in the past.

Tonight of them made a joke in reference to the graphic rape scene featuring the four guys in the bathroom and the mop in the Netflix show Thirteen Reasons Why, a scene that stopped me from watching the show and made my skin crawl for weeks. I am a victim of sexual assault and my boyfriend knows this, and when his friend made a joke (the friend thinks the scene was hilarious) referencing that scene my bf laughed and I was stunned. I called him out on it later in private and he got angry at me and told me he wasn’t responsible for his friends and what they said, and for me to drop it. 

I’m super hurt and don’t really know what to do. The comments on women the friends made irritated me in the past and I let it slide, but feel that I can’t let this slide? Especially seeing as my bf laughed, therefore acknowledging the joke - And what in the world do they say when I’m not present, and at that - does my boyfriend join in when I’m not there? 

Would be grateful for any advice on how to approach this or what to do - my boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years and we live together, he’s only like this with these friends it seems whereas with me his views on rape, equal rights, sexism etc are strong af which is why this is so confusing.",05Jun2020,1

I was talking to him the other day and he asks me why do I hold back when I talk to him. He asked me what I am afraid of that causes me not to just say what I want to say. He says that we are a team and will support me.

I know that I hold back as I am afraid of rejection and being judged as that my anxious thoughts make it so I end up not saying anything. My depressed thoughts causes me to believe that he will find that I am uninteresting, boring, weird, etc. As a result, I end up saying less of what I truly want to say and if I do say something it is mundane.

I have mentioned my anxiety/depression to him, but I don’t think he comprehends the extent of it. I am on medication and working with a therapist to treat it.

I want to be able to freely speak my mind and not have to hold back in front of him. A relationship is built on trust with one another, but I don’t know how I can allow myself to let all aspects of me shine. Especially when I’ve built up walls for several years.

991,"Hello.

Getting straight to the point, hi, I’m 15 and I’m terrified I’m wasting my youth.  

I don’t have any friends IRL but am working on not being so shy online, don’t do anything outside of school, come home every night and browse Reddit, same routine every day. I’m so jealous of people who go out with their friends and to parties and stuff, even if they’re not my thing at all. It’s my fault for always being the weird quiet girl and not trying to break past my anxiety but it’s too late now.

I’m halfway through being 15 and when I turn 16 at the end of the year I’ll have to get a part-time job. I feel like when I become 20 it’s going to be the cut-off line for me. No longer young, (well, no longer a teenager), and at this rate, no will to do anything. Stuck in a dead-end job slaving away and for what? To come home and do the same routine every night? I really enjoy anime but it seems like anyone in the fandom above 21~ is looked down upon. I’ve wasted my entire life sitting in front of my computer and there’s no one to blame for it but myself.

Is there anyway to improve my situation? Or at least to push me in the right direction? I’m sorry for being so whiny, I guess I’m just mad at myself for letting my secondary school years go to waste.",05Jun2020,1

Well, that doesn’t stop my mind from wandering. 
Every time I see him interact with certain women or even the thought of him meeting new women makes me wanna cry. It’s irrational, and I don’t really know what to do. I’ve tried to see a therapist about it and it still doesn’t take away the painful heartache I get. It feels like somebody kicked me in the chest. 

Yesterday he mentioned something about women w big breasts &amp; sternum tattoos and it made me cry. 
Not that he was talking about anybody in particular, but the idea of him checking out other girls breaks my heart. 

Again, I know it’s irrational and I don’t ever project my anger onto him but it hurts so much. It’s always bringing me to tears because I don’t want to feel this way anymore, I feel crazy. And I’ve felt this way in other relationships.

His side:

I am frustrated and am at a roadblock and don’t know what to believe anymore. A girl I was messing with in the past has tested positive for chlamydia and says that I gave it to her, saying that I was her only partner for the past 8 months so it has to be me. She said she got tested right before messing with me and was negative for everything. Hearing this news I was shocked and got tested for everything the next day and even took the antibiotics prescribed immediately after my test. My results came back negative for everything. The last time her and I had sex prior to me getting tested was nearly 3 weeks to a month, so if I had the STD it would for sure show up in my results given the duration of me being potentially exposed to the STD. Any advice, or comments?


Her side:


I started non exclusively talking to this guy last year in November and we started having feelings towards each other. Things started to get serious between us so we became exclusive at one point. He would be very sneaky and suspicious sometimes but i’m not a jealous type of person so i didn’t think too much of it. Since the beginning we never used protection because he told me i was the only one he was sleeping with. He was the only one i was sleeping with since the last time i got tested (november). I soon then found out he’s been talking to his ex girlfriend behind my back the entire time. And when she found out he was talking to me she convinced him to get tested and they came back negative to everything. (which i just found out about and they got tested in march) Which meant i was negative too from november till march since i haven’t been with anyone else. 

In May a week after i saw him one weekend i started noticing something wrong with my discharge, it was different. I was on birth control for years before this and everything was normal until the same time i was having strange discharge, i started breakthrough bleeding in the middle of my cycle. It was random excessive bleeding that i was not used to and never experienced. I thought there was something wrong with my birth control so i took a break from it. But it kept coming back when i would try to take birth control so i made an appointment with a GYNO. I received my papsmir results and they were clear but i tested positive for chlamydia. I called him and told him he gave me chlamydia and he denied it. He went to go get checked the day after he got tested and still took antibiotics thinking if i had it he definitely had it.

Keep in mind i wasn’t with anyone else from November 2019 until today. The last time i had sexual intercourse with him was May 18th and i started seeing symptoms after May 3rd. I received my tests back on May 28th. 

He quickly got checked and received it tests back today and they turned out to be negative. He showed me the portal of he negative results, the doctors name, with his name on it as well. Everything was legit. Maybe he knew he had it and got treated before i caught him? But he said if he knew he had it he would’ve told me right away because he knows if chlamydia is untreated it can lead to infertility, which he says he would never leave me to not know and would want me to get treated as soon as he knew if he gave it to me. I just need advice on this because this makes me look bad making me look disloyal when i was loyal to him throughout the entirety of our relationship.",05Jun2020,1

1008,So when we started dating we were both super kinky and often roleplayer and thought and talked about other people during sex. And now we mostly want really intimate cuddley sex and focusing only on us two. Can anyone explain why this happened?,05Jun2020,1
1010,"I am talking to my guy friend and we are in the early stages of a romantic relationship together. We are technically dating but not yet officially bf/gf since I asked to take it slow.

He has experienced everything in terms of romance; kissed, dated multiple girls, had sex, and has even fallen in love before. While I, on the other hand, have no experience. I have never kissed, dated, touched, or had sex with a guy in my life. I never even had a male friend.

So I just feel inadequate as I don’t know how to do anything and just feel socially behind despite being 20 years old and in uni. I have told him about my lack of experience and he said that it’s okay and will guide me through it. But despite that, I am afraid that I will do something that will just result in the relationship ending since I am so clueless about romance. I don’t know how to navigate being in a relationship and I am very anxious about it.

Can anyone offer advice or tips?",05Jun2020,1

1014,"I'm a teen, and I'm planning on my future life. My family has no dogs, mainly because my grandmother has asthma. I'm thinking I'll love to have a dog when I get my own house, but I'm not sure if I'm fit for having one.

First, I'm mildly autistic (aspergers), so loud noises can feel really bad to me. Considering that dogs make noise, and also the fact that my neighbor's two small dogs always annoy or even scare me when they yap a lot, am I really the type of person to have a dog?

Also, I'm not sure how I'll do with high maintenance stuff. I have a 75 gallon saltwater fish tank, and while it is enjoying to watch, the water changes and cleaning are quite the challenge (though It's not that stressful when I actually do it for some reason). The thing is that, as well as clean up, dogs need walks and training. Could I really handle that?

Dogs are also expensive. That I might be able to handle.

I should also mention the reasons why I'm wanting a dog in the future. I might want to live single in my own house. I used to actually be a DOG HATER when I was a kid since my neighbor's dogs were always assholes and affected my autism. Nowadays, however, I see that not all dogs are bad, probably because I started watching movies about dogs, as well as meeting a new friend at school who really loves dogs. Even though they scare me when they bark (again, aspergers), I think dogs are cool and can be cute. I'll also like some emotional support and someone to keep me company when I'm out. I also like certain breeds because they look cool. I love the look of dogs that have wolf-like appearances, especially huskies and german shepherds.

Again, I'm an aspie who's sensitive to the sounds of barking, but I still want to own a dog for some reason. Any advice?",05Jun2020,1

1018,"I’ve lived in my home country for my whole life until in 2019 my father moved us to another country to live with his girlfriend. It was horrible because my dad got yet into another bad relationship. But then in 2020 we moved back to my home country and I got to visit my home state with all my old friends. It was a bittersweet goodbye to my friends though because I was moving to a different state than my home state. But at least I got to see them once after a whole year of being gone.

When we got to the different state me and my father decided this wasn’t it, so we left to go back to my home state and stay with one of my dads friends till we had enough money to buy our own place. I’m even working to help, too. 

Now, my friends have no idea I’m back home. Except for one. He’s like my best friend and at first I was planning on saying nothing to anyone about being back home, but then he asked me how the different state was and I felt weird about lying. So I told them almost everything the exact day I got back to my home state. Which was probably too soon. 

I’m regretting it a little now, because he might want to hang out again (by ‘again’ I mean he was one of the friends I visited when I got back to my home state), which I really want to as well, but I don’t think my dad would let me because we are supposed to be focused on getting a house. This is why I thought it was no good telling anybody I was back, plus, I’m a little embarrassed at how much I’m moving around because this is not the first time. 

I just hate lying, but now I’m worried I might’ve weirded him out or confused him because not a lot of people have ever understood some of the strange situations I’ve been in. 

I would just like to know if I am just overthinking (which is a problem of mine), or if this is actually not that big of a thing and I should just deal with it. 

TL;DR: Lived in a different country for a year but then moved back to my home country and saw my old friends in my home state. Then I had to move to a different state than my home state, but then I moved back to my home state and told one of my friends everything and now I’m worried I might’ve weirded him out or if I’m just over thinking.",05Jun2020,1

1020,"I really love my friend but I'm worried for several reasons.

1. She's still in school and doesn't have an apprenticeship yet and won't earn money anytime soon.

2. She already had a snake and it died after a few months.

3. Her parents gave away the dog thay had two years ago or so but about half a year ago she got herself two small dogs which she takes care of quite well I think but her parents never really approved of that idea.

So, now there's the problem. She apparently wants to get bunnies, mice and rats ALL (about) at the same time (this or next week) and I'm honestly concerned.

 1. Because her parents won't approve of it. 

2. Because she doesn't earn money, thus can't go to the vet on her own. 

3. Will get them from a breeder (and not the reliable ones). Even though there are a lot of friendly bunnies, rats and mice at shelters near where we live but from the breeders she'll probably get the animals for free (or a really small amount of money). At shelters people always have to pay adoption fees. 

4. For the bunnies she does not have a proper cage/house and they probably aren't allowed to step on the lawn and eat the grass or whatever. 

5. She plans to use her 2 snake terrariums for the mice and the rats which I think is a really really bad idea since they need proper ventilation which they won't get in a terrarium + the smaller snake terrarium she planned to put the mice in is really small (50cm on 50cm or so).



I'm really worried about the animals, especially since it seems like such a rushed decision and she doesn't have the proper equipment. And to be honest, if she can't pay the adoption fees of a shelter, I don't think she should get herself these animals. 

I love my friend but I think it's a bad idea, what do you think?",05Jun2020,1
1021,"Evening reddit, I trust you are all having a pleasant Friday evening.

I’m not sure if this is a right move on my part to post this here, but I don’t really have anyone to talk to about this.

I feel intimidated by women in my age group (I’m 20M) but I need to give some context as to why. You see, I spent the last 7 years in the four corners of my bedroom - I go out once a year (work Christmas party), I get occasional texts from my mum asking how I’m doing, I don’t speak with anybody outside of work. 

At the age of 14 I had my first sexual encounter which left me shattered, I met a girl online who wanted to meet up on the first day we talked and we eventually did couple of days later. She was so “sexually driven” that I was literally shaking after I got back home from a night out with her, I didn’t know what to think and I didn’t speak with anyone about it.

I haven’t attempted to flirt with any other girl since then, and as I mentioned I don’t have many social encounters, so now when I meet adult women in my age group I feel extremely intimidated by them because they’re “sexually mature” and I’m not.

As a man I haven’t been blessed physiologically either, which also is a big reason why I’m not engaging into any relationships with women, I just cannot be as good as other men out there.

I don’t bear any hate for women or men, I’m just not good enough for “the game”, the only hate I’ve got is for myself.",05Jun2020,1

1027,"Hello Reddit,

Someone who used to be my best friend/bridesmaid just sent me a sweet card congratulating me on a recent milestone. She even put a bunch of confetti in it (for all you confetti-haters, I don't think it was an intentionally evil move on her part). She also put in a large check, which at first I thought was a gift, but then realized it was her paying off an old debt she owed me. The last time we spoke in person, she left me crying in a restaurant in NYC. I expressed how much I loved her and wanted to be close, and wanted to know what I could do to make that happen. (I am the type of person to assume it is always my fault and take responsibility for someone's distance, and will work on myself for others). But she said she didn't and left while I was still sobbing. She's reached out a bit here and there since then. Congratulating me on a work win, wishing me happy birthday. I've mostly decided I don't wanna fuck with her anymore because it hurts too much. It's hard because we used to be really close, but for various reasons I don't understand, our friends don't understand, she just doesn't really want my friendship. I reached out to her because she was in NYC in the height of the pandemic. But otherwise, I've left the initiating up to her, since she was a bad friend for too many years &amp; I was the only one to ever call, txt, etc. She's going through something personal right now, which I am well aware of, but didn't reach out because she specifically told me not to last time. So the right course of action seems to be: say ""Thank you for the card, it is very appreciated. How are you doing?"" I guess I just feel really confused by her colorful card filled with confetti congratulating me, when she has been a source of pain and hurt. I'm probably reading way too much into this.

One thing you should know is we forged our friendship in shared trauma, so I may have more emotions surrounding her than normal. We both experienced a horrific tragedy in college, and everything was really deep, real fast. I'm assuming that my brain chemistry is wired to crave deep emotional connection with her, rather than being fine with just growing apart. But I'm not psychologist.

I'm also debating whether to share with you the whole disagreement we had that made us like this. It's been rehashed with so many people, not sure it's worth it. Basically (a) there was a misunderstanding years ago, (b) she's never really forgiven me, (c) in us talking about this with many mutual friends, no one thinks I did anything really wrong for her to be that upset over (d) even still, I've apologized and actively tried to fix things so many times, and taken responsibility for what I did do wrong (e) I eventually said ""fuck it"" in 2020 and I'm no longer trying with her. SO. That's where we at.

In the end, not sure how to respond. Is she reaching out? Or just being cordial? And is my potential response too cold?

Sincerely,

Gaslighted by a damn card

1034,"Hello I run my own small business. I manage a team of people and some of them are graphic designers. There isn't much room for creative liberty in some aspects of what we do as the images we make sometimes have to be uniform and match up completely with past images. Think maps, brochures, things of that nature. We pay well. I have a great relationship with my immediate team mostly because of their willingness to communicate. In my experience a 5 minute phone call can replace a 3 week email chain. Sometimes my full time artists are over whelmed with work and we bring on other people to freelance and help out. When I hire them I do ask that if we need to talk on the phone that I can get a hold of them. I've had quite a few people quit the job telling me that I'm demanding too much from them when the work comes back objectively wrong. Objectively wrong meaning the images are not matching up and have various problems. Typically what will happen with these artists is the work will come back with 5-20 issues. I give them a call and they don't answer their phone. No problem. They tell me that they would prefer to speak on email which I'm okay with as long as things go smoothly and efficiently. I then list the changes I need in a polite way with bullet points and the art work will come back with maybe 1-2 things fixed and lots of things still wrong. This then turns into a 30 message email chain over weeks and they eventually leave the project without finishing what was arranged. This has happened 4 times now. This doesn't happen 100% of the time with freelancers but does happen with 100% of freelancers who are not willing to speak on the phone. I'm assuming that my issue is that I'm stupid for hiring anyone thats not willing to take the time to speak on the phone in the first place and should require phone interviews? These 4 people who seem to be competent all claim to have done every project in their life without issue except work here. They have ALL also said they've worked at bigger companies that asked for less out of them as graphic designers, and I dont know if thats a fair argument? Genuinely asking. I don't want to be a bad leader. However we cant send things back that are wrong or we all wont have jobs. The other artists seem to laugh it off and empathize with me on not being able to budge on certain things but i'm worried they just don't want to hurt my feelings as we have a good relationship.

1035,"Hi all! So I (21F) have had to move back in with my parents due to COVID-19. I was living in an apartment in the city near my school with roommates but since my school was shut down and I’m unemployed until further notice, I couldn’t afford to keep paying rent every month. I’m happy and grateful that I’m able to live in a comfortable home during these strange times. However, since I first moved out my freshman year (came to live back home the following summer) I’ve noticed a pattern of feeling somewhat unhappier/more tense living with my parents. I love them to death and we’ve always had a stable relationship, but I also value my personal independence and freedom greatly. Sometimes I feel like I’m not the same person when I’m living at home versus on my own/with friends. I’m planning on moving out again with some friends in September when school (hopefully) starts back up; I just need to make it through the summer. Normally I would spend a lot of time out of the house and out at bars/restaurants/etc with my friends or traveling, however everything is closed and our state is currently one of the hardest hit states of COVID-19, so a lot of my friends still aren’t willing to hang out, which I completely understand. But as much as I love my parents I do get lonely a lot of the time, and it might just be the fact that I haven’t seen/hung out with  people my age in months. Long story short I’m just trying to find ways to feel happier/less lonely while living with my parents for the summer. Any advice would be greatly appreciated 🙂",05Jun2020,1

(Yes this is a throwaway account)
The first week or so I didn’t give him any space (I now see that I was doing what I would’ve liked, but obv different people deal with their mom passing away differently). I thought that if I was always there for him right there it would help. I realised soon enough I was wrong and I started giving him space. And I didn’t keep asking him how he felt or if he wants to talk or anything, because he said he’ll talk or tel me if he feels like it, and that he’s fine. 
Now I haven’t lost my mom so I can’t even imagine how it must feel. My bf is also very responsible and takes care of his family a bunch, siblings, parents, all that. 
It’s been a few weeks now, he seems fine, I asked him recently if he’s okay and that I just want him to know I’m here if anything, but I don’t want to be too much or anything, he said the fact that I’m thinking about him is enough and he’s fine. And again, if he needs to he will. 
After that, I recently found that he posted something on here, a deleted post but comments are there, and from that I can infer that the post was about the loss and he feels guilty for wanting to just not deal with anyone or anything or take care of anyone. I don’t know what the post said and if there was more, but this is from the comments. I think it was an in-the-moment thing because he’s been fine since irl and on reddit posts (that post was made a couple weeks ago). And that’s fine, I myself have made reddit posts when I’m struggling with something. I guess I just feel a bit lost in terms of how to help him. Obviously he’s hurting in some way and I get that and he doesn’t want to talk to anyone (I know he hasn’t talked to anyone else either in real life, just that one post on Reddit). I know the fact that he won’t open up to me is just his personality and not because he doesn’t love me or doesn’t tell me things. And that’s fine. But at the same time I just want to help, without making him feel like I’m suffocating him or forcing him to let me do something. I don’t know, y’all. I just want to make him feel better, if he isn’t on the inside. So outside of the space thing and not asking him about it, what can I do? I wish he didn’t have to go through this now. Especially because he couldn’t even say a proper goodbye what with living in a different state from his mom and no travel allowed at the time she passed away. I want it to not have happened, I want to hug him so tight and make everything better. I also don’t want to be selfish and do something just so *i* feel good about “helping” even if it doesn’t help. Which is what happened the first few days where he let me be with him every second to make me feel better even tho he just wanted to be alone.

I expressed to them that I don't like the job and that I'd consider quitting if things don't improve. They became hysterical (the usual reaction when I tell them things they don't like) and told me they won't give me any money ever again if I quit. Cue panic attack. Beyond paying for nonessentials, I use that money to pay for therapy (I have autism and anxiety). If they stopped giving me money, I'd have to dip into my savings and I really don't want to do that. If my parents knew I did that, they'd kick me out of the house (which they threaten to do when I piss them off).

1041,"I think the reason my mom treats me so bad and has always treated me so bad is because (a few years ago) I remember her saying that when I was little I did things that reminded her of a sister she had that she really despised and still does. She was horrible. But I do not remember ever doing anything that she said I did. And to add onto it I was young and instead of being spoken to about my actions so that I would know what I had done was not right, I would get yelled at without an explanation. 

My parents think I am the rebel simply because to them I “talk back”. But when I do I am speaking up for myself. I try to talk to them to be heard and for them to hear what bothered me and what still does. I would be talked over and told to be quiet. So of course you speak louder and louder when you want to be heard and aren’t being listened to. 

I have never truly rebelled in terms of sneaking out, parting, doing drugs, drinking alcohol, or having sexual relations with anybody. Anything that would seem as “rebel” behavior I guess. I have always done good in school and gotten good grades, joined community service clubs, barely ever went out, taken care of myself and my siblings, and overall just not act out or fought or did anything you would think a “rebellious” child would do. 

I refuse to believe that to be a “good” non rebellious child I must sit quiet and “look pretty” while keeping my thoughts and emotions to myself. I refuse to let my mother and fathers past trauma dictate how I am treated. 

I give up on trying to be heard.",05Jun2020,1
1042,"Hey everyone.

I (21m) have recently been involved with a girl (20f) for the past month or two. However,  there is a definite expiration date, considering we are both only in the same town for the summer between college semesters, and neither of us are interested in committing to a long distance relationship.  She’s great, and I think I genuinely love the girl, but I’m afraid of falling too hard. Currently we are treating our current relationship as an exclusive one, and we are essentially dating, though we convince ourselves we don’t want to put a label on it.

That being said, an old friend that I have previously fantasized about getting together with reached out to me yesterday, explicitly stating she wants to have non-committal or unemotional sex.

If I were not involved in such my current relationship at the moment, this would be an easy choice for me, I have literally dreamed about engaging intimately with this girl on multiple occasions. 

But obviously, I’m morally conflicted. If I do not take my chance with this girl I may never get one again. (Not looking for any relationship with her, but purely something physical) I will regret not seizing the day when I had the chance, but on the other hand I will essentially be cheating on the girl I’m currently with.

I’m young, and I put myself in a pickle by agreeing to keep my current relationship as exclusive, but I was wondering if there was any advice any one would offer on how I might be able to continue my summer romance with this girl but also enjoy physical intimacy with this old friend.

At this point I perceive this situation as choosing between feeling guilt or regret. I’m torn.  Again, I am not unaware that what I would be doing is essentially cheating, but given the temporary nature of my current relationship I somehow find some justification in this.

I’m tired of not being selfish. I’ve played by the rules my whole life and every fiber of my being wants to choose to feel guilt rather than regret, because guilt is temporary and healable, but asking yourself “What if I had...” for the rest of my young life seems way less appealing.

Thanks.",05Jun2020,1

1048,"After applying on a whim thinking it couldn’t hurt, I have miraculously been shortlisted for interview for my dream job! At first, I thought it must be a mistake so I contacted them to confirm that it was OK that I don’t have the relevant qualification yet (I’m working towards it) and they said that it’s fine and that my experience counts enough to show that I would be employable in the position as long as I am intending to achieve the qualification.

Now, I KNOW that I would do an amazing job and that I would be a great fit for the role, but I also know that I’m at a disadvantage because there will be candidates interviewing who already have the relevant qualifications. 

How should I present myself to show that I am confident in my ability despite not having the most qualifications for the role? What kind of questions may I receive, and how should I field them? Any advice appreciated!",05Jun2020,1

1050," I'm from a very poor region in South America and I've studied a lot to complete my bachelors degree with a scholarship. After that I couldn't get a job in the field because there aren't many jobs available here so I've worked other random jobs for 2 years to get money for a masters degree. However, even though I used to spend over 12 hours a day working I still don't have enough money, not even for a start. There aren't any scholarships for me at the moment because the current government is quite corrupt and stopped all programs that used to offer scholarships for post graduate students. I've tried getting a scholarship to study abroad but it did not work out, I've also applied to some universities and got accepted but I'd have to pay for tuition fees and accomodation and since my currency is really bad my money is not even close to being enough. Now I see myself getting old and losing hope to find a job in the field that I've studied. Additionally, this whole virus situation has made it more difficult to get a better job anyway. I know some people have worse problems than me and I should be strong but sometimes I feel really bad and it feels like I'm losing all hope, especially because I'm getting old without a proper job. What really hurts is that I've studied a lot and given my best during my bachelors and I was one of the best students in my class.

1053,"Hi ya’ll I’m an aspiring zookeeper (I understand there may be mixed feeling about zoos and aquariums but let’s try not to start that here). I’m in a bit of a cross roads and since I always seem to shoot my self in the foot I thought I’d ask reddit.

I am currently employed at a fairly large zoo in the country and I was laid off in March due to Covid-19. I’m new to the area and thought I would start at the “ground floor” and work up, as you usually have to do. I took a position as a seasonal in the education department as I thought this would be the best first step.  About a month after I accepted the position, the zoo posted a Full Time Animal Encounters position (working with animals, my goal). I applied, got rejected, and they told me to apply for their seasonal position (same job duties, but seasonal). I didn’t because at the time I had just started in the education department and felt it would be wrong to job from seasonal position to seasonal position. I felt like a jump from seasonal to full time would be understandable by my supervisors. As I went through some of the training I started feeling depressed that I had taken the first opportunity given to me and I would be doing something I don’t love as much and that if I had waited I could have applied to the seasonal animal encounters team.

Either way Covid hit and I was laid off. Fast forward to now. The zoo is allowed to open next week. I got an email from the education department Vice President saying they are basically forming a skeleton crew since the budget is slashed. She said it would be mostly directing people and ensuring social distances, we would be required to wear masks outside (it’s 90° oof) and that theres no guarantee on how many hours we are given, and implied that time off may be hard to come by for a while. She followed up the email by asking if we are willing to work, if we can start next week, and how many hours are you willing to work. 

During my lay off the zoo posted the seasonal animal encounters position again and I applied because emails I received during my lay off made it seem like I wouldn’t have a job when the zoo opened. Now I’m face with the decision of do I go back and instead of education- “manage crowds and social distancing.” Or do I inform them that I’d like to hold off because of this other job. I have my hopes on the animal encounters team, I feel like if they invited me to apply before they would hire me now. And now that the zoo is open and the position is still open they will start the hiring process. 

I don’t want to burn bridges, but I wanna work at the zoo. I feel like if I join the education team now, it would be an ass hole move, or worse not even be allowed to switch teams if the animal encounters team wants me.

TLDR; join the education skeleton team bearding crowds or wait for a different opportunity?",05Jun2020,1

I’ve had horses of my own my whole life and I currently have an Arabian mare who’s 20 who I trained myself after finding her in a ditch 10 years ago.  I work at a very VERY nice barn. Big stalls, wash bays, heated barn...the works..it’s very expensive to board a horse here but the pay isn’t great. There are only 6 workers total including the manager who is also (20F) one month older than me. She doesn’t know what she’s doing and she can’t handle any form of a confrontation. She sends out bitchy passive aggressive texts in a group of one person fucks up. She’s very demanding but she’s lazy herself. Never okay for any of us to miss something small or anything but it’s totally fine if she does. When I work with her she gives me all the hard stuff to do and she just does what she wants.

1065,"So I’m smack-dab in the middle between 3 of the people in my friend group and one other one. It started since one of my friends let another into our central group chat, this chat has been around for years and has a max amount of 10, (but that things history is another story) 
So she invited somebody that none of us really knew outside of her being a good person to vent to, we’ll call them “person A”. So she joined, and while this happened one of our other friends (We’ll call them “person B”)was constantly self-pitying and pushing away advice. After maybe a month or half a month of this, “person A” cut off “person B” and they left the group chat. 

At this point me and another person (“Person c”) were the only people in contact with “person b” and after a while of just us three, person b stopped talking to “person c”. Not really on purpose just kind of happenstance. 

So it went on like this for a good few weeks of me bring the only person in the group chat or almost friend group who stayed in contact with “person b”.  Now one day me and “person b” were talking and we realized there was some seriously shady stuff that “person a” was doing, (I should probably mention “person b” was also doing a lot of shady stuff and claimed they were trying to cut it out although there was no way of proving it or not) so we talked about “person a” and these are the claims and things that happened that could point towards them being shady.
1. Cheated multiple times (I have strong feelings on this since I’ve only dated a few times, and got cheated on every time so normally I’d despise anybody who cheated) and I only found out about this from us talking
2. Ever since she started dating somebody else in the friend group (“person d”)they’d talked way less, almost never joined voice chats, and just slowly deteriorated to the point of contemplating self harm. (He’s getting professional help) and all of this started when he and her started dating. So was this just because relationships in general are stressful or was it her?
3. She “jokingly” hit on person c, while her and person b were dating, and once the two agreed to just be friends, after about a week person A and person c started dating. 

There were more claims but I’ll leave it at these these for now. So after this I went to Person A and layed out everything I’ve heard and told her to disprove it. And naturally as somebody who doesn’t really like being mean and who’s a pushover I brung it up in the nicest way possible and looking back I kinda wish I didn’t  but whatever it’s in the past. So their responses were (if they’re in quotes they’re directly taken from them.

1.  “When I have said everyone who cheats is a bad person, I mean it. Including myself. I have cheated. Multiple times. But it was an act of manipulation. I’m not putting all the blame on my manipulator but yes, I did cheat. But I always felt awful and I still don’t forgive myself for it. In fact. I think I’m a (five letter word that starts with W) for doing so.

2. “I honestly don’t know why (person d) is talking less, I really encourage him to talk to you guys more but he refuses.” (This was all she said)

3. “yes, I’ve always hit on (person c) but it started out as light/hearted” 

At this point, I was just like “okay” and told this stuff to “person b” since they’re the one who’s mad at them, at this point I was just curious and a little mad about the cheating. She also responded to the other stuff but again, I’ll leave it at these three for now. So I told all of this to person b and he wasn’t satisfied. So after all of this, I was like screw it why don’t you guys just talk it out? I’ll make a gc with us three and we can talk about it. 

It did not go well. I was hoping they’d just talk about it but it ended up as them hating each-other more, one of them leaving and both of them having a sour taste in their mouth. At this point, I don’t talk to any of them nearly as much as I used to.

Clarifiers:
1. At first person a was the only one who hated person b, now person a, c, and d hate person b
2. I was a little tired making this so 
Person 1=Person A
Person 2= Person B
Person 3=Person C
Person 4=Person D
Sorry if I made this mistake at all
3. Please ask any clarifying questions and I’ll get to them ASAP since I’m sure “person a” and “person b” isn’t a good way to explain this whole thing.
4. I tried to only use they, thems
and theirs but I might’ve included gender pronouns do if I did you can just ignore them because chances are I probably mixed them up since I basically just woke up
5. When I started this I commited to putting quotes around Person b or person a but then I dropped it so just ignore the quotes around those names.
6. I’ll probably go back and edit this to make sure there aren’t any mistakes
7. This is my first post here, so I apologize for any simple mistakes or any subreddit-norms I missed


Tl;dr: One of my friends is having a civil war with three other ones, and both sides have done weird and shady stuff, what should I fo?
So now all of that brings me to the final questions

1. Do I cut out any of them? (Person B keeps telling me to cut the other three out)
2. Is there anyway I can get everybody back together, if so what’s the best way to go about it?
3. Is either side in the right, if so which one?",05Jun2020,1

To make a long story short, she randomly texted me she missed me and we started talking as friends, a year after the break up. Then, she randomly started talking about wanting to have kids with me and getting married to me. I tried ignoring it, but she kept bringing it up.

1070,"Hey guys so I’m very new to Reddit (I know I’m behind) but I thought enough is enough! I need some new perspectives and advice! 

So there is this guy I’ve kind of been in love with since I was 15. Hes 25 and I’m 24 now. We grew up together because we were neighbors in the same complex for about 15 years. Now we’ve moved but our families are still wonderful friends and so are we. Our moms are best friends (can’t go a day without phoning each other.) Our dads are best friends. And our siblings are best friends. I’ve liked this guy before his relationship, during, and after it. I never thought he saw me as anything more than just a best friend or even a sister. Until one day...

It had been a couple months off his breakup and we attended a sport event together. This wasn’t unusual for us cause we always attend games together. But there was something strange about this night in particular. He walked me through the rules and plays of the whole game. We drank beers. Shared some nachos. I realized he was becoming more and more touchier and flirtier. He attempted to warm me up with hugs and began playing with my anklets. When the bartender mentioned us being on a date he didn’t deny it. I was taken back by his behavior but I did somewhat see it coming. We’ve always had a deeper connection and a more intense “friendship”. Everyone would tell me “you guys look like you guys are more together than him and his gf”. That same night one of my siblings was having a little party at home that we ended up going back to. I invited one of my guy friends to join us after the game and he did. During the night, at our house, my guy friend (who I made VERY clear to many times before that night that I’m interested in someone else) drank a little too much. He began tugging on my hand pulling me away from the neighbor boy. He began getting upset cause “i wasnt giving him enough attention.” Anyways after a couple of hours, my guy friend got really upset and walked out. Me being a few drinks in, I began to cry. Of course he comes into the rescue and begins to comfort me. After a moment of reassurance that none of the things that happened is my fault and that he loves me as much as one of his siblings, I wanted to be left alone. HE LOVED ME LIKE A SIBLING! HE MIGHT AS WELL HAVE STABBED MY POOR LITTLE TIPSY HEART! Anyways...after a bit of crying in the bathroom I got myself together walked out into my living room to see him sitting on my couch. I sat next to him as he had a conversation with someone else at the party. He slowly reached for my hand and held it while I sat quietly next to him. I leaned a pillow over his legs and laid there. The person he was talking to was soon after asleep and we began having a conversation together. Then one thing led to another and our legs were intertwined and we were cuddling on the couch. Soon after he began rubbing his hand up and down my thighs and at this point we haven’t let each others hands go. We stayed up all night laying around on one another’s chests and rotating from one side of the couch to the other. Anyways the next morning came and we were up as if we didnt spend the whole night listening to one another’s heartbeats and rubbing each others thighs. (This was huge for both of us😂). This night was never spoken of. 

We hung out a few times after that and nothing as intimate has ever happened. Just little flirty remarks here and there and that was it. Until a couple months after the situation, I got a boyfriend. After I had made things official with some other guy, he began to freak out. He would ask me questions comparing him and my bf. He would mention how he can do things better than my bf. He would tell my friends he doesn’t think we were right for each other. And most importantly he would be very passive with my bf. He became very protective of me. After a few months I found out my boyfriend was cheating on me so I broke up with him. Once my break up happened, he went back to acting like he wasn’t the one freaking out over the fact that I was in a relationship. After my break up we hung out many more times. He was more careful with what he says and does. He is more self conscious of his behaviors now. For example he might put his hand over mine then pull away. He might put his hand on the small of my back and pull away. Its been over 2 years now that I’ve been broken up from my ex and he still doesn’t want to hear of him or about him. 

One day my sibling asked him a question about where the ideal place would be to meet a girl he would potentially marry and he said “oh Idk, a friends friend, or a party, a neighbor girl.” He makes slight comments here and there about how he either thinks im attractive or fun to be around or flirts with me. But I can’t tell what he wants for sure. He is definitely more cautious of his behaviors and what he says. He seems so hot and cold.

1071,"So in my house, we have one of those phones that needs a cable and we never use it, but every day since last week there's a random number that calls at the same hour ( 6:08 pm) and when you answer it only starts playing classical music for 30 seconds and then the call end. Idk what to do, I know I can just ignore the call but the phone makes to much noise and if I don't answer they will call again and again.

1073,"Basically many years ago I was diagnosed with a disorder that I absolutely do not have because a very racist psychologist with more power than she could handle threw inappropriate diagnosis at young impoverished kids for the hell of it, and later on I was abused by people with the same diagnosis as a result of her actions. My gp is finally willing to revoke this diagnosis that has really messed me up, but my race and culture are leading very white psychiatrists with no understanding of my people to decide I have bpd, which I absolutely do not have. I definitely have a couple of problems I was already diagnosed with, I just need a psychiatrist to write a report that just says donutfroginc has anxiety and depression. Does anyone have any advice?

1080,"I apologize for the long post

So here's a little back story. my Gf's sister who is in her late 20's has 2 kids; 6 and 2 1/2 years old. they're amazing children and we love them dearly. she has a very bad habit of just dropping the boys of at their grandpas house, who lives an hour out of town in the country, all weekend. they never have an official drop off or pick up time. often time their grandma will insist they pick them up at 5pm. and they'll show up at 8 or 9 with no text or call. theyll often time make their grandparents pick them up and drop them off. often times My girlfriend and I get stuck driving them home. which we don't particularly mind, but it is very inconsiderate. And my old truck could accommodate their car seats so it because a big problem. Ive since bought a larger truck. its gotten to the point where she'll tell their grandparents that I'm bringing them home without even asking me. It's not like they (SIL   
 and her BF) are busy. they just want to have freedom to do what they want and often go across the country on vacations. 

due to my job and location I'm laid off of work for 2-4 months per year (still paid) Often times SIL will ask me to babysit last minute which is normally fine because I'm a nice guy and I love those boys. and since I dont work at all I had nothing better to do  I would tell her they need picked up no later than 9pm. they say that's fine and then proceed to show up at 1am.. without so much as an apology. which irks me because I'm watching them and feeding them and I'm not getting paid. after numerous times of them doing this my GF told her she needs to start planning better or we wouldn't be able to watch them.

Fast forward to now I'm back at work working 55-65hr work weeks. On Wednesday SIL asks my GF if we could POSSIBLY watch the boys on Friday night. My GF told her that she needs a definitive pick up and drop off time. She didn't respond until 10:30pm Thursday night and said thy would drop them off the next day at 5:30pm and pick them up at 9:30pm. At this point I'm just now finding out about the conversation. my GF works Friday nights so the boys would be my responsibility. I politely said no because work has been incredibly hot and busy. and I just wanted to enjoy my Friday night. My GF said that was totally fine because she was going to tell her no anyway since she made a last minute request again and proceeded to text her sister politely declining because it was last minute and I'd be exhausted after work (it's important to note that my job doesn't have a set clock out time so there was no guarantee that I'd be off by 5:30. anyway)  My girlfriends text was polite and there was no way it could've been taken as hostile.

fast forward to this morning. My GF wakes me up at 5am and tells me that her sister responded. to paraphrase she basically said that they always respect our time and that they wont ask us to watch the boys anymore because she cant trust us, and that she'll just have to figure it out without us and that were both too prideful to fix this situation that she cant depend on us and Its not her fault their life is unpredictable and that there are times that she needs people who love her to be there at the drop of a hat. and that shes keeping the boys from us because she's tired of our manipulative bullshit we put her through. I need to note that they asked us to watch the boy so they could go to the shooting range. every emergency they've had I've been there to watch them. every chance they get they pawn those boys off onto someone else. on their oldest sons 6th birthday I spent the whole day with him while they went on a romantic getaway. they picked him up at 9pm on his birthday. All day he kept asking when he'd see mommy and daddy. last week they saw their kids for a total of a day and a half. confirmed by their grandmother who was forced to watch them by her husband. their grandfather enables and spoils her and he wont change. its leading her parents to possibly getting divorced. I told my girlfriend not to respond because we aren't going to entertain her childish behavior. so Reddit, any advice on how to handle this one? I want to note that my GF and I both work 55-65 hour work weeks. she has 2 jobs I have one. so It's not that we just don't want to watch them. we just have to be able to plan them into our schedules. Should we just ignore it? or finally call out the elephant in the room and start our own family feud?",05Jun2020,1

1082,"Throwaway account for obvious reasons! This is in the UK. TIA for any advice!!

I (white female) recently took over a management position in a company a couple of months ago. Soon after, I noticed one worker (Eastern European male) who was aggressive to myself and coworkers, he was unreliable and argumentative.

After discussion with other management, it was decided he would be fired- he was already on a disciplinary for almost fighting a coworker. 

I arranged the meeting, and brought in a translator due to him having limited English. I explained what was happening, and he left pretty quietly. Obviously annoyed but ultimately no issues. 

2 weeks later, I’ve been informed that a complaint has been made against me to the company director, stating the reason he was fired was racism. He claims I “withheld documents from him”- which is untrue, I read these documents, the translator translated them to his native tongue, then he was given these to read. He also claims I “refused a translator” for him- again untrue, I had a translator present the entire time. The end of his complaint blatantly claims he was fired due to him being a different nationality to myself.

I would like to state we have around 10 out of 25-30 workers who are of the same nationality as him, none of which I have ever had any issues with and get on quite well with. Some of my coworkers are also of the same nationality and they’re some of my closest friends.

There is now a huge investigation that will be happening against me for these claims, and I could lose my job over this. Not only that but my reputation within work is completely demolished, he has told other workers so now the entire workforce are aware. 

I tried to discuss this with a really good friend (also my boss) but ever since this allegation came against me he’s treating me as if I did it. I feel as though I should leave my job, even when his claims are found to be untrue, my reputation is still ruined. I treat all my employees equally but it really is my word against his.

I really have no idea what to do, I know it’s a very difficult subject, but is there anyone who could maybe throw some advice my way on how to navigate through this? It’s completely devastated me that someone would accuse me of that, because it goes against everything I believe in and stand for.",05Jun2020,1

1087,"I have hazy memory in the first place. If you ask me ""what day did this happen on"", I'll tell you 4-7 days ago, maybe 2 weeks ago. At my last work place, I had a co-worker explain a conflict with a co-worker like 5 times in 2 days, then I echoed it back to her later, but then I realized what I said was way off base and was all ""no, wait, that's not that you said"" then got it right.

This habit also bleeds into remembering facts about my friends. I'm horrible with birthdays. I know my parents', brothers', 1 cousin's, and my husband's birthday off the top of my head. That's it. I do also remember the general time of December my best friend's birthday is, but that's only because it's close to Christmas. But they all remember my birthday, or at least the month that it's in (but maybe it's because it's also a winter birthday?). Also, I barely know things like their favorite TV shows, favorite hobbies, etc. Maybe it's because we don't talk about them much, even though we're always talking online daily. Basically, I'm the spacey one of my friend group.

I don't know if this is related to a mental illness/disorder or not. Many people, including a friend studying psych in college and a family member with a bachelor's in psych, think I have ADHD. Some people also suspect that I have mild autism. But I never got a psych screening despite a physician's recommendation (she thinks I have depression), and I can't plan one now due to the pandemic. I might cross-post this in a group catered to neurodivergency, but I don't want to be one of those self-diagnosing people, and I am in no way implying that I know that I have any of these without a proper screening. I'm only saying that it is a suspicion that has yet to be confirmed/refuted by a psychiatrist.

So yeah, if someone can give me memory tips on things about people I care about, that would be helpful. The aforementioned paragraph about possible neuro issues is in case anyone has tips more catered to those issues that might also be helpful for me, regardless of what I do or don't have.",05Jun2020,1

1090,"Rant ahead.

I was talking to an artist I admire via Instagram messages, and I said something that implied I understood the struggles of POC. That wasn't my intention at all. It made them really angry. At the time it felt like they where attempting to attack me and invalidate my personal experience. What I had said was that as someone bullied for having pale skin, it has inspired me to give my full passionate support to BLM. While this isnt my only inspiration for supporting it, for example I don't think people should be killed for their skin color and culture, I can see how it may have come off as me trying to link their struggle to myself in some way. Before I could apologize this person had blocked me. So I asked another user who followed them that I often talked to for advice because they have had many experiences that I relate to, if they could let them know about my want to apologize. They agreed to do it but said that I shouldn't have reached out to them and that the person doesn't owe me forgiveness, this person blocked me as well. Now I have managed to upset two people I look up to and I'm sure you can understand why I'd be upset. Should I just forget about my past relationship with these people and move on?

1091,"Hi! So I started this job as a pharmacist tech a few months ago, the work isn't difficult just somewhat overwhelming and the pay is good. My only issue is my coworkers. I'm finding it difficult to make a connection with them. What I mean is that for some reason it's been difficult to talk with them about anything. When I'm asking for help or the be walked through the process of something, more often than not, I'm met with a condescending tone. Not all they time and not every coworker/manager. But definitely the majority of my team responds this way. And when I try to have a chat with them, I get shut down instantly. At first I thought it was just bc I was new, but we've hired a couple others sense I started and they seem to be fitting in fine with the rest of the team. Cracking jokes, talking about after work plans, just enjoying each others in general. There was one day when my manager was talking about a match he played in this FPS he plays, I'm a video game person and even if I don't enjoy the game myself I still just love talking about video games. After he finished his short story I wanted to talk with him about some of the games I play. My thoughts were that maybe we play some similar games and we could just have a nice conversation on the topic. All of my other coworkers literally turned their backs to me and started chatting with eachother or started working. My manager just gave me this blank stair and kept repeating ""uh huh. Yeah. Oh yeah? Wow"" until I took the hint and shut up. This happens quite often and with any topic I bring up. We'll be in a group during a moment of calm when we're not busy and looking for something to occupy us, and everyone is chatting but once I try to add something everyone except one coworker leaves the conversation immediately. And that one coworker gives me the same blank stair and body language that tells me they just want the conversation to end. So I've been keeping to myself most days. This upsets me though cause I see my coworkers having some fun with one another, but not me. It brings back bad memories of middle school lol.

1094,"I (20/F) realized this couple of days that my dad's Facebook account has been hacked, my dad told us he can't access his account, and my mom found out his profile pic and his name changed (we believe the language is thai) 

My sister and I exhausted all the possibilities and ways we know in trying to recover the account, however it's been a long time since we both used Facebook and we're frustated.

He used to log in with his hotmail (he had no 2 way confirmation security or whatsoever) so we tried to mainly change his password so the hacker couldn't get any access to it, and since he doesn't remember his password to it, my sister retrieved it (the hotmail), we found out it was too late, the guy already changed the email adress and the password of the Facebook account so to no avail we resorted to mass report the account as 'fake profile' and 'hacked'.

Due to Covid19, it is stated that the server moderators are less so major problems will be tended first. One of my friends that reported the profile recieved a message saying they didn't find any discrepancies with the account, but none of my other friends got it, we are waiting for another response.

I'm really afraid of the possibilities that guy is using my dad's account for unknown reasons, he has pictures with his friends and us, thinking about what he can do with those makes me really stressed.

We have no idea how this happened.
My dad expressed that, if there is no way, at least deleting the profile and everything is also acceptable. Everything to stop the guy at least!

When talking about the police brutality against protestors and how they tend to target African Americans in particular, he said the police arent really to be blamed because black people 'tend to be more violent', so the cops need to be more careful with them.

I went away a few hours to college and lived on campus so i did get some freedom and space. But when I graduated 2 years ago i found myself moving back home because of 62k in student loan debt. I found a job 6 months later and for the past year or so have been paying some debt down and helping my family since they aren’t financially stable. I’m torn between moving out or continue to live at home with very limited space. I do help cover some expenses when they are short for bills do when an unexpected expense. It’s usually a few hundred at a time that I give. Which I don’t mind. They do not plan on moving into a bigger apartment nor do they update the apartment (it’s been the same for 25+ years). They plan on retiring in the next few years and moving out the country so it’s safe to say things will remain the same for a while. I feel kind of guilty wanting to move out as they do depend on my help and moving out i wouldn’t be able to do so. I want to move out and get 2 roommates or so I can live within my means and still pay off debt. I live in NYC so it’s very expensive to live on my own. I want the luxury and freedom to invite my friends over which I can’t do now. I feel a bit selfish for leaving my family but I’ll be moving only an hr away. My income is stable at the moment.
