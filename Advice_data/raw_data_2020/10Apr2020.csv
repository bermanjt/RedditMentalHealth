0,"I don't even know if this will be approved because it's so long, but I hope it will. Should I:   

1. Leave early - you've gone above and beyond for this family and don't deserve the disrespect from your friend's mom, yes you'll be lonely back home but it's better than staying somewhere you are not appreciated. Pay $30 to change your airplane ticket and just gtfo. 
2. Stay until agreed upon date, the 19th - the mom is rarely there, she maybe comes once a week and everyone else in the house appreciates you and wants you to stay. 

Background: I have a friend with whom I have a complicated relationship. We met as first-year transfer students in college two years ago and bonded over similarities that included hobbies, but also that we are both daughters from poor immigrant families. She has crossed boundaries in the past when it comes to my feelings, and has a hard time taking things seriously. She's very childlike so it can be frustrating (we're both in our mid-20s), but she's also the funniest person I know and can be very caring and uplifting. I grew up in a physically and mentally abusive household where everyone was always angry, so being around someone bright like that feels good to me. However we definitely bickered a lot, mainly because she is a total slob and quite careless with possessions and spaces, and I am as clean and tidy as they come (think Monica Gellar from FRIENDS). This is important for the next part.  

Due to quarantine, she moved back home to SoCal and invited me to stay at her mom's house for a few weeks. She asked if I could help her clean the house with her, sort of ""teach her how to fish"" so that she could make the change into being an organized, mindful person like me. I've been to her family home before. I am not exaggerating when I say it could be an episode of hoarders, but I agreed because I care a lot about my friends, I love SoCal, and I love cleaning.   

The same day I arrived, I started cleaning. IT WAS SO HARD. I've never cleaned a space that was so severely neglected. There was 10 years of dust on everything, cobwebs everywhere, everything had strange stains for some reason, trash shoved everywhere, hoarding of unused purchases, on and on. I cleaned for 8 hours straight on the first day and did all of the heavy labor myself, asking my friend and her housemates to do only small tasks, which they bitched and moaned about the entire time. It was so stressful and I almost had a panic attack because not only was I doing hundreds of dollars worth of labor for free, but people were not making it any easier for me. On the first day, we cleaned only the living room.  The next day, we tackled the kitchen and dining room. This time it was a little easier, people were being a bit more respectful and giving more effort. That's all I really wanted, I wasn't helping to get glory and thanks, I wanted my friends to learn valuable life skills to improve their lives.

Here's what ABSOLUTELY SHOCKED ME. My friend's mother, who is the reason why the house was in such a horrible condition, started barking at us to finish faster, do more than we planned, and then would buy us cheap takeout food as if that made everything even. She never even thanked me for cleaning the countless messes that I had no hand in creating. I was literally on my hands and knees everyday, scrubbing away HER filth, and all she could say when I completed a task was, ""good."" Here I am, teaching her daughter, my friend, skills that her own mother couldn't teach her, and she's treating me like this? I did more work in ONE DAY than my friend had done in her whole lifetime, and that is not an exaggeration. Her mother had no right. 

This morning, my friend had cooked us all breakfast. Nobody asked her to, she just loves to cook (and make a mess and not clean it but that's a different can of worms). In fact, I asked her not to cook for me because I eat quite healthy and my friend tends to indulge. I was awake maybe 2 minutes when her mother started yelling at me, ""WHY DID MY DAUGHTER ONLY COOK? IS SHE YOUR MAID? No no no, you can't live here, just stay for vacation and then leave."" (She was referring to me staying for the entire school quarter which would end in June. My friend and I wanted to do this because we were helping each other achieve personal goals. I was helping my friend learn to be orderly and lose weight, and my friend was helping me wake up early and learn physics). Her mother pulled my friend's boyfriend aside and said ""Come here Nick, look at her, so what if she cleans a little, she's just using my daughter. And now look, she's talking back."" While her boyfriend was feverishly saying ""this place wouldn't even be clean without Drish, she does more than anybody here."" 

It was the biggest slap in the face I have ever received, and this is coming from someone who actually used to get physically slapped in the face as a child. Hours and hours of pain and work, for no pay, no thanks, all to be told that I AM the one taking advantage of one of the laziest people I know. Just yesterday I cleaned up after my friend in so many ways and just asked her to be mindful, didn't even give her a hard time. When her mom was yelling, my friend just sat there and ate her breakfast saying, ""just let her complain and finish,"" basically not arguing back and standing up for me and not calling her mom out on her bullshit. My friend kept saying ""What do you want me to do?"" 

All the housemates came and comforted me as I was crying upstairs, trying to validate all the efforts I put into their lives. This happened hours ago and I'm still crying over it. It's hard to focus on my homework. 

I was going to stay until the 19th and comeback after I got my affairs in order. But obviously I can't live here longterm. So at this point I'm wondering, do I just stay the remainder of the trip like my friends are asking me to do? Or just leave? Thanks if you made it this far &lt;3",10Apr2020,1
1,"I'm 16 (f) and I keep getting strong urges to drink alcohol. I'm very scared I'll become an alcoholic and I have little clue as to why this is happening to me. It's very overpowering and grows by the day. (Some extra info) I have been to therapy for many reasons and I'm on anti depressants now. Idk if my family has anything to do it, but there are a few too many heavy alcoholics in my extended family. I just don't know why I want to drown myself in alcohol and I don't want to worry my boyfriend or friends. So I guess I've turned to reddit. I'm afraid I won't be able to abstain for much longer.

4,"Hey r/askwomen, I’m a 17 year old guy and I seem to have upset another girl, same age as me, through snapchat.

I don’t really know her, she’s a friend of a friend and I was able to get her Snapchat via a shoutout maybe a week ago?

We didn’t really talk during that week until last night, where I thought I’d try and strike up a conversation and just get to know her a little. You know?

Anyway, I don’t get far as I ask her what she does, meaning as in does she go to college or have a job or anything like that. She responds by telling me she’s a key worker (that’s all the detail I got) so my response was “stay safe out there”.

This is apparently where I f’ed up. She went on this rant to me about why she wouldn’t be safe and that guys like me need to stop being so protective over girls they don’t know, but that wasn’t the angle I was trying to come from at all.

I guess all I’m asking is did I do something wrong that I genuinely haven’t seen, and what steps do I take from here?

Thank you.",10Apr2020,1
5,"I work for state government and we’re all working from home in the midst of this pandemic. There are three people who feel threatened by me because I’ve essentially at the job level they were at in their mid 40’s. Several times one woman told me how I wasn’t qualified for this position, because she didn’t want me in the office.

Just generally I’ve been proposing simple IT solution to our collaboration issues, and proper ways to track COVID-19 challenges in addition to my normal duties. I’ve proposed them, they’ve been shot down by this one women, and then re-proposed in the subsequent meeting.  To me this is a temporary secure job to help me get financial and psychological footing.  I decided, I’ll do only what is asked and nothing else.  They’ve even questioned me about why the project wasn’t done and I had to refer them to the email the woman sent taking responsibility for the project.  I will do my work, but I’m done getting worked up over the situation.

TL;DR: I’m sick of trying to fight people for stupid little victories.  Is it wrong that I just do the bare minimum in my job? I plan to move on eventually and have plenty of good references.",10Apr2020,1
6,"Cross post from r/careerguidance 

A month I told my manager I’m was applying to another role in another team but since COVID happened all transfers has been stopped but I told my manager I was interested in shadowing and stuff learning about the role still and they said they “support me”. Fast forward to now I’m in a client facing role but work has been super super slow and there isn’t work to do at all so I reached out to the other team lead and asked if I could use this time to learn and shadow unofficially since there’s nothing to do. The other team agreed. 

After they agreed I went back to my manager and told them I had reached out to the team lead and they agreed to let me shadow. Well my manager is not very happy. 

They got in a call with me and first they said I should have told them before I reached out and they they were blindsided. I felt like this wasn’t a total surprise, but fine I’ll go to them first in the future. The manager then said that all opportunities must go through them first and they choose who gets to do what and they their employees can’t shop around for other work, and that for anything career related they should be the first person I go to.

I agreed and said ok got it, I won’t let shadowing affect my work. (And honestly I feel like I’m a fine worker. I do everything on time and I always stay late when I’m needed, no complaints.) They then said they have more work for me— as if to bury me in work so I didn’t have time to do anything else.

One of the reasons I didn’t go to my manager in the first place is because I felt like they don’t actually support me and what I want to do. I kind of feel like they are “job-blocking” me. Last month when I said I was interested in another team they were saying I need to improve more in my role and that I need to become an expert in my role first, all that stuff.

I know I should have went to them before I reached out to the other team, but has anyone else experienced this? How much control does a manager have over you professionally? Any advice on how to precede would be appreciated. I’m new to the workforce so I’ve never experienced anything like this.

Thanks in advance!!

Edit: I did ask both my manager and other team members if they needed help or had extra work. No one had anything to do.",10Apr2020,1
8,"It started in 2012 my dad was getting really bad chesty coughs and sickness (didn’t smoke and was just a social drinker), he went to the doctors to be diagnosed with a lung disease and received a double lung transplant a year later.
As of now it is increasingly getting worse and the average life span for a transplant is around 5-10 years so i know it’s bound to happen in the next few years or even months. Especially with all this corona virus going around mainly effecting the lungs, i know that if he does get it he will die. I’m really not prepared as i’ve never experience a death in the family so i don’t know what to expect. I try to make soft humour out of it to prepare me and let my body know that it is inevitable. I can’t stop thinking about my father not being able to walk me down the aisle on my wedding day, see me graduate from university or even meet his first grandchild. He is a single dad and me and my brother (21) live with him, I can’t help to think what will happen when he’s gone and how different our lives will change financially. I can’t stop thinking how different my life and my fathers live would be if things had never got this bad. He sits alone, he can’t work as he is so weak, he can’t even walk up the stairs without having to be on oxygen and out of breath by the time he gets to the top. It’s heartbreaking and im really struggling right now.

9,"don’t attack me please. I’m trying to figure out why I feel this way. I feel like when a white man is in a relationship with a woman who’s a different race, he is taking advantage of her and doesn’t really care about her. 

Ironically, I’m a white woman who is only attracted to a specific race of men (not white). and I fully support relationships consisting of white woman / non white male. 

What is wrong with me? I feel like I should be supporting both sides but I just fucking can’t. I want to change but Every time I see a white man with a non white woman I just feel like he took advantage of her and that he isn’t in this relationship for it to last, but he’s in it for sex. Because I feel like white men think they’re better than everyone else and that getting women of other races is “easy” for him. 

I think I might be racist towards white people in general even though I am one. I find myself always advocating for ending racism against races other than my own. 

I honestly feel like white men are what made the world a living hell for so many other races and ethnic groups. But I’m trying to change, I know this is wrong and hurtful. Feel free to change my mind if you can, because I don’t feel good about being racist towards *anyone*.",10Apr2020,1

15,"To preface this/ give some context I'm a 22 year old woman, in college, and living with my parents now due to being kicked out of my on-campus housing because of current events. I'm a low-normal BMI, my family members who are living with me are either also normal or a little overweight. I'm also a vegetarian and have a lot of allergies so I usually eat different dinners from the rest of my family. We eat dinner together most days.

I don't eat perfectly, nor do I claim to. But I do eat a relatively healthy diet on the whole, probably healthier than the rest of my family if anything so I don't know why they seem to single me out. A typical example of dinner is they'll make something like baked chicken and salad, and meanwhile I'll make something like a soup with lentils and veggies in it (so both protein and veggies, just no blah raw salad and obviously no meat). I usually have small dinners because I am just not really so much of a fan of dinner (or large meals at all really) and eat it more out of courtesy to eat with my family than anything. I also don't eat breakfast, I usually just have black coffee. I'll have lunch and also snack at various points throughout the day, on things like fruit, beans, chips, chocolate, cereal, hummus, bread, yogurt. Doesn't sound like a huge amount but clearly I get enough calories because I'm not underweight or anything, even if I'm on the thinner side. I do keep track of my protein intake and take a multivitamin.

So yeah not amazing and not very traditional but I don't think it's so terrible that I should be criticized so much about it. I understand being worried but they'll blame everything on my diet, be it my depression or anxiety, feeling tired, a headache, if I ever get sick. They blame all of it on my diet. Whenever I'm eating anything unhealthy, like say some chips, they'll criticize me for it and say all I eat is junk, which is not true. Meanwhile they ate an entire bag of the same chips earlier and I'm just eating a few. But the response to that is that it's a higher portion of my diet because I eat less. They are absolutely 100% not perfect or even very healthy eaters at all, they drink a lot and eat lots of cheese and carbs and red meat. They'll eat deserts like cake, which I can't eat because I'm allergic to them. And they down junk food all at once whenever it's around the house, while I just eat little bits of it occasionally.

So yesterday they were going at me for it again all from different angles. My brother was ragging on me for being vegetarian and about how ""vegetarians are not healthy"". My dad was saying I eat too much junk and carbs. My stepmom was saying I need more vitamins and talking about some berry she thought was a superfruit. I told them to stop bugging me about it and mind their own diets. That they're not perfect either and I could do the same to them. I'm just sick of everything I eat being picked apart. I'm an adult and just because I'm living at home doesn't mean they can control every little part of my life. I do follow most of what they want me to do out of courtesy since I'm living with them while in college, but I'm not a child and policing my diet just feels horribly controlling to me. I would understand if I were eating all their expensive shit or something but I eat less than anyone else (I'm a small mostly sedentary woman and don't need so many calories) and when they criticize me I just feel like eating less because I feel like a burden or something. I don't know how normal it is for them to be obsessing over what I eat so much or why they're doing it but I'm really sick of it

TL;DR I'm a 22-year-old college student living with my parents and they are very overly critical of my diet. I got frustrated with it and told them to mind their own diets. I don't know why they feel the need to single me out so much",10Apr2020,1

20," I (21M) live in an apartment with two of my friends in college, and I am in our college's theatre program with one of them. Back in November, we had auditions for a play and one of our recent alum got in the cast (he auditioned the same semester that he graduated). Although, the lease for his apartment ended the next month. He asked my other roommate (the one who is also in theatre) if there was any chance he could stay at our place while he was rehearsing/performing (which would be the entire next semester), and he said yes.

What I didn't like about that was they talked about it a couple months in advance and I didn't know anything until a week before he moved in.

I heard them talk about it on the phone the week before and my roommate said I could give him a copy of my key (which I was baffled to hear because he still hadn't said anything about anyone moving in at this point) and he could see that I was very surprised that he offered this person a copy of my key, not even his key. He said, ""You look surprised about this"", and I said, ""Yeah, you never said a word to me about anyone moving in. When did you first start talking to him about this?"" and he said ""About three months ago. Did I not say anything?"" to which I said, ""No, this is all brand new to me"". He then asked if it was okay, but in a very half-assed manner. I said yes, as long as he helps out with rent/utilities, but I was still upset he didn't say anything months ago. He then gave me the responsibility to talk to our third roommate about this situation and ask him if he was okay with this instead of doing it himself. My third roommate agreed with me.

Fast forward to March. This friend has stayed here since December and hasn't helped out with rent/utilities at all. Other than going to work in the morning and rehearsal at night, he stays in our living room and plays on my roommate's \[roommate who offered him our place\] Xbox all day. It's gotten to the point to where his controller batteries die every other day and he is getting tired of constantly buying more batteries. But instead of being upset at our new roommate, he is upset at my girlfriend and I because ""we play Xbox with him 'all night'"" (which isn't nearly as long as our new roommate does, plus most of the time it's just us watching him play Xbox, so we have nothing to do with this). I asked him if there was any way he could help us out with bills, since we're all broke college students and money is tight. He said that \[roommate who offered him our place\] was going to talk to us at some point about it. I was pretty upset to hear that, because I felt this should've been compromised far before he even offered him our place.

Later that day, I sat down and talked to my roommate. He said he was going to help out with buying household items (like cleaning supplies, batteries, etc.), which is completely different and far cheaper than rent/utilities. I asked him what happened to helping out with rent and he said that money is tight for him. Which I would understand, but since he is out of school, he is working more hours, therefore making more money, than all three of us, so I don't understand why he can't help out at least a little bit. He then replies with ""Dude, he needs a place to stay. I offered him a place to stay.""

I am not a confrontational person, and didn't want to start a full-on argument about this, so I let it slide. But now I'm regretting it.

Fast forward a couple weeks. School has been moved to online classes for the semester due to coronavirus, and the play has been cancelled. Still no sign of any financial help from our new roommate (at least not on my end, as far as I know). I'm always willing to open our place up to someone if they need somewhere to crash for a week or two, but it has been almost four months now, and frankly he has no reason to stay here now. I've been staying at my parents' place since spring break a couple weeks ago, but I came back one day to get some things I needed, and I saw that he was still staying there, knowing the play had been cancelled for the past few weeks. I asked \[roommate who offered him our place\] what was going on and he said he has nowhere else to go, and doesn't want to go back to his parents' place (which is completely different from having nowhere else to go, cause frankly he does). I asked if he has contributed towards anything at all, and he said no. It's gotten to the point to where he is definitely mooching off of us. Now I'm the bad guy in their eyes because I'm questioning him staying here rent free while we bust our asses to pay rent. My parents figured out and they're livid because we're still paying rent, even though I'm back with them for now, and he is living there rent free. My father has threatened to call our apartment complex and have him kicked out of our apartment if he figures out he's still there by the time I come back. I don't want to do that, but it's been months and we have had no financial support from him, and he frankly has no reason to be there anymore.

Am I an asshole for feeling this way about this situation? I don't want to be the bad guy here and kick him out, but I feel that this is all unfair for not just me, but my third roommate as well.",10Apr2020,1

23,"Hi all! This is my first time posting &amp; I was hoping I could please get some outside perspective. (TL:DR at the bottom!)

In high school I dated this guy for like a year and a few months, but when he left for college, he broke up with me so he could experience the college lifestyle. I was super duper sad because we had a really great relationship. I found out that a couple weeks later, he was already dating this girl whom he had been chatting w/ while we were still dating. They hadn't been flirting, but it still felt weird and I kinda felt betrayed? Idk. They dated for like eightish months or something, broke up briefly, then got back together. 

My ex and this girl moved across the country together to Seattle and got an apartment and cats together. Recently (in December), they broke up after being together for 7 years because she'd been having some family issues. A week after they broke up, he reached out to me and started kinda flirting with me again. I even bought a ticket to fly out to visit him for a weekend (I live in Illinois) and we hooked up. I was so excited cuz I got my boy back. 

But lately I've been feeling pretty uneasy. This girl is in his group of friends and he wants to stay really close with her. She's super pretty, funny, and successful which is intimidating and I'm worried he's still into her. He helped her move apartments then hung out with her all day, &amp; he let her keep some really expensive things of his he left when he moved out (I found messages of her asking him if she could PayPal him for the items or give them back, but he insisted they were his treat). Since we've been quarantined, he facetimes her (along with her friend group) all day every day and if she's not online he messages her and asks her to hop on their call, I heard him laughing with her on the phone the other day and making borderline inappropriate jokes, and they play video games together for hours. I wasn't even aware of this until I was using his computer while visiting Seattle recently and found messages and FaceTime logs etc. I'm scared because I live across the country and I don't have as much in common with him as he does with her. I'm going insane with anxiety. 

Is this okay for him to still be this close to her ... am I overreacting? Am I just a rebound/being used? Please be brutally honest. Thanks everyone! 🌟

24,"So, this is long story but I want to know if I just make myself a victim of an I a real one. Sorry if it's a wrong subreddit, I wasn't sure where to post it...

So it started a year and a half ago. I met my friend's brother (25m) So, we got friendly, he was interested in my 23 year old friend(let's call her S), she is really cute so no wonder. I kinda liked him but I knew, I'm just a child so I tried to help them get together but still being friends with both of them. 

A said that he would rather me than my friend because of her personality. I didn't know what to think about this at that time. Mind you, I was (still am)very sensitive girl with really bad self worth so it was nice that someone was interested in you. Yet I couldn't believe he was serious, A is a grown man. 
We texted a lot. I really started to trust him, I treated A as my friend, he was also very friendly with S. A kissed me on a cheek a couple of times and so did I

A started make me feel like he did want to be with me for serious, I know stupid. He started kissing me and I was curious, I did feel like I shouldn't. I am stupid and caught feelings for him unfortunately. At that time he also tried to grab my breast and butt. I didn't let him. At that time, A was flirty with S too, this made me feel really sad yet A told me he can't be serious with her because of her mental problems. After some time, A stopped doing it
Time passed, I trusted him more and he started doing more and Some things happened. I am really disgusted to myself that part of me wanted that. It was stimulating and oral. A also very often sent me a d pic so I would get aroused enough so I would send him a pic (which happened a couple of times). 

I told him before all of that that I just want him as a friend, he always said he understood but when we met... I just thought, because he is older and I know his sister and brother-in-law, that I could trust A. This went for six months when I finally told him that I'm telling my parents. He asked me not to tell them that it was him, not to ruin his life and not put him in jail (even tho the age of consent in my country is 15) Unfortunately, I lied to my parents. It's been a whole year since then, I still was talking to him. Even tho my parents were understanding and helpful, I still feel like trash, I just hate myself.

Today, I blocked him an cut the contact with him. A said that I wanted it, he did and that's why he continued. A very often helped me emotionally when I needed. After all, A was a really good friend except that part. Spending time with him normally was really the best and fun. My parents always trusted him. I once wanted him to admit he did have advantage from me (he is older etc) but he said he won't do it because it sound that he planned it but he didn't. A is angry when I come back to it, A says that I should stop focusing on it and that only thoughts make our actions bad, we should just learn from it

So will blocking him help me? Or maybe I'm just overreacting and just ahould move on as he says? I don't know, I have so many doubts...",10Apr2020,1
26,"My ex texted me saying she “misses my friendship” and wants to hang out, but says she doesn’t want to get back together. I’m about 80% sure she has a boyfriend, so I’m confused. Is she not fulfilled in that relationship and just looking for a distraction or something? What would you think if you were me?",10Apr2020,1
27,"My sister-in-law M. has been living with my husband R. and I for six months. We needed help with rent and M. was having roommate issues, so she agreed to move in with us. She has a stable job, seemed clean, quiet and responsible, and because R.'s daughter K. stays with us on the weekend we thought a family member as a roommate was the best option.

Once she moved in we realized she's not clean and responsible-- she's incredibly gross and lazy. She doesn't help out around the house at all. She wears the same clothes for days on end &amp; doesn't bathe regularly. She hoards junk food in her room AND has food delivered every day, but never throws anything out so her room is full of garbage-- then she crams the kitchen with fruits/veggies which she doesn't eat (I guess she buys them for show?) so they inevitably rot and smell horrible. (This is just scratching the surface of how disgusting she is. She never invites us in her room-- I only know it's disgusting because I peeked when she wasn't home.)

Both R. and I have tried politely talking to her about cleanliness but nothing changes. It's pretty clear a lot of this stems from a food addiction (she's very obese) and R. has even told their mom to see if she'll convince M. to get help but mom just makes excuses. We can't afford to kick her out and we aren't comfortable letting a stranger live here. It's causing problems between me &amp; R.-- he doesn't think it's as bad as I do, that's his little sister and she obviously has some issues and I'm being unsympathetic, etc etc.

Last week while M. was gone and R. was picking up K., I got nosy. We have our own bathroom, but there's a 2nd bathroom which M. has to herself during the week &amp; shares with K. on the weekend. I realized I'd never been in there as long as M. had been living here and I wanted to see if she was keeping it clean. Of course she wasn't and it was filthy, but the bigger issue was what I saw upright on the counter next to the sink, in full view-- a large, purple vibrating dildo.

I didn't touch anything and got the fuck out of there but I had no idea what to do. God knows how long it was sitting out (having seen M.'s living habits, probably a while) and if K. had seen it before-- assuming she would know what it was. Either way it's disgustingly inappropriate to leave your dildo out where a child can see it, whether she knows what it is or not.

I didn't want M. to know I snooped in her bathroom, so I didn't say anything. Also that's an incredibly awkward conversation to have with anyone, let alone a family member. Usually I defer to R. for talking to M. about house stuff but I know I would fucking die if anybody tried to tell me about my sibling's masturbation habits let alone expect me to talk to them about it, so that was not an option.

I checked again the next day and the dildo was gone. I can only pray that M. realized she left it out and put it away before K. noticed, and if K . did see it she didn't know what it was. However, I'm very concerned about the possibility of it happening again, especially when M. has shown that she is so careless about cleaning up after herself.

What do I do? I'm at the end of my rope with M. for so many reasons and this is the last straw. But I don't want to talk to her about it, and I know my husband definitely won't want to (and I don't blame him).

**TL;DR: was nosy and saw that sister-in-law left her dildo out in the bathroom she shares with her 11y/o niece/my stepdaughter. I don't know how to approach the issue with my SIL.**",10Apr2020,1

Ever since they got together we have been a little distant, but I want to get it off my chest. A couple of my friends have told me that since we are quarantined for a while, I should shoot my shot.

30,"Mother in law was stationed in Afghanistan for seven months with the Navy, and has just returned to her home in Virginia. She told my wife that she went through six airports to get home and sees no issue coming down to us in Austin, Texas after she quarantines for two weeks. That puts her at getting here on April 23rd, the DAY after peak Coronavirus infections for us ([according to this model](https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america/texas)). We've tried to explain to here the real risk she and everyone she comes in contact is (she wants to see my Wife's grandparents and brother that lives with them while she's here too. They are well in their 60's and 70's, and wouldn't mind as they're avid Fox News watchers), but she still wants to ""come give her daughter a hug"" no matter what. We've sent her the below links, as well as shown her the map of the currently infected areas of Austin, as well as google maps routes that show her having to \*\*literally drive through those infected areas going anywhere from the airport\*\*, but she won't be deterred. 

&amp;#x200B;

Part of the reason she really wants to come down is she left her Truck with us before she left for Afghanistan. We held onto it for her as we could take care of it and we only have one car between us at the moment. We understand her need to have it back, she complained about having to walk a mile to the grocery store. We have no intention of withholding it from her, but we're prepared to say that if she comes here, we'll leave the key in a hidden location on the front porch, and that's it. We won't see her, we won't interact with her, which obviously won't make her happy. 

&amp;#x200B;

She hasn't bought her one way ticket yet, but she'll probably buy before I finish writing this post. We're willing to offer her to come visit at another time (June 1st?), and we'll pay for the delivery fee of her groceries from the delivery service of her choosing, but I honestly doubt she'll bite that either. And if she doesn't I don't what really to do.

36,"So there is this girl that I have been talking to lately. She slid into my DMs and instantly started talking. She would always reply to me quickly and showed great interest in me. We call each other cute names and talk intimately.

Yesterday night, she told me she had a headache and was going to go to bed (this was at a time much earlier than when she goes to sleep) so we told each other goodnight and she left me on read. However, about 20 minutes later, she posts a selfie on instagram and I notice she is on snap talking to other people for the next two hours. I was devastated and felt lied to because of this.

Today, she finally messaged me but it was well into the afternoon by then. We exchange a few messages until she left me on delivered. This time, I noticed that she posted a story on instagram. I saw it and even commented on the recent picture she posted last night to which she replied very positively (I probably shouldn't have). But the thing is, she has left me on delivered but I know she has been messaging other people on snap and it has been 3 hours now since we've talked.

The same goes for every single social media account i have, meaning I can never show my face, my voice or anything personal to people who have opened up to me so many times.

I considered just disappearing from everything, but it broke my heart to hear a certain persons kind words about how they hoped I wouldn't abandon them. The online world is my primary way of self expression, so my online friends are a huge part of my life, who have stopped me from suicide so many times. I could just stop lying but it would be Abit shocking to say ""hey yeah I've been lying to all of you this whole time and I'm younger than all of you"" and then just expect everyone to be fine with it. I just wish I never lied in the first place, I feel so awful looking in the mirror after talking to people with my online persona.

40,"Hey my Reddit family, I'm back again needing more advice. So I am 25(f) and I am having trouble finding a job. I graduated high school about 6 years ago and during these last 6 years I've had 4 jobs. The longest I've had a job is a year and a half, but the rest were about 2 months each. Yes, I did move the other 3 times, but I was also dealing with extremely bad mental illnesses that weren't being properly treated. I left those jobs in a worse state than when I went in, and I feel horrible. Well 3 years ago, I started college and nearly had my associates when I had to move. I moved in with my now ex and his father into a house and had my last job during that time. Things were good, I was in school and having fun. But then the last semester his dad decided to move and sell the house for financial reasons. I get it, we weren't doing too well and he has himself to think about too. But it cost me my last semester, I was so stressed out from packing and chaos that I failed 2 classes and it broke me mentally. This last year (May 2019 till now) I have been actively seeking a job. Not just because I want to pay off my loans, but because I want some financial independence too. I updated my resume and cleaned it up, I applied for any jobs I could work and waited. But rejection after rejection has poured in and now I'm at the point in my life where I may have to move in with my mom. My mom abused me as a child and I have finally found a therapist and medications that work. I don't want to start all over again, and lose that progress, but this town doesn't want to hire me. I know, it's karma getting me for my failures of the past and I deserve this in a lot of ways, but for once I'd like to not be another statistic. I don't want to be another former foster kid relying on the government for support the rest of my life. But this Coronavirus has made my task impossible to complete, and I have no real choice but to move in with her. Can anyone tell me what I'm doing wrong? Why I'm being rejected by even Walmart? Maybe help sort out my resume and applications? I'm very desperate and I want to continue making forward progress.",10Apr2020,1
41,"Little background: I started a new job a few months ago. I accepted the position because I was offered an opportunity to earn some certifications and felt I could use the position as a stepping stone to grow within the agency.

Fast forward to today: The job is nothing that was described to me or what I had expected. Within 30 days, my supervisor changed my job title and responsibilities with no communication or change in pay. I've was then thrown into the middle of some office drama between my supervisor and coworkers. They all hate each other. A coworker quit, and as a result, I've been unable to do the job I was originally hired for. I've gone through the entire chain of command expressing my questions and concerns. As a result, I've been told by the two highest directors that my supervisor has not been telling me the truth. This is currently being addressed by the top director. I have no respect for being lied to and I feel as if I now have no choice but to leave the agency even though I just started a few months ago. I'm a semester away from finishing my bachelor's and want to build a career within one place. I feel this could be the place due to the high turnover rate, but at the same time I've already been lied to by my own supervisor within my first few months and that concerns me going forward.

45,"Lately, I’ve been having Some weird symptoms. It took me a about a week to figure out but I’ve come to realize I’m experiencing the same symptoms my father, sister and brother all experienced when they were diagnosed with a chronic illness. I’m not going to say the name of the illness, it frustrates me just by seeing the name. It was assumed that I had escaped it and wouldn’t get it but I think I have it. I have a doctors appointment scheduled for Wednesday to get it confirmed. 

The chronic illness that I think I have is not treatable but is sustainable with medicine. So, if I take medication everyday for the rest of my life, between 4-8 times a day, I can live. My life expectancy is cut short by twenty years but I can live. There are many with the illness that go on to live productive lives and generally don’t have complications. My dad, for example, has a great career, is in amazing shape and I’ve only seen him hospitalized or sick 1 time in my entire life. My brother, however, finds it harder to take care of himself having the illness and as a result gets hospitalized 1-2 a year. Last year, he fell to the ground and had a small seizure, caused by the illness. It was terrifying. So I’ve seen both sides of the spectrum. 

I don’t like the idea of having to take medication everyday multiple times a day for the rest of life. It seems unfair. I’m a good person, I work hard, I’ve established a decent life for myself. I’m also fairly young (early twenties). I don’t understand why *I* have to come down with this affliction. It’s not fair. I’ve been seriously considering just letting myself die from it. Basically treat it as a sign from the universe that it’s my time to go. The medicine only puts off the inevitable, it’s sustaining not treating. If I were to allow myself to succumb to my illness, I’d have probably a few months to a year to live. I would look into upping the amount of my life insurance so that my mom could receive a decent sum of money and all of my expenses would be covered as well. I would also liquidate my 401k, probably sell most of possessions to have some liquid assets and I would jump in my car with my dog and perform a small series of bucket list like tasks, return home to my house and wait until the inevitable were to happen. It would be painful but it would be over soon. 

The reason this is even a consideration for me instead of just accepting to take the medication to live is that I don’t have much to live for as far as I can see it. I don’t have friends, I don’t have a girlfriend, I don’t have a wife, I don’t have kids. I have my dog, my parents and my job. I have my accomplishments, don’t get me wrong. I work a great job, am a homeowner and have attended many concerts, sporting events and vacations during my lifetime. But I’m alone all day everyday (aside from the 2 days a week I spend with 1 coworker on shift) and I spend a lot of time depressed. I don’t know if I see the value in having to do something additional to continue living. I also don’t know if I really want to pay money routinely (every month) to continue living. I have health insurance. But even with that, my estimation is that I would probably end up paying around $110 a month for medication and other expenses excluding medical appointments. I can afford it but it’s still terrible. To take medicine for the rest of my life and have to basically pay to live, even just conceptually, sucks. 

There will never be a point where I do not need the medication. There is no medical breakthrough coming. It’s either medicine or die. 

Looking at it from a different angle, with the medication I could live for around 40-45 more years and provided I take good care of myself, I could live a relatively good life. Within that span of time, I could potentially find a friend, I could maybe find somebody that loves me, I could continue excelling within my career field. But those are uncertainties.

Once again, There will never be a point where I do not need the medication. There is no medical breakthrough coming. It’s either medicine or die. 

Long post but I’d really like to hear thoughts on the subject. 

**TLDR;** Will more than likely be diagnosed with a chronic illness in a few days. I don’t know if I should just pay for and take medicine to live everyday for the rest of my life or just let the illness kill me now. Is living with a chronic illness for the rest of my life (approx. 40 years) worth it? There will never be a point where I do not need the medication. There is no medical breakthrough coming. It’s either medicine or die. The medicine is sustaining not curing.",10Apr2020,1

With my extreme anxiety, and stress in normal times I was barely keeping it together, now I'm having heart palpitations when I get home and having trouble sleeping.

My wife is still employed and makes more than enough money to support both of us until I find a new job and we have about 3 months of emergency money saved. She has said that she will support whatever decision I make, and has encouraged me to quit for my own mental health.

I'm scared for the future, and I don't want to put the entire financial responsibility in my wifes hands, but I also want to look out for my health.

Any advice? Thank you for reading.",10Apr2020,1
55,"As the title says, the family member received an email from a hacker telling that the family member enter a porn website that was infected and stole not only the passwords but the names of all the people they know about, and unless he/she pays they would send the video they saw + their reaction to say video (since apparently they recorded from the webcam they hack too) to all the people they know.

The thing is that we know its a scam because they wrote fake information about the family member, such as:

1)Fake password

2)Not recording of any reaction since family member dont have webcams on the computer (both at home and at work)

3)Hacker was very ambiguous on the whole thing, making it sound like if it was anybody.

The problem through is that they knew their account, and since we dont know much about how email works we dont know if they actually hack to the provider, or they send at random hoping someone falls for their trap. 

Should we ignore it? Put it as spam? Delete the email account?

As an adult, I've found the work world to be harsh and unfair. Salaries are based on arbitrary issues (like how much did you got paid at your last job) and often have little to no relation to the job's importance to society. Employers are trying to maximize the work output of employees while minimizing the pay. And we spend most of our waking hours working so that we can afford the privilege of paying rent.

I've become really pessimistic about the future. I'm applying for jobs and am having trouble motivating myself. It all feels so pointless. Anyone else ever feel this way?

58,"helloooo everyone.

  I need advice on a secret that I have never told anyone mostly because I am ashamed of it even though it mostly doesn't have anything to do with me. I come from a christian background and my parents are pastors of a prominent church in my city. 

   When I was around 13 years old, I was using my dad's iPad to watch Youtube videos. I happened to go into his video history and I found porn that started transgender women that still had penises. I was really confused and thought that my dad might have a virus on his iPad but deep down I suspected that my dad was intentionally looking these things up. So whenever I had time alone, I would go into my dad's iPad to see if he was still watching these videos and every time there would be videos in his history. I felt upset and angry and I didn't understand why my dad would watch this stuff... I mean he was a pastor. I tried not to think about it but it was hard not to. Well, a couple of months later my mom would always have my dad's phone with her and things were...  tense between them. I sensed that it had something to do with what I found months earlier and I got into my dad's phone and found that he was contacting prostitutes on a website. So yeah.... it was really awkward for a couple of months but everything seemed to go back to normal.

   Then about a year later when I was 14, my mom picked me up from school alone and she seemed upset but she was trying to act as normal as possible. I asked where my dad was and she didn't tell me. Turns out, my mom dumped my dad on the highway and made him hitchhike to our house. Once my dad got home, my mom proceeded to yell at him very loudly saying things like ""In our bed..."" and just crying and being visibly upset by his betrayal. So I figured he was cheating... again. I remember my mom would sleep on the couch because I guess she was so disgusted by his actions in their own bedroom. I hated everything about it, I felt so alone since I knew what was going on and I could see my parent's relationship falling apart but they would try to act like everything was fine in front of me. Part of me wanted them to get a divorce and the other part wanted them to stay together even though I knew it was fucked up.

 I quickly left for a volunteer trip for around a month and when I came back my parents were seemingly happy but I honestly think it was just to keep up appearances at our church. I am 19 now and 6 years have passed but I still catch my mom unable to trust my father. Their iMessages are linked and their Internet history. Now, I cringe whenever they kiss or say they love each other, still clouded by the horrible memories a couple of years ago. It's hard for me to not be angry with my father even though on the outside I act like everything's fine but I hate him deep down I do. I never really thought of this as trauma but whenever I think about this whole situation I get really anxious, as if it has damaged me. So I guess my question is.... could this be classified as trauma and how do I stop feeling hurt by my parent's marital issues?

Also I am 19F!!

TDLR: I found out my dad's infidelity by finding transgender porn on his iPad and eventually found out my dad was cheating on my mom with prostitutes. My mom found out and stayed with him and they don't know that I know about all of this. I hate the fact that they stayed together and I hate my dad for what he has done. How do I get over this?",10Apr2020,1

My new step mom is amazing, she gives me advice, gives me presents helps me with homework and tells me not to half ass anything. Basically treats me like her child, love her very much. But always gets upset when I don’t wanna go to family parties. There’s always huge family parties (before covid19) for Christmas,birthdays, anything majority are at my house but I just stay in my room. Just not found of loud music, lots of people, not my scene. She gets upset if I stay in my room for too long and not enjoy the party, or how right now I didn’t want to go to my relatives birthday (bc of Covid it’s only them 2 &amp; other 2 ppl so 5) she started to say why not and you can do your homework later ect. Honestly made up excuses just not to go. Nothing against my relative, just didn’t want to go. Also my father has already stopped trying to get me to go to family gatherings and stuff awhile ago.

61,"Ever since I gained an interest towards gaming and the internet I’ve made tons of online friends. Most of them being guys. 

For about two years now I’ve been active on my Xbox as well as reddit and iFunny. I’ve begun to notice that multiple guys that I game with have become protective and even jealous while talking to me.

I never flirt with people online as I don’t want a long distance relationship, only friendship. I would like to have more female friends but I’ve barely found any that play games like I do.

Anyways, most of the guys I talk to don’t like other guys to be in parties with me. It’s gotten to the point that multiple of them have admitted to having feelings for me and wanting to meet me in real life.

This whole thing has become extremely uncomfortable for me. Most of them know what I look like because I communicate with them through Snapchat.

But again. I want to make it clear that I have made it obvious that I do not want a long distance relationship with anyone. They still admit these things to me and it honestly makes me uncomfortable and I don’t know what to say.

I feel bad telling them that I don’t like them that way back. I just don’t know where I went wrong and I honestly feel like it’s my own fault that they think I want a chance with them.

I do still continue to play games with them and we share a lot of good memories and have good times together but I want to know how to show them that I don’t have those kinds of intentions.

70,"This is my first reddit post! I’m (22F) worried that my boyfriend (22M) is going to vote for Trump again. Some context...

I’m a Muslim American born in the states. I’m pretty detached from my religion. I drink and have had sex. However, being Muslim is still part of my identity. I have dated my boyfriend for 5 months now. 

I know politics is uncomfortable for many. I’m very passionate about it. It plays a major role in my life and I think it’s important to be aware and participate. He doesn’t think so. He’s a white male (very wealthy). That’s okay. I realized early that he voted for Trump. I was hurt. He says it was for economical reasons. I don’t blame him. We just started college, we hadn’t formed our own thoughts yet or met diverse new people yet. I am not mad at him for voting for him. He had his reasons. He recognized that those reasons were selfish. 

Now, I bring up the topic again. He said he hasn’t thought about it. That it’s a concern for a later date. I thought after dating for a while that I had some impact? I’m not trying to change who he is. I support people and their political beliefs. I understand both conservative and liberal viewpoints. I’m just sad... this president doesn’t believe I deserve to be here and this is my home. I’m a first generation American. And it hurts that he considers Trump to still be an option.

An old friend of mine, who I used to be with 10 years ago, 
Is doing it rough &amp; has been for the last year. Recently they have said they have been sleeping on the streets. My friend sent me a message this morning about ending there life. It's not the first time over the years they have said this. I recently brought my own home, which I am concerned about keeping with all if the current financial uncertainty. 
Should I offer my friend to stay with me for a while?

Backstory: 

- My friend is a drug addict/ alcoholic who does not work. He is not violent but his lifestyle definitely has an effect on him.
- I was 19 &amp; he was 33 y.o when we were together, it lasted roughly 2 year's before I ended thing's.  I'm over everything that went on  in our relationship but would be lying if it didn't have a big impact on me for many years.

- I have supported ( financially) boyfriends with substance abuse problems in the past ( they were abusive) &amp; have finally started living on my own &amp; am enjoying feeling less weighted down by other people substance issues.

- My friend does not really want to help themselves &amp; has recently broke up with his long term girlfriend who I'm sure financially supported him alot

- I have recently started seeing someone &amp; it's going really well, I great change from my previous relationships. I don't want to mess is up &amp; it's a big ask for a new relationship.

- I am worried that I will end up supporting them &amp; having a long term housemate ( my place is small)

My friend recently called me crying that she’s not coping very well with motherhood (it doesn’t help that we’re in quarantine and her partner is stuck in another country cause he couldn’t fly back on time) anyway, she’s always said that she doesn’t feel very maternal and feels no emotional connection to her baby. When she was pregnant she used to call the baby ""it"" and even now sometimes it still slips out of her tongue when she’s speaking about her baby. Eg; If I ask her how the baby is doing she would say ""it’s sleeping"" I constantly have to remind her not to do that. I think she does it subconsciously. But she gets super upset when someone misgenders her dog *unrelated but ygwim*

So back to the phone call, she called me feeling very desolate and she was tearful. She said she hates her baby, she doesn’t like how she makes her feel , she says she hates that her partner is so far and unable to physically support her. She’s juggling both work and motherhood simultaneously at home and it’s taken a toll on her. She’s not someone that’s very affectionate anyway so I was really hoping this would change when she gave birth but if anything she’s become even more distant. She says the baby isn’t a tough baby, she sleeps well, feeds well and doesn’t cry a whole lot she’s generally a good baby. So she doesn’t know why she feels the way she does. She said she woke up feeling very overwhelmed and started thinking of ways to get rid of the baby. She said if the baby was to die in her sleep she wouldn’t feel any type of way. She said sometimes she purposely puts a lot of blankets in the baby’s cot while she’s sleeping hoping she’d “accidentally suffocate herself” omg this made the hairs in the back of my neck stand up. She said she hated being pregnant and that she envied the attention her partner gave the baby. 

I FaceTime her everyday just to know the baby and her are safe. I literally call her every 3hr,even at night because I know she struggles the most at night.

So obviously, I broke out my spare fabrics and made masks for my boyfriend and me, and while doing this, I noticed that I had a decent amount of spare fabric. So after posting a picture of the mask I made for myself, I mentioned that I would make one or two for anyone interested. My mom, her friend, my aunt, and an older friend of mine took me up on the offer and it was kind of nice to have something to do while isolated and I would like to thin out my fabric collection. So I decided to make more masks to donate to the local hospitals, but I found out that they received so many donations, that they are no longer accepting new masks (not surprising, I live in a very craft-centric city).

Well, I decided I'd just make a general post on FB about making masks for people. I was planning on offering them for free because I sort of felt like it was a little shady and whatnot to charge for something like this since so many people are out of work (also all the fabrics I'm using I've had for YEARS).

86,"Okay, so I haven’t thought about this for four years and I had almost blocked the memory. However, I found an old diary I used to keep at university and after reading it, it brought it all back and made me question what happened. 

Sorry if there’s too much detail! I just want to see what you all think.

I had a one night stand during my first year of university and invited him back to my place from a night club (it was probably safe to say we were both intoxicated but I did have the thought that i was a bit more sloppy than him), we were unclothed and kissing in my bed (I didn’t really want it to go this far but after a few drinks it just turned out this way).
Without me saying anything, he penetrated me without telling me (I feel like because we were both naked it’s expected that this is going to happen? So I’m unsure of the grey area but with previous sexual encounters there’s always some communication but there wasn’t in this case. And it felt as if I wasn’t there at this point, I remember feeling as if I couldn’t speak up). He had no condom on either but we didn’t get to the stage where we would talk about condoms, it felt as if he was determined to go in me and I had no say in the matter. I didn’t really know what to do, since it had happened I didn’t feel like I could say no anymore as he was already in and I was scared what would happen if I were to say no at that moment in time, so it just sort of happened. 
I remember him trying to repeatedly insert his penis into my bum (he hadn’t asked and tried to convince me it was my ‘vagina’) and I had to continue saying no and trying to stop that from happening. It wasn’t a relaxing experience and I remember feeling guarded the whole time but it was such a blurry night.
Then I remember asking him not to cum and moments later, he sighed with relief flopped back down next to me and said he came inside of me. It was a heartbreaking situation, my breasts were badly bruised from this (I can’t remember how that happened or any pain but the next day my breasts were black and blue) and I remember my vagina being super sore for the following week. I had never experienced so much pain from a sexual encounter before.
At the time I felt disgusted with myself as I had invited him back to mine, I had continued this and ‘led’ him on so because we were both naked, it must have been consent. 
I’m older and wiser now to question this as I was only eighteen at the time and had never had the freedom to live on my own before, I was more naive. 

I hadn’t thought about it for a long time but now the memory has come back, I feel like I can’t shake the thought and I have never told anyone about this because I don’t really know what to make of it myself. I still feel disgusted by it now and I don’t think I’ve ever explored what actually happened, so I don’t know really. I don’t know what to say it was as there is such a grey area around consent.",10Apr2020,1

Recently, I(19F) ended things with my two best friends(19F, 19F) of 12 years. It’s long, but you need the full picture. 

Some backstory, we’ve been friends since 1st grade, went to the same schools for 12 years, i considered their parents my family and we had our graduation party together. We were a trio and people knew us that way, getting especially close in the last two years of highschool. However, they were both super high achieving, ranked first and second in our graduating class, while i still did well in school, they both considered themselves smarter than me. My role in our friendship was for them to make fun of me a lot, which I chocked up to their personalities until recently, while my it’s just not in my personality to make fun of other people or be mean. 

In March 2019, I got a new boyfriend (still together) who I was very much in love with and started to spend a lot of time with. I loved being with him so much, and still do. While with him I felt carefree and on top of the world and we just clicked, which was especially helpful while I was dealing with difficult exams and end of the year projects. Around this time, I also decided to go to university outside the country, while my two best friends were going to the same university.

Thus, after school ended I started spending significantly less time with my friends, and more with my boyfriend, simply because I was so in love and having so much fun. They began to resent me for this, which made me feel guilty and scared of seeing them because I was afraid of confrontation. Neither of them had boyfriends or had been in serious relationships before. During this time I was also working a full time job, which was tiring and very stressful, while neither of them had jobs. They always asked me to hangout spontaneously, like when I was already at my boyfriends house after work, and they expected me to drop him and come over, instead of planning to hangout ahead of time. So, I was seeing them maybe once a week. They started hanging out just the two of them, and stopped texting me back as much as they used to, and they were always dropping inside jokes and excluding me from conversations when we did hangout. 

IMPORTANT:
It got to the point in mid july when I was feeling so guilty and anxious about the situation that I decided to confront them. We went to dinner and I calmly told them that I would like to apologize for not spending as much time with them, and saying that I value our friendship and that I don’t want our relationship to be tense like this. They responded by insulting me. They said that I must have low self esteem to have a boyfriend, and hate myself, and that they don’t approve of him (mostly because he go to a community college and smokes weird once a week) and they will never approve of him no matter how much I care about him. They also said that since they’re my best friends, they DESERVE my time. 
This left me crying at the dinner table and feeling awful about myself. 

After this I became depressed and started to question my self worth, causing me to go see a mental health therapist.The way I saw it, the two people closest to me had just told me that they saw me as someone that has no self worth, and they don’t care enough about my feelings to change their thoughts about someone I care about. It made me mad that they thought I “owed” them my time. 

I tried to reconcile in early August, before college started. I explained how they made me feel, both said they ‘wouldn’t take back what they said’ and wouldn’t apologize for saying it, only saying they were sorry I felt that way. 

FAST FORWARD: to January 2020. 
Before this I had kept things cordial, as our friendship hadn’t had a clean break. I talked to them each once on facetime through the 4 months that I was at college. 

January 9th: 
One of my friends birthdays had passed, and I didn’t wish her happy birthday. She texted me, asking if we were “best friends” how could I not wish her happy birthday. I told her they I didn’t think we were friends anymore, and they I’m still hurt over what they said to me, and the fact that they wouldn’t apologize for hurting me.  I did this in a few calm sentences. She proceeded to send back four or five angry insulting paragraphs, saying how they “always supported me” and that I was “selfish” because she was worried about me all semester, among other things. I didn’t respond and that was the end. 

Through college I’ve made amazing friends, we have so much in common and they love and support me no matter what in contrast to my highschool friends. 

THOUGHTS: 
Being back home, stuck in isolation, has me wondering if I made the right choice. Maybe I should give them another chance? Maybe I was seriously in the wrong for not spending more time with them and I should be begging for their friendship? Is it worth getting into all of this again just to get told to fuck off? I feel left out not having best friends to come home to from college. We did have a great friendship for a long time, I had fun with them and it’s sad to give all of those memories up.

TL;DR:
I started spending a lot of time with my boyfriend before college causing a fight with my friends that left me emotionally damaged and going to therapy. They refused to apologize. Now i’m having second thoughts.",10Apr2020,1
88,"I’m 22 years old and I’ve wanted to leave home for as long as I can remember, but there’s always been a reason for me to stay. Then in September, my dad got diagnosed with lung cancer. I was his caregiver for several months and took him to all of his chemo sessions. On February 13, he was given 3-6 months. Then he passed 12 days later.

My dad was my reason for doing anything in my life. He’s the only family I had here. And my last blood relative who I was close with. (For reference, I was raised by my grandparents. My dad is actually my grandpa. No relationship with my birth parents and a terrible relationship with the remainder of the family.)

Anyway, these last few months have been pretty traumatizing for me and the only thing getting me through it is the thought that I can get out of here.

I live in Missouri now and was raised between here and rural Texas, but have always wanted to live in a major city. I’ve traveled quite a bit in the US and there’s just something about all of them that I love so much. The thought of moving somewhere where I know no one is scary to a lot of people but it’s always excited me. I see it as finally getting a fresh start.

I know cost of living makes a difference and unfortunately I don’t have a degree. I’ve been a legal assistant for about a year now and am hoping to stay in my current position for at least another year in order to have experience on my resume for when I want to move.

Right now, I’m considering Chicago and LA, but I’m open to any suggestions. I love visiting NYC but it’s just so expensive and seems so unrealistic that I’ve kind of ruled it out.

Chicago

Pros: I have family about 6 hours away (who I’m actually close with). Reasonable cost of living especially for it’s size. I found people to be friendly the times I’ve visited. 

Cons: Weather. 

LA

Pros: I’ve met some really great people here and have a great time when I visit. The beach. The overall vibe/lifestyle. The weather. Endless things to do. Countless options for entertainment. Scenic.

Cons: Traffic. Cost of living. 

I’d appreciate any opinions at all!",10Apr2020,1
89,"F21, my first attempt at college I had a seizure the day before moving in, and another one a month out. Then I got diagnosed with epilepsy and withdrew. Back then I still went as undecided and didn’t have enough time to figure out what I wanted either.

Im now 21, and working at my boyfriends cafe, and I have a feeling we aren’t going to be working out. I’ve spent 3 years so invested in being helpful for him (waitressing, bartending, baking, barista-ing, dealing with people and problems,etc) that I’m now realizing.... what do i want? If we don’t work out, I have nothing. My names not on the business, but I’ve pulled a huge load of work... I don’t feel fulfilled. 

I can’t drive either because of the epilepsy. Also, literally nothing seems interesting to me. If you put a gun to my head and asked what I sparks interest in me... I still wouldn’t have an answer.

93,"I am unsure what to do about this situation. I'm a 26 year old woman who has always wanted kids. Not soon because I want to get myself together first. The only reason is that, whenever I think of that, I get sad with all that comes with it. My parents' marriage was a disaster as well as their way of raising me. I've been hurt by men in the past, from cheating to simple rejections, which of course we all experience. There was no feeling of comfort or security in any of my relationships. Therapy didn't help me with this issue like it did with other ones I had. I'm currently in an amazing relationship that started off kind of rocky and there was some dishonesty involved right at the beginning. Just like everyone else on this plant, I feel like he will do something sooner or later. I feel like almost any man will, from cheating to just leaving. And then I would have to deal with someone who I'd love too much and who reminds me of the father, and who would need to have a connection with their father forever, making it impossible for me to get over it. I realize how problematic this sounds which creates this conflict in my head, I fear the heartbreak I'd experience as well as the heartbreak my child would experience if I'm not the mother it needs, since I've gone through that as a kid. Due to this I was even thinking of adoption even though having my biological kid is what I truly want, but that also becomes a problem as I'd be doing it for selfish reasons and could hurt the child too.

94,"(M20) Alright well.... Of course this is about a girl, I've known this girl since the 7th grade and we were friends until she randomly disappeared, later found out she was homeschooled all of highschool, back then I didn't have much of a crush on her or even ever thought of her in that way, but then in what seemed like fate I bumped into her while picking up my siblings up from school. We exchanged a confused and surprised look and I'm assuming we both remembered that we used to talk over KiK so when I got home I redownloaded the app and so did she and thats when this whole rollercoaster began. One thing led to another and I even made a Snapchat to talk to her because she didn't like the messaging app, we were hitting it off and that's when I fell in love. She wasn't like any other girls I had ever met, she was kind, she was loving, goofy, funny, and most importantly actually cared about me. I believe that emotionally I'm a strong person but in my efforts to hide my emotions she saw right though it, and what she told me pretty much cemented my feelings for her, she told me that ""we all get days when we are sad so let's be sad together"". Since that day I had become so enthralled by her that I needed to confess my feelings, but me waiting for the best opportunity was in the end my downfall. We had been talking for about 6 months at this point and in August we both made a plan for me to go and visit her at her school since, because of her dad, the house was off limits. I went and for the first time in my life i was speechless, she literally took my breath away but it was only the first time I'm visiting so I decided not to ask. I visited her one other time before the third time where I brought her food and also I had psyched myself up to finally tell her how I felt. It didn't go my way, her friends essentially cock blocked me because they never left and in the 2 seconds that I finally got her alone she told me that she could walk me to the parking lot because she has someone she had to talk to. This someone popped out of nowhere and caused a preemptive goodbye. I made plans to go and visit her the following week but when an employee at my job quit I ended up getting swamped with work to the point where there were days where I didn't even get the chance to say hi to her on Snapchat. Worst of all the time frame in which I was running around so busy, fits around the time where the guy that I left her with that fateful day, took her from me. Worst of all I had found out during a bathroom break on a really busy day so I had no time to process my feelings and just had to swallow them and keep going. Two hours later of crying and driving up and down the Malibu mountains at 2am I went home. Fast forward to the new year, me and couple of friends rent a cabin in big bear to get drunk in to celebrate me turning 20. Waking up the next day and I send her a lengthy well written text message confessing my feelings and everything that she means to me, needless to say she hasn't texted me back nor contacted me on any other platform. Till this day I've yet to get over her and have reoccurring dreams of the what if. The feeling of complete and utter regret has been on my back for almost 5 months with no sign of going away I try to tell myself to stop thinking about her but nothing seems to work. So if anyone has any advice it will be much appreciated.",10Apr2020,1
95,"Hi! Before, I start, I would just like to make it clear that I know no one knows someones intentions unless you ask. I just wanted to get an idea of what you guys think.

We've been friends for over 2 years. I met him my freshman year of college (I'm currently a junior) and it was clear he was interested in me from the beginning. Long story short, we talked for awhile, eventually kissed (thats the furthest we've gone) and I eventually asked him what his intentions were. He said he didn't want a relationship at the time and we left off on good terms and stayed as good friends. Sophomore year came along and we still stayed as friends and he would ask to hang out here and there but we never did anything physical or anything.

Summer entering this school year, things changed completely. We began to talk a lot through Snap, he would tag me on things on Facebook. Immediately when classes started in August, he asked me to hang out which then became a consistent thing throughout the year. From August to March, he did a lot of things for me such as: asked to hangout a lot more often, always pay for my coffee several times, always try to hold my hand when we hung out, bought me wine, cooked for me (even bought me a steak because I specifically asked for one), asked to hang out in the city and Facetime over winter break. We were at two parties together this year and he stayed by my side the whole time which was unusual because the past two years he would be hooking up with other girls. At one of those parties, I was dancing close with another guy and I knew he got jealous but just didn't say anything. Anyways, he also remembered my birthday and bought me a bottle of wine after I jokingly asked for one. At my party, I got really drunk and was apparently flirting with his friends and one of his friends the next day told me he looked stressed when I did that.

Fast forward to March, our school required all of us to leave because of COVID19. The day before we all left, he asked to hangout with me because he said ""this might be the last time I see your face."" We get coffee, he pays and holds my hand. Eventually, we go back to my room and we talk for a bit. Eventually, he asks if I wanted him to kiss me and I say no. He asks why and I say I'm not good at this physical stuff (I really have no experience) and he ensures me its fine. I say I'm only comfortable with just the cheek and he just kisses me on the cheek and kind of just makes out with my neck. We then cuddle for 2 hours. Later that same night, I go to the bar with friends and I get a text from him saying he's coming too. I dance with my guy friends and then later, I see him hooking up with another girl. I then got kind of pissed so I find another guy where I eventually sit on his lap and I knew he saw it.

I'm confused: did he just put in all this effort throughout this year just to hook up with me? Or did he want an actual relationship with me? It's weird cause ever since freshman year we would keep in contact through some sort of social media, but now we haven't talked at all since the quarantine (like 4ish weeks).",10Apr2020,1
96,"For the last couple weeks my sleep pattern has turned into something terrible. I only get tired at around 11am, fall asleep at that time because it’s too hard to stay awake, and then I wake up at about 5-7pm. It’s exhausted me and I can’t break it.

103,"My parents (mid 40s) are generally anxious about my (19F) and my younger brothers’ safety. That’s normal for parents. But then, most parents know how to handle their fear and let their children grow. That’s not the case here. 

The biggest way in which my parents deal with this is that they track our phones (on top of that we also have to text them every time we leave/get to a new place). They know at all times where we are. I’ve brought up multiple, multiple times that I don’t like it and that they don’t really have the right to do it because I’m legally an adult. For all of my teen years I’ve heard that we’d discuss this when I turned 18, and when I turned 18 and tried to discuss it I was basically answered something along the lines of “our house our rules”. 

Now I honestly haven’t done anything that would make them not trust me. I won’t get into details because this post will probably be long enough but I’ve literally never done anything to upset them.  

The thing is, I don’t know how to properly express what disturbs me so much about being tracked at all times. It simply does. I feel like my mother might as well have a television crew broadcasting live what I’m doing directly to her phone. I just feel so watched, even though she just knows my location. 

For example, say I’m on my way to uni. I swear to god, 4 times out of 5, I will get a text from my mom right as I’ve entered the building that says “are you there?”. She knows I just got there and I feel like she wants me to feel guilty about “forgetting” to send her the text. 

It’s like she’s taking away any freedom or spontaneity I might have. When I try to explain this, I get hit with the classic “the only explanation is that you have something to hide”, or even worse, I get guilt tripped by mother who says I have no regards for her anxiety and what she must feel when I don’t answer the phone quickly enough. 

That’s the basic situation. However, it’s affecting me more than it should. It’s like they are stealing what should be the best years of my life. My mother tells me stories about how she met my dad, how she made friends, and overall fun stories from she was around my age. I don’t want to assume anything, but I have a feeling my mom never texted my grandma to ask her for approval about shoplifting with her new boyfriend. I digress. 

Interestingly, my mom will often ask me about relationships and will genuinely wait for me to answer like she doesn’t know my every move. I’ve never been in a relationship. Maybe I technically could but this whole thing is just not working out for me, it’s not my personality to tell my parents about my feelings. I just can’t. I feel judged, they pressure me into finding someone of the same religious background (Im not religious at all, I don’t believe in god so they keep saying they must have made a mistake in their education. It’s like everything is about them) when I can barely meet new people as I rarely get out of the house. 

To give you an idea, the last time I saw my friends was in January. The time before that was October. 50% of the time when I ask to go out they find an excuse. We live a little far from the city so I sort of rely on them for transportation. I’m not allowed to take the subway at night, so I can’t go and come back by myself. 

This is already very long. I don’t know if this is clear, if I’ve included everything I should but I hope so. I can give more details if that’s needed. 

What I’m asking for is any type of advice that could help me improve this situation. I’m tired of feeling this alone. I want to be in a relationship. I want to have basic freedom to get out of my house and to talk to whoever I please without feeling like my mom is always next to me. I’m already feeling late enough in life and don’t want to lose any more time.

109,"Hey all. I’ve been thinking lately about my current situation with women and how I pursue. 
Basically I believe that I’m decent with women and am in recent months becoming much better overall. If I can get any interest then I am usually good at progressing it. Graduating from college was a big step for me in terms of reading, talking, and understanding people. Never really had a girlfriend and have trouble letting people in. I can get laid but it’s never with anyone I want to be with minus 3-4 people. Standards must always drop for physical intimacy. I prefer something real nowadays but meeting people and actually bringing it to mean anything is always slim for me. People flake. 

I wonder if I’m lagging behind. I want a true relationship and as much as I believe i am ready, my standards get in the way. I’m in a new town and surrounded by younger college aged women but wonder if that would be a good choice for partners. Not really sure why I’m even posting but my biggest dilemma right now is the fact I have a woman who wants to sleep with me but I have zero interest. She knows it’s casual. Considerably below standards. Part of me believes I should do it for my sanity and health of maintaining physical contact, and the other side of me believe I should now start to pass and stick to my standards. This I know would be a longer and potentially more lonely path. We both know it’s just physical but I don’t want her to catch feelings and i know I won’t and don’t really want more than physical. 
Interest in tinder, and other apps right now are not high and I’m worried that’s a bad thing, my “drive” “motivation” isn’t the same as it used to be. It’s hard to meet people where I am right now but that’s what I should focus on.",10Apr2020,1

so the city I live in is under a stay at home order due to covid -19. I recently moved in with someone and everything is great. We’re both young and have a lot in common.  Big problem is,  she won’t  self isolate . She has multiple people in and out of the house, she goes in and out of the house to see people. 

I’ve asked her to try to do her best and stay home and not have friends over but she’s just thinks that everyone she knows is safe and not sick bc no one has temperatures or coughs. 

I’ve made it pretty apparent that she shouldn’t have people over and she responds with “I’ll keep them in my room” I try to explain that sickness will still travel from her to me through out the house and on going time. 

Does anyone have any advice for getting this to improve?

My high school friends keep telling me they’re here for me and I can talk to them whenever which I appreciate cause they knew my mental state was not healthy at the end of high school. I used to go to them to talk about my issues, but now even when they offer, I’m hesitant because I feel like they’ve moved on to talk about their issues with new people and here I am as a loser wanting to talk to them about my issues. I’m not close enough with my two college friends to talk about my issues because I don’t want to seem like a depressing ass person. 

I don’t want to drop my high school friends, but we’ve been growing distant.

**WARNING: Wall of text. Like really long. 

TLDR: 
I(M22) am a college drop-out art student that wants to transfer to engr. ME/EE. Parents want me to be BS-Nurse/MT. Any compromise between medicine and engineering? Or should I just continue my art degree?**

-----
I came from a family where we're not that poor but also not that rich. My mom's occupation is a phycisian. She and her mother along with my aunt, provides for our daily and school expenses. My father lives in the US and currently works as a hospital caregiver. He can't provide for us. Don't ask why because I don't understand either.

Before anyone says it yes I know I'm retarded. I should've researched more before picking a bachelor's degree to pursue. I was not a very bright Individual when I was 16. 

When I was in highschool, I obsessed creating flash game assets. I would practice vector art and animation on a pirated copy of macromedia flash day-in-day-out. Adventurequest was the BOMB back then. It catapuled me into the direction of what I wanted to be when I grow up. A graphic artist. And as my parents saw my passion for it, they supported me. Now comes college. 

I proceeded to choose a Multimedia Arts bachelor's degree specializing in Graphic Design. At first I thought it was more akin to game design though more emphasis on making game assets, concept arts and the likes. But as I progress towards my 3rd year little did I know it was more focused on ADVERTISING and MARKETING. I was at that point where it's too late to change degrees. It was somewhat passable/under the same field so I just went with it. I thought to myself that I'm already this far ahead, I should just suck it up and finish it. But after 5 years of failing subjects left and right dodging different marketing, business, and advert classes, I've finally called it quits and stopped. In those years I've grown to hate and loathe my degree. I felt my passion and drive for art slowly die down. I hated the school but I hated myself more so.

Fast forward to present. After self-isolating and contemplating with life in my room since December. I thought of starting anew and talked to my parents about it. I came to understand how really blessed I am for having supportive parents.

We talked about what I should do and how do I proceed in life. My parents proposed that I should re-study but under a medical degree, BS-MedTech or BS-Nursing, more in-line with their occupations. Its not something I'm against with but its also not something I would enjoy doing. So I counter-proposed, and I suggested that I wanted to go for an engineering degree (ME/EE). I've always had a knack for math during highschool and considered CS as a secondary choice. In fact during my latter parts in art school, 2nd - 3rd year, I've become more inclined with my mathematics, coding and sciences classes as oppose to my other classes. On one other note I would say that my fascination in electronics bloomed as I became more addicted with r/mkb, console modding, and pc building. Yes, I know that that doesn't even scratch the surface of what ME/CE really is. Nevertheless, it sparked something similar I've long lost felt. A drive.

This time though they were against it. I explained to my mom that If I were to do something for the rest of my life, I wanted to have a job that makes me happy in doing it regardless if it pays or not. She expressed to me that she wholeheartedly understands how I feel.--

*(And It's true, my grandfather forced my mom to become a doctor. So when it was our time, she let us pick what we wanted instead. In the end though she never regretted being a doctor.)*

-- but that's just not how life works. She thinks that if I were to be an ME/EE, I can't gurantee myself a stable life like hers, if I were to settle down and have family of my own. After a long brief time, she exclaimed *""In the end it would still be up to you. It's your life and I would still support you in whatever you pick.""*

I was happy for that but after hearing it, I could feel the sadness in her voice. Even when I was in art school she had doubts for my future and she's right. Truthfully I don't want to be a burden from them anymore. I'm at that age (M-22) where I should've already been working. I feel like I've already wasted alot of time and money in art school. So in the end I just went with it and agreed with her.

--
So now comes new opportunity. My dad has finally petitioned my litter sister and I to live with him in the US. It was supposed to be this year but due to COVID-19, it might be moved next year. The situation was I would live and work there along with my father during school vacations and I would be studying here in the Philippines with my mom. 

I wanted to become financially independent while helping my dad pay for bills and accumulate enough savings to pay for my tuition (if I can). The problem is I've never finished my bachelor degree in art school and no experience elsewhere. So before that I want get a short course here in the Philippines on [Consumer Electronics Servicing NC-II](https://www.courses.com.ph/consumer-electronics-servicing-nc-ii-tesda-course-philippines/) then work as a part-time repair technician there (I'm trying to coy them into letting me do little bit of electrical engineering) but I might not be able to start my BS-N/BS-MT if that happens. Plus I don't know if it can land me a job out there because here its commonly a lower class job, as far as I'm aware, but I'm willing to take the risk. After explaining that to my parents they were against it, especially my father, as it was far removed from what I was supposed to be studying and that it would be pointless. I don't know if I can force myself to study something I don't want to anymore.

As for jobs in the US should I work at a fastfood joint for part-time? I feel like I could do more with what I learn in art school.

BTW they are against me studying im the US because of student loans.

Am I being picky when I shouldn't be? Should I just accept what my parents want and move on?

I wouldn’t say I’m a great student because I tend to be lazy and procrastinate and basically want do the minimum i need to succeed at a specific task, but I do take a fair amount of AP classes.

Basically what I’m trying to say is that my mental calendar usually works pretty well.

Except recently important things will slip my mind completely. For example, I’m trying to run for president of a Society, so I had a scheduled zoom interview at 4. This morning, I woke up knowing I had the meeting at 4. I even pulled up the link in safari in advance and left to do other things for a couple hours...and then completely forgot.

-Laziness. I put less and less effort as the year progresses. This has never affected anything besides like school though.

 Two years ago my dad died in front of me and 6 months ago my best friend of 17 years (im 22) committed suicide and none of this things have ever bothered me in any shape or form and yet somehow  i do care for my mom and two sisters but sometimes just feelings things its really hard.But someway somehow im able in certain situations to get ""strong"" feelings about something. Sometimes i just dont care which i know its a ducked up thing to say.

 I do feel things but kinda when the emotion wants to come out, or the wrong emotion to a certain situation or in a low frequency. The lack of empathy is really there, the lying, the manipulation when i really want something. The fact of going to a therapist bores me but recently ive been wanting to go to one more because of the curiosity and less because i worry or want to get better, i really dont care about that . I dont feel like hurting people physically and i find it wrong even though i can imagine me doing it. I feel like im very smart but im so much ducking lazy to gor for something and study also because i loose interest of things and sometimes people really fast. And yet i try to always be nice even though i dont care or feel really small things over the person because i belive every one deserves to be or feel happy. Happiness is another confusion in my head. 

The last time i remember felling happy was when i was untill my 14 years of live, sice then i do not feel sad or depressed, i just havent felt the actuall felling of happiness and it doesnt bother me at all. I enjoy life, enjoy friends but the moments i should be felling something strong on in some specific way, i just dont. The emotions or feelings i really can tell and feel is nostalgia, anger, fear and a some anxiety. These or the things i have no problem with but only about my self. When people get mad at me i tend to do something to try make them normal again, not because i care but because i like to have o good relationship with the people im around (less stress, less problems, less things to worry about).

141,"I'm at the end of my rope looking for suggestions, because it feels as though all logic has left this household. Tldr at bottom. 

Precursor info- 
I'm (F 20) live w/ my grandparents (76+), while I'm in college. My cousin, aka my grandparents' great granddaughter (F 24), is a heroin addict. 

Initial problem-
She showed up (to our house) after getting out of jail a week or so ago. We hadn't seen her in almost a year. My grandma told her she could stay here, until she gets things figured out. Well, she overdosed that first day she was here. Cops, paramedics, Narcan, the whole nine yards. She left with paramedics, survived (obviously). My grandpa was traumatized, he has dementia, didn't  really know what was happening. Gma advised her that she could no longer live here &amp; do drugs. Fine okay, no more cousin she has to go elsewhere.  

Intermission -
After she leaves, we're preparing to quarentine ourselves. A stay at home order is in place, we're getting ready to buckle down. Ordered groceries and ready to be at home for the next 2-3 weeks while the virus hits it's peak. I'm not seeing my bf, no one is leaving. 


New Problem &amp; Dilemma-
Today, day 5 of our quarentine. Cousin notifies my gma &amp; uncle (who also lives here) that her car is broke down. She can't go anywhere, is sleeping in her car, etc. They give in and LET HER BACK IN THE HOUSE! This is so frustrating/worrying to me, bc 1) both of my grandparents are 76+, with underlying health conditions (heart disease, dementia, diabetes, blood pressure issues). She is in &amp; out of the house constantly due to her addiction. It makes me fear for the safety/health of myself &amp; ESPECIALLY for the safety of my grandparents. 2) selfishly I feel like WTF, I've been avoiding loved ones. Working my ass off sanitizing groceries, spending a lot of money on groceries, making signs for our door, cleaning, and trying to drive home how important it is for us to be responsible &amp; minimize exposure. And then it all goes to shit. 

I get that she's an addict &amp; heroin addiction/being homeless is no easy road, but I'm more worried about my grandparents. I also understand that this is my grandparents house and they can be as careless as they want because this is their property &amp; their own health.

My anxiety about it all is absolutely through the roof. I installed a new lock on my bedroom door bc she has a history of stealing to support her addiction. Also spent a good 45+ minutes bawling like a small, emotionally disturbed child &amp; having an anxiety attack earlier. My poor bf listens to it all from afar via Snapchat/text. 

Basically, ANY advice or even coping strategies about it would be much appreciated.

143,"Recently I started receiving a large amount of email SPAM.  It has gotten so bad I'm getting at least 20 spam emails a day.  I've been pitched Gutter protection, Liberty Mutual Insurance, CBT and hemp products, ADT Alarm systems, Protective Masks, Zippy Loans and more. 

Since I can't go out, I have time on my hands so I spent some time doing research.  All of these emails have return addresses such as:

custom.medical.group@filteredenergy.com  

planet.pure.cbd.oil@newestadvances.com

zippy.loan@eslplatform.com

adt.authorized.premier.provider@evolvedskyblock.com

Now here is where it gets a bit interesting.  No matter the email address, for every single domain I checked the whois information was registered at [NAMECHEAP.COM](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/whois/).  But the commonality does not stop there.  

While there is no name attached to any of the domain registrants, they all seem to have the same postal address of  2885 Sanford Ave SW , Grandville, MI. 49418.  This is also the same address which appears at the bottom of the emails as the companies' address.  Sadly, that address is a disreputable mail drop.  A Google search of that address shows numerous BBB complaints from that address.  

However, each of these dubious domains has a phone number attached.  When I google searched the phone number I was able to identify an individual with that number.  The phone number starts with the Grandville, MI area code of 616 and appears in multiple searches which makes me fairly confident I've identified the individual responsible for all the SPAM.  So what do I do now?  Can the FBI do anything?  Any other Federal Agency applicable?  Can Namecheap shut them down?  Perhaps I should dox them and give this guy a taste of his own medicine?  What are your thoughts?",10Apr2020,1

146,"good songs for a long lost love

i need songs that are about lost love/ missing an ex/ missing your first love/ young love. i’m super into chill frank ocean type music and i love old 70s music but of course i’m open to the soppy piano shit because i’m tryna CRY. if u wanna know more context and the story there it is


the first guy i ever fell in love with a long time ago was my best friend since middle school. we started dating literally in 7th grade and he was my first kiss all that shit. we had a stupid middle school relationship, but because of our close friendship and both of our unhealthy family dynamics, it ended up running deep. it lasted years of my life as an on and off thing or friends with benefits or a relationship and whatnot. we were both equally unstable and not ready for a relationship. we both had parents with shitty marriages that came out hardcore when we tried to love eachother. we both were fake charismatic “popular people” and related on our deeper brokenness. i loved him for years stronger and more than i have anyone else. eventually, we broke it off because of the way we mirrored eachother, and the toxicity that come from it. agter that i had a different boyfriend for a year and a half, and it was a very nice relationship, but things got bad and we broke up. when he found out abt our relationship he told me that he loved me and regretted losing me. i chose the other relationship instead of going over the same shit. when the relationship ended, a while later of course my first love invited me over, yk yk yk. i told him i had always had feelings for him and been drawn to him like no one else and that we knew eachother so well and i always felt wed end up together. he expressed mutual feelings and his love for me but that he was afraid of this and was still stupid and immature. we didn’t speak much after that. that was last june. in the later summer, he got a beautiful, athletic, funny girlfriend who looks INCREDIBLE. i congratulated him in october and we updated eachother on our lives. we didn’t talk since then until a week ago he texted me with an old picture, saying he missed me. it brought all of these feelings up as we reminisced but stayed civil. i still love him dearly and don’t want to get in the way of his relationship now, but i have a gut feeling our crosses will pass again in the future.",10Apr2020,1
147," 

I want to know how I can stop rushing through things I should be enjoying.

Whenever I am watching a show, reading a book, or even playing a video game. I am rushing to finish it. It sometimes feels like I'm rushing so that I can start something new but it gets to the point that I'm hardly paying attention to what I'm supposed to be enjoying. I just keep glancing at the clock and realizing there is not enough time in the day today to finish this book/show/game.

Additionally, I notice I do this when I feel behind in my work. Even if I want to have a genuine conversation with someone I will rush to say bye so I can get back to my work.

I don't know if this is a trait I can change but I would like to try because it is ruining my enjoyment of these things.

I should mention I just started meditating about a week ago as I believe that will help and I found a headspace sale for students. I would really appreciate any other advice.

It feels like the only thing I'm not rushing through is my senior design project because it feels impossible during this online class-era. I should note I felt this way before my senior design class but it definitely didn't help.",10Apr2020,1
148,"I have a foreign name. The first part can be pronounced as either ""E"" or ""Eye"". I personally think that ""E"" makes my name sound really pretty, and ""Eye"" makes my name sound atrocious. Coincidently, I've been going by the ""Eye"" version of my name my whole life.

Every time someone new tries to pronounce my name, they always pronounce it with an ""E"". Other people always correct them, and I've just gone with it. 

A few years ago, I learned that my parents had originally pronounced my name with an ""E"", but when I was learning to speak I pronounced it with an ""Eye"" and they just changed the way they pronounced it. So I basically gave myself a name that I absolutely hate.

I always wanted to change my name when I was older, but I've heard that going through the process of changing your name sucks so I always just planned to keep my name because I'm used to that one anyway. I also considered going by my middle name, but I know at least 2 people who's first name is my middle name, and that'd just cause more confusion.

When I learned that I've been going my a nickname my whole life, I was so ready to change it. I told my friends about it and they said that they liked ""Eye"" better, so they were just gonna keep calling me ""Eye"".

And, in class, at the beginning of the year, when a teacher asks how to pronounce my name there's always gonna be someone I don't know who says it before I have a chance to, and I've never had the need to correct it. So basically, to the people I don't talk to, it's gonna sound like I randomly decided to give them an incorrect pronunciation of my name for no reason.

So basically I'm stuck with a name that I really hate. How do I change it?",10Apr2020,1

152,"I know this might come out as off or make me look like I have a attraction to my cousin living in the trailer next door, but I actually am considering waiting until marriage. Not specifically for religious reasons -seriously, as cute as it may sound, this ain't half of enough of good motivation to wait, I've seen that- but for the simple fact that I think my first intimacy time is very precious to me and I wouldn't want it to be with someone that is not the person I would like to spend my life with. 

I just find it hard to imagine committing myself 100% to someone having had past experiences. 

Now, what is really setting me off is the thought that, with that, I might be impossibly restricting myself. I mean, people in places like the US are even weirded out by the idea of not exploring your sexuality until marriage. 

The impression I have is that I would stick out like a sore thumb and end up alone.

153,"So as a bit of context, my mother was considering having a tenant when I left for college, because it would be the first time in a long time that she would be living completely alone, and also wanted some extra money. A friend of my mom's suggested her cousin, who was in a very bad living situation and looking for a place to stay. Her friend insisted that she was nice and easy to get along with, so my mother agreed. 

She did have a job at first as a taxi driver, but she got fired and never got a new job. So she stopped paying rent very early on. On top of that, she insists on leaving the back door unlocked and the light on, (even though she has a key to the front door and has a phone, and therefore a flashlight) even though there are burglaries in my neighborhood and my next door neighbor has had a break-in in the past. She also plays vulgar music very loudly in the house, which my mother has asked her to stop doing and she refuses. And she never cleans up after herself, and whenever my mom does it, she leaves sarcastic and condescending notes ""thanking"" her for it. 

I come home from college due to the coronavirus, and she now has a lock to prevent anyone from coming in the basement, so now we can't do laundry. She's still playing music very loud, which disrupts me in class. And she's so adamant on keeping the back door unlocked (btw, we also have an indoor cat, which she ""doesn't give a fuck about"") that she recently glued paper towels in the lock to prevent it from being bolted. 

My mom is trying to evict her, and has taped a letter from her attorney to her door (which she has blatantly ignored) to try and get in contact with her to get a settlement. At this point, her aim is to get a reaction out of my mom so she can call the police, as her kids stay regularly even though she doesn't have custody of either of them. So she regularly pulls stunts like the lock. My mom regularly updates her attorney whenever these incidents occur. 

The tenant insists my mom is the one at fault, says she's filed for domestic violence even though we have proved that she doesn't have one, says that she doesn't owe any money at all, etc. She also accuses my mom of threatening her kids, who my mom has never interacted with. 

She hasn't established legal residence, but we are so stressed and desperate to get her out. My mom is so stressed out her blood pressure has been spiking constantly and pulls all-nighters to make sure the door stays locked, and due to the coronavirus the courts in my town are closed until further notice. In general, I legitimately hate being home. I'm constantly scared, depressed, and anxious and can't do anything about it. If anyone has any advice, ranging from legal to emotional, I'm all ears. Because I'm reaching the point where I can't concentrate in any of my classes and are afraid to be in my own house. She hasn't explicitly threatened either of us, but she has such a temper I wouldn't be surprised if it gets to that point.",10Apr2020,1

158,"I consider myself very emotionally stable, i don't worry almost at all. Wasn't always this way, i learned to handle my emotional attachments better out of necessity. 

That said i am not exactly sure how to process ghosting by my father. I grew up with my mom, and i almost felt like a guest at his house with his family that i visited weekly-biweekly while growing up. I was accepted for a while, but as my road got more challenging and started angling downward and most importantly when i got depressed, he and his family basically decided they don't like me, and my visits became limited to holidays.

Felt like they were waiting for me to prove myself, and to be fair i was a burden, i truly failed to take responsibility, i sought their help and guidance but when it didn't work i was to blame. I didn't know how to fix myself nor was even sure i cared to, seemingly no one else did. 

I briefly rekindled the relationship with them when i moved countries like 1,5 years ago, even left a fair bit of change with them just to hold onto for me, that i never asked back. Can only contact them via email, and we basically send like up to 3-5 message a year, and i thought Coronavirus was a good reason to open up and share what i was up to. They basically never do, and i always feel responsible for not reaching out enough.

I suspected i will be judged. They can't help but see me for who i used to be, not the person they kind of liked, but the person they didn't, the useless depressed guy, who was not above lying to pretend to have a sense of normalcy and was pretty annoying to deal with. Just talked with people to feel good but nothing ever got done.

Now i don't like dwelling on the past, it's pointless you can't change it, if anything if you keep seeing yourself as the person you were yesterday than that anchor hold you back. 

The current situation is that i sent them a message like over a month ago, followed it up with another short one a week later, totally relaxed just sharing more stuff i am doing. Replying slowly is definitely not out of character for them, but doesn't seem to be the case this time. 

I found myself speculating what was the last straw, especially annoying because i am doing the best i ever did. Perhaps i should have messaged them later so my achievements are more impressive. Apparently it never even warranted them belittling or halfheartedly accepting my achievements and pointing out what i should do instead. Of course we had good times too, and i didn't hurt them intentionally, they simply seemingly wired to interpret the actions of others personally. Who i was, was far from ideal, but i wasn't acting like that to hurt them.

Realistically i don't think there is going to be a resolution to this, maybe his christmas reminder will tempt him to write a line or two, but i think realistically i should focus on making new friends.

I would have preferred direct and honest replies. I suppose i should be glad for what i had and accept our relationship for what it is, rather than what i wish it to be.",10Apr2020,1
159,"I haven't really been in the best place recently, even before all this Covid madness. I am about to graduate (well, was) from my senior year in highschool, and I think I know what I want to do with my life, which is to be an artist (animator), but every time I feel myself take a step forward, I feel I've taken 2 steps back, and im constantly wondering if this even is what I want to do with my life. 

I live in Tennessee, where there is a new program called the Tennessee promise, in which we are given 2 years free college tuition to any technical school we want, even some community colleges like ETSU, but the requirement is you have to choose one immediately after highschool to be eligible. I haven't been able to find any schools that would fit me, and on top of that, my parents are making me go straight to college after school. I have to find something, and each hour is all that much closer to me not knowing what to do. Then, all this quarantine nonsense comes, and I lose my part time job. Now I'm stuck at home with family who doesn't listen all day. 

My mother is in the medical field, my father an IT and they have some how turned into prison wardens over night. Ever since schools have closed 3 weeks ago, they've had us kids (me and my younger siblings) on a schedule that can't be deviated from each weekday from 8 to 3:30. I can't contact any of my friends during that time, and I'm a fairly diligent student, and usually get most of my stuff done each monday, the exception being one of my teachers who give us more on Wednesdays, but I get it done that day too. School was already my escape from home, but now I have none at all, and the limited social contact has not been helping, funny considering im fairly introverted. 

Im just looking for someone to talk to during these times. My parents argue a lot and are fairly loud about it, so I can't hardly get on discord calls with friends to talk to them, I can't vent to them out of not wanting to bug them or make it awkward for them, as they can't do anything either, and they can't give me any advice. I want to say all of this has me feeling depressed as I've had numerous times where I've had near total breakdowns in the past, heck, just last fall break while in Florida I had a day I broke down entirely for no reason one night. I don't want to say im depressed because I have days where some of my friends have called me optimistic to a point of annoying them, and some days I just can't help myself to talk the ears of people, I mean seriously, this is paragraph 4.

 I know this is all a lot to unpack, but I'm not sure what to do anymore. I can't tell my parents their fighting is bugging me, because they'll either get mad at me or won't care for more than 5 minutes, I can't talk to friends because I dont want to be the guy with the shitty home life (although they've probably heard enough), I want to stay strong for my siblings going through the same shit, but they both have anger issues so I can't really get that through to them, and I have so many things happening all at once, I haven't even really drawn anything in the past month until I had to for art class today. I'm not sure what to do anymore, its now 11:05 and I've been crying since 9:30, and I have a deadline of now to figure my shit out or have my teeth kicked in by life...

Yeah, any help that a kid without a job could get would be great, and that help would have to be able to be kept from my parents, because I don't want to do the whole ""Do we need to take you to a psych center???"" thing again. Again, friends are right out, and I have no in state family to go to either. I can't drive yet, so running away, as desperately as I want to, can't happen. I live in a semi-rural area, so no walking away either. None of my friends even live within 30 miles of me, and I'm kind of ""big boned"" so that won't be an option either.

161,"Hey everyone, I'll try to explain the problem as thoroughly as possible but because the the issue is with my half-brother there could be subconscious things ive long forgotten about that leave me with an aversion to him. 
I am a 22(m) and I currently live and take care of my childhood home. Im the youngest of 3 kids, one brother who i'll refer too as ""R"" and is 35, as well as a sister (31) who truthfully doesnt play a roll in the story. Ive lived in this house my entire life, my siblings were born in California and travelled around the world due to their dad being military eventually ending up in my hometown by the time my brother was 11. My brother moved out when he turned around 23 or 24. Growing up my only memories of my brother are being distant, aggressive, hot-headed, and a rampaging force roaming the house. He constantly assaulted my dad, threw golf clubs at cars, shattered old tvs, this was regular. He eventually got into drugs and ended up going to rehab. I have no real good memories with my brother, he was significantly older so there was never a real relationship. My parents eventually split up when I was 15, my mom moving out and my dad eventually remarrying and moving out leaving the property to me. Its a paid of land and mobile home, and when my parents split my father began buying my moms 50% of the property from her. My dad is the primary owner of the property and during the time between my mom leaving and my dad leaving the entire 2 acres got overgrown and incredibly dilapidated. I was left having to move, box and organize a 3 bedroom house worth of items and memories with no help whatsoever from my family members. Garbage and old couches littered the yard and I was a freshly new 18 year old. Over the years ive done my best to better the space and it looks better than it ever has. Im incredibly proud of myself for it. The only contant ive had with R my teenage years was him asking me to do him several favors lile house sit for free and help him sell at swap meets for $10 and I was rarely paid. He never offered to help with my situation even though he was well aware of it. R previously lived next door to an office I worked in and siphoned electricity from our electric outlets and I was accused of assisting him. That same period he requested I let him park 2 of his wrecked vehicles in my backyard since the city was threatening to tow them. He parks his wrecked jeep and truck in the middle of my front driveway while I was at work and refused to move them. Told me they would be gone in 6 months. They've been here for 3 years and not a mention of apology. Last september he bought a giant bus he was planning to renovate and eventually live in and asked if he could park it in the backyard to work on it promising to be done by Christmas. He needed to move it having just gotten into a domestic argument with his girlfriend and was threatened by the police. He has since moved into the bus permanently, no asking if it was acceptable or if me and my girlfriend were comfortable with it. Broke into my old shop and siphoned electricity after I told him he couldnt be able too and needed a generator. Im barely making it month to month and he has given me no money for the electric bill while he leaves his lights on and uses power tools to work on the bus. Its well past Christmas and the bus is still there. He allows his dog to wander unmonitered and it craps on my front lawn and harasses my 2 month old puppy. I recently approached him asking him if he could be gone by June because we were planning some big projects come summer and he flipped out. Accused me of never doing any work and allowing the property to fall into disarray even though its monumentally better than I was given it. He hasnt seen it in 11 years after all. Telling me I need his help and that hes the only reason im not getting broken into. Things escalated and we started yelling at eachother, I told him he needs to hurry up and leave the property, as I started to walk away he chased after me, tripping, getting up and continued to follow me obviously attempting to fight me, calling me a pussy all the while. I threatened to call the police and went inside to my girlfriend. He texts me and my mom in a group chat telling us both how furious he is and says he will never forget this as long as he lives. At this point I obviously dont feel comfortable with someone who attempted to assault me living on my property. He texts me saying he will move the vehicles in the front yard, as well as the bus in 2 weeks. Its been 2 months since then, I have had little communication with him due to covid and all. Random trash littered around his bus as well as piles of debris and junk. I photographed everything just for proof as well as saved his messages saying hed be out in 2 weeks. Last week I noticed R out back with a known neighborhood tweeker. I dont know this guy but apparently R met him growing up and the guys using a weedwaker just on some random brush. My problem here is last I checked R was supposed to be gone a month and a half ago and here he is inviting random known theifs onto my property without my knowledge. After trying to assault me he never apologized, addressed it, and he greeted me as if everything was normal. I told him he had no right to invite someone onto my property and he retorted saying that he grew up in this house and its just as much his as it is mine. He hasnt paid a single bill, helped fix a single thing since hes been staying here, and has treated me with no respect. I got my father involved and R started saying he should be able to move the bus in a week but might not because of all the covid closures. He is homeless and currently living in my backyard, ive been beyond patient and have been met with nothing but rudeness and violence. I dont know what to do. My names on bills if that matters at all, but Im incredibly tempted to call the police. I feel so incredibly unsafe for both my girlfriend and I while hes here and the thought of him being here for multiple more months is mind boggling. Please any advice would be helpful. Nothing about his behavior or the situation has changed either of our past interactions. Thank you.",10Apr2020,1
162,"Confusing title aside, I am likely fucked. I am very likely fucked with no way out of this. So I've come here. There's gonna be a lot of details because even the most minor pieces shape this puzzle. **Buckle up because this is a long story!**

**Context:**

I'm M16 and my girlfriend is F15. We started dating the night we were quarantined so last time we saw each other in real life, we weren't even dating. We've been dating for over 3 weeks now and we love each other very much. But something came between us; her friend who I will call 'Sio'.

**Sio:**

Sio was one of the first people who told me that my girlfriend (back when she wasn't) had a huge crush on me. Thanks to her and a few others, we are dating. After that, I had few interactions with Sio. One time she sent me a meme, one time I guessed a riddle from her Snapchat story, and there was one time where she posted that her laptop wasn't working. She had enough details for me, a somewhat tech-savvy guy, to get her laptop working. She didn't even thank me for this when it did start working. One time she said she was in the hospital from her Snap story. I asked if it was corona and she said it was a suicide attempt. I obviously tried to jump in with the ""whatever you're going through isn't worth your life and I hope everything gets better"". Sio didn't respond to that. Though every now and then I'd see she screenshotted one of my stories - usually with offensive memes. One day I made a meme about the fact that you can only buy a ""There are more than 2 genders"" t shirt in men and women sizes. It had Donald Trump shuffling (who I don't really even support much) just for the meme. Sio, upon seeing this, posted on her story that if you're homophobic, transphobic, pro-life, Trump supporter, or a ""bootlicker"", then you needed to unadd her.

Instead of ignoring that, my dumb ass asked these questions; ""I don't support Trump but I support him more than the communist and the dying old grandpa with dementia. Also I'm not pro-life but I'm not pro-choice. Are you going to unadd me?"". No response. And then she posted another story about political shit and removing people and I asked her ""Listen, I don't mean to be rude or whatever but are you really removing people just because of fundamental differences? That's a little biggoted. Can't we all  just get along despite our views?"". She said no, bye, and unadded me.

I learned upon seeing pictures later that she has colored hair, glasses, claims to have 5 wives, and is basically a total SJW. And then her screenshotting my offensive memes in the past started feeling different. I just hoped she didn't do anything crazy with those screenshots like save them into an archive to show to my girlfriend's parents. It sounds far-fetched but anxiety went places.

**Now:**

On Sunday morning, my girlfriend texted me saying that she might not be able to talk much that day because she had a headache and was gonna be busy. I told her I hoped everything got better and wished her a good day.... and then she didn't text for the rest of the day. I didn't think much of it. Then I didn't even get a text the next day. That was off. None of my messages were even opened until today at around 5:30 (it's currently 8). I got a Snap from her. She explained in it that her parents found out she was dating and they were furious and grounded her. The only reason she had her phone then was because her parents were out of the house.

I asked a lot of questions and here's what I got; her mom was particularly mad that she hid our relationship, her punishment was still being decided - like how long she was still being grounded for. My girlfriend doesn't know how her mom found out, but she suspects Sio because right up before this Sio said she hated me and hated the fact that we were dating. One red flag is her mom knew my name. 

**So basically:**

Sio has screenshots of my offensive memes and hates me over politics. If she's the one who told my girlfriend's mom, then she probably showed her those memes. In which case I would be absolutely fucked. Those memes pretty vile if I'm being honest. There would be little to no chance of her parents ever approving if they have seen those. Sio likely fabricated things if she's so far into politics that she doesn't like me. I was nothing but nice to her. I fixed her computer, I tried talking her out of suicide, and it had to be politics of all things. But the problem is my girlfriend and I aren't 100% sure that's it. I asked my girlfriend if I could just call her parents because that would be a great way to clear up things and... I guess prove myself. Her response was ""No, you guys aren't calling each other"". But I really want to. That would really work.

**The decision:**

I happen to have my girlfriend's mom's number from a screenshot and I, against my girlfriend's wishes, really want to call. So here are my options:

A. Let my girlfriend question her mom a little bit and bring me back results next time her parents leave the house. This would take a lot of time. My girlfriend already said she will question her mom about it and hasn't opened anything else since. This would not only take time but stress and anxiety over the days.

B. Call her parents anyway just to clear up things - dismiss those memes if they're brought up and just openly discuss things with them. I think they'll find that I am quite likeable (or at least I can present myself that way). This is what I want to do but my girlfriend doesn't want that at all. This could also go in the direction of ""YOU'RE OFFENSIVE, STAY AWAY FROM MY DAUGHTER"" and then hang up and block my number.

C. Shoot the parents a text. A call would be more genuine and it still goes against her wishes but honestly resolving everything with her parents seems more logical to me in every scenario. Maybe the text could be what I would say in option D;

D. What if I call them and say something along the lines of ""Hey, uh, I'm \_\_\_'s boyfriend and she didn't want me to tell you but like... she has been inactive on social media for a few days and this all happened right after her friend Sio tried to commit suicide so I'm kind of worried and I just wanna know if they're both okay and well. I'm open for questions as well"". I'd rather leave that as a voicemail. That seems like the better route for me because in option B, it would seem to imply that we found a way to communicate. With this option, I would come off as caring, open, honest, and there wouldn't be any indication of us recently communicating.

&amp;#x200B;

**I have no idea what I should do. Option D. is looking better but it still goes against my girlfriend's wishes - therefore kind of breaking trust. But I know it's better for us! Someone please help me out.**",10Apr2020,1

172,"So I moved from Norcal to SoCal a couple of months ago to work for company that my brother started (I was 20 when I moved). The agreement was that I would for him while I continued to go school, while I work for him till I graduate, then I decide what I want to do. I work from nine to five but since a lot of the job is remote, then I don't have to be all day the office. 

I like working here and all but I have gotten to the point where the work has bled into my school (im computer science). Today we got into an argument regarding the hours I work. He wanted me to work longer and basically said that it is my responsibility. I was pretty angry so preceded to ignore him and just continued working. However, then he continued ranting and got till the point where he called me out in front of the team and asked them to name everyones responsibility was (to put me in the spot). He does this to everyone whenever someone makes a mistake or something. (Sometimes he even makes different group chats with different people when he feels that he does not trust them). So then I just pretty much said that my hours were from 9 to 5, and the hours afterwards  are for school. 

So now im having second thoughts of whether I am being horrible person. I mean he is paying me. And with that money I am able to go to school. For work, I am in charge of coordinating campaigns, talking to the designers, clients and getting the team to work together. Before I got here the company had no calendars whatsoever. I implemented a system to helps us all work together. Productivity has increased. The content that we have been creating, I believe , is way better than ever. I just don't know if it is the right decision to quit.

175,"okay so i dated this guy for about 2 months, but we’ve known each other a couple months before then. some background info on us is that we met at a group for other kids with depression who just came out of the hospital, so at the time of meeting we were both in a bad place and he’s practically seen my best in worst sides. anyways a few months go by and we begin talking, but practically dating without the label.

 i was his first girlfriend, which kind of surprised me because he’s very attractive and has great humor. but he also has social anxiety and our therapist used to joke that “he has no game” because he’s only ever kissed at girl once. let’s call him jake. anyways the first month of our relationship was really good, and out of nowhere he got really distant. i would never spam him or anything, i’d always wait around for him, which i know isn’t good, and he’d blame his depression, which i could understand

i would always let him rant to me and always motivate him and constantly tell him that i’m proud of him because i knew how much that meant to him. but he  stayed quiet and didn’t really talk to anyone.

so my friend texted an old group chat with all of us from months ago and jake got pissed off and never responded to any of my texts, and we got in a little argument, so i assumed we were over. and honestly i felt relieved, because being with him just took so much emotional strength, having to deal with his dry replys, knowing our love was dead, and just his lack of motivation and depression. now he’s memes on his story like “damn, i’m really not loved” and another that says “guys out there have girlfriends out there stressing them out and restricting them for things lmao couldn’t be me.” and he captions that “if that ain’t mf true” 1. i never ever restricted him from anything, if anything he gave me restrictions 2. i never tried to stress him out ever, i would always support him with everything and let him take his time. 3. he knows how much i cared about him from the beginning to the end so yeah. i would text him being like “dude, cut the shit none of that’s true and stop being a pussy and posting things” but i KNOW he’d deny it and say something like “it’s not about you lmao” plus i really don’t want to text him. and it’s very tempting not to look at, just how can i ignore him and his selfishness?",10Apr2020,1
176,"My (23M) younger sister (15F) is so lazy. For reference, I’m 6’2 and 82kg (fairly fit) and she is 5’11 and 100kg. She’s got self esteem and body issues due to being very overweight. Being her older brother I try to get her to come for runs, bike rides, gym or do yoga with me but she never wants to. She spends all day on her laptop upstairs watching YouTube and doing Tiktoks (I guess typical teenage things these days). 

Parents give her everything she wants and she will get away with anything. I’m trying to help her understand that she has the power and ability to change things about her life (not being active, eating fast food all the time etc.)

Even though she feels like shit all the time because she hates her body, (she’s told me so) she doesn’t make any effort whatsoever to change things, even with my help. 

At this stage I’ve given up on trying to help and if she’s going to sit and sulk rather than make the effort to change things in her life, then that’s on her. I experienced depression when I was her age and still struggle with it today but I know what’s good for me and I was still being active and attempting to make positive changes in my life. 

I understand she’s young, but I think 15 is old enough to be able to do things for yourself. I don’t know if I should be harder on her, because I’ve tried to have these chats with her before but she just tells me to go away and doesn’t listen.

177,"This will sound silly and sad. 

I am ethnic. My mom is full one ethnicity and my dad is half. His other half is a culture that is of lighter complexion. My mom is of deeper skin tone. I do believe she grew up with a lot of self-hatred towards her own ethnicity and people of her own skin color and she isn’t aware of the effects of a harmful mentality. 

Growing up my mother always spoke down on her own ethnicity/skin tone and spoke highly of my dad’s ethnicity. 

I never realized how much of it drilled into my own way of thinking. I grew up being ashamed of my ethnicity and always claimed my dads other ‘half’ even though we were never close to his family. I hated my skintone, naturally curly hair, etc. etc. 

I moved for this “job” about 2 hours away from my parents. I say job in quotations because I now realize that my true intentions in moving here was to get closer to my dad’s people. A lot of people of his ethnicity populate this city. I see it as a way of my yearning of acceptance. Trying to be accepted by his people. 

It sounds soo silly typed out but I hope someone reading this will understand what I am talking about. 

I’ve been living out here for about two years now. Doing a lot of self reflection and I’ve realized that my deep insecurities of not loving WHO/WHAT I am has manifested in me moving to a new city in a way to find “love” and “validation”. I realize now that I have no place here. That I don’t need validation for anything and that I am enough. 

I know now I have no place in this city. I accomplished and found what I was looking for in the first place by moving out here but instead I found the answer within myself. Cliché, yes.

But now the only thing stopping me is money. I wouldn’t have a job if I move back. The job I have now is stable and the company I am working at is doing a good job of holding onto employees during this pandemic. Pays good but it’s a regular job (like you don’t need a degree to apply.)

I plan to go back to school so if I stay I would apply for a community college out here and work/school. If I move home I would try to find a job and eventually do the same, school/work. The difference is I would be with my family if I move back and if I stay here I would be by myself. 

Another note is that whenever I think of the reason why I moved here it makes me sad/ashamed for myself and makes me wish I never came out here.

Sounds very silly. But if you have any advice please let me know.",10Apr2020,1
178,"So I have a friend let’s call him Harrison, and he has a girlfriend we will call Harley.

I’ve known Harrison since freshman year of high school, for reference I’m now heading into my first year of college after taking a 1yr break after senior year. He went straight to college after high school.

He met Harley at the end of Junior year and they really hit it off, and I loved seeing them together, they were the dream couple. And I got to know Harley as time went on, but never really felt like I was falling for her.

However this year rolls around (fuck 2020 btw) and I’m having a rough day, so I post on my Insta for people to send me a meme or something to cheer me up.

Harley takes it a step further and asks me how I am, and I just felt like being honest, so I told her everything, and she was really understanding, and from that day forward (this was January), she and I have talked just about every day, texting back and forth, checking on each other. 

Idk why, I just really love talking to her, and I’m starting to have feelings. I don’t think she feels the same way, although she has told me that she’s paranoid about Harrison staying too anti social and not giving her any attention. 

I try to not initiate conversations, but she does, she even sends me voice messages and stuff, and we just have so much things in common but not to the point where it’s boring, she’s an interesting person and UGH ITS REALLY FUCKING WITH ME!

I knew she was insecure, I just hadn’t realized to what degree. I’ve picked up on that whenever we talk about our other girlfriends, she tends to say bad things about their bodies. Just recently I told her I wanted to get to know her boyfriend, me, who she considers her best friend and should trust, and she panicked. She told me she thought her boyfriend would start talking to me and prioritizing me over her and possibly fall in love with me! Gee. Her boyfriend said she’s like that with all girls he knows, some of which live in different states. How can I help her? It seems like reassuring her that I’m not a two faced 🏖 and that her boyfriend loves her is not helping at all.

I even encouraged her to talk to the school counselor and she didn’t, and recently I contacted the counselor to talk to her and as far as I know nothing has come of it.

That being said. Me (20m) and my brother(29m) has always had our differences. It was more of a one sided fight to be exact. He was always bigger than me so I tried as much as I can to avoid confrontation. Also, my father was not around (has multiple wives, long story). So my brother was the law in our house since he was the oldest.

To be quite honest I don't really hate him. I just don't like being around him since he a is a narcissistic self-centered victim-card bringer.

Well today I spoke up about something, I called the non emergency police because my old job posted on FB that they were opening up today (clothing store) and in my state, the executive order is essential only. I was worried about my former co-workers and the potential spread (probably because I have so many in my family who are immunocompromised and I'm town apart by anxiety by this pandemic). 
Well I saw that they were doing a curbside pickup and not opening the store but I know they don't have the right supplies to stay safe anyhow (manager once made an employee wipe up a customer's piss on carper with windex because that's all she would buy). So I checked with someone who works there and she was afraid to work but scared to say anything so I called the police. 

I was called back by the officer who went and instead of saying 'nothing we can do' OR 'curbside pickup is allowed' he proceeded to chastise me for wasting his time, saying that I had ulterior motives because I used to work there and further more should stop worrying about the health of the public because it was his job and not mine. 

I was shocked. I can understand him believing I had ulterior motives (which was for the safety of former co-workers) but to say that a public health check was a waste of time, I don't get. This is a pandemic. Fuck me for trying to slow the spread? I'm terrified!!

My girlfriend (18F) and I (18M) have been together for four months now. I know, it doesn’t seem like a long time but we clicked pretty quickly and have immense care and love for each other. Then suddenly, boom! Out of nowhere, her family is deciding to up and move to California. We are both devastated by this, because neither one of us wants to be in a long distance relationship.

Her family loves me and love me being with her, so they gave me the option of coming and living with them once they get settled in a few months. Her dad even offered me job opportunities, if I decide to go through with it. 

I don’t have much here except my minimum wage job and my aunt and cousins that I live with, however, I did plan on going to college here because my state offers plenty of helpful benefits. But leaving and moving in with her family seems like a big change. Coming from a family that moves a lot, I’ve really come to enjoy where I live now and I’m comfortable, I’ve really come to fear things changing. 

I really do love this girl and I know I’d be willing to give it a chance for her. However, I don’t know the first idea of what living with her family is like and I’ve only had a glimpse of what living with her is like (she’s stayed at my house for a couple weeks). 

I know I’m not down for a long distance relationship, so if I decide not to go- I’m leaving her. I sort of felt obligated to promise her I wouldn’t leave her no matter what though, so there’s that. 

So Reddit, what should I do? Stay where I’m at and leave her, after promising I wouldn’t leave her, or go with her and explore the opportunity.

It leaves me spiral,in and thinking so far into the future and I either wind up feeling like this new normal endless and my brief life on this planet has been cut off, or I wind up thinking about the things making me anxious when we finally get free like seeing my dad or my friends for the first time? I don’t even know why I’m anxious over the latter, I can’t hold onto a reasonable explanation for why I’m scared and yet fear is consuming me from all angles. 

The problem is that I keep letting myself get wrapped up in the future, but I don’t know how to live in the present. I don’t know if maybe it’s because of my ADHD, but I can’t do anything but stew unless I’m being distracted, and now with no car, no places to go, no friends to visit, and no coping mechanisms I can’t distract myself. I try art, gaming, focusing on school, writing, everything I can think of but it isn’t helping. I know that if I could just live Day by Day than I’d feel better. The endless void of the future won’t scare the hell outta me because I can take it one day at a time. 

But I have no idea how to do that.

I’ve researched those lists and articles that are supposed to help, but the advice always boils down to “distract yourself” (which isn’t helping) or “just do it” (which I obviously cannot). I need a concrete plan to get me out of this mindspace before things get worse because I’m already at my wits ends and as far as I can tell we’re nowhere near done with his quarantine.

How do I live day by day, when I don’t know how to stop spiraling into worrying about the future?",10Apr2020,1
197,"A little backstory to explain 

So about 8 or 9 years ago we adopted a kitten that we named Skippy and he was super nice and cool. About a year and a half ago we adopted an old cat (around 15 now) and named her Ginger. Skippy hated Ginger, since he had been the only cat ever since our other cat died when he was like 1. And it got better but not by a lot. Skippy would always hiss at her and swat at her but then he would stop after that, and Ginger would just sit there and take it, and eventually that only happened when they ate or every now and then. They still didn’t really like each other but it was better. This morning Skippy did his usual thing when he was eating breakfast where he swats and hisses, and this time Ginger just went off on him, chased him screamed at him and swatted at him. Now the two cats won’t go near each other without yelling and fighting. Right now we’re keeping skippy in my room and the plan is to switch daily who stays where. I want to know if this has happened to any of you guys, what you did, how it worked out, and if it hasn’t happened to you what do you think we should do?

And sorry for all the commas",10Apr2020,1
198,"They both have serious anger issues and cannot see anyone else’s perspective but their own. Naturally, that makes them very prone to fighting. With words and fists. I fear one day they’ll literally kill each other- my father tends to start and provoke my brother &amp; my brother cannot think and tends to provoke my dad by calling him old and saying he’ll beat the shit out of him. My mom has been trying to make them stop and talk it out for years but as of today she’s given up. My parents aren’t in a happy marriage so when my mom tries to reason solely with my dad that doesn’t really work either. 

To put this into perspective I’ll give you a rundown of the fight that happened today. My brother and dad both share a fish tank in the house for hobby. My brother recently bought $$$ fish again (the first time being when he stole my grandmothers credit card and bought some) and he also made the decision to get rid of two of my dad’s $5 fish from petco &amp; give them to his friend since it happened to be that those fish don’t get along with his. No my brother did not even ask my dad but proceeded to give them to his friend anyways. So later at night when my dad realized, things escalated pretty fast and they ended up beating the crap out of each other in my brothers room while my mom and i begged them to stop. We had to physically hold them back because my brother would not stop saying disrespectful shit to my dad without thinking. 
I genuinely think they are capable of killing each other though because once either of them gets mad they both don’t see straight &amp; neither of them can be reasoned with.

If it matters, this particular job is essentially being a waitress in an independent living facility (think retirement home). I've had a few other jobs during that time, but because I was seasonal, I never really had to quit. I had a set end date when I hired on. I enjoyed working at this place to begin with but over time it became worse and I'm now having disputed about payment because I'm missing a paycheck I was supposed to receive four months ago.

From the very start of the recruitment process I was upfront about having another job, and asked that they advise me if leaving that job would be required. They advertised as being very flexible with days and all my interactions throughout the recruitment process reflected this, they all insisted that my other job could be worked around.

Things are going well at the factory and I just got my first pay, but I'm starting to feel uneasy instead of reassured. I receive a text each evening asking me to confirm my availability for the next day, which surprised me as I had laid out the days I wasn't available. Turning down a day but stating I could work the day after had no negative effects, and almost all the permanent staff I have spoken with at the factory started as agency. 

Despite all going well I am really worried that working ""part time"" will hurt my chances of being kept on.

206,"Tl;dr - I had my first date with a guy a year and a half ago. After 5 or 6 more dates, I ended things because he only seemed interested in sex. He has a girlfriend now and I haven’t talked to him in a year and a half, but he sent me a happy birthday message. I’m not sure how to interpret this or if I’m reading too much into it. 

I went on my first ever date a year and a half ago. He was very charming and I liked him a lot. But after a couple dates, things got *intimite* and I was getting kinda uncomfortable. After that he only seemed to be interested in hanging out at my dorm. So I stopped talking to him 

I got kinda drunk a couple months later and messaged him to come over. To which he replied that he only wanted to be friends. (Yeah, not my proudest moment). But other than that I haven’t talked to him in a year and a half. 

I later found out that he got into a serious relationship maybe a week after I ended things. They were casually seeing each other the same time he was seeing me. Pretty sure they are still dating. 

A couple days ago, it was my birthday and I posted on my Instagram story. So he responded “happy birthday!” And I replied “thanks you :)” 

I just thought that was a bit weird and idk how to feel about it. I still have feelings for him, considering he was my first date.

207,"So here's my story. I am 19, currently in North America. I moved here 2 years ago, and was in South Asia before that. Before moving here, I've been focused on studies and just serious stuff (read: boring) in general. I didn't listen to any songs during my teenage, any movies/books/series/shows whatsoever. 

Growing up I never had trouble in South Asia, as Asian communities in general have kids that are just focused and that's praised. I never felt the need to ""be in the know"". Fast forward to now and all my friends are talking about songs, their artists from the past or something that they have watched. I sit there clueless. Feeling completely alienated. I swear that celebrities would pass by and I wouldn't even know who they are.

How do I connect back to pop culture? I feel like so much has been out there that's it hard to find what I like and too much to catch up too. Don't know where to start or will I ever finish the must see shows/movies and stuff as it will take an incredible amount of time to see/hear everything. I feel pressurized which in turn isn't allowing me enjoy these things, which is one way the prime purpose of these things. What do I do?

210,"Hello thanks for checking in!!

So I have this really bad habit of never responding back to my friends or families text messages. Or it usually takes me weeks to reply back. It’s probably my worst habit and I want to stop but it’s so hard. 

It’s not that I forget about them either. I think about responding pretty much all day. And the longer I go without responding the worse I feel. 

I’ve talked about with most of my friends and warned them of this habit. They all understand but there’s a limit on how much someone is willing to put up with this treatment. I love them all very very very much i don’t know why it’s so difficult to respond to them. 

I’m a huge introvert btw. It’s really hard to hold 10 different conversations at once and to give them all the appropriate amount of attention and love and intimacy. I get so overwhelmed I guess I freak out and end up procrastinating. I know procrastination is a coping method to ignore doing something that brings negative emotions? Or something like that?? Idk know that doesn’t really do much for me

I met all her friends and instantly felt loved. I had my own friend group but these people seemed like they just overflowed with mental health and happiness. When school started back around though things became more difficult, i felt like i had to control my emotional needs when i was with her. I loved feeling needed and i loved all the adventures, but i definitely felt like she was never going to want to see the whole me. i alway thought that her form of friendship was being helped and my form was doing the helping. She is the opposite of emotional. One time i upset her and her friends told me she never says sorry and that i should be grateful that she thought about apologizing. But she also loves really hard too and will cook you every meal and plan the best parties. On any given day she's either one personality or the other. As you can imagine things got difficult. I asked her to hang out multiple times and she declined. We haven't spoken in months. Its been hard on me because honestly i was the happiest i'd ever been last summer and now i feel so isolated. Im worried i'll never be that happy again, i'm worried that ill be given this amazing opportunity and ruin it again. i still want to know what i did wrong, if i could have fixed something.

I usually hold it until I take a shower in the morning, which is fine most of the time, but can be inconvenient at times. I don't really like public restrooms, but I can poop in them as long as there is no chance that someone I know will walk in (i.e. I won't poop in them if I'm out with someone of the same sex or at work or school). Some people can just stand up and say that they're going to take a shit, but for some reason I don't want my family to know that I do it.

219,"I don't know where to start because it shouldn't have gotten this far.

But I am a 21 year old woman and I live with my mom, my teenage sister, and my two little brothers. I usually help me mom each month by giving her 240 dollars to help with rent and my phone bill (usually I give her 100-120 biweekly). However, because of COVID-19 I cannot go to work until the pandemic is over. My mom said I wouldn't have to pay her anything because my job closed. Because I had no income, I had to use some of my emergency money I was going to use to buy a car to help buy groceries and such. However, recently I have received FAFSA refund from my community college. I also got approved for unemployment and my job sent me a check because of the virus. But here's the thing 1) I've already spent about 300 on textbooks and food and 2) I was planning on putting most of it away for my car expenses.

She took me to cash my checks I received from my job and unemployment and she wanted me to give her money for the rent. We ended up having a fight because she said I had a attitude when she took me to a ATM and I asked ""How much do you need mom?"" She got really upset and asked me why I don't want to pay my bills. I told her I don't have much and I'm trying to save what I have for my car and groceries. She says she doesn't make much either, but I said I will get the money and told me never mind and started driving off and she was yelling at me in the car about how I need to pay my bills, I'm being selfish, how I agreed to pay my bills on time when we moved, and how when I move out I need to pay my bills on time or I'll get put out and such. I'm supposed to move out in August when I transfer to university (if the pandemic is over by then) so she says this a lot lately to me a lot if I'm behind on giving her money (which is usually only a couple days at the most). Her friend (who I call aunt) was on the phone with my mom saying I'm wrong for that. She sent me in the store to get her some wine and cokes and I went in and got a 100 dollars for her but she gave it back and said she's ""never begged for anything so she wont beg me for anything"" (yes her exact words).

We get back home in silence and we are still in silence. She got mad at my sister because she washed her sheets while I was gone because she was washing her sheets. Before we left, my mom was washing her clothes and she told my sister to wash them yesterday so she yelled at her about that. She said later we have to go to our dads house next week for a week .

Me and my sister are in a group chat with her and we both texted her we were sorry. She texted back that we selfish and we don't appreciate what she does for us and she wants alone time She says this every time she gets upset that were ungrateful, selfish and don't appreciate her. I love my mom, and not just because she's my mother but I would be lying if I said I wasn't ready to move out. I'm sick of her calling me selfish and ungrateful every time she gets upset with me. It's not like I'm a awful kid. I do the chores I'm supposed to do, I've helped her take care of my siblings since my parents divorced when I was 14, and I usually always come through to help her when I can.

I don't know what to do at this point, I feel bad for acting irritated when she asked for money but it's shouldn't have turned into a argument and I was hoping she'd understand. Is there anyway to show her I do appreciate her or anything I can say?",10Apr2020,1

He may never be completely “able” but he can definitely get to walking and moving easier- which is what he has voiced he wanted. How can I help motivate him on a daily basis without wearing down myself? He has such a hard getting himself to do basic things that would help him dramatically- like having his protein shakes and vitamins, and doing his daily stretches and arm workouts. His doctors have told him specific things he needs to do, especially to gain weight and muscle, which is something he needs desperately, but he more often than not doesn’t do. If anyone has gone through this, on either side, please please tell me!

227,"Sorry if this story is a bit large but I need some advice or maybe just talking to someone about this situation, also sorry for my wrong English
So I have this huge (sorry for simping) crush on a really cute and smart girl at my school, I met her on English class and just became extremely attached to her, we talked and texted for a few days and then I decided I would do a portrait of her, which I did (I like to paint and did that portrait for her with her permission) I gave it to her and I told her that I didn’t liked it enough so I would make a second one to compensate, I bought oil paints and better brushes and made a really good oil paint portrait of her which I gave her by surprise, I also started hitting the gym because I wanted to impress her. I kept talking to her and some months later I had the idea of making poetry and cards to her and send them anonymously through a mutual friend. Something which I did by taking some of my class hours to write those really complex cards and poems for her. this continued for a month and some more weeks; she already knew I was the guy behind those cards but gave no response at all and just told my friend she liked them a lot. Also, by those times I also started doing an animation for her to declare my love to her, something which I stopped because I got no response from her and I kind of felt really awkward about that and that she wouldn’t ever love me, and a few days ago she got a boyfriend, a guy who was really popular and everybody loved. 

They were in a relationship for a few weeks until he cheated on my crush, and I had no intentions to write cards or animate or do anything at all because it was just unrequited and I never thought her love would just blossom out of nowhere.
Or that’s what I thought because during that time she had broken up with her ex I was at a party on another city (take in count it was at another city) and she texted me to tell me about how much she loved the cards that i did for her and she would want me to do them forever because they lifted her mood every day she read them.

Reading that totally hyped me up and I started once again an animation, which I did on full speed mode during  the time of the trip between the party at that city and where I lived. That same night I told my friend to send her the animation with the exact same words she used to give her my first card (which I remember hearing in the back of the place by heart). She loved it and all but I never got an actual response from her, except for the fact that she texted to me the whole days after. And I thought she did fell in love with me after all.
A few days were past and I was ready to propose to her and I asked her friend what she thought about me proposing to her and she just tells me that my crush got back with her boyfriend because she forgave him cheating on her.

Oh and you think that this was the end of the story? No no no... a few weeks ago I was talking to a friend of mine that somehow had some familiar bonds with my crush’s boyfriend and I now know that he is again cheating on my crush. Not with one girl, but with two other different girls. And he does all that on her back while she tweets and writes how much she loves him and he’s the best guy she has ever met.

I honestly don’t know how to feel, she is my first crush ever in my whole life and this is such a confusing situation, on one side I feel mad, sad, angry, that I can treat her way better than he does, that even if I gave my everything I’ll never be enough. I don’t even have a concrete opinion about this. It’s like a whole ride in the dark with new feelings and not knowing what I do or think or feel.
I would appreciate any kind of opinions or advice. Because this lowkey sucks.
She’s just such a nice girl and I would want her to notice that the dude she’s dating with now is going to hurt her feelings, because I would hate if she ever got hurt.

In resume: I fell in love and did everything for a girl but she is now girlfriend with someone who doesn’t actually love her and I don’t know how to feel. And I’m asking for help with my feelings",10Apr2020,1
228,"I was just going on a walk with my dad because self quarantining is a little boring. And a couple needed some help moving a couch. My old man owns a pickup truck and offered to help them out. The whole thing was a ton of fun for the most part. I helped get the couch in the truck and the woman(who’s name is Ainsly) helped me keep it on the bed while we moved it up the ramps. She was a really nice young woman and she kept talking about how we’ll manned I was for a 22 year old and stuff like that. I swear she probably made me blush but I tried to ignore it since she was clearly with someone some way. They never really explained their relationship. So I never asked. Anyway, I decided to run up the ramp so if the couch fell out i could stop it. She eventually coaxed me into jumping on the back of the pickup and holding on like a garbage man😂. I did it and we road the truck up the ramp while my dad drove. It felt like so much fun. When we eventually got the couch into the apmt we were all talking and chatting up a storm. Ainsly, me, Nam, and my dad. I learned that she traines dogs to become service dogs for disabled children and young adults. I instantly had a lot of interest in her because I am in the grey about whether or not my social anxiety and other adhd stuff is enough to make me consider myself in any way disabled. Anyway. The whole time I was talking to her I felt so comfortable and safe. It’s terrible I know. But she made me feel like I didn’t have to worry about being me. So I guess my question would be should I feel bad for feeling a kind of way about this woman? Or should I pursue my feelings further depending on if I ever see her again? Btw Nam wanted to give us his number for work and we ended up getting Ainsly’s number. She didn’t know his number. She asked me how I became such and exceptionally well rounded young man. And my heart exploded and I know I lit up. I don’t know what to do with these sudden feelings that I think are very wrong.",10Apr2020,1

231,"So I have been afraid of dogs for as long as I can remember. I know an incident happened when I was around four years old; I was chased by my neighbor's dog. That apparently traumatized me, and now my fear that has been professionally diagnosed as a phobia is more subconscious than ever. I missed out on a lot as a child. I had friends at school, but I never went to their houses because they all had dogs. My closest childhood friend has two indoor dogs and two outdoor dogs, so trying to even go to his house would be a challenge of distracting the outside dogs while I run into the house containing two indoor dogs in the kennel. 

With all of that said, I am happy to say that I have made progress. My grandmother got a dog a few years ago, but I was terrified of this sweet, loving 12-pound miniature poodle. When my grandmother flew out across the country to visit her sister (I was probably 14 or 15 at the time), she left her dog with my family. Every day was tough, as I wouldn't leave my bedroom until I was assured that the dog was in some sort of containment. However, I started to notice the dog's tendencies more than ever and I (somehow) eventually got over my fear of her. 

Even with that progress, I am still struggling. That poodle is 12 pounds. I am still very uncomfortable around large dogs and will not be in the same room as one that is not contained. One of my therapists from my years in therapy for this issue recommended that my family gets a puppy that will grow into a larger dog so that I could watch the dog grow and see that large dogs are just larger small dogs (if that makes sense). I loved this idea, as I never hated dogs. I always thought dogs were so beautiful and sweet, but again, my fear had become subconscious so early in life. 

This brings us to today. I have never wanted to get a puppy more in my life. There are a few problems with this, though. I am now 18 years old and am leaving for college in a few months (if Miss Rona subsides). I know I would get to watch the puppy grow some, but I feel like I would miss the transition from a young dog to an adult dog (even though I will probably visit home every month or two), and that is probably the most important transition in overcoming my fear. Also, my father plays a huge factor in this. He had a dog when he was a child, and when it passed away it actually traumatized him. When my mother relayed that information to me, she said that he had tears in his eyes. He said that he never wants me to experience the pain of loss that he did with such a companion. I completely understand where he is coming from, but I don't think he understands the extent of what I missed out on as a child, the friends I lost, etc. Mainly, I am asking for advice on how to convince my father to allow me to make this dramatic change in my life. I am sorry for writing so much, but this has been weighing on me lately. Thank you all!",10Apr2020,1

I was off my meds for about 3-4 weeks and for this week I’ve been feeling the effects of them. I’ve been anxious, moody, sad, suicidal, and sometimes happy.

They keep changing. Like, it won’t just stay one mood and I hate it. It’s why I want to kill myself. I just want it all to end but I promised I wouldn’t kill myself. I’m waiting for my meds to kick in.

I tried explaining to my boyfriend how important social distancing is and how helpful it has been for a lot of places now, I showed him the difference between New York and San Fransisco when one asked people to stay indoors vs the other suggesting movies (was a post in r/agelikemilk) 

He's just been annoyed with the commercials and talk about it all, and doesn't really seem to take it seriously.  His response was ""well who has a bigger population? Theres other factors involved."" Which yeah New York does have a huge population but that comparison I showed him was going by every 100,000 people. 

I'm most worried because were currently living with my grandparents and he doesn't wash his hands, wear a mask, wear gloves (despite us having both) goes to the store daily, multiple stores daily, hes living the same as he did before all of this started. He calls the commercials 'Propaganda' which doesn't make sense to me, and no matter how hard I try I can't get him to understand how important this all is and how serious it is. 

Its destroying so many people's lives.. it's to a point where my grandma might have to ask him to leave because she so scared she'll get it.

I still have not received either. 

Should I call up tomorrow morning and ask to confirm if they still need me or should I just turn up to work given I said I could come?

I don't really see why the rostering manager would really need to ring me back/call me as its not really neccessary to confirm anything with me given I said I could come and therefore answered the original text's question, so I'm thinking that they've probably received my message and all is good.

246,"I'm a boy just entering the teenage years, and I need help. Throughout my life, I have always prided myself on being objective to the point of coldness. My teacher and friends always point out that in any given situation, I can be counted on to provide an objective analysis. However, this isn't the case with my parents. Every time, I try to say something to them, they take it personally and lash out. Within ten seconds of ANY disagreement, I am being given the parental ultimatum of ""we provide for you, you are nothing to us,"" ending any hope of a rational conversation. I've tried everything I know to see their side and used the utmost of my empathy to put myself in their shoes. I never make any emotional arguments or say ""I want this."" Yet I always find myself on the receiving end of a torrent of verbal criticisms. Any disgruntled attempt to lash out myself will lead to hell on earth. Any and every analogy or example I use or draw a parallel to is taken as worse than a personal insult. If I were to say ""Imagine if X,"" they will hear ""You are X."" I barely raise my voice once a month, and never be anything but polite when arguing with them, and any form of verbal assertiveness on my end is a form of suicide.

For example, just an hour ago, I was listening to music while working on my PC. I looked over my shoulder to see my parents watching a slideshow of my relatives and my mom said something to me. Leaning back to remove my headphones and stop the music, the first thing I hear is ""...he never wants to listen to anything."" My attempt to point out that I was taking of my headphones was met with ""Watch your tone..."" I then spent the next 30 minutes being ripped into for ""refusing"" to watch the slideshow, which was apparently a very touching piece made by some cousins for a grandmother who recently passed. I was screamed at for ""thinking I was too good for it"" despite these cousins apparently being pretty rich and famous in our family. My weak protestations that I had asked what the video was about even before my parents told me to watch only served to enrage my dad (who has the dimensions of a linebacker) who would've taken me apart (he has before) if it wasn't for my mother, who abhors physical violence, body shielding me. However, make no mistake, this is only because of her religious upbringing. In every other aspect, she is just like my father.

For context, my parents immigrated from an Asian country with a strong system of piety towards elders, which may help explain their actions. They have both dedicated their lives to me and my brother, and are loving adults who I would absolutely respect them from an external standpoint, and I don't want a lack of communication to irreversibly damage our relationship.",10Apr2020,1
247,"Good evening everyone! I live in an apartment complex with my bedroom on a shared wall with the apartment to my right. I’ve lived here about a year now and for most of this year at least 2-3x a week there is a baby crying anywhere from 9pm-3am (or later because I usually fall asleep eventually). Lately it’s been every single night. I’m laying here right now typing this because it’s currently happening and I’m at my boiling point. It’s not just crying, it’s banging on the walls too, both by this child and (I assume) the adults occasionally around it. 

The crying gets really intense, screeching at points. Usually dull audible crying with a screech every 3ish minutes and this lasts for HOURS. I understand letting a child cry it out but there are definite limits with this when a child is obviously not self soothing. But what do I do? 

I’ve ignored it for so long but of course my mind runs with what’s happening to this child. My guess is they’re about 1yo. I hear occasional talking and arguing amongst adults over there some nights, occasionally sounding like it’s in Spanish but I could be wrong. I don’t think I have EVER seen these neighbors. I kind of want to leave a note of some kind but the complex I live in has some sketchy people and I fear they could retaliate if they found out it was me. I want to call CPS as well but I know that can also have it’s issues. I just can’t handle this anymore. Maybe I should text my landlord first? But he only owns a few of the apartments. It’s a strange place and I’m not sure if they’re his tenants. 

I don’t know what to do, anyone with experience with any of this is welcome to give advice (or just anyone at all really). I get angry sometimes when I’m very tired and can’t sleep because of this. I’ll want to slam the wall to let them know I’m irritated but I know it’s just a child over there and I’m of course in no way angry towards this child. I’ve gotten used to sleeping with ear plugs in which is ridiculous. I’d sleep in a different room but I don’t have any option and I feel like maybe this isn’t something to be ignored, but I don’t see many good options.",10Apr2020,1

He doesn’t talk to any other girls Bc he knows it will upset me and I’m the only girl he hangs out with. But he always reminds me and let’s me know we are just friends. But he doesn’t do any of this to any other girl Just me. He made me a promposal. everyone thinks we are dating but he always says we are just friends. He’s so good to me but it’s so hard because I do like him a lot but we are just friends. How can you be this way if your just friends? A couple months ago we had argument and he asked if I liked him and I said no because he always tells me he does NOT want a girlfriend. So a couple more months pass and I break down and I start crying and I tell him I like him. He said he did like me in the past but he does not any more and he’s moved on. If he’s moved on why does he still take me on dates, cuddle, and hold hands w me? It was a lot to handle but we moved passed it. Nothing changed we still acted like we were dating. A couple weeks later I tell him again and he says he does not feel the same way only as a friend. So to present day. We went on a date yesterday to go painting in the park and ice cream and we held hands and hugged and he kissed me. I don’t understand at all and I’m so confused because it’s soooo hard. I want to be with him and he’s making me feel like we are. He’s a good guy he’s good to be and treats me well but this is so hard for me. 3 years of this. What do I do?",10Apr2020,1
266,"Hi again!

It’s me. Here to vent to you all, yet once again.

Just a little background of myself: I am 22 years old. I’m a senior in College. I am engaged to my amazing and loving fiancé who is 26 years old. 

My fiancé has recently got out the military so he is also going to school. We are both studying our butts off to get our degrees and get our careers going so we can finally get married and live together. My fiancé and I have been together for 4 years. Engaged for 2. 

All of our friends are either having kids, getting married, or moving in together. We both still live at our parents house. It’s kind of depressing being the only couple who hasn’t got married, who don’t have kids, etc.. 

I’m happy for all of our friends but I feel like I’ve been in school for forever now and I am so tired of it! I feel stuck. Like I’m not progressing. There are SO many state exams I have to take and I’m worried I may not pass them. (Considering I am a very bad test taker) and if I fail these exams, it will only push my graduation date even longer! 

I’m running out of patience. My fiancé really try’s his best to help support me and encourage me to keep going. That all of our hard work will pay off. And that in the end we will have everything at it’s given time. He’s so patient, I love it. 

I have nearly 2 years of school left. He’s got about 1 year and a half. He said we’ll get married as soon as he graduates so I don’t know? I really hope we do because I just want to live with him already! I really hate going out separate ways when leaving parties or him having to drop me off at my house or me having to drop him off at his house. Meanwhile all of our friends drive happily home together, lol. 

If anyone on here has any words of encouragement, advice, or tips for being patient, I will gladly be here to read it all! Thank you so much for taking your time in reading my little rant sesh! :)",10Apr2020,1
267,"I’ve been dating this guy for months now and I really love him, I’ve never fallen this deep in love with someone. But I have incidents of other guys hitting me up and flirting with me and I’d show I’m not interested by being dry and just seeming genuinely not interested. But I don’t know how to say no. My relationship is private as of right now and when someone would hmu I’d just go along and not mention my bf because we just don’t want to make it public yet. So sometimes a guy would ask for a pic or something yk and I feel so mean when I’d say no, I feel like a horrible person for some reason, but then I’d send and I’d feel so so so so ashamed, and regret it. I just feel like a terrible person for doing that to my bf. I love him I really do I just don’t know how to get over feeling so horrible for saying no. It seems so simple and usually if I did say no, guys would beg for so long I’d give up. I feel so gross and disgusting I don’t know what to do.",10Apr2020,1
268,"Im going crazy. I need help.
First, I'll sum up the situation I'm in and how i got into it.

Me and my Fiance first started dating 4 and a half years ago, I'm from America he is from England.
We dated long distance for 1 year before he came to see me in America then we have traveled back and forth from USA to UK everything since, We have been inseparable since day 1 always together side by side I'd even go to his work every day bring him things like snacks and lunch help out if needed his boss was fine with it he worked on a pier so I'd sit and enjoy the ocean and do research on my phone (He has moved jobs since I've been away, better offer) 

Anyways, for visa reasons and things I needed to deal with and him needed to stay working I had to go back home for a few months just as we got things sorted. Before I left he proposed and promised when I'm back we would get married and get my visa fully sorted so I'd never have to leave by myself again. Me being ecstatic about getting married to him but nervous and sad about having to be away from him for so long (6 months total) I had to do it. after the worst day of my life and over 12 hours in air then finally reaching my family right before the holidays, Discording and Skyping my Fiance everyday for 6 months and February 25th came, The day i could come back. My birthday was the 24th of February my official flight we booked ages before was 18th of March (found a good deal if we waited a few more weeks after the date i could come back) so all was planned i was so over being here in Michigan and I just wanted to see my fiance again. 

Well i was hearing about the virus. Wasn't worried at first, no one else seemed to be anyways, I have asthma and an autoimmune disorder so eventually when i learned it could hurt or kill me i become worried, however nothing was going to stop me from seeing him.

Until 2 days before my trip the travel ban extended to the UK as well and my trip was canceled.

In 8 days its been a month since i was meant to leave, I thought i could do this only a little longer right? Well i have no idea when ill be able to see him again, When ill be able to marry the love of my life, when i will be able to go home and see my cat in England. 

Wanna know what makes things worse? Since his work has shut during this situation. My fiance at the very start of his stay at home started getting a rash along his arms that has now spread all over his body and is extremely painful for him, He's gone to the hospital 2 times now and they won't even run tests they said both times ""not sure what it is"" then in total prescribed him 7 things. In England every prescription is £9. Together that's £63 thats just short of $80 and none of it helped him at all. He can't even put on a shirt. He's embarrassed he won't even video chat me anymore because he hates the way the rashes look. He doesn't want me to see him that way and it makes me feel horrible he has to go through that by himself. His lockdown time he can't even enjoy and play video games with me. 

What do i need advice with? My mental state.
My whole life I've had depression and anxiety and i finally felt like i had control over my life again and now im in the biggest pit imaginable stuck living in my parents basement counting the days i can go home and get married and never leave his side again. My cat was a kitten when i left. He's huge now. 
I don't have a single friend to help me during this time my Fiance is my best friend. It hurts so much to see him suffer in pain as well both stress and cry over my flight that was canceled if over it was 2 days sooner, maybe if we booked it for the 25th and weren't cheap about it. I know the world is going to shit and this one situation can't compare to what is killing thousands of people but i can't handle any of this and its only going to get worse. 

Sorry about typos and grammar :( 

Oh and one more thing i had to stop taking my anti depressants because the side effects were making me constantly sick along side with my PCOS and Metformin medication i felt the only thing i could cut out were the anti depressants and i feel i made the right choice, physically I'm feeling better. Mentally however I'm in one of the dark times (not my darkest thankfully) but getting there. I was once very suicidal starting 6 years ago up until my fiance dug me out of my slump and saved my life so if you could imagine it feels like he's my life suppose and my cord is being very stretched (3,000 miles) just hanging on and I'm hoping i don't like do something fucking stupid like trip over the plug and kill myself (not my finest comedy but I'm depressed leave me alone) (but don't leave me alone because I'm already lonely) 

Im just rambling now, knowing probably no one will read this but if you have thank you, And I'd be happy to accept any advice on how to cheer myself or my fiance up in these hard times. Or any other advice really, thanks again",10Apr2020,1

275,"Long story short, I live in an area under lock down and I’ve been lucky enough to be allowed to live with my boyfriend and his family as we are both “essential” workers at the same company. I’ve had issues at my house that prevented me from staying with my family( i.e. I’m unable to drive and I cannot risk taking Uber any longer so I rely on my boyfriend now for transport). So it made more sense for us to just live together until I could continue my driving lessons when this blows over. 

All was fine for the past few weeks, I’ve been bonding with his younger siblings, chipping in with groceries and helping his mother with chores etc. I even offered to pay rent, which they politely declined. However, as his stepfather still works I’ve never really connected with him like I have the rest of the family. 

This all leads to yesterday, when my boyfriend informs me that $100 went missing from his stepfathers room and that he(the stepdad) is convinced I stole it. I’ve never stolen anything in my life and I was appalled that anyone would ever accuse me of that, but his word is law in the house so I left.  I don’t think I’m ever welcome back in the house after this. 

Now I don’t know if there is any way I could prove my innocence. I see a future with my boyfriend and he even left his home to be with me in family’s house as he is my main method of transportation, but I feel like I’ve severed an important tie with his family that I can’t get back. I didn’t steal his money but he refuses to believe I’m innocent, so now I’m just a thief in their eyes. 

I just don’t know what to do. I feel guilty about this whole situation but I don’t know how to confront it. My boyfriend suspects it could be a race issue as I’m half black and his stepfather can be a little racist but I just don’t know.",10Apr2020,1

When I went off to college I bought some baking glass ware with the brand name anchor hocking, it does not have the turquoise tint like soda lime glass does but due to where I bought it (Walmart) and the price (cheap) I feel its too good to be true.

I'm a felon as of 2017. I never served prison time as a first time offender but did spend time in jail. This shows up on my background checks and I know it will when I do applications. I'm not sure how to go about it.

I have a really bad credit score because I was in college at the time I was in jail and unable to pay my student loans and I was not able to pay the medical bills that I incurred before being taken to jail.y credit score is now 200-400 depending on what credit company they use.

295,"About 2 years ago, my childhood dog very dear to me passed after living over 17 revolutions around the sun. Very soon after, my friend asked if my family could take care of his dog, a pit bull. The deal was that my friend would get his own place so that he could eventually take his dog back. Everything was ""teed up"" as if he would get his own place and reclaim his dog relatively soon. 

Two years have now passed and he has said nothing to me about wanting his dog back. It's been awhile since I have hung out with my friend, and I texted him not too long ago. He didn't reply. My family is now in a situation where we really want to ""seal the deal"" and overall determine if this is going to be a full on adoption. Does he even want her back (her name is Cleo)? We don't know the answer and it would be a weird thing for me to bring up after it's been so long talking about this situation. It's time I get it resolved as requested by my father.

The thing is, my parents claim to be attached to Cleo, while I'm not attached. They want to keep her because they feel that Cleo would not like having to leave the household where she's been from ages 2 - 4 these past two years. They think that breaking the bond would be too much for them and for the dog.

Me on the other hand, I don't want to keep this dog. She barks too much, she won't stay still If I try to snuggle her, and she always bombards my face with aggressive licking when I get remotely close her. The licking can be funny at times, but I miss having a dog that knows how to snuggle, plus I like having fur to pet. My old dog, Sadie, had those traits and comforted me. I really don't think pit-bulls are as cute as dogs with fur either. It's just my preference.

Why not just get two dogs? Cleo is an aggressive player. We have to have her on a choke leash when taking her out because she is that strong. If we had another dog in the household, the barking would be insane with Cleo. 

I want Cleo gone. I understand why my parents don't want to break the bond which makes me feel somewhat guilty. I have a preference in dogs and I do have misophonia (a repetitive noise irritation disorder) which makes barking especially difficult. 

One last thing. The original owner of the dog; though he does not have is own place yet, he always mentioned getting a mobile home and living in it. He has the mobile home now, but he still lives with his parents. I have not seen it or been in it yet, but I'm curious if he has plans to actually live in it claim Cleo back. Most apartments won't allow a dog at her weight to be held which means that my friend needs his own place to claim the dog back.",10Apr2020,1

303,"I’m in the Vancouver area and I’m trying to choose between two very different post secondary options: UBC (Faculty of Science) and Emily Carr (art school where I’ll get a foundation year before specializing). I want to have a career in art someday and it’s something that I think I could be happy doing but it feels like I would be taking a risk in terms of my future financial situation. 

If I went to UBC and went into sciences on the other hand, it would feel a bit more stable or “safe” for my career, but it’s not what I’m passionate about. I don’t think I would hate it, but I certainly wouldn’t enjoy it. Thing is, my close friend and a few other people I know are also going to UBC, and it could do a lot for my happiness if I was able to commute with them to university every day (we live in the same area and would likely bus there together if I chose this option). Just because of this, I’m seriously considering going to UBC. However, I know that this close friend of mine would never do the same for me in this situation, which sounds reasonable, but our friendship has always had me putting in more effort than she has. I think it might be good for me to meet new people at this point, but she and I have really good times together and we have the same sense of humour, and it’s hard to find a friend that I can have such good conversations with.


Also, I currently have another slightly toxic group of friends, and a few of these people are also going to Emily Carr. I honestly don’t want to see them after high school, but I feel like I shouldn’t change my uni choice based on the people around me. I know that if the people were taken out of the equation (i.e. if I was only picking between the two schools with no outside factors) I would pick the art school in a heartbeat. I’m banking on hopefully being able to meet new people in uni and have a fresh start, but I’m scared of drifting apart from the friend who’s going to UBC.",10Apr2020,1
304,"So, my friends dad recently landed me a job a packaging factory and it’s a temp job for three months.  My senior year has been taken by corona so I’ve had nothing to do so I thought why not?  It’ll be extra money.  

I filled out an application, and then I had a phone interview, went and got drug tested and all is well.  On the phone interview I was told I’d probably work 4 PM-12 AM.  I said I was okay with that or 8 AM-4 PM.  Well halfway through training I was informed in front of everyone I had the 12 AM-8 AM shift.  At this point I’m already kind of mad and I know I’m not going to enjoy the monotonous factory work, but that’d been okay with other hours as coronavirus has left me little options.

I have a near full ride to college, so this money isn’t super important.  So this isn’t a career builder.  

I’m scared to make my friends dad look bad but I don’t know how I can survive the night shift.  Should I just quit up front or try to stick it out a couple weeks (I do know that I will quit, I don’t want to miserably change my sleep schedule for a few weeks and then have to change back when college hits).  This also destroys my summer if everything opens up.  Should I quit even though I risk making my friends dad look bad?  And how can I do so without making him look bad?

We only hung out once outside of work and i have his sc, which he asked for, but don’t really text much. Me being a dumbass said i would go, without thinking it through, even after he told me that they were going to be smoking and drinking, i still said yes. Now i have never smoked weed but have drank before but never gotten drunk, but i don’t really have a problem because i want to try smoking. The problem is that i don’t know any of his friends and i have social anxiety so it’s hard for me to socialize with others.  The other problem is that i have strict parents and they would never let me go especially since they would be drinking and smoking and it would be late at night. He asked me what i would do if i were to get wasted and i told him i wouldn’t be able to go home and he told me that he could take care of me if i wanted to.

He accuses that someone is behind him touching his back and thinks its one of the family members in the house. He also yells at no one as if he is talking to someone indirectly since he is in his room. He also says that he hears yelling but none of us were ever yelling. He has also accused that my dad put toilet water in his water bottle. We've tried to explain to him that we are not doing that which he doesn't believe. During these moments he becomes defensive and verbally abusive. His anger can last up to an hour of constant swearing, yelling, ranting about the things we do wrong. He will constantly point out how we pick on him, call him dumb, forcing him to stay home and not find a job. He has expressed feelings of depression. He also has been diagnosed for having a mild intellectual disability so could that also be affecting his behavior? When he does calm down, he does express remorse. The same situation of him yelling and accusing us has been occurring up to 4 times a month. I want to be able to help him and understand what is it that he is going through.

307,"Hi all, 16M from Melbourne, Australia. Recently I have been torn with what to do, I am in a position fortunate enough whereby I am able to choose what career I want to enter, and I have full confidence that with hard work I would be able to enter most careers that I have any interest towards as I am relatively confident with my skills. The thing is, knowing this, I have always wanted to become a doctor, helping people and being at the forefront of human knowledge has always intrigued me and I have a deep interest in medicine. However recently, I also happened to have developed a passion for aviation, and it pains me to have to choose between aviation and medicine as a career. I acknowledge that I can and most likely will only be able to choose one to commit to. I am prepared to put in the hard work to succeed for both careers but am lost on which to pick, best case would be that I change careers after some time but I understand that would be illogical and unnecessary.

310,"I was on a Discord NSFW server and someone posted a link that had a bunch of dropbox files on it. I knew it was probably I bad idea, and I really regret doing this, but I clicked on it just to see what the files were. 

The link led me to a pastern website with a bunch of Dropbox links. Most of them had an ""Error"" sign when I clicked on them. One link loaded and it was legal porn. Another link had slightly questionable porn, but it also had videos form actual pornsites and a lot of clearly of-age women. 

Since most Dropboxes had ""Errors"", I decided to open a few more. I knew I should've just closed the website, but I just wanted to make sure that the other files were of-age women and that I wasn't doing anything illegal. However, I opened up a Google Drive link and another Dropbox link. I opened up the links and I wasn't sure if the pictures were CP or not. They were questionable, but not certain. I started to freak out and quickly closed both links. I never actually clicked on any of the images, let alone download the. All I did was open the link and scrolled for less than 20 seconds before I started to freak out. 

Now, I am freaking out that I might've accidentally opened Dropbox/Google Drive links with CP in them. I knew I shouldn't have even opened sketchy looking links from Discord in the first place, and now I am having an anxiety attack. I promise that I wasn't looking for CP AT ALL.

314,"I work as a delivery driver at a large pizza chain in the US. Today was fairly slow, and when there's no deliveries to be made I help out making food for carryout, preparing ingredients, answering phones, and helping anyone who comes in the store or to the drive through. The dining area inside of the store is closed due to the current health crisis, and we encourage people to only come inside if they are picking up an order and to go in and out as quickly as possible. I was on a shift with two other people, my manager and another coworker who is an ""insider"", basically someone who is neither a driver or a shift lead, and just does all the aforementioned tasks I do when I'm not driving. 

This afternoon, my manager was doing an hiring interview and my other coworker was making pizza. A man came into the store with long, messy hair, a large beard, old, dirty clothes, and no shoes on. I gave him my standard, ""Welcome, to \[name of pizza place\], how can I help you?"" He asks me if he can use the phones in our store to make a call, as his cell is dead/doesn't work and he needs some help. I tell him I'm not sure and I go to ask my manager, she tells me that I can't let him back into the kitchen where our phones are, and that's company policy. (Someone might tap the phone lines to steal customer info, try to steal something from the kitchen, or whatever else someone might be plotting when asking to use a company phone behind the counter) This is what I thought anyway, but wanted to double check. I tell him I can't let him back, but I can call a number for him and relay a message. He seems pretty bummed out by this but he understands, and leaves the store without saying much. 

Probably about two hours later, he comes back into the store. He says that he wants to try having me call and give a message, and I take some extra receipt paper and write what he wants to say, and gives me the number for his father. The gist of it is that he's stuck here and his car is out of gas/needs a jump start (he said both but I'm not sure if he means both or just one of them and got confused), and he needs someone to come and help him find somewhere to go, or a place to live. I call the number. No answer. He gives me a different number, which I call, again no answer. It seems like he's struggling to remember what the number is exactly, and gives me another number which is just one digit off from the first one. That one sent me to a robot, so I'm pretty sure that he was right the first time. Each time I try a new number he says something like ""He'll definitely pick up this time, he'll pick up."" I tell him I can try the first one again and leave a message this time, and he says that will work. I call it, no answer, and leave a message saying that your son needs help and I hope this is reaching the right person. 

My manager later mentioned to me that she noticed him hanging around in the parking lot for the past few days. It's a small shopping center with a big parking lot next to a busy street, so it's not like he's loitering around specifically our store. I'm not sure if he had been in the store before today, but he's definitely been in the area.

He was talking to himself and repeating stuff the whole time, and he clearly looked and seemed out of it. I'm not sure what exactly was wrong but he was clearly a guy who was down on his luck and in need of some assistance. 

I guess my question is, what should I do about this, if anything? I've been thinking about it all day since I came home from my shift and I'm hoping my message got to his father or someone who came to help him out. What are my options here? I could call homeless services but I'm not sure how helpful they would be, especially in today's climate with everything going on. Should I go back over there and bring him some food, gas, and offer to jump his car? Should I bring someone else with me if I go? Do I just ignore it and leave it for someone else to deal with?

There's that part of me that wants to be a cynic and say he's either trying to scam someone or is on drugs, and that I'm endangering myself by engaging with him. But I really just want to try and help this guy out, but I'm not sure how or if my efforts would even do anything. Any advice on any part of this would be appreciated.

Thanks to all, and hope you and your families are safe.",10Apr2020,1

320,"So first off, I had all the symptoms that were listed as COVID-19 back in December.  The kicker is...I didn’t travel outside the country.  I do travel between CA and AZ a lot, but the only places that I went that had a lot of close contact with people were casinos and shopping centers...it was holiday shopping season.  More specifically, I went to a casino resort in southern CA that is a big Asian tourist destination, for both its gambling and for its shopping outlets.

On the night of the 23rd, I slowly progressed to having breathing problems and then developed a fever with a slight cough.  I went to urgent care and told the doc what I was experiencing.  He convinced me that even though I had gotten the flu shot, it was only 30-40% effective this year and I potentially caught the flu.  He performed a flu test on me...which came back negative.  And the only thing he said was “you have a virus.” He didn’t give me any meds and told me to just “sleep it off”, but if I were to get worse to go to the ER.  Keep in mind, at the time, COVID-19 didn’t even have its formal name, this virus was still an Asian virus, and there were no testing for it.

After a few days of suffering through what was then thought to be a bad virus, I eventually did recover around the 2nd of Jan.

Is it possible that I had COVID-19?  Can I request my records from the urgent care and have someone else verify or is it too late?  I’m actually more thinking along the lines that if I did have it, maybe I have developed some type of antibodies and I could possibly help out where I can.  Is this also a possibility or is that far fetched?",10Apr2020,1

326,"TL;DR
I love the personality type of sober active drug/alcohol users, but hate drugs and alcohol.


So, out of everyone I've met, the personality types I tend to really like hanging around most are drug users.
The problem is that I have never done drugs. I don't drink (I've tried it many times, but I *never* liked it, so I stopped) and I don't smoke (I've had 3 lung surgeries already, and that's without even smoking. So on top of not wanting to in the first place, doing any further damage just isn't a smart move.) And I don't particularly like being around drugs or alcohol.

With that being said, there is a certain chaotic charm that drugs and alcohol seem to imprint on a users sober personality, and I really enjoy that.

Friendships are not so much a problem, because I don't judge people for what they do in their freetime as long as it doesn't negatively impact me.

The problem is the relationships.
Every girl I've met that I really enjoyed their personality, typically turn out to be heavy smokers/druggies. Now, that isn't a problem on a friendship level, but it makes dating really hard because it is a major part of their life that I don't want to be involved with.

I'm not sure how to handle this in the dating world because other people like me who have never smoked and don't drink, just don't mesh with me well. But I don't mesh into drug users lives well.

It sounded like a good idea. So I moved all my stuff out of my apartment and moved in with them an hour away.
Shortly after, we were put on a mandatory stay at home order. I was fine with that since I just had online school work to finish up.

Their 16 yo son, my cousin, was not.
After some freak outs and sneaking out on his part, they decided they would let him go on bike rides and stuff with friends as long as he stayed 6 ft apart and didnt go in anybody's houses. I didnt like that as it is, but as a guest here I didnt feel I could say much. I expressed my concerns and reminded them I'm at risk for complications if I were to get the virus due to health issues and they just played it off.

My cousin got home late tonight and I found out he was hanging out inside his friends house all day around all of this kid's siblings and parents and whatever, and even worse my aunt and uncle knew about it and let him do it and it's been happening more than just tonight apparently.

I've been having trouble breathing at times since last night too. It kept waking me up.

I'm seriously freaking out because they invited me here because they thought it was better for me but honestly I feel more at risk here and they dont like people questioning their parenting but I'm terrified of getting the virus and the complications from my other health issues.

They act like it's no problem their son is completely going against the stay at home mandate for either the health reasons or the legal consequences.

So I’ve been quarantining with my boyfriend in New Jersey for about 3 weeks. My parents and my brother are in Long Island at my parents house. There are obviously cases where I am, and cases by my parents house. I FaceTime them everyday and they ask me to come home. The problem I’m having is 1- my dad is OK with following the stay at home order, however is still going to grocery stores, etc. the other day he even went to Home Depot. Here with my boyfriend, I have more control. If he goes to the store he wears gloves mask etc showers when he gets back I wipe everything down outside, I clean and disinfect often..I don’t know if I’d be able to be so on top of things at my parents house. I know my father wouldn’t listen to me if I told him to shower after coming home. And even if I offered to be the one to go to the store or wipe groceries down, I’m not sure my dad wouldn’t just go anyway just to get out of the house. He’s smart and knows it’s serious but he also has a really hard time not doing anything. If it were up to him he’d still be working. 
I really miss them. I’d love to be spending quality time with them right now. But I just don’t know.

331,"I’ll just get right to it. I feel like my mum is strict, and is always around.

&amp;#x200B;

She leaves me home alone, maybe once a fortnight; and I’ve only been allowed home alone since about six months ago (once again, I’m 14)And when she does, she turns the internet off. She works from home, but never works in her office. She literally sits on the couch on her laptop for the whole day. My bedroom is upstairs, and I’m not allowed to have any devices in there (not at night, but ever). This means that I spend most of my time downstairs, next to my mother’s judgeful eye. I tried wearing earphones while watching YouTube, and she didn’t allow that; saying that she needs to be able to hear what I’m watching/listening to.

Bearing in mind that she already has software on my devices restricting internet; as well as limiting me to 3 hours on my phone. Also, she makes my devices lock at 7 o’clock. And she thinks that this is generous somehow. I find it slightly degrading to still be asking my mother for more time on my phone to text people when the sun isn’t down.

These rules have barely changed over the past 3 years; and I honestly can’t see them changing as I get older.

I’m not allowed to download apps without her approval; and one time, I asked for more time on my phone to text a friend; she asked who, suspiciously; I told her the truth, but she didn’t believe me for some reason; then she asked for proof, which I gave her, and she scrolled up and read my past text messages. Bearing in mind that I was telling the truth, I asked her why she lost it, and she said that I spoke ‘evasively’. The whole situation gave me the vibe of ‘just read an article about teens lying and am now paranoid’.

I want to finish this all by saying that I am an A+ student; I play two instruments and play soccer and tennis; I’ve have never really had a massive instance of misbehaviour or anything; nor have I given her reason to put these restrictions on my devices. It’s just always been the case. I’m honestly sick of it, I’m sick of having to come up with lies to my friends to explain why I can’t do certain things. Her attitude to parenting has shown no sign of changing as I approach late adolescence. It’s hard to have a conversation as it depends so heavily on her mood, and it takes seconds for her to gain an un shiftable opinion on the subject, and it is generally pointless.

What should I do?",10Apr2020,1

MS=my sister
X=her ex boyfriend

So first a little backstory. Im the youngest of four siblings (18F, 21F, 31M, and 35F). My older two siblings live far away from us and werent a huge part of my childhood. MS and I grew up pretty isolated with extremely strict parents. We didnt really get to interact with other people a lot until we went to high school. As soon as we did, MS started getting into a lot of drugs and alcohol, generally in with the wrong crowd. All throughout high school, she would always pressure me to try various drugs with her or to drink with her, even forcing me to a few times. Nothing serious, I only would have like, weed or a bit of vodka, but i never liked it. Even still, every time she would do something, she would have me cover for her, or babysit her to make sure nothing bad happened. She even accidentally OD'd once and got sent to the hospital. I was constantly getting worried texts from people, and having to look out for her even though she was older. She ended up dropping out of high school because of her drug abuse in her senior year. Its low-key really traumatizing. All of this, and other things, have led me to not trust her very much. Shes never been my older sister, so I dont need to treat her like it. 

Ive always been the ""gifted"" child i suppose, so even though she's older than me, we were either always in the same grade, or she was only one year ahead. This is important in setting up the age groups that Ive always been friends with. My friends have nearly always been her age or older, with a select few exceptions. I started high school when I was 11, and college when I was 15, so I'm used to hanging out with people much older than me. In general, people assume I'm in my mid-twenties and tell me I seem more mature (I'm not sure how to say any of that without sounding like a bragging child but there it is I guess)
Im extremely introverted and have a lot of social anxiety. That, and my age, has kept me from actually being able to talk to a lot of my friends. Its considered weird to have a big age difference in friendships, obviously.

Well, last year, MS got a new boyfriend(29M), X. X was one of the few people she knew who wasnt in some way an alcoholic or addict. Not perfect, but actually intelligent and trying to keep his shit in order. She was very excited to introduce us and encouraged us to be friends. He wasn't actually that much older than most of the people I tended to get along with, only a year or two, so I wasnt bothered being friends with him, especially since we were very similar in interests and worldview etc. Over the couse of the 9 months they were dating, MS encouraged us to keep being better friends. She said she couldnt date someone who I didnt like. And so we did. X actually took on a sort of older brother role, since none of my actual siblings were people I actually felt I could trust, but he was always honest, open to criticisms and non-judgemental. We never talked about anything graphic or inappropriate, but I could at least be honest if I was upset about something and he would take me seriously. Since we were both fans of fantasy and creative story telling, we would often talk about that. I even joined his DND group.

It should be noted that X at the bringing of the relationship was hesitant to be involved with MS due to her younger age, and shes the one who pushed for it. It is ALSO important to note that he at one point, did sleep with a 19F. Just so we all know whats going on. He is 100% wrong and bad for that, everyone told him, and he agreed that he should NOT have done that. So there is a bit of confusion with the age of his partners happening. 

At one point when they were dating, my sister started seeing a bunch of other people. She would tell him that her relationship with him wasnt exclusive, but also would lie when she saw someone else. It was all more of the bad crowd she was super into. She started disappearing for days on end, not answering anyones calls or texts, turning up a week later at a casino in a sate over. Everyone was upset, and X was especially. Eventually, he told her that she was being reckless and dangerous and crazy and he loved her and didnt want her to get hurt. It was all very dramatic, and she didn't take it well at all. She broke up with him the next day.
I was mad at her for her behavior, but i didnt want her in a relationship if she disnt want to be in one, so I supported her breaking up, but also agreed that she was being reckelss and crazy. We ended up having a big argument about it because she was shocked that I wasnt just ""automatically supporting everything she did"", and I was ""breaking her heart"" for ""disagreeing with her."" Her words not mine. But also, yeah. 
After they broke up, I continued to be friends with X and talk to him. At that point, we would text pretty much daily and meet up for coffee about twice a week (always public places). At the same time, I was avoiding MS and all of her friends because I was still angry.

Its been 4 months since then, and MS is now angry at me and X for still being friends. She says that he's trying to seduce me to torment her, and that he's going out of his way to cause her pain by continueing to be my friend. She says it hurts her that he's been awarded the ""older sibling"" title that she had always wanted. I can see her concerns with him perhaps trying to seduce me, as he has slept with younger women before, however, I also know that that's not at all our relationship, and I am perfectly capable of shutting something like that down if it did come up.
 I understand that the age difference is weird, but since its not a romantic or sexual relationship, I dont think its actually harmful. Like I said before, X is more like an older brother or mentor. I also find it hypocritical of MS to be upset about the age difference in a non-sexual relationship she has bragged to me before about having sexual partners even older than 40. 
I also understand that its weird to be friends with your sisters ex, but again, since nothing inappropriate is happening, I'm not sure I understand the harm.  
So far as the ""older sibling"" title is concerned, I feel like thats just one of the consequences of living your life so destructively, all the drugs and lying all the time. Shes proved her whole life that she isnt a trustworthy person, but now shes upset at me for it. She even blamed me for her behavior by saying that I was never angry enough or outspoken enough, and I didn't try hard enough to stop her.

Am I wrong for still being friends with X? She keeps saying she wants me to do something to fix her and I's relationship now, and also that she won't be happy as long as im still friends with him. What should I do?

Im hesitant to stop talking to him because he's one of my only friends right now, I have a few others but they're all wrapped up in other things and cant actually talk or hang out much. I also dont want to give up finally having someone like an older sibling.

335,"Wife and I have 3 month old daughter. She's our first and last kid. We didn't plan for her. We're both approaching 40. The transition to parenthood has been rough. Im a quant at an investment bank and my wife is a litigator. Kids were not part of our lives nor was patience for anything that consumed the little free time we have. When she was born we both felt some regret. We don't live near family and our local social networks are professional only. Basically we we were on our own and it was much more overwhelming than we thought possible. Over the last 3 months though I've realized how much I love my daughter. I heard her first laugh today and thought I might cry I was so happy about it. I love listening to her make sounds and seeing her wiggle when she gets excited. There are still some deeply frustrating nights but we're learning to handle those better. 

In those early days we didn't understand the importance of patience. We were doing absolutely everything the books said to do to calm our daughter but she was still screaming. We were deeply frustrated and desperate. I yelled at her a few times and probably swayed too aggressively (NEVER shook but my god I was tempted). My wife was in the same boat. Looking back at the last 3 months I can't believe how mean we both sometimes were to our daughter (again to be clear, I'm not talking about hurting her but just letting our frustration boil over a bit). I just feel so much shame that I was so impatient and can't believe how roughly I probably handled her when changing her diaper for the 10th time of the night or trying to calm her down with no success after several hours of crying. One night I just thought f this, she isn't responding to us so let her cry it out. We closed the door and she screamed for probably 15-20 minutes. My wife had enough of that and tried comforting our daughter again. My wife said our little one was sweaty and hot. F. My heart just breaks thinking about her being that worked up.

Anyway, we're really doing much better. We are better at detecting each other's frustration and stepping in to give each other breaks. 

I worry so so much about those days when she was even more delicate than she is now. Did we mess up her bonding? Did I impress on her the idea of anger as a default response?  My wife and I never yell at home. I don't mean just when arguing. If we aren't in the same room we walk to where the other is. We don't yell. We've had this rule for years to maintain a peaceful calm home. When we yelled for our daughter to ""stop crying!"" did we just make it harder for her be somewhere calm is the goal?

I'm very worried about my screw ups in just the past 3 months but I'm scared shitless for the future. What the f do I know about raising a daughter? My dad bailed when I was in middle school. Haven't seen, spoken or heard from or about him in 25 years. So once again, I'm a bit on my own.

I feel more committed to my daughter and family every day so I'm hoping others can give me some advice on how to raise a well adjusted daughter and minimize the number of future screw ups.

336,"Okay so the story is kinda long. It I need help with dealing with the situation and getting over him and forgiving him. So here goes.... me and John (fake name) met about 3 years ago in school. Some how we hit it of right away and would FaceTime all the time. Like we would spent all day at school together, than go home and FaceTime the rest of the night. Eventually we started getting flirty but nothing too serious. Eventually he got a girlfriend. He didn’t want to date her, asked for my opinion and I just said to give it a try. Fast forward to about 4 months ago. We continue to flirt, shit gets very intense between us. We have an undeniable chemistry that even our friends have pointed out even thought that at one point we were secretly dating.  The week prior to the Christmas break were spending everyday together. He would come into school to keep me company and we would work. We had a couple intimate moments that definitely added to buildup of our whatever it was. During this entire time he never acts like he was in a relationship. She was often forgotten about. The last day of school before winter break we all get drunk. He was all over me, wouldn’t stop touching me. He took me to the bedroom and wanted to start something. I shut it down and told him that he needed to act like he was in a relationship, despite my own feelings for him. When we finally got to the bar he continued grabbing me and pulling me aside. Eventually he realized what he was doing wrong and backed away. The next morning he went home before anyone even saw him. And he didn’t talk to me for an entire month. We eventually had a deep talk about the entire situation in which he told me he only thought of me as a friends with benefits (which I found very insulting), and the idea of being with me was just for the thrill. He apologizes for everything and we try to mend things for when school started back up again. Once school started up again he became very mean and cold towards me. Made me feel inadequate and like trash. I would like to believe that he didn’t do it un purpose, but at the same time he directed the same energy that he has towards me to another friend.  Now we’re all in self-isolation. And he calls me for hours. I really like his company and I know we’re just friends an nothing more but a part of me keeps leaning into it. Do I stop talking to him? I’m afraid if I do I’ll loose him completely but I have to make sure that I’m not gonna get hurt because getting over him was very painful.",10Apr2020,1
337,"This is not serious and is obviously quite dumb but I honestly don't know what to say to him without feeling like such a chump. (also this is more of a rant than anything else) For some clarification I love art, I love drawing, writing and anything creative. But my brother loves to undermine many of these hobbies and interests of mine. I get that art is seen as either useless or mediocre as anybody can do it, but I don't need to be reminded of that every day. You see, I want to do something in the entertainment field, creating my stories or directing them. I just want to be part of some project and create something wonderful.

 I understand that it's a huge risk, and has a lot of competition, which is why I'm not entirely set. But I do try, I try learning and bettering myself with new knowledge or trying out things. I'm no prodigy of course, so I work hard. But my brother seems adamant on lowering my self-worth. When I show artwork of mine he says others can do better, he gives no constructive criticism other than people being more capable and creating fluid writing pieces. I am not self-conscious at all, I can handle constructive criticism and blatant insults (most of the time). 

It honestly hits different with a family member though. I and my brother have a healthy and good bond, we have our moments of fighting as many do, but we're honestly quite happy and can talk to one another normally. He also is someone I admire and look up to, and though he doesn't do art such as painting or drawing, his writing is really good. He won $300 from a writing competition with around 2000+ people. He is the smartest person I know and take his ""criticism"" very personally. 

It may be my fault for holding him up in this kind of view and taking his words literally, but it's difficult not to. I just wished he would stop undermining my work and let me evaluate my own flaws. I think it's because he's always been a quick and talented learner which is why he rushes what I do.

342," Hello.

While playing apex I was joined with a person that needed someone to talk to. I will call him J. J talked to me about really serious and traumatic stuff that happened to him. Long story short a person close to him did something awful to J, that person went to jail but hes coming back to his house tomorrow.

Throughout all the conversation I tried to tell him that what happened to him was wrong (in one moment he was actually trying to say that what happened to him was not bad) and to call someone from outside from help. While triying to convince this guy, another person joins the squad and is a relative of J. This new guy says that J shouldnt talk about that stuff to other people. I was in shock after seeing how this relative of J prefered to keep things quiet instead of helping J. I tried to tell J to add me (which he did after a while) and then I use the friends chat and told him about how he should try to talk to someone from outside, to try to look in the internet for a place where he could go and talk about his problems since this piece of shit relative honestly didnt care.

At the end, the relative leaves the squad and I emphasize to J that he should seek help somewhere else (at this point I was almost sure not even his own family will help him with this) and then I HEAR HOW SOMEONE IS KNOCKING HIS DOOR. J tells me hes probably his relative and that he must go. He left the party and then disconnected from apex/origin.

J is from the USA and Im from south america and I dont know how to ask for help for this guy. I only know this guys name, the city where hes from and a personal information about a relative that just maybe could help identify J (probably not). I dont honestly believe this relative of him is going to hurt him or anything but im pretty sure that piece of shit is telling him that what he did is wrong and what happened to him is ok and that he should just let it be.

343,"So for the past few weeks my close friend has been enstranging me after I made a horrible decision to ditch her in the party chat for a girl I was attempting to get with.
Me and this friend have known each other for about a year now. And we at one point dated each other for 3 months early in our friendship. And we decided we should still stay good friends after we broke up.

To make a long story short, a month or 2 ago I decided I wanted to try and date again. I wanted to do this so that I could stop having strong emotions for her and maybe making our friendship a bit stronger. But it ended up doing the exact opposite after I ended up ditching my close friend to talk to this girl I wanted to date.
 I still feel like a worthless friend after doing that and I have never explained to her why I ditched her. And so after that she has basically enstranged me over time while I attempted to make ammends for it.
But just yesterday she deletes me and wont respond to me on anything.
I feel incredibly anxious that I might have ruined the friendship and I just dont know how I can possibly repair it. 
She means alot to me as a friend, is there anyway I can give a heartfelt apology? I have apologized for things quite a few times in the past for dumb decisions when I was still feeling heartbroken.

I’m sorry for bothering you guys but my grandma has been hiding her stage 4 lung cancer from my mom, sister, and me since Christmas of 2019 and didn’t tell us until last month when she was admitted to the hospital. Only because we live in a different state than her and she didn’t want us to all drop everything in our lives to come see her like she knows she would. The corona virus rules in hospitals don’t allow visitors right now which is why I’m not with her right now, plus she said she liked the rule so she could rest and watch tv whenever she wanted and doesn’t feel like she cutting people short with their convos.


To preface I’d like to say that I’ve already lost my great grandparents on the other side of the family, my grandpa, a cousin who was a make a wish kid and got her wish fulfilled by a popular metal band in 2011, two good buddies (one when I was 16 and the other in 2018 when I was in college). So I am familiar with death, I try to avoid thinking about it as much as possible and distance myself; emotionally, cause I know it will hurt like a bitch. I know how the process goes and I just have a deep sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach about her cause I know this isn’t good. 
Also I’m sorry for any grammatical errors or spelling errors cause I’m hammered as hell and crying my eyes out right now. 


I’m not blaming her for not telling us or wanting to tell us of this cause her and I are the exact same and her and I need time to process how to deal with bad news we hear before we tell anyone else. Even those closest to us. She’s been living with her mom (my great grandma (F97 years old)) and her sister (my aunt and god mother (F64))


My mom(48F) went up to take care of her about 2 weeks ago when she got out of the hospital the first time and today I learned she was readmitted to the hospital in worse condition than she came in the first time. My mom says I wouldn’t even be able to recognize her now if I saw her. 


I wanted my grandma to see my graduate college and get married and for her to meet her great grandchildren like my great grandma was able to and I don’t think she’ll be able pull thought because she’s been smoking since she was 14 years old.

I’ve been drying to drink it away from my mind but it’s just too hard to right now and it won’t get out of my head 


I’ve only hear her say she was proud of me once and the last time I talked to her she told me not to lose sight of my path and the path she raised me to be on.

basically what i’m saying is my whole life i wanted to do this one thing i wanted to help people and make impacts on their lives and now i don’t think i want to anymore. and because i’ve spent so much time focused on that job and how i was going to be a nurse, i have no idea what else i could do or what else i’d even be interested in. i’ve been trying to look into some office jobs in hospitals, like read their descriptions and see if i’d be interested. 

office jobs really do have better perks in my opinion. like it’s easier to take time off, the hours are shorter, the hours are also at a better time of day (9-5 roughly) and usually set in stone, also i could potentially make a lot more money in the long run than i would as a nurse. 

i just don’t know if i should just stick with the nursing thing because maybe this is a phase and i’m just getting nervous it’ll be too hard for me to handle or if it’s a serious thing and i need to consider choosing a different future major.

I moved to cairns with my family (my dad, me, my boyfriend and his mum- its complicated, they're not married, and were not related at all) in December last year, however things flopped, big time. 
My then boyfriend who came with us (M22 - the same one above) basically ran around in circles with our relationship and eventually called it quits...twice. the first time was to kick both me and my father out, which, upon learning I was going to take care of my unemployed, car-less and broke dad, took me back and basically reconciled everything with me. There were a lot of tears and hugging and apologising. I accepted this and for the next two weeks was essentially walking on eggshells. I had spoken to his mother about the way he had been making me feel and she was...less than impressed. The second time was during when he was having a uh...Nang Phase (hopefully you know what that is) and during that time he broke it off again. So I made the decision to move interstate, to live with my mum. During the moment I made the desicion and up until I boarded my flight, he and I were acting no different from when we were together. Again, there was lots of tears, lots of hug, kisses and comforting each other. So once I arrived the first two weeks were fine, and he (who I thought was still my boyfriend) made the desicion to move to Another State. During the first two weeks of him staying somewhere, we were talking every day, calling most nights, saying intimate things to each other(such as talking about living together next year, he told me he would treat me like a queen when we lived together, calling me an angel, goddess, and generally loving things like that), and genuinely are(were?) still very much in love. But now, he has since moved to live with family three days ago and since then I have basically been put to the side and ignored. He still tells me he loves me sometimes, however this is not often, we hardly call, talk or anything. And today I decided to confront him about it as I was feeling quite hurt and confused. 
I approached him about needing to talk and call about something today, as I have been rather upset these past few days and dealing with feeling of rejection. This was the gist of the conversation:
He proceeded to tell me we were not together, called me crazy (I was very upset by this as I have dealt with mental health issues previously), mocked me at one point of the call and was overall hardly responding maturely, if at all. It was extremely difficult. I tried explaining the circumstances, how I was feeling, and told him that I wanted to let him know, as I was sure he would understand and wouldnt be doing this on purpose. His main excuse was ""I'm just chilling, I'm relaxing"" and just basically moaning and whining about the fact we had to have a serious conversation. The call lasted 45 minutes, basically going around in circles. Towards the end I heard someone come in, a family member and he then said to me ""this call has gone on for way too long, i have friends over"" which were his family members he was living with.
And I know for a fact that he is smoking pot there, which is another concern I had. So i got pretty angry at that statement and said ""Fine. Go and smoke then."" And he said ""okay? Bye..?"" And I said BYE and put the phonedown, and then proceeded to break down in front of my mother who was clearly upset herself and didnt know what to do. 
Redditors, am I the asshole? Am I too clingy? If anyone needs more context let me know..but I'm extremely hurt. What is the best cause of action? I'm really confused and the way I have been feeling lately has been terrible. I am extremely lonely here and have no friends, I cant afford to do anything or go anywhere, and am restricted to these four walls. I tried explaining that, and explained that its not his fault, but to just be aware that these are my circumstances... 
Please help, this is killing my heart.

Tl;dr : My boyfriend(M22) has exhibited a huge change in behaviour towards me(F17) and I am really hurt and confused about how to handle this and what is best.",10Apr2020,1
351,"I met a guy on bumble back in early 2019, since he’s in the military he would visit my town once a month on the weekends for drill. When he asked me out on a skating date I had a great time even though i kept falling and ended up getting bruised. Fast forward to fall of 2019, i transfer to a university in the city of my dreams which also less than a 30 minute drive from this guy. He would take me home every time he had drill and took me back up with him when it was time for him to go home. During one of our drives home it suddenly hit me that i was attracted to him, without him doing or saying anything to invoke it. We more os less told each other that we both have crushes on one another, and there really wasn’t a rush to get into a relationship. We shared intimate moments and my favorite moments were being able to wake up next to him in the morning. He’s an outgoing introvert, he has many friends so there aren’t a lot of times where he’s free. After the semester was over I was out of luck when it came to staying at my university until graduation due to the tuition + dorming fee they wanted me to pay. I had to move back home away from the city and my crush. He still does have to come up to my hometown once a month, but now due to the virus, everything has been postponed. One thing that bothers me is that i feel that we cannot be fully transparent and open with each other, I personally keep all of my mental illness issues to myself but one day i mentioned to him how when it comes to eating im a bit “weird” with it. His response wasn’t much, and it pushed me to avoid confiding in him. Im used to guys who are interested in me texting me everyday or almost everyday, but for my crush and i we don’t do that at all. I added him to a group chat with my close friends and some days he’s more active there than other days. He used to give me long paragraphs which were updates about what was currently going on in his life, but now that doesn’t seem to happen anymore. For me, all i can really talk about are video games, tv shows, and how im feeling since there isn’t much that goes on in my life. On our last date we went out to eat, and when we reached my house we sat in the car, joked around, kissed, and just tried to enjoy each others company because he had plans with then military that involved him being out of state for a few months (pre corona). During this talk i told him to wait for me, give me 1-2 years and i think we’ll be able to date. The only reason why i told him this is because every-time I’ve tried a long distance relationship, the other person gives up on me and we just can’t make it work. By giving him 1-2 years that is enough time for me to get my degree and either move back to the city or on the outskirts. Due to past and current friendships i feel like all the effort in keeping these relationships/friendships alive come from me and that i have to be the one who starts up a conversation. I’ve gotten tired of it but at the same time im so terribly lonely. My pride prevents me from begging from attention and constantly trying engage in conversations with people daily. Every night i contemplate if im doing the right thing by putting myself in some sort of weird limbo with my crush, we aren’t dating but we aren’t trying to flirt or date with other people. I’m at the point of my life where i want to get to know him more, maybe fall in love, and settle down with him. Im scared that me trying to communicate how i feel about where we are may push him away, or give him too much to think about. Part of me really wants to see if love is right for me, and another part thinks i should figure myself out first (deal with my mental health issues) and then give it a try. If we end up not doing anything or getting anywhere, i refuse to go back to dating apps to find a significant other. I’ve pretty much given up on looking for that someone to spend my life with and I’m not afraid of having to live my life alone. Should i just write him an essay on how i feel? Do i wait these 1-2 ywars and see how life plays out and then try to see if a relationship is right for us? I am stuck and I do not know what to do.",10Apr2020,1

353,"Okay so my entire country has been on lockdown for a month, and I can't go outside (except maybe going for a walk around the block once or twice a day let's say). At first it wasn't so unbearable, but now I am starting to realise how much time I waste on my phone every day: I am constantly on reddit/instagram and when I get bored of those two apps I basically don't know what to do, so I figured out I could use this time to ""detox"" from my phone and decided not to use it at all in the morning and limit its use during the afternoon and evening.  

But now (as expected) I just feel like I don't know what to do... the hours are long and I feel like I am already doing a lot of ""good things"": I have read two books just in the last week and I'm very proud of this as I'm usually a quite slow reader, I've picked up the guitar, which I hadn't played in weeks, I experimented in cooking, and started playing video games again (I don't want to use my phone but I still have the pc, so I'm not completely ""isolated"") but after a while all these things just get boring and I'd like to find other things to do.

And so I'm like ""what am I supposed to do now"". I'm not a therapist and if I send this person links it would feel like I'm trying to shoo away from him.

355,"  

Hi Reddit. I really hate it when I bring down the mood for anyone but, I kind of need help.

I had a lot of plans and goals to meet this year. I wanted to move out, go beyond my undergrad in terms of education, get a better job, etc. I was so excited. Now though, COVID will delay this stuff for a long time. I know that it won’t end next month, or the next, or the one after that. 

I now find myself in a very dark place where I’m not too familiar with. I want to give up and start doing stuff that will not help my situation and the fight against COVID. I want to drink, I want to go out have mindless sex, do drugs, etc. I know it’s not the answer but, I just feel like giving it all up. I lost myself and, I feel like this is a cry for help. I am really trying my best not only for myself but, for others.

I now find myself on chat sites and online therapy sites and, I start to feel terrible for all the people that are on here too. Who have nobody to talk to, to let out their problems, who are hurting. Now I am one of those people, searching for something to help ease the pain. Yet despite knowing that I need help, I still lend a hand to those people and forget about myself in the process. 

I talked to one friend that I thought was close but, it just feels like she doesn’t care or doesn’t know what to say. I told her I was depressed and stuff but, idk. It’s been almost a week now and she hasn’t even checked one me once, not even a single call then too. I kind of feel let down and, tbh I’m telling myself I can’t be sad right now. My family needs positivity and I am doing my best for them. 

I’m telling myself, maybe I made the wrong friends, maybe I chose the wrong path in life but, that’s not a way to think and live life is it?

I’ve been sleeping 13+ hours a day, eating 1 meal a day, constant headaches. Laughing at things that aren't funny. Can't seem to look people in the eyes anymore. Severe depression probably.

I know my problems are probably not as bad as others but, I really do feel dead inside. What are other ways I can help myself escape this place during this time. Thank you Reddit.

356,"So, pretty much I was with my girlfriend until she broke up with me, then like couple months later she was with someone already but then during the summer like June she confessed to me that she still had feelings for me and I did too, our breakup wasn’t necessary at all (we were together for 1 year and 8 months) and since the summer I’ve been having talks with her about her real feelings and she told me she doesn’t feel anything for the guy, that she lied to him about seeing a future with him and liking him.

I was arguing with my husband often, I needed to take melatonin to get to sleep, extremely depressed and miserable. After going to 1 day a week, the arguments pretty much stopped, and I got myself on a regular sleeping schedule and my happiness improved. 

Now, I’m working 3-4 days a week because I’m allowed to work from home (only allowed if I work multiple days a week, was the deal my supervisors made me) and my husband encouraged me to take the deal for extra cash. I’m pregnant now, still in college, doing an internship. I took the deal anyways for my husbands sake. Every day I have a break down, my bosses bully me into taking shifts I hate (overnight) and if I say no, threaten to make me come back in to work. My husband and I fight, and My sleeping schedule is gone. I actually haven’t slept tonight, I couldn’t get my mind to shut off.

even though the few people I managed to contact have said they don't have my pics saved or anything. I still feel lots of guilt and shame over these actions and pics, I hate what I did and keep imagining how it could come back and destroy my life. what if they are online somewhere and my parents see (they're extremely religious) or somebody decides to send them the pics (this would be the worst I constantly dread my parents finding out somehow), what if police show up one day because something went wrong... i've read stalking stories as well lol.

I know these are all far fetched and its been over 3 months, i've been told if anything was gonna happen it would have by now but I can't help worrying and my anxiety is getting worse and I can't help but imagine the worst.

380,"Over the past few years I feel like I have slowly lost interest in things I used to love. I used to play videogames on a daily basis and listen to rock music. I used to enjoy watching films. I used to like playing football in the park with my mates (I just view myself as too old to do this now since I am 26) Im beginning to think maybe it is depression but I don’t feel depressed. I have actually being depressed before and it doesn’t feel like that, I feel happy. 

But with these things I have mentioned. I’ve seen every rock band I’ve ever wanted to see and I’ve listened to the music so many times. I don’t like the new artists. It just feels like I have exhausted it out. Like I have listened to Metallica songs probably over 100 times so It doesn’t give me the buzz it used to. Same with movies I’ve seen every movie I’ve ever wanted to. I’ve even watched movies that wouldn’t appeal to me at all. Then with videogames new ones come out all the time yet it doesn’t feel the same. 

I’m beginning to think I have exhausted my hobbies. I want to like them so much still. I’ve got a massive back catalogue of videogames, I still buy them yet don’t want to play them. I keep thinking my love for them will come back but it doesn’t. I don’t have interest in anything else though. I have tried to get new hobbies but nothing interests me. I like to watch football and play fantasy with my mates and go driving in my car. But I’ve got so much free time especially now in lockdown. I’m just sat here bored lol. 

I think it’s because I’ve don’t these hobbies for so long. When you first start out on something it’s brilliant but it fades with time. My mates are the same regarding videogames we played them for so many years but now it’s not the same. I just hope I am not depressed.",10Apr2020,1

388,"My friend and I have been friends for 4 years without any problems. Recently, we got into a huge argument. 

In short, he ditched me for other people 5 times and didn’t answer my calls nor texts. I don’t mind that he didn’t answer my calls, or hangs out with others. However, a simple:

“I’m hanging out with other people, ttyl”

Would be fine, but he confessed and said he ignored my attempts completely.

When we finally hung out after 3 days, he left 30 mins in and said, “the other group is having a karaoke night, I’ll call you once it’s done. It’ll take an hour to two hours”

I waited until 4 am my time, and not once did he say anything. Afterwards, he ghosted me for two more days. Whenever we finally talked, he kept mentioning this group did this, I did this with other people, etc. EVERY SINGLE TIME HE CAN.

Whenever I hung out with him, he’d chat and talk to this group in the background. I’d tell him something important, and he’d say:


“Say that again, I was talking to this person in X group”

Even writing this makes me cry, and I don’t understand what I did wrong to him.

I asked him why, and he said he was lazy. But he wasn’t lazy for the other group? His best friend said he tried multi tasking and can’t give his full attention to things. But when he hangs out with the other group, he’d give his full attention to them. He told me I expect too much from him, which I don’t. I only expect him to be honest, loyal and trustworthy. A simple, “I’m hanging out with others” would suffice. 

He even stood me up when he said, “ I’ll hangout with you later.”

I told him how I felt, and I can tell he felt bad. But I want an explanation why he did things. He’s always explained why he did things when he finds out it’s bad. I don’t understand. I genuinely tried my best to be a good friend. I never complained when he first ditched. I never questioned anything. I always follow through with plans. I never ditched. 

It sucks, because if he can’t explain why, to me it just sounds like: They were better than you, so I chose them over you.


He apologized, but I want to forgive. I just can’t though. It genuinely hurts and every time my close friends ask about this, I just cry. I don’t know why he did this, he’s never done this before. I don’t know what to do.",10Apr2020,1

Okay so I need a little help. Mainly advice on what I should do.

If this thread is too long then skip to the TL;DR







I live in a VERY conservative household and my parents consider people who have relationships at ANY age a sin. Basically, your only option is an arranged marriage and keep your virginity until then.

Being a teen, I naturally didn't resonate with that idea and I had a girlfriend by the time I was 13. We were as serious as a relationship at that age could be and we really REALLY liked each other. After a year we finally decided we wanted to have sex because she was going to move away during the summer and it was sorta like a parting thing. 

Between then my parents found out that I was in a relationship because I had gotten into a fight with someone at school because they were harassing my girlfriend. They gave me a long hard lecture and told me to break up with her. I didn't really want to do that, so I lied to them and told them I did. 

We continued being together after she moved but (being teens) we had started sexting. I made sure that I was respectful and I made sure that not even my closest friends knew about it. Eventually, my family noticed that I was always messaging someone so they got my siblings to unlock my phone using my finger while I was asleep. 

They went through my phone and they found the photos of my girlfriend and told me to delete everything. Obviously, this was new to me and I was scared as sh*t. I told my girlfriend about what they had told me and deleted everything. A week later, (during my exams) I woke up to find that my phone was missing. When I do downstairs I see my mom with my phone and I already knew that sh*t was about to go downhill. 

APPARENTLY, when I deleted everything off my phone I didn't account for the backed up images on my Google drive (which I don't even use). My mom started going apesh*t on me and I started to panic. She threatened that since we were both minors, she could press charges on me for child pornography. 

To me, it seemed like my world had just ended. If I stay with my girlfriend, I destroy my future of being able to attend ANY university. If not, I lose someone who I loved. This put me in a state of shock and I started having a panic attack. (Shaking, cold sweat, you name it) My mom was basically in a mindset of disownment so she just told me to get lost.  

I cried and cried and cried that night trying to pick which one I should choose. I decided that since I had exams coming up, I should forget about it right now, and deal with it once they're over. I didn't really have any other option. 

However, once exams were over I was so emotionally scarred that thinking of that night felt like I was about to have another panic attack. To me, it just felt like a traumatic event. After the night of the exams my girlfriend never heard from me again. It took me 3 months to even build up enough courage to message my girlfriend and tell her what happened. She was super sad, but I was too scared to go back into a relationship with her at the time. 

I felt so broken, betrayed, backstabbed, and defeated. My older brother was someone who I always thought I could trust while growing up, yet even he turned his back on me. My relationship with my mom also turned very toxic. (Obviously)

I felt very lonely and I started socially isolating. To be honest, I was in such a miserable state that I probably would've committed suicide not so long after. Thank God, I had some fucking AMAZING friends who although knew nothing about what was happening with me, they were always by my side. 

After a few months, I realized that and started going out with my friends to help ease the toxicity and suffocation I felt at home. It helped me get my mind off the stressful things and it was one of the first times I started to feel happy again after a long time. 

A year after I had the panic attack and ""broke up"" with my girlfriend, she messaged me again to ask how I was. We started talking for a bit and eventually she asked me if we wanted to get back together. By this point I had told some of my friends everything and they agreed with the idea of me getting back with her. 

I was pulling through quite well with my girlfriend because my friends were by my side, but recently (coronavirus) I haven't been able to hangout with them or leave the house. The toxicity from staying at home with my parents has started to creep back into me and fears of what would happen if they find out again. Because of this, I randomly just stopped messaging my girlfriend and even though I want to, I just can't bring myself to message her. 

Additional information: 
   - about to turn 16
   - live in Ontario, Canada (for laws)





TL;DR - Mom finds nudes of my girlfriend and threatens to destroy my future. I have a panic attack while she's lecturing me. I'm forced to break up with my girlfriend and I emotionally suffer for several months. Eventually my friends help me with the toxicity I faced at home and I get back with girlfriend. Coronavirus has stopped me from destressing and now fears of my parents finding out that I'm back with my girlfriend have stopped me from talking to her. 

This is a pretty shitty TL;DR so if you wanna know the details you're gonna have to read the full thing. 







My main reasons for posting this here is to ask for advice on what I should do. 


Also, is it normal for me to be experiencing the feelings I am given the circumstances, or do I have a mental illness? 
My friends have mentioned to me before that it seems like I have PTSD with the trauma being the day I had the panic attack. 
While this does seem sort of reasonable, I've been scared to contact any adults who could help me because basically anyone who would be able to help me would be legally obliged to contact my parents. (And obviously, I can't have that happen) 


Do you think I should risk it and seek help, or is there another way of dealing with the situation? 


Should I stay with my girlfriend? (We are very close and she has helped me with numerous tough times that I haven't mentioned in this post)",10Apr2020,1

In September last year i couldn’t find a reason to get out of bed, i felt like i was just doing the same thing over and over again, I gave up on myself and it took me going to a whole different country for 3 weeks to sort it out. I was doing a lot better but for the past 2 months i’ve dealt with it again, i quit my job because it was a really bad place to work but that’s a whole other story. I just need advice on how to find the motivation to keep going, i don’t want to leave my bed in the mornings, i don’t want to talk to my friends or my family i feel like i don’t have the energy for it. The only time i’m at peace with my thoughts is when i’m laying in bed staring at my ceiling. I don’t want to get dressed or put any effort into my days. I’m never really outside either, i take my dog for a walk in the evening and then i crawl back into bed.

There are some very fine females at work and I can’t talk smooth as silk to every single one of them no problem but SHE just leaves me speechless. Tha first time I ever saw her I almost dropped a customers food tray on him! I got to talking to K and got to know her a bit but didn’t know if she had herself a man so my friend asked her stepsister who also works there if she did. I guess it’s apparent I like her because her stepsis came out looking for me right away to tell me she knew I was the one asking. She without a doubt told her, which terrified me because I wasn’t sure she liked me that way. Come to figure she asked me for my snap! I also got her Instagram and even better one of my homegirls, who we’ll call Gina, was talking to her and she told me K was talking about how cute I was and how she was looking to get herself a man. On top of that my homegirl Gina also told K about me telling her I could talk to any other female but how she just leaves me speechless, that apparently almost made her cry cuz she found it cute. And even better K asked Gina to tell me about all she had said to make it apparent she liked me back quite a bit! But now I’m lost as to how to get this to be a relationship! I’ve had girlfriends in tha past but none made me feel the way K do and like I said I just freeze up and get left speechless with her.

I’ve been an off an on relationship with the same guy for 6 years. 

Tonight I’ve locked myself inside my bathroom to post this

My boyfriend has been forcing me to have sex with him. I tell him NO. Absolutely not. I tell him I don’t want to I say if you love me you’ll respect me and he still forces himself onto me. 

Tonight it happened again, so I moved into the living room to sleep and he followed me in and kept harassing me telling me to sleep in the room with him that I’m over reacting and he won’t go away. 

I’ve told him that what he is doing is molesting me, because he is doing it without my consent. 
I told him I needed some space and he refused to leave my site.

I am having such a bad anxiety attack right now. I’ve been asking him to leave but he always refuses to, he has been staying with me during the quarantine and is refusing to leave.

I’m a commuter college student but school, the gym, and exercise, was my escape and now I can’t even leave the house for obvious reasons.

Could someone please explain this weird phenomenon where throughout the day I’ll be horribly tired and sluggish, but when my parents and siblings go to bed at night and I feel awake, it’s like I can breath and just relax. I’m just basically waiting everyday till they go upstairs to sleep or whatever, just so I feel like I can be myself and just not have anybody judge me, criticize me, annoy me, etc. I literally feel like o sigh a relief and like a weight off my shoulders bc I know I won’t be bothered or pestered with, at least until the next day.

I don’t even like being in conversation with my mom anymore bc it always turns into something I’m doing wrong, what I’m not doing right, how lazy I am, etc. I have a worse relationship with my dad but he likes to keep his distance from me and I don’t like talking to him either, but when he sees that I’m depressed it seems like he likes to poke fun at me even more. My brothers and sisters are just high schoolers but they like to cause an unbelievable amount of noise and my sister is literally almost like a police officer and she’ll clarify and interrogate during arguments and things. 

I just isolate myself in my room and lay in bed all day, and they’re completely oblivious to their actions or to the fact that I’m depressed. They just see it as me being lazy and not wanting to do hw. I kind of feel the same way when I’m not in their presence and like they pick me apart so much, and I just can’t stand it anymore. With school being online it’s almost impossible to be productive and my grades have been falling but I can’t bring myself to care.

I stupidly decided to bleach my hair white (I’m naturally a light blonde) and for some reason the hair dresser needed to bleach it twice and even then we still couldn’t get the blonde colouring out. 

The damage that came because of this is indescribable. I was having full brush loads sometimes two loads of hair coming out in one shower. My hair was tearing and ripping apart and is completely destroyed. 

Back in July 2019 I had gone in to bleach &amp; tone my hair from a dark brassy colour to a slightly dull version of Khaleesi and the most I experienced was my hair being a little straw like for a couple days. My hair was so incredibly smooth the day I got it to so the result I received after this appointment (this happened early March) was not expected whatsoever. 

A large chunk of the top of my head is basically just a finger long (my hair reaches my sternum) which makes it impossible for me to do anything with my hair, I run my hands through it and I’m pulling out strands with my fingernails, no matter how many showers I take my hair is never smooth. It never looks good anymore, it basically looks like what you’d find on some emo band’s guitarist and I absolutely hate it. 

I honestly just want to shave it all off or cut it short, my hair is what made me confident with myself and now it’s fucked beyond repair.

A few months back I was on a website where you could get an inmate as a penpal, and I figured it would be a good idea since I was bored.

I ended up saying yes, thinking it wouldn’t end up happening (this was last year) and that everything would somehow work itself out. After all, May was like 8 months away, lots of time for one of us to figure something out for alternate living arrangements.

Hello, uh this is a really stupid post, please forgive me, I just feel like this could snowball into a bigger problem.

As the title says, I think I’m developing a split personality. I’ll label my personalities as Personality 1 (shy, nervous, clumsy) and Personality 2 (stoic, cynical, aloof).

When I first meet someone/out in public, I’m normally 1 but upon getting closer to someone start to become more like 2, however these can switch around a lot, so sometimes I’ll be 2 to start with etc.

To make things worse, I’ve made split social media fan accounts for my personalities. I have one account where I’m in my 1 personality and another where I’m 2.

If I act too much like 1, I’ll force myself to go into 2, and vice versa.

I don’t have any health issues and I don’t know why this is happening. I’m getting worried because I’ve never felt this way before and there’s nothing I feel that could trigger this. I wish I could go back to being a kid when I was just quiet and I’d really appreciate anyone’s help.

404,"So my job at a bookstore has me furloughed for an unknown period of time. I’ve worked there for 4 years and while I’ve always considered getting another job alongside it, I never found any opportunities. But because of COVID-19 I went out and got a new job at a company I’ve worked for before, I hated it the first time around but different warehouse and different work. I only took it because it was a ton of pay because it’s an essential business.

But the past 3 days there were ok. The trainers left me and the group of new hires alone with nothing to do for over an hour, it was already frustrating with that until they found work for us to do. But the job they put me on for actual work involves driving a forklift that lifts you and a cage 30 feet high. I passed the training yesterday (took 3 hours of training) and today I feel like I was just sorta thrown onto the forklift and told to work what I can.

I panicked after 2 hours of sorta knowing what I was doing (I had training for the machine and the work I had to do, but together with actual work was overwhelming) and parked the machine and said I needed a moment. My trainer was nice and asked me what was up but I just really felt rushed and isn’t know what to do.

And now I’m debating if I go back to work on Monday or quit. Driving the machine in training felt metaphorically like learning to drive a car, but then today felt like I got dumped driving in a freeway by myself.  This job is for sure temporary, I could use extra money, but I really don’t know if I’m comfortable. I mean I had a panic attack over it.

It’s frustrating, it goes against my natural work ethic to not give up. But at my old job when they just threw me at something new, it wasn’t anything that involved equipment that could hurt a person if handled improperly. I don’t know if I should hold on because I need the money or just quit and get unemployment for the time being and look for something more customer orientated...",10Apr2020,1

407,"Okay so there’s this girl I really like more than any girl I’ve ever liked. I told her last year how I felt but I was stupid about it I was drunk and couldn’t hold it in from telling her when on the phone. Anyway needless to say she didn’t feel the same way. After time passed we were just friends and I didn’t really like her anymore and we just texted occasionally. We’re both seniors in high school btw. Anyway a few days ago I called her when I was drunk and was talking to her and I remember why I liked her and started to get feelings. I told her at first that I don’t like her anymore she doesn’t have to worry about that, and it was true, but the more I talked to her the more I liked her. I wrote her some poetry when I was drunk which she enjoyed but to show her that I wasn’t just being dumb and drunk I wrote her two other poems when sober over the next few days. We talked on the phone for hours each night and last night when her bf called she said oh sorry I have to go real quick, then she texted me saying sorry and that her bf called because he just got off but that she was going to tell him to call in the morning. Then she didn’t call me for like an hour and said she her boyfriend hung up on her to play video games with his friends, then said he texted her back saying his phone died. Then today she was telling me about how she was annoyed the other day and I asked why and eventually she told that her bf stopped talking to her to play games with his friends, but that she thinks she was overacting. Tonight we were talking for a few hours and she’s like sorry my bf is calling I’ll call you back. But then she doesn’t call me back for 3 hours (3 am) and tells me how something happened but she’s really embarrassed about it. I had a feeling I know what she was talking about, and I was right. She said my bf asked me to take photos for him and she had never done that for her and I was surprised she would say that to me. She said her bf made fun of the pictures she sent and said “Do I need to send you example so you know how to take them” (I know real dick I wanna knock his teeth in tbh). Then she said I’m sorry to be honest I just don’t have many friends to which I replied sarcastically “I had no idea!” (I’m an asshole but I was pissed that she told me this, felt disrespectful since I was writing her all these love poems and telling her that I enjoy talking to her). But what I would like is some advice as to what I should do. I was thinking about just saying fuck it, give up on trying to date her and just tell her “for future reference when a guy writes you love poems and talks to you for hours all right when he has other girls trying to talk to him it means he likes you and not to say these personal things about your relationship to him”. I know that would make me look super lame and hurt any shot I may have with her, but I think it’s best to give up since why the hell would she tell me about sending photos to this guy when I’m clearly showing that I like her. Just really pissed me off and I promised not to tell anyone so I can’t get advice from anyone except anonymously so please help me out with any advice. I can provide any more details or the poems just if you’d like to see my dumb ass poetry lol. Cheers guys


TLDR: Girl I have really like for a long time who didn’t like me when I asked her out last year I recently started talking to a lot again. Over the past few night I have been talking to her on the phone for hours  and reading love poems I wrote for her to her and she liked them and when I asked if I should stop making them if it’s awkward since she has a bf she said no. She complained to me about her bf not talking to her to play games, so clearly he’s not giving her enough attention. Tonight she said she would call me back after her bf called since he got off work and then took 3 hours to call me back (3am). And she told me that he asked for pictures and she had never sent them before and he made fun of the pictures she sent, asking her if he needs to send her examples of how to do it right. So should I just stop trying with this girl since it is there still a shot that she would go for me. Really pissed me off that she would tell me something like that, but she’s either too blind to see that I like her and sees me as a friend she can confide something like that in, or she is trying to make me jealous. I think her being blind is more likely, I think she only likes me as a friend. Any advice is greatly appreciated since I can’t go to anyone else because I promised not to tell anyone else.

I’ve been a bad friend, girlfriend. I’ve lost good friends. 
My amazing boyfriend has forgiven me and had given me a chance as to be a new person.

However I keep dwelling on the past.

I’ve also been such a bad friend and taken things too far by gossiping about a close friend who used to be controlling but I ended up taking things too far by gossiping about to another girl who used to be my bestfriend.
I did end up feeling bad about it and wanted to change things.

However karma hit me when one of my other friends make a rumour about me to my bestfriend that’s when my bestfriend exposed everything I said about the friend me and her gossiped about. But made it seem like I did most of it. She did end up apologising and we are some what civil now but in the end I did mess up a good friendship.
My bestfriend at the time also told my other friend I said something bad about her which I know I didn’t ! But after apologising she said she does remember  me saying something bad about about that friend but understands if I can’t remember.

Anyways I’ve also been a bad girlfriend. I used to always go out partying and clubbing with my bestfriend even prioritising her over my boyfriend. The thing was the whole going out clubbing, partying was something that was new to me. In the beginning I never even took the relationship seriously as I was new to the whole serious relationship and boys things. 
It wasn’t until my eyes starting opening and I starting falling for him more and more. I ended up feeling so much guilt and confessed to him! Even things that weren’t my fault. And things that were my fault! I told him! I admit it did start of small but eventually I told him. He forgave men saying he understood I had an immature mind set and saw changes in me 3 months before I confessed. However made it clear if this was to happen again. It would be over.
I did try to leave because I didn’t want him to suffer or deal with pain although I did not want to But he insisted we work on things and be both decided we have a fresh start ! 
It’s been 6 months since our fresh start. 
We have been together for over a year a bit but have decided to start over and count our fees start! 

However I feel like I can’t forgive my self. I feel selfish and stupid ! 
I keep trying to make sure I didn’t miss telling him anything! I keep over analysing. It goes away and then comes back. My boyfriend has completely forgiven and moved past. considering we are both young and said that he understands and that now it’s a new beginning for me as I’ve matured. 
Doesn’t care if I missed anything or didn’t. Doesn’t want me analysing it and wants me to move past it! 
He mentioned he doesn’t want me to repeat or dwell as it’s going to ruin my mental health.

I can’t stop !! It’s back again today.

I also have OCD , ROCD and intrusive thoughts which doesn’t make it any better! This makes me having to relive my mistakes a certain number of times in order to temporarily feel at peace! Not that these things excuse me at all but makes it hard for me to move past.

And to make it clear I will never ever never repeat my same mistakes!!!!
My boyfriend has told me to stop and I don’t wanna keep annoying him!
Because of quarantine as well I haven’t been able to see my counsellor!  

I want to forget but this is going to live on me forever for being a shitty person! 

As for my friend I have tried contacting them but haven’t gotten a response. 

I’ve forgiven my bestfriend as I feel like I need to also forgive and move past !",10Apr2020,1

Those are the screenshots and they are making rounds. I want to anonymously send them to his wife before she finds out from someone showing her. Are they even enough to prove him cheating? He has cheated on her before/during/after her beating stage 4 cancer with not just this woman. I just don’t want to be the messenger so I want to be anonymous. 

Would you freak out knowing your man was sending these messages? 
Would you want to know?",10Apr2020,1
414,"Not an english speaker, so sorry if there was a lot of mistakes. So, looooooong story, I was in a 6 year relationship since I was barelly a teenager. We date since when we are 13 years old, until 19. It was a complicated relationship with a lot of abusive and toxyc moments. Things ended when he cheated on me and I discover he was dating another girl for more than a month.

I was extremely heartbroken and alone, just moved to another city to live with my GM, so i was depressed. I basically stayed in my room all day, and skip classes most of the days, and develop and an alcoohol problem. 

In all this time i just had 1 friend (26M, and I was 19F at the time of breakup). It was an online friend that I met in a facebook group, and I never told about him to my ex, because he has literally been my only friend for about 3 or 4 years. We are very close and talk every day since we became friends, always supporting each other.

So, at this time, he was always advicing me and trying to help with his own experience (he was depressed too, but got better after a lot of things) and I start doing therapy. We actualy met in person when he comes to my city because of his job, and in one of his visits, we hook up and he confess that he always liked me. I said that i eas confused and not ready to this bc of my previous relationship.

Time passes, and we became even more close, and one day he said that he was moving to my town bc of his job and having me there just make the decision more easy (he lived far away from my city). I was shooked but happy too. When he moved we started to go out a lot, hook up and all kind of thing that couples do, he even got to know my family (and they liked him a lot).

The problem was, i never felt 100%. He was always asking me if i would like to date him and have a serious relationship, but i was really scared and does not feeling that it was right, so i always said no, and explain myself  So, christmas was coming, and he appears at my house with relationship rings (it was a natural thing in my country to use boyfriend and girlfriend rings), and ask me to date him in front of my family. I was so shooked and felt extremely pressured, so i accept... a month passes and I was not feeling well with my decision, so I talked to him and sayd that I wanted to break up. He was devasted, sad, and sayd that i need to think bettter, that we could took a break for me to think. 

I already knew that i will probably wont change my mind about this, since I was not feeling well at all. I went to a hollyday trip with my brother, that was planned for an year, and we went to my aunts house, in a beatiful city with a lot of beachs. It was the perfect time for me to relax and think. I hang out i lot with my brother and cousins, and was having a really good time. One week later, i already had met all of my cousins friends, and a random guy appears (one of his friends that was back from a trip). We spend hours talking that day, and the next day, and the other. Basically we have A LOT in commom, like, a lot . So, in my last day there, we had sex and I felt things that i does not felt with my atual-ex-i dont know boyfriend.

When i come back, i officially break up with him, but i never told about the other guy. This happens more than a year ago, and my ex was very upset with me, especially bc we could not be friends anymore.

So, with the quarentine, i could not stop to think about him. He was in the risk group of corona, and lives alone, all his family is in another state, and he never was a person who has many friends. I really wanted to check on him, but i know that he probably is still upset, and i do not know if i should speak to him, especially because i dont talk about what happened in my vacation and i feel guilty all this time. So, should i talk to him? He tryed to talk to me last year, after 7 months of the breakup, but he was still upset and we ended up fighting, with him saying that it was a bad idea to talk to me. I really like him as a friend, and will always care about him and remember the things that he did for me, we were best friend for 4 years and hooked up for 1 year, and I always wanted to try to clarify things, but i am worryed that this can be bad for him. Advices?",10Apr2020,1
415,"posted this on r/relationshipadvice as well, didnt get any responses 

so i started secondary, and me and this one guy really clicked, like best friends almost instantly. We would hang out everyday, you'd always see us side by side type crap. The joke was that i was the akita and he was the shiba (two identical dogs, but the akita is bigger than the shiba). Then idek how it happened we just started drifting like really slowly. we would talk over phone and do homework together and we started to argue about random dumb shit. i started to like this girl, and he accidentally sent her a bunch of mugs (bad photos) of me. I kinda flipped out at him, but his argument was so bad. he was saying because it was an accident it wasnt wrong of him to do?! and another time we were mucking about and crap at school. I took his pasta, he started hitting me, but with no really malicious intent, dumb stuff. This teacher sees us, and we both get in trouble. I wasnt that scared because this had happened to me before, but it was his first time getting in big trouble, and i dont think he'll ever forgive me. Things were a bit bitter between us for a while, but we made up and were still really good friends. We started spacing out again kinda and he became really good friends with another guy, same with me, but we are still good friends. For a small while now, he just like hasnt been responding to my messages, and if he does he responds dryly. I just, i want to go back to how it was you know, i miss always being side by side and i feel bad. did i do something wrong? idfk. we arent the most open about emotions and idk i just feel really bad. im rambling ill stop. sorry this was written very badly.

417,"  

So, this is a Throwaway account but anyways, a few months ago my mother found out that she had (I am going to call it a disease here) a disease. For a weird reason she only told me and because it is possibly genetically transmittable, she wanted me to get tested, I am 15 and I don't have any symptoms linked to that disease, so I refused. She never asked my sister to get tested for some reason but a few months ago I noticed my little sister, who normally looked up to me, become disrespectful and making comments linked to the disease. I noticed more and more of the people around me looking down on me and making hints about how I am feeling and if I can do certain things because of the disease. I am unbelievably hurt and angry at my mother and have already confronted her once about it (while my dad was present because he still has my back and doesn't believe my mother) and my mother denied telling the people around me. Still my sister is getting more disrespectful by the day and I don't know what to do to make everybody believe that I don't have any problems. I also am, for some reason starting to doubt myself like maybe there is something wrong with me and I think it manipulates me.

418,"Some background info first i guess. I went to Elementary School with this girl and we were decent friends and in traditional youth fashion i had a massive crush on her for the whole time, come middle school (start of 7th grade) I was suddenly relocated to a diffrent town (Read family issues) and never got the chance to say goodbye. Any way, i went on with my life still thinking about her once in a while and occasionally looking at her facebook, now i am on my last year of highschool and set to graduate relatively soon. With this whole COVID thingy one of my teachers recommended that we send thank yous to all the people that Influenced our academic life. Small note, ive been doing 100% online school for the last 5 years so this recommendation was primarily for people who do both online and in bulding school who wont be able to see their teachers or friends since schools are all shut down. But it got me thinking and now seems like the time to send this old crush a message just thank her and to let her know she had a positive influence on my life, hence my dilemma. How the hell do i do that with out comeing off super creppy? Im legitimately not trying to reconnect or anything like that, i haveint seen her in almost 6 years and probably won't ever again but i also know if i dont say anything now i never will.

423,"Hi,

I have been watching the domestic violence statistics rise and have been watching documentaries about it which has left me wondering whether I should inform the parents of my ex that he has hit me once. I still have their phone numbers, after I left him a couple of years ago they even sent me a message that they were going to miss me. I know for a fact that he did not tell them about it when it happened and he threatened me so I would not tell them, so I am pretty sure that they do not know. I also think they think he is a perfect person who would never do such a thing. I was wondering if me telling them would maybe make them discuss it or more watchful when he enters a new relationship, which might help prevent someone else from getting hit. 

About the situation when he hit me, I was crying and wanted to leave his apartment to go to my own because he was mad and screaming at me for a joke he didn't like, he didn't know how to handle it so he hit me to make it stop and make me stay. He was raging. I asked for permission to go to the toilet and was allowed, but instead I immediately fled to his roommates room, woke him up and asked him to protect me while I called my parents. The roommate thankfully waited with me until they arrived and escorted me downstairs to their car. After the incident I stayed in the relationship until I had found a safe way out, that I was looking for since the moment this happened. Although he initially apologized for the incident, he did say that he found it my own fault and pretty much thought he couldn't have done anything otherwise in the situation, which was, and is, bizarre to me and makes me think this could definitely happen again with someone else. 

I have not spread stories about him or anything, I have only discussed this with my closest friends and family. I am currently in a very happy long-term relationship. The purpose of telling his parents is also definitely not to make him look bad, but to help prevent such incidents in the future with new people in new relationships. However, I am uncertain whether it will make me look like a bitter ex, whether it will lead to him telling negative stories about me in our shared community (which can impact my career and education as he works in a similar field) or even him looking me up to confront me about telling them. I am also whether it will have any positive impact at all. What do you think I should do?",10Apr2020,1

Me = Me of course, Gary = family friend, Kate = Family friends girlfriend Mum = My Mum, Sister = my older sister (22F) and Brother = Little brother (17M)

All my Life I have been different from my sister and brother always being asked by Garry ""why can't you be more like you siblings""  or tells my cousin's "" Me did all of that she is a trouble maker"" half the time it was my brother and I yet I was always to blame. 

When I was 16 my mum kicked me out of the house, I had not home no money and no family I could rely on I had to charge my phone at school and shower every few days at my best friends house. I had no where to go and no one I could trust with this information, I ended up having a nervous breakdown (mental breakdown down) I spent 12 days on a mental health ward, that spread around my family pretty fast, my mum ended up being me home.
Everything was fine till I had to defend myself from my brother bashing my head into a corner of a cupboard, I bit him so he would stop I just turned 17, so January 2017  she gave me up to the state and I was left to fend for myself  I couldn't get government benifits because my mum earnt to much  so I was left homeless, didn't have a job had to drop out of high school.  While my older sister and brother had it easy, my sister was in uni and my brother in highschool, I wasn't eligible for the study help because I had no income. I was called lazy and a screw up I got pregnant a few times fell into the wrong crowed and my little angels never made it past 10 weeks gestation. I still resent my mum for abandoning me and my sister and brother getting it easy.

I’ve been a bad friend, girlfriend. I’ve lost good friends. 
My amazing boyfriend has forgiven me and had given me a chance as to be a new person.

However I keep dwelling on the past.

I’ve also been such a bad friend and taken things too far by gossiping about a close friend who used to be controlling but I ended up taking things too far by gossiping about to another girl who used to be my bestfriend.
I did end up feeling bad about it and wanted to change things.

However karma hit me when one of my other friends make a rumour about me to my bestfriend that’s when my bestfriend exposed everything I said about the friend me and her gossiped about. But made it seem like I did most of it. She did end up apologising and we are some what civil now but in the end I did mess up a good friendship.
My bestfriend at the time also told my other friend I said something bad about her which I know I didn’t ! But after apologising she said she does remember  me saying something bad about about that friend but understands if I can’t remember.

Anyways I’ve also been a bad girlfriend. I used to always go out partying and clubbing with my bestfriend even prioritising her over my boyfriend. The thing was the whole going out clubbing, partying was something that was new to me. In the beginning I never even took the relationship seriously as I was new to the whole serious relationship and boys things. 
It wasn’t until my eyes starting opening and I starting falling for him more and more. I ended up feeling so much guilt and confessed to him! Even things that weren’t my fault. And things that were my fault! I told him! I admit it did start of small but eventually I told him. He forgave men saying he understood I had an immature mind set and saw changes in me 3 months before I confessed. However made it clear if this was to happen again. It would be over.
I did try to leave because I didn’t want him to suffer or deal with pain although I did not want to But he insisted we work on things and be both decided we have a fresh start ! 
It’s been 6 months since our fresh start. 
We have been together for over a year a bit but have decided to start over and count our fees start! 

However I feel like I can’t forgive my self. I feel selfish and stupid ! 
I keep trying to make sure I didn’t miss telling him anything! I keep over analysing. It goes away and then comes back. My boyfriend has completely forgiven and moved past. considering we are both young and said that he understands and that now it’s a new beginning for me as I’ve matured. 
Doesn’t care if I missed anything or didn’t. Doesn’t want me analysing it and wants me to move past it! 
He mentioned he doesn’t want me to repeat or dwell as it’s going to ruin my mental health.

I can’t stop !! It’s back again today.

I also have OCD , ROCD and intrusive thoughts which doesn’t make it any better! This makes me having to relive my mistakes a certain number of times in order to temporarily feel at peace! Not that these things excuse me at all but makes it hard for me to move past.

And to make it clear I will never ever never repeat my same mistakes!!!!
My boyfriend has told me to stop and I don’t wanna keep annoying him!
Because of quarantine as well I haven’t been able to see my counsellor!  

I want to forget but this is going to live on me forever for being a shitty person! 

As for my friend I have tried contacting them but haven’t gotten a response. 

I’ve forgiven my bestfriend as I feel like I need to also forgive and move past !",10Apr2020,1

Take three since it’s 6am and I can’t explain myself properly due to lack of sleep! All details should be present and clear now. Sorry for confusion before.

I need advice, these screenshots are of my friends husband basically pleading for one of his past affairs to come back to him to fuck for over a year. I know the wife and she thinks he is completely faithful, meanwhile the other woman’s fiancé has disproved that by sharing these screenshots around to embarrass the other woman. Since that video is actually of the married man getting head from her and she didn’t consent to the video getting shared once he discovered it.

My biggest concern is the fact that the married mans wife, my friend, thinks he is completely faithful. He has cheated on her numerous times before and will continue to and he always denies it. But this time she was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, at the same time he began messaging this woman again. Friend is now in remission. But he sent all these messages and met with this other woman while she was going through treatment. 

Would you want to know? Should I tell her anonymously before they make there way to her from people she doesn’t know?",10Apr2020,1

453,"First time poster here. I really don't have anyone to talk about this, so thanks for any comment. So me (22/f) and my bf (20/m) have been having the hardest time lately because of my jealousy.   


To give a little backround to this: we are in a LDR for 2 years and have never met. He suffers from some mental issues (including depression) which has prevented us from meeting until now.   
I am madly in love with him and I take this relationship really serious and until now it seemed that he did too. We were both kind of introverted people, few friends and most of the time we would spend together. It was perfectly fine for me to be by his side every day through calls and texts as I am a pretty clingy gf and he new that right away. He also knew of my jealousy problems, ecspecially with females.   


In my last realtionship I got cheated on for almost a year through texts. My ex wouldn't let me see his phone, he was writing all day with people I didn't know and I had so much faith in him that I never questioned anything. He sent pix and they were all in relationships while this went down. I ended up breaking up with him because I had given up so much for him that I just couldn't bare being with him anymore. I think that's when the whole jealousy thing started for me.   


My current bf and I had some issues in the past because of my jealousy. He started texting his ex at some point and she wanted to persue another realtionship with him ( which I learned way later) and basically took all his attention away from me. I had bad anxiety and was really afraid of losing him like every normal partner would, but it went up to a point were it was hard for me to think about anything else. All day I would feel my stomach turning at the thought that they had constant contact, that she would send him pix and vids etc. would freak me out and I would be extra clingy and really nosy. Piercing him with questions about her and never letting the topic go whenever we were talking. He told me several times that they were just friends. But at some point things got a bit to much and he ended the friendship. For me it was to late, I had already had my panic attacks and sleepless nights.  
My friends all suggested breaking up but I could not bring myself to do it.   


Fast foward this year, everything seemed fine. We were planing on meeting this sommer and I was looking foward to it, although he was really nervous and wouldn't show his happieness too much. This march he started changing completely. He was very cold towards me and never showed any affection. He was angry all the time and quit phone calls. Later that month he told me he was having a hard time with his depression. I tried talking with him about it, but no matter what he would not open up to me. Instead, he met an old girlfriend of his and they started talking. They started talking day and night, about his problems and everything else. They were talking on the phone at nights. I felt really left out. He was talking so highly of her and I couldn't help myself feeling jealous. Why can he talk with her about anything and feel understood but I am an exception?   


I started having my episodes of jealousy and I kept overthinking. He talks with her so much and one time I asked if he could tone it down. He made me feel so bad because I asked that of him and then went on and ""stopped"" talking with her. Basically he told her that its my fault they can't talk. He seemed so heartbroken about it that it made me feel like shit for days. So I apologised and told him he could talk with her if he really wants. I found out they were already talking again they never really stopped. He just made me feel like shit about it.   


I feel almost as if I am the friend and she is the gf at this point. It is really messing with my head. He keeps saying how much she means to him and I can see how he is changing before my eyes. Showing more affection to her then to me. I don't know what to do, at this point I just feel so responsible for everything. I just want things to get back to normal. I feel like a piece of shit having these feelings and I want to change it, but I don't know how to go about it. Any advice on how I can stop being so jealous would help. Thank you

457,"Ok so I (20M) always had problems with doing schoolwork and when I entered University I struggled a lot at first. It was a new world as I wasn't being forced to do anything as university is basically at your own pace over here in Austria.

 I worked on myself and tried to grasp motivation out of thin air to do work for university in order to pass subjects. Mind even I really like my subject I still find it hard to sit down and work.

 So I finally got my shit together starting this semester and it all went well, I was more motivated than I'd ever been, attended every lecture, sat down in the library during breaks and studied in order to never allow myself to fall behind. And it worked, until quarantine hit. It threw me off completely and I am again sitting at home struggling to find motivation, trying not to get too depressed etc... 

Any tips in coping with fallbacks like that and how to find motivation once again? I've picked up new hobbies so far and been more consistent on working out atm. But I've found being motivated in other things doesn't help with study work. Any help appreciated :).",10Apr2020,1
458,"I'm new here so I was reading the rules and you don't have to give me medical advice??? Anyway let's get on with the story.

Ok here's the deal. My brother is a bit strange in a few ways but I'll try to keep to the details of the story, I hope, I'm sorry if I go on a tangent. 

So I (19 yr old female) tend to always brush my teeth, twice a day, sometimes floss. I always leave my toothbrush in one spot away from my brother's toothbrush (23 yr old male) in a specific box next to the sink. Quick background, my brother has never had a job in his life, dropped out of school in grade 10, has learning difficulties and the doctors, any other types of proffesionals could never diagnose him for some reason (that sounds really bad but it makes sense if you meet him and live with him your whole life). Anyway, sometimes I find my toothbrush has been moved in different places. I just thought either my mum or someone wanted to keep all the dental products together in the pre determinded toothbrush holder. However, I j
started to notice, my toothbrush is wet on the britels when after a 6hr sleep it should be dry... I kind of didn't know what to do and passed it off as a small incident, I mean it's not the first time I assumed and had it all wrong. Yet, it just kept happening.

So, one day, I notice my gums above two/three of my back teeth have started to bleed quite significantly and my gums have started to recede to the point that it's gotten, bad, really bad. I start brushing, flossing, salt water wash, mouthwash... It's slowen down but it's receded to the point where one of my teeth I can see the gum has receded to show the root of one of my back teeth... I'm scared to go to the dentist cause of the money. I deferred Uni to save money and have a chance to step back and look at my future. In short, I don't have much money... I come from Australia and we have Medicare but I don't know. I looked into it and Medicare covers some things but I don't think it covers regular scaling, root/gum treatment around $135 a session. Heck, I might even have to pay for gum surgery worth $600. 

I confronted my brother about this and you know, when you know someone that well you can tell when their lying just by their reaction. Well, yeah. I just don't want to assume but there is just so many questions leading to one answer. Like why is my toothbrush wet when it shouldn't be, and it's in a different place. It's sort of my word against his though, until he admits it or I can show the wet tooth brush. I already stashed it away though and am keep my own toothbrush in my room.

I have only told my mum about this, I promised her to keep quiet. My dad gets really angry about these sort of things and usually hands out the punishments in this family. He also feels the most sorry for my brother, it's harder to confront him too since my brother usually starts crying and screaming. He won't bother changing his behaviour even though he is clearly in the wrong, sort of thing. He won't listen and continue do the thing he shouldn't do, was told not to. My dad also sometimes gets a little defensive with my mum and I if we slide a comment or talk about these things he does, even though there could be somethings wrong with him? It's not hard to know you should only wear one pair of underwear a day, not for two days, as a cycle. Don't throw the soap in the bin just because you see a speck of dirt of it. When your account says -$153 it means you have less then zero money and have to pay money back! Don't buy things all the time, it's not your money anyway, it's our parents, I don't get that money, there is a reason you get it and it is to save. In some hope that you might I don't know do something...! Don't open all the toothbrushes, have four of them sitting in a jar 2 perfectly new ones and potentialy be using mine??! I went on a tangent. 

I don't want to write this in a bias way but I probably already have. I probably sound like a whiner too. Anyway, I'm so sorry you had to read that, anyone willing to give advice I would gladly appreciate. 

Just, I don't know where to go from here. I kind of want to confront him again which I kind of feel paranoid in saying that, I just want to make sure. It's not like I can put a camera in the bathroom, that's just gross. Also, sorry I didn't really edit this, the person reading this right now, I'm astounded you even got this far.",10Apr2020,1
459,"So I've liked this girl from my course for months now. She's cute, she's sweet, she's smart, she can draw, all-around she's just lovely. My main problem personally is that I've chronically low self esteem and so I had it in my mind all that time that she just couldn't possibly like me and considering I'd never even asked a girl out before this I just presumed that I'd fuck it up royally and make a fool of myself if I did try. Over time I did gradually begin to psych myself up to ask her, though I knew I was kind of leaving it to the last minute. On our last day of college most of us came in only to be told that our lab for that day was cancelled and that we'd have nothing in-person for the rest of the semester. We kind of fucked about celebrating and (unwisely) went out that night. My crush wasn't there and, being in a somewhat celebratory mood and seeing the last minute had kind of passed at this stage, I basically said fuck it and texted her asking if she'd like to go out some time:  
Me: Going out on a limb here, so let me know if I'm reading into something wrong, but would you be up to grab coffee with me some time (provided we still can)?  
Her: Hi [me], I would like to go for coffee. I value our friendship and I’m not sure if there’s anything more in it. We can meet and chat.  
Me: Hey, sorry about the misunderstanding on my part. Thanks for letting me down easy. If you'd still like to have a friendly chat sometime that's grand, though I understand completely if it would be a bit awkward.  
Her: I get that it was hard for you to tell me. Yes I’d like to meet up and have a chat sometime!  
Me: Next time we're both in [where I study] sure  
It's awkward now. We've talked once since (she checked up on me asking how everything was now and how I was dealing with the cabin fever and we started talking about common interests and stuff), but that was nearly three weeks ago at this stage. We've both returned home (it turns out she was literally on a bus back when I texted her) and what with everything that's happening we probably won't see each other until college starts back up again in September. Between now and then I haven't the slightest notion of what to do. I mean I know I should probably text her, but about what? Even still, even after the summer when we do meet up, I don't know what to do on a first date either. I just feel doomed to fuck this up, honestly.

460,"I’m (20 yo F) staying with my 27 y o female mentor at her boyfriend’s home. I don’t have anyone else to stay with during the pandemic. I’ve felt like I’m stepping on their toes, I don’t want drama, and that is why I’m reluctant to raise any kinds of concerns here... 

The Bf has a new roommate (28 y o M) who has made me uncomfortable ever since he moved in at the start of this pandemic. He makes comments (ex: you’re fucking hot) and touches me inappropriately.  He will press my thigh or boob casually as I’m doing something (I.e dishes) then act like he didn’t... 

He asked for a klonopin. I said I didn’t want to be responsible for anything happening or for him becoming a “pill head”. He got annoyed and made a point to say that he’d done plenty of drugs, “probably 20x more drugs that me” and that this was nothing. I hate this word but he was “mansplaining”. My mentor heard this convo and even laughed saying, “why are you mansplaining? Haha she’s just looking out.”... I am prescribed these for chronic pain &amp; sleep disorder from an autoimmune disease, I don’t typically dole them out. I did this time. I had a bad and my night was sort of just sad... He came in my room an hour after the benzo and we talked. It was nice. Fast forward, the talking turns into glass of wine and him trying to kiss me. I turned my cheek. He made out with my neck anyways. I kept pulling away and then said, “I’m going to go to sleep”. So, he left but I heard something a minute later. He had thrown a bag of hot Cheetos into my room. I was thinking wtf and then thought maybe he just wanted me to sober up. I rolled over and nocked out. I got awful sleep and felt something on me in the night. I realized that it was him around 5 am— he had climbed into my bed at some point. For an hour, I was awake and moving his hands off me. I got up to use the bathroom and opened my mouth to tell him he had to leave... but was interrupted by him blaming it on the benzos. He said he didn’t realize he was in here and now is texting me, trying to make jokes and saying it was the pills and alcohol. He’s also saying I should not have given that to him &amp; is asking that I don’t tell mentor + BF. 

I feel embarrassed and like I’m going to be blamed for entertaining the situation as he was in my bedroom in the first place. I didn’t think it would turn into that but maybe I shouldn’t have ever invited him in.... I don’t want this to escalate and then me have said nothing to my mentor or her BF, though. I don’t want to start drama or for there to be any kind of altercation now &amp; my worst fear is looking like I’m asking for problems and pissing them off... especially because it doesn’t need to be made into a huge deal since I believe he knows to step off now. I still think it may be better to be honest about what’s going on, though...

Her beautiful blue eyes, her long wavy brunette hair, her smile that could outshine any constellation. Finally after all those years, I finally got my shot with her. This angel wanted me just as much as I wanted her. She was beginning to take steps to advance her career, blossoming into the beautiful  and intelligent woman I know she was destined to be. She was supportive of me and I of her. It was the BEST time if my life. I was 18 and pretty much graduated. We went on summer vacation in Delaware and just fell deeper and deeper in love. We were together for about 2 years until she moved to philly and we had to cut it off because of distance and schooling. We both agreed to it. There was no hard feelings and we were still homies and still talked all the time. We began to get a little more distant being adults, busy with work and just everyday life. I never lost that love I had for her. My mind and heart didn't see a reason to seeing as it wasn't  a negative situation. Our relationship, whether it was romantic or not, was just always full of positivity and deep passionate love.

I won't lose your time on details, but basically she started to like me, but i didn't  intend to make a relationship. She didn't  tell me she liked me until aa week after the camp ended, at wich point starting a relationship was pointless(she lives far away and i don't believe in long distance relationships)

Weeks passed, we continued talking as friends, and i talked with her cousin(also a girl) too, wich seemed to annoy her a bit.

One day in December, she texted me accusing me of talking sh*t behind her back, wich i denied. The conversation went like this (G=the girl, M=me and C=her cousin):

G-why did you talk sh*t behind my back?
M-umm i didn't 
G-yes you did, you talked shit about me with C
M-i haven't  talked to her since a few weeks ago  (wich was true)
G-i took her phone and found your convo with her
M-well, if you insist i did it, why don't  you tell me what i said, since i don't  remember?
G-you said many things. Why should i tell you?
M-because if you don't, it's  a vain accusation 
G-from now on, never message me again!
M- G, calm down
G-bye

And then i was like ""f*ck it, i won't even try to talk""

This was not the first time she argued with me , and she's really annoying, but now idk if i should text her to see if she changed or if she's  the same easily offended b*tch i knew her as, and if she changed, maybe reforge a friendhip or something.

477,"Hi people of reddit. I'm in need of some advice. Sorry in advance for my rambling here - I think quarantine has broken my brain.

I was asked by a good friend to be Maid of Honor for her wedding in the fall (my first time being MOH). At this point, I know that I should be planning the bachelorette party, but with all the craziness of COVID, I haven't done as much planning as I normally would have done. The bride-to-be has recently said she still wants to plan a weekend away for July/August 2020. Even with COVID, it looks like a lot of places are already booked up, so I think I should start planning ASAP.

My friend is also super easy-going (which I love about her), but in this case, it means she doesn't seem to care about the location for the bachelorette and she hasn't decided how many people she wants to invite yet. I just feel that I need more direction from her, but maybe I should be taking more charge here?? I don't know if brides are usually more involved in planning (at least in terms of picking locations and deciding on # of people invite??).

I don't want to put more pressure on her in terms of coming up with ideas for the bachelorette weekend, but I have NO IDEA where to even start. I also recently moved abroad and have told her that there is a chance I won't be able to afford to come to the bachelorette and the wedding. I lost my job due to COVID, so it's looking more and more like I won't be able to come for this weekend. Since I most likely won't even be present for the bachelorette weekend, I feel like I should ask someone else to help me plan, but she has only asked one other person to be in the bridal party so far, and I don't know them. 

Is there anyone else out there trying to plan bachelorette parties during COVID who can give me some advice? I feel like I'm the worst, most unorganized MOH ever at this point, but I honestly don't know how to proceed. How terrible would it be for me to ask the bride to be a bit more involved in planning OR ask her if the other bridesmaid can be more involved?? How reasonable is it to be planning a weekend away for the summer at this point? 

Thank you!",10Apr2020,1

481,"Hello. So there’s this guy I was really close to who recently cut me off. Like I was really close to him.

      So let me start in the beginning- I don’t exactly have a good home life and I always went to him to rant to. He said so many times I could. A way I coped with my depression from the stress of living in a house like this (it’s abusive but I’ve gone to the cops and they say they can’t do anything about it) was using substance(s). I know he was really opposed to me doing them and we use to get into fights about it. He’s not exactly clean either so we did talk about drugs a bit. During January I was in a major depressive state and tried to kill myself a few times (pills- I do not suggest it) and he found out and called the cops. A month later or so I get put into IOP and we get in a fight and he unadds me on snap. A month later he blocks my number. Keep in mind he ALWAYS said I could go to him. I always told him if he wanted me to leave him alone he just needed to tell me. 

This isn’t like him at all but since school is canceled and this is our senior year I probably won’t see him again. 
I don’t want to loose him. I feel bad for going to him about my problems but I don’t want to loose him. I honestly love him and I wouldn’t be alive right now but he clearly doesn’t care about me anymore or he’s going through something. I talked to him a little bit after he blocked and he was defiantly not himself but he also didn’t wanna talk to me or associate w me. 

I had a plan to just leave him be for a month then check up on him and be like hey hows everything going for you. I know it sounds like I’m a clingy bitch but I swear I cannot loose him. 

In my life he was the only one who gave a fuck about me. I don’t have a lot of friends and I have no connection to my family (adoptive) 

I just want to know what I should do",10Apr2020,1

483,"I’ll start by saying we’ve never had the closest relationship and we’re very different people. Things are very strained and up until I moved to a different city, things weren’t healthy. 

When I was 17, she met this man and had me move in with him at 18. He had a steroid addiction, a crack habit and was generally abusive and horrible, and 3 months later without telling anyone, I’d saved up, gotten support, and moved out on my own and away from it all. I still spoke to my Mum but refused to associate with the man she was seeing. Throughout my time living with him she would constantly say she’s leaving, but she never did (I know love can really make people blind but this was awful), so I took it upon myself to get out of there. 

Since then, I’ve come to university, gotten my life together and lived independently ever since. My life is good, I’ve fixed my relationship with my Dad, slightly mended it with my Mum, got great friends and a good job. My mum claims multiple times to have left this man, but I know she’s still been associating with him and trying not to upset me. I visit her occasionally but never for more than a day or two, as like I said earlier, we aren’t the closest and I like to keep my distance. 

Anyways, this man has had some sort of drugs charge against him, and my mum is being blamed for it by him. He’s been pursuing and threatening her so I’ve taken her into my home temporarily (she has police permission to be here despite the pandemic of course). This has been really hard on myself and my housemates, but I’ve tried to do what I can and bought her food and tried to make her at home, but with our strained relationship as it is, it’s been difficult. 

Last night, I felt myself being a little short with her and she had a go at me in front of my housemate. When I tried to explain myself she refused to listen. As an adult with her in my home, I told her she should hear me out and I apologised, and explained that I am struggling with this entire situation, my Nana being in hospital amidst the virus, plus my own mental health struggles. It’s been a lot to process and very foreign to deal with, and that’s why I was short. It was no personal attack and I’ve been trying my best. She kept saying she’d just leave, that I’m awful etc, and she doesn’t want to fall out. I told her I am not asking her to leave, but to be patient with me and understand this is a struggle for me too, but her safety comes first and she is welcome here despite me having my own stresses and that it is ok. 

Anyways, I woke up to find she’d left this morning without saying anything and has returned home, to which this man has smashed her car up etc. I’ve told her to contact the police and go to a friend or neighbours and hope she’ll be okay. But I’m very conflicted, have I done the right thing? Have I been awful? What do I do? 

Thanks in advance.

NYU Stern or CMU Dietrich or Indiana Kelley

Hello everyone,

I am in seek of any advice or opinions. I got into all three schools: BPE program at NYU Stern and CMU Dietrich and public policy at kelley (want to switch to economic consulting and double major with something more technical like finance). However, the price to attend NYU and CMU is absolutely crazy and I am awaiting a financial aid offer(i doubt it will be much at all). On the other hand, I have a full ride to Kelley; do i take the close to zero debt or rack up over 300k at NYU? I don’t know what career I want to fall into, but possibly IB or HF; I am also very into politics, but I doubt that’ll be an area I’ll pursue. Any advice would be appreciated, let me know what you guys think please!

I (24F) live with my grandma (84f) who is pretty youthful so I take care of her but more as a I’ll cook us dinner, help you figure out Netflix kind of way.

About three ish weeks ago before quarantining, I hung out with one of my best friends (24F) of over 10 years. 
We had a few drinks and naturally started talking about everything going on with the pandemic. In our drunkenness, we came to the conclusion to quarantine at my house, her, my grandma, and I, thinking it’d be nice to have her around. My grandma was okay with it. 
So that’s what we’ve been doing the past 2/3 weeks.

Basically, I just can’t stand my friend’ presence anymore. She’s extremely extroverted and I’m beginning to despise her. I’m irked by just hearing her loud laughter because of something funny on her phone, tired of hearing about the minor details of her dating app chats, and tired of her asking me to do stuff.
I’ve tried to get some space the past two days but it’s hard when we’re in the same house all day everyday. 

I really just want her to leave and go to her mom’s or home but don’t want to hurt her feelings. Any advice how I can handle this?

Hi everyone. I am 18(F).I have a friend and we both dated for some time and after breaking up we have been friends till now. Our relationship was good, had a mutual happy breakup, we wanted to focus on our lives and long distance wasn't working.  We are now good friends, we talk well and meet whenever we can. But both of us were kinda still stuck on e/o. I still had feelings for him because we were talking almost regularly and still cared about e/o. Ig we were never able to move on. I didnt wanted to date anyone mainly because of time constraint and I didn't try to find one.I think I had idealised him too much. After break up we were still making out sometimes and were doing a lot of couple things. We just liked it. But from few months I am getting irritated by this weird relationship we have. I want to break this old habbit of talking to him everyday. I don't like to chat with him, he makes it feel like a burden and I don't blame him honestly I just think he's too busy and its cool. So, one day we were chatting and it felt weird talking to him, it felt like a compulsion and burden again. Talking with him didn't bring happiness now.i felt indifferent. That day we had a  small argument and he told me later that he was streesed. Ik him for 3 years now. I felt so bad that day and I have felt this before too a lot of times. But that night, it just felt like I need to leave from here it was toxic and not good for me. So I just blocked him and went away. I told him not to contact me. He tried to. I blocked him. He had lied to me sometimes  but we were not in a relationship then so I didn't wanted to react. But it felt bad because he knows lying freaks me out. 

So, after some days he was saying sorry and I asked him not to text me and then he wrote- I have your nudes will you like it if I share them. I broke. Couldn't imagine him saying that. This best person with whom you shared everything said this and it shattered everything around me. He said he missed me and wanted to talk and be in touch with me.For that comment he said that he thought this was the only option to get me back and it was impulsive.

Should I forgive him? He started crying and he regrets it a lot. He said he has been drinking too much which made me come back to him and it felt like I couldn't leave him on his own. Idk what to do
Please advice me. Thank you!

Onward, I (26) work in the service field. I love my job and have been doing it for about five years now. I have moved around to quite a few different positions within the organization and have gained a ton of understanding of how things function and why they function how they do. I also have gained many qualifications because of this experience. 

Well this spring an upgraded position came available and I put in for it. I worked very closely with my boss for applying, tweaking my resume, and even formulating a career path. I tailored (with boss’s help) my degree choice and the specific classes I was willing to take and at what time. (Timing matters for this job so i might not be as available in the spring vs fall etc). In this position I wouldn’t be able to move very high without completing my bachelors, so I am. Honestly, talking with my boss it was STRONGLY implied I was a shoo-in. 

I was an extremely strong candidate. For more reasons than one. However, I was dealt a crushing blow from my boss that stated essentially, “we went with another candidate because they possessed a qualification that you didn’t”. However, the qualifying “qualification” will literally be nullified by the end of the year, because the organization won’t recognize it anymore. The pep talk I was dealt essentially went, “you are an awesome candidate we went with other person because they had x qualification. That was it. We still want you here. But we all have to receive a ‘no’ every now and again. You will absolutely be a strong candidate in the future and i suggest you stick around because I imagine there will be an opening in the next year to two years.’ 

My first reaction was to resign from my current position and pursue a career elsewhere. I don’t necessarily believe the other candidate was hired because of their “qualification” because I have useful qualifications that won’t be nullified that are far more useful. Also, said person that was hired has no aspirations for getting their degree and has been very outspoken about transferring organizations in the past. 

I feel a bit slighted and I sincerely can’t hang my hat on a two-year “maybe”. So reddit, an I overreacting? Should i just move on like my gut instinctively told me to? 

TL;DR - been at a job for five years. Worked closely with my boss to apply for an upgrade. Was made to believe I was a shoo-in, but they went with someone else. Should i stick around for a maybe or find a different job?",10Apr2020,1
511,"Hi Everyone,

I am from the USA and I am turning 30 this year and I feel that life is quickly passing by - all I want to do is now is to travel and want to experience new things. My perspective of life changed when I had cancer so I feel like my time is more valuable. As I am writing this message, I am currently in Malaysia - and have been in Asia for the last 7 months.

I got married at the age of 24, and currently still married. My relationship with my husband is beyond fixing - we have done so much damage to each other that it is really time to turn to the next chapter.

To be honest, I know I got married too young and I was not ready for this kind of commitment. Initially, I said no to his proposal, and he started to cry in front of people and I felt so bad with people looking at me so I changed it to yes. I just feel I wasted my prime years in a loveless relationship. We have nothing in common (Him being born and raised in the Phillippines). I even asked for marriage therapy but he said he would rather divorce than go through that (this was in our 1st year of marriage).

During our last 6 years, all we have done was argue and we never saw peace between us. I don't know why we even stayed together - but I think it was that we both travel often help. I would go to Europe for 6+ months and I will come back and he will go to the Phillippines for 6+ months. To put my dirt out there, I have been completely unfaithful to my husband after the 4th year of marriage. I dated and slept with other men. I even have read some of his text messages, and I also suspect he's been doing the same - I am not even angry or jealous!

We talked about divorce, and him moving back to the Phillippines.- and he will take our 2 dogs with him so I can pursue whatever I am trying to pursue (I don't even know what I want). I thought about teaching English in Thailand (I loved Thailand a lot!)

I am nervous about what is yet to come - I am excited about the new opportunities I have ahead of me without dragging dead weight around - I am sad that I wasted my 20s over this relationship and curious where my life would have been if I were more firm of my original answer.

a.) The man who I lived with and loved for three years and I broke up.

b.) The pandemic apocalypse is happening.

c.) I went from working in retail and living with my boyfriend to working at a law firm and being forced to get my own apartment.

d.) I took acid.

I'm young and I don't know what the fuck is going on  in life and I'm scared. 

This is me and my ex's second breakup. The first time I was in so much pain I couldn't function.

This time I'm mad, confused, upset and driven? Who breaks up with the girl they said they wanted to marry like a week after I got an okay job..?

I immediately reached out to a guy I haven't spoken with in five years and I feel like such a bad person because I truly loved my ex but we had a really toxic relationship.

My ex treated me like a child because he made more money than me; we broke up because his brother yelled at me in my car and I cried and he called me a baby. My boyfriend didn't stand up for me, and when I said that made me wanna break up with him he just completely gave up on our relationship and wouldn't let me take it back.

So okay.

I did acid because he never let me do it. He always said I was too emotional and immature to do it. But you know what? I went out, and got a good job. I was able to get an apartment in a SINGLE DAY because he gave up on me.

And I had this revelation that I have never relied on just myself but that I'm not childish or immature just because I cry a lot or have emotions.

But I'm so anxious and sad and confused and honestly just need guidance at this point.

I also really like this guy I'm seeing (we almost dated five years ago) but I know that's me being stupid.

Please help? Idk? I have no parents or anyone that cares about me and I know that sounds pathetic and like I'm playing the victim and I am sorry... But I really am so lost in the world right now.

TLDR; my boyfriend broke up with me and it's the pandemic and i did acid four days ago 

and i need guidance from adults??? i don't even own a shower curtain and i'm poor with $4000 to my name 

(my rent is $815/month if that info is relevant..?)",10Apr2020,1
513,"I’m a very sentimental person and my senior year just ended prematurely due to the corona virus. I know that it was for the best and there are people in worse situations than I am, but I haven’t been able to leave my bed or eat because I just feel so overcome with sadness. I talked to my friend on the phone last night about it and could barely speak because I was panicking so much. I don’t like change, and I know I was gonna graduate high school, but I didn’t realize it would be this soon. I don’t know if this is the right place to do put this, but I need some help with how to deal with this sadness. I’m starting to think my friendships with people aren’t even worth it any more because I will never see them again after August, I just need to get out of this mindset, any advice is appreciated, thank you",10Apr2020,1
514,"I have been friends with this girl for almost 4 years, and we have been close friends for the last 2 years. She had opened up about her hypochrondia, which was always fairly mild, however about 18 months ago she went hospital and found out she had low white blood cells. Since then, her hypochrondia seemed to turn up, and the past 12 months had been even worse. 

There are numerous examples of her hypochrondia, too many to even count but let me list some examples to show the severity of the situation: 

1. She bumped her head on the doorframe and thought she had caused brain damage. It took me close to an hour to convince her otherwise.
2. She gets cuts fairly open, usually closed cuts like papercuts. She works in retail and has loads of hand to hand contact with customers, some who also have cuts (with or without plasters) and she keeps thinking shes going to get HIV from those interaction. I've told her numerous times not everyone has HIV and its not that easy to get it. 
3. She experienced some symptoms a few days ago and believed she was having a heart attack, once she told me those symptoms, I realised she got pins and needles... 
4. She believes any cough, sneeze, random headache or dry throat is a cause of some illness or disease she has but doesnt know about yet. I tried to explain to her on numerous occasions that everyone experiences these things so no one speaks about it. She doesnt seem to think that, she think shes the only person who experiences everything alone.

Any time this occurs she spends hours focusing on these so called symptoms, and messaging me constantly about the topic. I have tried to explain to her, her illogical thought process, how her apparent symptoms dont add up, and any advice I can give on resolving her anxiety. I had spend the majority of 2019 in a state of depression with loads of anxiety, to the extent where I had monthly check ups with my GP on it. Due to this, I have learnt any ways of dealing with anxiety and I tried to give her my best advice. She completely ignores everything I say and just continues on about her symptoms and conditions and how shes so ill. That is not even the case, out of our friendship group, myself and another girl has a few conditions, some quite severe, yet she always goes on about ill she is or how she hopes her symptoms dont flair up. 

This all just got even worse due to the coronavirus pandemic, and although she has been stuck at home for the past few weeks, she believed she had the coronavirus, pnuemonia, heart arrthymia, heart attack and a few other things. She constantly pops up about these issues to the extent where we dont speak about anything else on our private chat. Before anyone suggests therapy, she did have CBT therapy once and she completely discredited the therapist and refused to go back after a mistake done by the receptionist. 

I have tried my best to help her out, but since she doesnt listen to my advice at all and just continous down this path, getting worse, I really dont know what I can do, especially considering I'm the only one she opened up about this. Please advice?",10Apr2020,1
515,"TL;DR at bottom.  I need advice on how to talk with my daughter (15) about her behavior. For nearly a year now, her anger/temper/teenage angst/whatever has progressively gotten more and more aggressive &amp; hateful. This morning I (46F) caught myself dropping my eyes and turning away from her when she entered the kitchen to avoid seeing her glare at me and hoping she wouldn’t blast me for unintentionally being too noisy while emptying the dishwasher. Around her, we don’t say, “Good morning!” We don’t ask if someone slept well or what their plans are for the day. It’s an open invitation for her to tell us how badly she slept, how her days are ruined or boring, or that she absolutely can _not_ help us do any chores (not that we dare ask) because she _has_ to do schoolwork because she is (somehow) always behind despite “doing schoolwork” being 6-8 hours worth of what she “does” all day.

We don’t open the sliding glass door to let in cool air because the creek is too loud for her. We don’t watch TV in the living room because she “hangs out” in there since her bedroom is an unmitigated disaster. My son (17) poured a large glass of milk, and her reaction was a angry outburst about how that gallon is the only _thawed_ gallon we have left and it takes _two days_ to unthaw another one (first world problems). She began stomp (as in two-year-old style) out of the kitchen, but I stepped in from of her. Her reply was to tell me, “I’m going to my room, and you can’t stop me!” So, I had a one-sided conversation (while she snarled) on the absolute ridiculousness of that comment. She then went outside to sit on the swing until nearly midnight (over 4 hours). These are recent examples; things have been getting worse for a long time.

Our entire family tiptoes around her. We quite literally avoid her. I already regret having to tell her to do something _before_ I tell her to do it. For example, offering to help clean her room. It needs to be done, but the thought of her reaction makes me cringe. I still do it, but my gut is in a knot as soon as I begin to plan how to phrase it in a non-threatening way. I ask my son or husband (47) for help or I try to do it myself before I make the timid suggestion that I need _her_  help. 
I did NOT raise her this way or allow this from either of my children as they were growing up. My son isn’t like this. In fact, it was my cringing reaction to her walking into the kitchen and grunting (sighing?) aggravatedly that made me realize how bad it has gotten because the progression has been slow. It’s so bad now that I am afraid to broach the topic with her, _but I have to do it._ Any advice is appreciated.

TL;DR- I need advice on how to tell teen daughter that she is bullying our family.",10Apr2020,1
516,"I’m overwhelmed having mixed feeling about this whole situation. But mostly I’m feeling shocked, betrayed, and sad. 

So recently I started reading books about sociopathy, psychopathy, and ASPD in general as the topic caught my attention. One of the books that I was reading mentioned a story of a guy that resembled the actions I think he’ll take if he was in the character’s place. Then thought to myself, I always thought to myself he’s different than other people which was the thing that made me aspire to be like him. His lack of stress and how he handles his problems in life has always impressed me. He’s extremely manipulative in a playful way. I call him master manipulator. He’s really social, popular, and charming in an unnaturally unbelievable way. 


I remember he always tells me that people are dramatic. So thought why not ask him and clear away all the doubts. I messaged him and started chatting with him trying to find a way to open this topic. And thought to myself even if I confronted him about it. He’ll lie cuz no one wants to tell on themselves that they’re sociopaths. Anyways, I was telling him about the book and how one of the characters resembled him. So I told him I want to analyse your personality. He said go ahead because I truly feel like I’m different than other people. I think a lot and differently than other people. I’m really confused. 

The summary of the interrogation:


If your father died would you feel grief:

I always try to act in these situations 
because last time when my brother passed away I tried forcing myself to cry be like everyone else

You like to be really charming to people to make them like you? 

Yes

You don’t take blame for anything?

No but I argued with him then he said everybody does that

Every person you meet you give a different version of yourself?

Yes lol

Do you feel that you’re insecure about anything?

Never. I’m really confident.

Do you feel remorse when you do unethical stuff?

What’s remorse?

Why do you do the right moral decisions if you don’t know what remorse feels like? 

I’m a super logical person. I have big goals in life and I work towards them. Not making moral decisions will put me in trouble

Do you keep your friends around because you feel that you’ll need them in the future?

Yes

Do you ever feel stressed out or nervous or jealous?

No

Why do have friends?

Fun to hang around

Why do you do favors for people?

Because I might need something from them. Doesn’t everyone does that?

Do you enjoy manipulating?
Yes

Do you lie for the fun of it?

Yes

Then asked him about some violent stuff and he obviously lied to me. 

He was weirded out about how accurately the questions described him and asked me what’s the purpose?

Told him that he’s a sociopath and he didn’t know what it means and laughed it off. Then he started reading about it and became concerned that I might know stuff he doesn’t wants anyone to know about, which then he said why are you reading about these stuff, you’re really bored it seems.

Should I continue being friends with him knowing that he has no remorse if he killed me in any second and only thought about me as an object that’s fun?",10Apr2020,1
518," First of all, forgive me if I am in the wrong place to post this or if this sounds really silly to you.

To introduce myself, I am a 19 y/o college student.

I was being bored by the lockdown in my home and I had some skills in Creative Softwares. So I joined [r/slavelabour](https://www.reddit.com/r/slavelabour/) and I was surprised with a lot more personal income ( It's a really great subreddit for freelancers). I was working there for about 2 months and earned a lot ( at least for me it is a lot ).

There is nothing wrong with it even now. but the problem is I got addicted to it. I keep checking for new tasks there more than ever. I cannot stop myself from it. I tried it many times before...but failed. I cannot concentrate on other things or I cannot learn anything new due to this. I am unable to keep myself busy with other things...I tried that too.

Is there any way I can overcome this? can anybody give me good advice for this?",10Apr2020,1
519,"Hey everyone.

I'm a 23 french M. I've been in a relationship with a 20F girl that ended in january. That was an english girl that was doing an erasmus in France. We ended things because she didn't want to do a long distance relationship, which is understandable. 

Since then, I've been no-contact with her. Apart from a time she contacted me because of Covid. The conversation lasted multiple day, because at the time she was in Argentina trying to get back in UK  and I was kind of worried. When she went back to Uk, she ghosted me. I decided to block her at that time. 

I'm becoming very tired. The breakup happened 3 months ago and I can't seem to move on from that girl. I loved her a lot. I was ready to go in Argentina with her, and to go live in UK after my graduation (in 4 months). That didn't happened and I can't fault her because she was clear with me. Still, I want to forget her and move. But I do have some troubles.

Since then, I've made drastic life change using the pain it caused me.
 - I stopped smoking weed (10 days ago), tabaco (since yesterday).
 - I've been doing sport 3 time a week for the past 3 months. I've been increasing the frequency at everyday since two weeks.
 - I meditated everyday at least 20 minute for the past two months.
 - I play at least one hour of guitar a day for the past two months. I made, for the first time, some composition and I'm pretty proud of them tbh. 

I'm doing ""everything right"", but I still... Can't seem to move on from her. I loved her a lot. That's kind of stupid, but I thought she was kind of ""the one"" for me, that how much stupid I am. 

I need some tough love and advice to move on. Please.",10Apr2020,1

522,"I (24f) started this job at a small doggy daycare (after leaving another job due to personal reasons.) and for the first two weeks (I started March 4th then the daycare had to be closed due to the pandemic), it was just me and my supervisor. 

At first, I thought I was doing okay. Looking after the dogs, cleaning up after them, making sure everything was chill. 

That was not the case because according to the supervisor I was working with, I was making a few small mistakes such as missing a couple of pee spots, taking my time at the end of the shift to sweep up the floor, dumping out a mop bucket that was clean even though it looked dirty and when my supervisor was lecturing me on this, she straight up said ""I don't want you back here if you're just gonna keep messing up."" 

I have this problem with separating emotions from work which every time I make a mistake with my job, I just break down from it and have a hard time bouncing back.

Should I quit?",10Apr2020,1
524,"Without getting too into it, I have a lot of opinions and philosophical problems with the way the world is. I find myself jealous of the carefree life that a dog would live, whereas being born human in today’s time is a life sentence of work/education/social stigma or expectation/etc.

I’m 20 years old, which of course can be chalked down to naivety, but I’m rather mature and ‘developed’ for my age. My opinions are the result of long term philosophical thinking and analyzing society and cultural norms from as objective of a view point as I can muster. This probably makes me sound like a sociopath, but I have high functioning empathy and social awareness. 

My problem is that I cannot justify the amount of time that I’m expected to give in order to ‘survive’. I have a limited time on this Earth, and when I do die I’d like to look back and think that I spent as much time doing what I want with my life as possible. Because at the end of it all, that’s all I really have. The average person has to work 40 hours a week in America in order to make a living, and some people can’t find jobs that pay well enough even then. It’s tragic that we’re so used to this type of life in an age where technology, and the ability to be aware of our history, social and cultural dynamics, and government make it entirely possible to create a better way of life.

Why do we not devote great political or scientific minds to create a new system that would benefit the most amount of people? Instead we’re so obsessed with the rejection of communism and socialism, and embracing capitalism, that I think we’ve forgotten that there are a nearly infinite amount of types of governments or societies that we could create. Even books create entire societies that could potentially work in reality. Yet we never deviate from our way because tradition fights progress and the average person is too busy just trying to survive that we can’t stop to reform our way of life. Not that it’s within our control to begin with. Just a very small example of the philosophical train of thought that I have.

Anyways, how do I justify giving thousands of hours of my life working in a system that I have no faith in? It’s too broken in too many ways for me to support it. You cannot escape civilization, the very trees are owned by the government. I can’t just walk into the woods and build a house, because that land belongs to the government. I’m forced to play this ridiculous game that enthralls you into relying on it and giving a large portion of your life to working for it. From my perspective, I’m born into a world with a lot of demands and expectations that I don’t want to meet. It trains you to believe that it’s the only way to live, it trains you to be a good worker bee, while taking advantage of you the entire time.

Look, I want to try at life. Succeed, even. But my perspective is a curse, I study the origin and purpose of our way of life and it seems like a raw deal. And as soon as I live on my own, because I live with my parents, I’m going to feel trapped. I’ll have to keep working to keep living comfortably, I won’t have control over my time anymore. Why are people okay with this? Because it’s ‘normal’? Because they have no other choice? 

Regardless, I’m just looking for advice. How do I change my perspective? How do I justify working to survive? How do I cope with not being able to spend my life the way I want to because of a pre conceived society that I had no control over or the time period I just happened to be born in? If someone out there can flip a switch in my mind that makes this all bearable, I beg you to give me your thoughts. 

Otherwise, I might end up living with my parents forever, which wouldn’t really matter anyways because it’s only frowned upon due to social stigma, which is subject to change and is exclusively a human issue, which makes it irrelevant in terms of me spending my short life how I see fit. (Although I do value independence and respect, so that probably won’t happen.) See what I mean, though? I dig so deep on every concept. How do I cope with this?

TL;DR- My philosophy and way of thinking makes it hard to justify the expectations of modern life. I’m worried that I won’t be able to thrive, how do I cope with this?

Side note: I think everyone deserves a better way of life, not just me. But there is very little hope of the type of change I’m looking for in my lifetime. Which is very depressing and leaves me feeling defeated before I even try. Also thanks for taking the time to read all of this you wonderful person. :)",10Apr2020,1

So my better half and I are looking for a kitten while we're both in quarantine. I'm looking everywhere on facebook and kijiji (I live in Canada) and the opportunities are sooo rare because of the covid and when there are avaiable kittens, they go away super fast. 

So, last night I decided to go see in other ""market"" website. I found one, annonce123.com , with a couple of kittens for sale. So I contact a couple of them. 

Then I receive an email of that man who says he is going in a retirement home and wishes to give away his last kittens from his breeding ""farm"" (sorry second language).

The text is long and there is already a ringing bell in my mind but the ""dispair"" is stronger, I really put the idea in my head that I will have a baby cat. So I ask some more questions, it's always a bit akward but I still go for it... he says he is doing business with a delevery service to help him give away the cats.

So then he ask for my adress and phone number and I give it.

Something like 3 minutes later, this too long text for the amount of time passed arrives. He replies that it will cost like (ridoculous amount of money) to deliver because blablabla and he will take care of one part of the charges but that I will have to pay (still ridiculous amount of money) and it goes on and on... like now it's obvious. 

I didn't read it all because now I just felt stupid and insulted. 

Now these guys have my address and phone number. I already filled a report on a fraud prevention site but it doesn't feel like it will do anything. 

I also plan on writing to my bank today about it. 

But what can I do? I checked some other of the kittens advertissements and it""s all the same trap with different person names

They have photo of  ID pieces of people to ""prove"" they are ""legit"" in their first mail they send you. So I would really like to actually do something to report them. And do something to protect myself.

534,"Basically, I came forward about my feelings about a situation and she wasn't happy about it at all. I understood that the conversation wouldn't be pleasant because I was basically saying to her that I had a feeling she had been lying to me before and was doing it again. I was never mad at her, but I was so scared to come to her with it, and needed reassurance/support. She said she wasn't mad at me either. I asked if she needed space, as we were meant to meet that night, and she said yes. But I didn't hear from her for 2 months. After the 1st month I accepted that I probably wouldn't hear from her again, and mourned the friendship while trying to move on and deal with the rest of the stuff happening in my life.

&amp;#x200B;

With all the COVID-19 stuff happening, I ended up moving countries again in the midst of my final year of uni, and that's when she decided to message me. Basically she said it was all trivial and she wants to chat. I was offended she called it trivial as it took a lot of courage and me doubting myself before I could talk to her, and it clearly wasn't that trivial if she cut me out for 2 months. 

&amp;#x200B;

I said I would maybe talk to her this week, depending on my workload, etc. I don't want to drag things out but I don't really know what to do. I don't feel like I could talk about anything important with her anymore or share any concerns because what if I get cut out again for an indefinite amount of time, no idea of where I stand. We've been friends for a long time, so I'm wary of throwing away an important friendship, but at the same time I can't be vulnerable around her, especially because she wants to forget the whole thing happened and won't really acknowledge her reaction or anything. She wants to pretend nothing happened.

537,"A quick preview, I'm a son of one of the top most influential people in the country that I'm from, without naming names, and my father has a lot for his country and for the people, he very much well known and very well respected businessman, BUT he ran a very private life, he was never on TV and his biography was also ambiguous to the public and he lived that way and died couple years ago.

Now I(m19) have befriended this guy (m24) that I've known for the last moth or so, and he is, generally speaking, a nice guy but I'd say that he almost lured to this friendship.

He was good at talking so he convinced me by telling me how i was the smartest and the most interesting person he had met in 2020 (I believed him cuz he's a Cambridge graduate and has a master's degree in economics) so i thought i might learn one or two things from him. At first i was hesitant and quite skeptical because he kept texting me not miss the reading session, but eventually being the nice guy that I am and  just can't say no, i got there and we got along quite well.

And when i asked him what he's getting out of this, he told me he returned to contribute something to his country and he's gathering a group of smart people who can make a difference and that was the 1st person.

So long story short, a month later he came out saying that he's sorry, he was lying about almost everything and he's here to write a book about my father's biography and he needed to get close to his me because I'm his son, nothing more nothing less.

I have no problem with him writing a book but my late father never wanted a book or such thing about him, he lived to serve his people, he didn't want fame or power and he turned down so many people from that and people respected his decision.

Now, this guy lied to me about his intentions and about what we were in the first place. our friendship was bogus. And now he's expecting me to help him write the book and he's telling me the reading thing was legit, and he's ready to wait till i feel comfortable. (Like someone who's about to lose their V-card lol) + I've been thinking about writing the book myself for quite sometime now.

Should i keep this thing going or should i just tell him it's over? I told him that I'm not gonna judge him but is it judging if i not go see him any longer.",10Apr2020,1
538,"I know a friend of mine who has a dog (1 year old, Australian Terrier). The problem is that his parents refuse to train him. He (the dog) doesn't know any basic commands like sit, lay down, stop etc. I've heard that Australian terriers are extreemly active dogs and that training is really needed.

So I visited my friend one day and sat down on the couch. The dog started jumping on the couch, trying to reach for my face and bit a few times. My friends parents picked him up, laid him in their arms and then they were talking to him like he's a baby. No shouting, no punishments, just 2 parents talking to him like he didn't do anything wrong. The dog became crazier after they put him on the floor again. This all went on for the like whole time I spent there.

They also spoil the little guy rotten by giving him lots of toys, I mean LOTS of toys. They let him do whatever he wants to do or where he wants to go so even upstairs. And ofcourse not training or punishing him if he does something wrong.

Not gonna lie, I kinda hate that dog, but I know it's not his fault for being and acting that way. My friend and his parents should have taken more responsebilities in raising a dog. 

But I don't know if I should report them to animal protection, because I don't know if it counts as 'abuse or neglect'. I tried doing research online, but I couldn't find anything. 

Should I report this or what else should I do?

540," I think I misguided my sister and feel guilty about it. 

I kind of suggested her to go to public school as she would get scholarship there. She followed my advice and passed her high school there but her performance was far from her best. She wants to study MBBS but we can't afford it. so she took an exam for government scholarship but no success. As a result she decided to take the examination again next year. Again I didn't oppose her idea. 

Now about 9 months after I think she isn't interested in her studies anymore. I have discussed the situation with her and she told me she didn't understood the courses. I even told her that she don't have to study MBBS  if she thinks its too much for her. But i think she is so confused now and don't know exactly what she wants to study. 

Now I feel guilty for the public school recommendation in the first place. I am not blaming the school but I think she would be much better academically if she had gone to a different  high school. I also feel guilty for supporting her idea to wait for another year. Our family was in a bad position economically. So i was going through ""can we afford it?"" kind of attitude the whole time.

I feel like i misguided her

544,"I can't go to school / work, I just can't.

Ever since I was a child, going to school was hard for me. Every morning I felt sick to my stomach, like I would throw up. I skipped class a lot, even when I was still in elementary school. My mom wasn't too happy about it, but she couldn't stop me either. The same thing continued throughout high school. I almost never did my homework or studied for exams, unless the topic felt interesting to me. 

After high school I stayed home for over ten years. I tried to study, tried many jobs, but always ended up quitting them. Finally I graduated and even got a job. I worked hard for over a year, and thought I could learn to work like people usually do. 

Despite my efforts I always felt like a prisoner, though. And lately I have started hating work so much I feel utterly depressed. I can't enjoy weekends either, because I know I have to go back to work on Monday morning. I just don't see the point anymore. 

I was bullied throughout my childhood and teenage years. I have BPD and some other ""issues"" as well. I'm very bad at handling boredom. I know it's something everyone must learn to tolerate, but I just can't. I feel like going crazy, I actually suffer when I feel bored or if I'm forced to focus on something that doesn't interest me. It's hard to explain, I know it sounds like laziness or lack of self-discipline, but it's not that. I just can't bring myself to do it if it feels like shit. It hurts mentally, it's intolerable.

I don't think my past or my BPD can explain why I feel like this because there are other people who have it worse and are still able to work. I have always wanted to be free, do my own thing, spend time alone (not with co-workers or classmates). I need freedom and solitude so much. There's something else wrong with me, but I don't know what it is.

This week I skipped work for 2 days, and last week I stayed home for 3 days. As you could probably imagine, my boss and my co-workers didn't like it. I have lost their respect and I'm already scared of going to work on Monday. I feel so ashamed of myself and trapped in this situation.

I'm currently living with my SO and he's the reason I tried living like a normal person, so we could afford living together. Now I don't know if I can go on like this and it feels awful because not only I have disappointed my boss, I have also betrayed my partner. If I quit work I need to get my own appartment because in my country you won't get income support from state if you are living with your SO and they are working. My SO doesn't make enough money for both of us and I don't want to take his money anyway. 

Life feels so rough. Don't wanna work? Be poor, maybe end up homeless. Go to work? Be trapped in there throughout your best years and suffer until you die. I just can't win.",10Apr2020,1
546,"I (M23) currently live at home with my parents, before this I was set to move into a new house with my fiancée, something that I had been looking forward to for a very long time.. mainly to get away from toxic people in the household.

During this whole virus lockdown my sister has been the main problem and a very big problem at that.. she REFUSES to abide by the rules of staying inside, she constantly drives places she wants to go to, she’s constantly meeting people including her boyfriend who is just as selfish as she is for meeting her, an example is today she’s insisted on driving to a gym she knows to collect a massive amount of used unclean equipment to bring back to my parents property inside the house! 

She knows how bad the current situation is as how deadly the virus is but the more I tell her that she needs to stop going out and making reckless selfish journeys the angrier and more determined she gets, I have tried issuing my style of punishment at her including shouting at her and threatening to report her to the police (even if they could do anything at all!) but that just makes her more angry, and when I try to prevent her doing these things I get massively punished from my parents for apprehending her, including being threatened to being thrown out the property, I’ve been told that I’m no longer to try and prevent her from doing things from my parents. 

This is ultimately because my sister becomes violent and aggressive whenever my parents have tried to stop her doing things in the past, so it’s become far easier for them to just leave her be, and just as easy to punish me for trying to lay down the law... what’s worse is I am on the very high risk group with a heart problem, and my father is in the high risk group too, it’s become exhausting to try and lay down any type of rules when I have zero authority in a house that isn’t mine. 

She’s committed crimes before including stealing my parents credit cards to go out and buy things and driving without insurance, all of which I got massively punished by my parents for trying to explain she needs to be punished. 

My mother also works for the NHS in an extremely important job role as well, which puts a LOT of people at risk, at home I am trying to do my best in terms of sanitary procedures, such washing my hands every two hours and using surgical spirits and hand sanitiser, the two high risk people in this house (myself and my father ) attempted to have our own bathrooms as another measure, but she refused to accept that and instead decided that she wanted to use every bathroom in the house, her reasoning was that “why should certain people have their own bathrooms and not me” 

Unfortunately this has been a reoccurring theme throughout her life, she was massively spoilt as a child and has a MASSIVE sense of self-entitlement... so much so that through hard work I was able to buy a fairly expensive car, she was extremely angry about this and demanded that my parents buy her a new car to which she was given one immediately, another example is I have a large outdoor metal shed/storage facility that I paid for and built myself, I put a lot of expensive gym equipment in there and was looking forward to Using  it during the lockdown period, unfortunately my sister did not like this one bit, after one of her drives out one day she can’t back into the shed and decided to cough over and used literally every piece of equipment in there making it not safe for me to use. 

I am at a point now where it is almost certain that I will contract this virus, and most likely die from it, I have no idea what to do... can I contact the police? Can I report her to literally anyone??! 

TLDR: My sisters reckless and selfish behaviour ignoring ALL lockdown rules is putting a lot of people including myself and my family at high risk!",10Apr2020,1
547,"I haven't done anything wrong..

I work part time in a supermarket (weekends but full time as of recent).  
I've been here 6 months, they let a couple people go coming up to their 6 month review..  
I started as Christmas staff and I was the only one to be kept on from that group, since the start of the new year 2 people have been let go at their 6 month review, two people who seemed like they were good workers.

  
I had a little 'catch' up with our HR person around 2 months ago, I needed to sign paperwork that I was suppose to sign when I started.  
When I was signing the paperwork she started saying how I was a little slow working, and that I needed to make sure everything went out (not missing anything/leaving it behind).  
She also said to try and not miss any/too many more days (I'd missed 2).

I ended up missing a week 2 weeks ago because a supervisor said I shouldn't be working given the current pandemic and my asthma.  
So I had a sick cert for that week and I started working nights after that.

  
I've tried to speed up.. and I've been pretty quick/diligent, but I don't know if it's enough.

I want to stay working here... I like the people, I don't have any friends outside of work and we get along very well.. I don't want to start over.  
Also there's a girl who I've been chatting to quite a bit, I think I've a chance.  
She's also on nights but only does 1 night a week and I haven't been on the same shift as her for a few weeks now.

I don't/won't see her outside of work.

I don't know if I should say something to my supervisor/ask her about it.

I mentioned it to one of the other supervisors during the day and he just said 'oh that could be postponed yet given everything that's going on..   
But they're hiring more people each day..

I asked for more hours and I got them.. so maybe that's a good sign? Even when she didn't reply to my email...

I don't know.

What can I do to improve my chances?

548,"I suffer from depression, PTSD and (social) anxiety and have been in a relationship for over 2 years now. He generally treats me well, cares for me and supports me but it becomes more frequent that the way he talks to me during a discussion/fight, behaves and touches me, also in day to day life, causes me to have major flashbacks and triggers me into a panic attack or even causes me to fear him in those moments as my brain somehow compares him to my parents and my uncle (people who seperately abused me). I started hurting myself again, I feel myself slipping into a major down again.

I know he isn't like my parents nor my uncle. I go to therapy and work on my trauma and how it affects me in daily life. But I start to worry that this situation isn't healthy for me. That those incidents set me back in my progress over and over again. That I won't be able to heal while being with him.

I talked with him about this already on multiple occassions. Told him what exactly triggers me and that I try to fight against it but he could try too to not get loud or personal/insulting during fights. Nothing changes.
I also mentioned it to my therapist but he doesn't give me advice regarding this situation.

Can anyone help me? Give me advice on what to do? Should I break up for my own sake and hope that it will help me heal? Continue this way and hope therapy helps me even with those incidents?

550,"My husband is just stressed about every little thing lately. We talked about it about a week ago and his mood got so much better. It was so nice. We worked in the yard together and just had a great couple of days. But he's going back to being moody again. 

For example, yesterday before going to work he's complaing the entire time and getting mad and yelling at every little inconvenience like sometimes you have to jiggle the handle on our toilet or the water will just keep running. We have a puppy and she was jumping up on him and he was yelling at her. So since he was in such a bad mood I cut the grass(so he didn't have to since I've been asking him to for like 2 weeks now), I went to the store and got him some good snacks for work. And I made his favorite chicken with carrots for dinner. When I showed him the yard all he really had to say about it was, ""that's awesome, but that's my job"". Idk I was expecting a bigger reaction, or some more appreciation or something. 

I work from home and he works in construction. So I normally wake up with him and pack his lunch just bc I like to and I know if I don't do it he just won't eat. This morning I woke up late because I was up with the puppy all night since she had tummy issues(she's okay now). He got up with me when it first started around 2 AM but he was just yelling and stomping around so I told him to just go to bed bc I can't stand being around that especially when I'm exhausted too. So this morning he's obviously annoyed which I don't even know why. I wanted to sleep in since I was up half the night but I wake up to him just making a bunch of noise so I ask what's wrong. Since he's been up for less than 15 minutes I just can't see what can go horribly wrong in the first 15 minutes of the day. And he goes, ""I checked the bank account, after we pay the mortgage we're going to be effin broke again"". So I checked and we're not, everything is FINE. He's just over reacting about everything as he does lately. 

It's just really putting me on edge not knowing what mood he's going to be in when he gets home. I feel like I do so much to try and eliminate any unnecessary stress and as far as I know there is nothing going on causing him to act like this. But it's starting to make me feel really underappreciated bc it's like he doesn't even acknowledge what I do to try and keep things running smoothly and he just gets so annoyed at every little thing. 

I don't want it to sound like he doesn't ever do anything. He does soo much around the house and he works so hard. I know how much he loves me I just wish he could come out of this funk. 

Tl;dr: Husband just seems annoyed at everything and it's starting to hurt my feelings and take a tole on how I'm feeling throughout the day. Is there anything I can do to make him less irritated or at least not let it affect me as much.",10Apr2020,1

They are constantly coming by to move stuff and coming into the basement to ask for favors, no problem, but every time he calls me and im sleeping he always makes remarks and literally just lectures me to wake up earlier. he is a millitary retired who always wakes up at the ass crack of dawn and does who knows what all day.  i was up all night last night sick and i took benydril (its only 940 when he came) and my boyfriend was helping him move a washer and dryer and i heard him ask why im still sleeping. normally this wont bother me, but i feel extremely judged because im staying here during quarentine, after we lived together three years and just moved out recently, and my boyfriend is paying no rent as they are helping him out. he makes me feel like shit when i already hate that i cant work during this stay at home order (immuno compromised). is there a way i can ask him to stop the remarks without being rude? maybe its in my own head i just dont want him to think im taking advantage of staying here and im probably overthinking because why would he care? im 22 and bf is 25, and they arent even living in this house, i had a package delivered here (my meds) and for some reason i was super self consious when he told me. Its making me on edge and exausted because i try to stay up so if he comes he wont think im lazy, but im just fucking up my sleep schedule and half the time he says hes coming he doesnt and im just waiting around. in my opinion why should it matter when i wake up when there is no reason to? ill be sitting around in the morning just like i do at night so why does he care so much",10Apr2020,1

When I was still a toddler, my older brother decided to lock me up in a pitch dark closet. This have not been any problem for me until recently when I started doing security job.

It's so severe that I if I so much as see one just a few metres away, it completely takes hold of me and I totally shut down. My whole body instantly jerks, I have to get away immediately, and I'd push people over if they're in the way. It makes me lose perception of all my senses. 

In this country we get swarms of wasps every August - October, meaning that on most years I can hardly leave my room for that three month period. I've noticed that they've already started this year, however. My family is insistent that we always keep all doors and windows open during the summer, and if I close any they'll shout at me and throw things at me for 'causing disasters' and they say that I'm embarrassing for it. I simply cannot leave my room for the majority of the year - I even avoid using the bathroom for fear that wasps could by flying around our house. This isn't entirely unfounded either because I will see a high number of wasps entering our house every single day.

I don't care if it's rational, because either way it's still real and it's stopping me from living a healthy life. I've looked for therapies, but they are simply unavailable in this country: even when my life was at risk a couple of years ago nothing could be found and no help was offered or provided.

I've cried, I've yelled Ive almost wanted to leave a couple times, yeah not a good idea especially now, my mom has tried to talk to me but I'm just so hurt or I was to hurt to listen.

Everyone says I did the right thing in calling the cops. Everyone but my dad of course, he wanted my phone the only thing that made me feel safe anymore in my home. I refused so he took my headset, I paid for it and it was pretty pricey but it was worth it. Ever since then I've been on a mission to ruin him, I wanted to take him to court and get him in trouble otherwise.

All of my pots, pans, silverware, cups, etc are all sitting in the sink dirty. I never have any stuff to use to make breakfast. They might load the dishwasher but never turn it on so I turn it on in the morning. Then I almost have to force them to unload the dishwasher, just so I can put the ones from the sink in there. I woke up this morning, one again, to the dishes in the sink and melted cheese stuck all over the counters. I could not leave until I cleaned it and I finally had to give up on scrubbing all of the cheese off. It's constant and it has gotten worse since the whole quarantine. I can't escape it.

564,"This is weird, but I’m not sure where else to ask this question. It’s not exactly a medical question,  but also sort of is. 

My eyes get puffy after crying, like EXTREMELY puffy. Even if I’m only crying a bit, they’re get swollen to the point that they’re difficult to open. It looks like I’ve had an allergic reaction to something. 

They also stay puffy for hours. If I cry at night, go to sleep for 8-9 hours, I’ll wake up and they’ll still be so puffy it’s a chore to open them.

569,"My life has been a roller coaster as of late, although it usually typically is. 

The root of my problems is my mother. Over the past couple years she’s disappeared/reappeared into my life multiple times while she struggles with drug addiction. It wasn’t always like that, I used to live with her full time and be happy. She was happy, everything was bliss until the addiction came, and the lying, and the leaving until the mom I knew completely disappeared. 

Recent years she’s been fine though, almost like my old mother, with one problem, her new boyfriend is a piece of shit. He’s abusive, violent and has a long criminal record, he even has an FBI profile.

So he goes on these business trips, that’s when I stay with my mom. I may have been bored one night and taken a few grams out of his weed stash. Upon his return and discovery (which I was gone for thankfully) he cussed my mom out (in front of my little sister) for hours, kicked her out, and threatened to come to my school and beat my ass or harm me somewhere else which led to me having to file a report.

So, my mom goes to live with my grandma. I felt guilty bc even though it was over something as stupid as a few grams of weed it was my fault she got kicked out. (She wasn’t able to bring any of her clothes, art or her dog) 

Skip about a week later, my mom goes back to live with him. After his threats to her and her children, her mother and everyone else who loves my mom idk how she could go back to him. She didn’t even tell us, I didn’t know for days after it happened. This isn’t the first time she’s been kicked out by him though and gone back, more like the fifth. 

(I should also add she’s very financially dependent on him. My mom hasn’t worked a job since she got fired for drugs like five years ago. He makes enough money to care for them both very luxuriously.)

I’m just hurt that my mom would go back to someone who threatened me. Ig it shows how much my mom cares for me. It also doesn’t help that I’m a completely failure (looks, intelligence, talent) have no future (no way I make it to college) i have bpd (one of my mother’s many mental illnesses, I think this was passed hereditary) I feel like my friends secretly hate me, and I haven’t talked to my mom in like a month. Even on her birthday I said nothing which caused me enormous guilt. I just don’t see a reason to live if I can’t be loved by my own mother.

571,"**Edit the title should say Dump but I guess I should proofread before I hit send** 

I know all yall will be thinking ""yeah you should"" but I'd then quite literally have no one in my social circle who is my age.

So here's a little background basically my friends who I have been friends with since secondary school used to ignore me, go out without me, never do anything which I would like to do (i.e. I like chill nights out with food and a few drinks and they like going to get blackout drunk and hating life the next day). But since this pandemic now all they want to do is talk to me. They never cared before, like I could go weeks without talking to them. They would never contact me unless they wanted something, never had my back if I needed anything.

But now because of all the pandemic stuff, where we can't go out they want to talk to me all of the time. They set up a group chat which is pinging most of the time, they want to do a group video chat once a week so we can see each other. And they're always checking in on me to see if I'm okay. Yes, I'm okay I can function without people checking in on me all the time and making sure I'm still alive, I'm an introvert and love my own company. I just want to be cosy and read.

When I do go out with them, because I do when they invite me and if I feel like it (Social Anxiety at its finest yall), they sap all my energy so I have to spend the next day in bed recovering my energy levels.

So should I just cut my losses so I can spend all my time on me and going out on my terms with people I like to spend time with who may be older than me but they don't sap my energy or do I stick with what I'm doing now and only go out with them depending on what they've planned and if my SA isn't being all weird",10Apr2020,1

575,"Hi.

My gf went to Spain in january to study there 6 months. When the pandemic hit, she got stuck in the country. She has no income, and both her parents were just fired from their jobs. She’s been staying at a house with 3 other people. They’re all very nice and fun, but she’s afraid she’ll run out of money and that she’ll get kicked out or something like that. A student friend of hers that is also stuck in Spain tried to arrange a flight back with the embassy, but the flight was expensive and ultimately got cancelled. My gf doesn’t want to spend what little money she has left on a flight that may get cancelled. She has enough to stay this month and maybe next month, but chances are, with the economic crisis that’s hitting the world, our currency will be worth less a month from now, so even that is not a guarantee.

I’d appreciate suggestions on what to do next. She’s been trying to find a job in Spain even before all this, but she can’t because she doesn’t have the proper visa, and now it’s even harder. She’s looking for online jobs to get some income at least, but she is struggling with that as well, partly because she doesn’t speak English.

576,"So I’m a free-lance artist, and yes very much unemployed thanks to COVID-19. I started this one job back in the Fall and hoped they would keep me on for the future season projects! I am the only one that is not technically faculty. I’m also 24 and he’s somewhere in his early 50’s.

The first time anything got awkward was when he made a comment on how “I’m probably a wet dream for some of the student interns.” I basically froze and tried to blow it off, with a loud “ew.” I know, probably wasn’t enough to set him straight.

He and I had been texting at the beginning of quarantine discussing what to do with the currently stalled project.

However, two days ago in a group chat I messaged him and another coworker with a picture of a wine bottle/baking supplies with a “when your show can’t open, what can you do other than have a glass of wine and bake?”

He responded in a separate text just to myself the next day, asking how my night was/hope I enjoyed the wine/deserved to get drunk.
Conversation cont’d and he says “well at least you didn’t send nudes, pictures of doughnuts are fine, but I wouldn’t judge either way.”
I said something along the lines of “OH GOD, no nudes here hah.” Because I’m horribly with confrontation, and my first response was to deflect/change the subject.
He brought up suggesting nudes once more and then made a joke about “doughnuts”
I ended the convo with a “well stay safe! Let’s hope this quarantine ends soon.”
He followed with a, “you too! Let me know next time you’re drunk.”

I know the easiest way is to just tell HR/other faculty but I’m not a person who likes a lot of attention and experienced a similar but physical situation at another job 4 years ago where the guy flew into a rage throwing power tools after I went to HR, I was hidden in a storage closet for an hour while he screamed asking for me- couldn’t sleep for a week, since he knew my car.

588,"Hi all,

I've (30F) been with my boyfriend (31M) for 1.5 years. We got a 2 bedroom apartment together back in October 2019, along with his 74-year-old mother. The last six months have been hell for me due to his mother's habits:

* She is a lifelong smoker of cigarettes. She goes outside to smoke at least 10-15 times a day. The front door is constantly opening and closing. 
* Although she smokes outside, up until 3 weeks ago, she was smoking right by the front door so the smoke would come in when she came back into the house. She goes a bit further to smoke now, but still, she often goes directly into kitchen and if I'm in there, I'm nearly floored by the smell (I'm very sensitive to it, possibly allergic). 
* She also drinks coffee all day. She makes 1-2 pots of it a day. However she gets coffee all over the counters and then doesn't clean it up so eventually I'm left to clean up the stains. 
* She makes other messes on the kitchen counters, doesn't make any effort to clean them, and leaves stuff out. 
* The living room/couch is right in line of the front door, and since she was smoking by the door for 5 months, the smoke has accumulated on the couch and left a smell. I can't sit on it anymore or I'll smell too. I lock myself in our bedroom because that's the only place with fresh air. 
* Since we don't use the couch anymore, she's been using it and is constantly in the living room.  I feel like I have no privacy. 
* Whenever I'm making something in the kitchen, she comes in and starts making something (as in, she will use the oven/stove while I'm still using it) and it's worse if she does it right after coming in from smoking. 
* She sometimes uses things or food we have bought, but doesn't contribute any supplies.
* She always puts food (like chunks of meat) in the sink but that stuff is too big for the disposal and she already caused damage to our dishwasher and the apartment below us when she put rice down there and is caused a huge clog. Almost got fined. She still puts big pieces of food in the sink which we then have to transfer to the trash.
* She also smokes marijuana, but that's inside. She uses just a pipe with no filtration so whenever we turn on the heat/AC, the smell comes through the air vents. I can smell it in our bedroom and it's very apparent out in the living room even though I've closed the vents. 
* I have a cat that I'm keeping in my room because every time she stays in the living room she comes back smelling like smoke. I have to wipe her down all the time. 
* I have had recent high blood pressure issues and heart palpitations and I'm worried of the effect of the smoke. 

We are halfway through the lease, with 6 months left. I didn't realize when we moved in it would be this frustrating living with her. I used to like her, but now I'm growing resentful due to her habits and her desire to live off of her son. I feel completely uncomfortable living in the apartment and dread coming home from work every day.

His older sister was going to help their mom find her own place but then coronavirus hit, and they don't want to take her out in public now. 

What should I do? Should I move out? It would be tough on both of us financially, but for me I think it would be worth it to have my own space. I just can't deal with this anymore.

So, as my title indicated, I have a big problem of motivation. And it didn't recently started because of the quarantine, it has been going on for years now and I don't know what to do anymore. Every time I start something, I rapidly lose the motivation/interest to continue it on the long term, even if this thing interests me.

For example, since the end of last year, I wanted to start studying korean because this is a language that I find interesting. I even bought lessons books and all that stuff and, for a while, I did started to learn. But now, just the idea of sitting at my desk and opening one of these books seems hard. Same for writing ; I want to publish my own book and started to write around ten chapters but now, I'm not even motivated to open OpenOffice. And these are just two examples on a very long list.

I did found a way to keep me motivated a while ago ; journaling every day and making a ""to do"" list of the things I needed to accomplish (writing, learning ect..). But as my life is pretty uneventful, I quickly realized this method wasn't helping at all because I was always writing the same things in my journal, so it made me stop.

The problem is that I, also, lack of patience. When I start something, I want to have quick results or a ""proof"" that what I was doing wasn't in vain. So when I was learning korean (to stay on that example), the fact that I couldn't quickly memorize things and make visible progress made me feel defeated.

Anyways. So I came here hoping that some of you share the same problem as mine and found a solution. Any advice is welcome, because this lack of motivation is really a nightmare for me.",10Apr2020,1

In grade 6 she got into this huge fight with her friends because she did something wrong and they got mad at her. They started to ignore her. I wasn’t involved but I was aware of what was happening. After she fought with them I became closer with them ( nothing t do with the fight ! We became close due to a project). After we graduated, we made up and chatted causally. We haven’t talked in 4 years and today I received a message from her. I thought she was just being polite and wanted to chat up. But then she started asking about her fight and asked me if I was using her to get closer to her friends and told me stuff like, I believed it when you said they were using me, they were my only friends and stuff like that. She also said that they ignored her after they graduated which was fake cuz she came back last year and they met her. She also talked about how they hate her and stuff and how it’s cuz of the fight. She kept on asking if I told them stuff and why l lied. I told her that did not and at first she didn’t believe , after a while she stopped and we chatted a bit. I asked her if we were okay and she said yes we r okay. I can’t understand what she is thinking and I really don’t want her to text the others or start something cuz it’s been years and I am not keen on reconnecting with the others and I know it will start drama. I can’t understand why she asked and I don’t know what to do. I know I ended the conversation but u still feel weird. Should I just drop it? I am so confused.",10Apr2020,1
602,"I recently started working at a shop within the last few months and shes been working there for two years now. Weve known each other for a long time, ever since middle school. Although Ive only ever consider her an aquantaince, we've had decent convos all throughout the years.

So the other night her and I and another coworker (who I'm also pretty comfortable with and have known him for years) were all conversing about an old coworker before me who kinda let her things run free. Hearing this was funny, I guess, but then they started going on about how her breasts looked and how sweaty they would get and then I was just over it, barely listening.

Thats when she said ""Yeah they were just a little bit bigger than yours..."", quite rudely too. I have a case of gynecomastia, its where the breasts develop small fatty tissues around the nipple. It usually can happen in men when theyve lost a lot a weight (for me almost 70 lbs) and theres a lot of leftover fat around the chest. Ive been struggling with it for awhile now and its been evident that Ive lost quite a bit of weight since HS, and have been trying my best to stay active and find remedies to get rid of them. So when she said this I knew she was making fun of my body, and I felt humiliated. I just said ""Okay..."", gave her a face, and walked away. Things were pretty awkward for the rest of the night.

I know this is something to report, but I feel way too embarresed to even bring it up to my boss (who I already have problems with and dont feel like confiding in him about something personal like body image). So my only choices I feel like is either confront her about it (which is already 
nervewracking as it is) or go to corporate (idk, which I feel is going a tad too far even for me). Im trying to rack my brain on how to approach the situation.

Tldr: Longtime aquaintance and coworker made fun of my body in front of another coworker and I dont know how to go about the situation (would be weird if brought up to boss, not on good terms).",10Apr2020,1
604,"(First post)
 I dont actually know how to start.

 In the past, I have had issues with feeding myself and purging when I did eat. I had very poor body image growing up. 
Getting older made my confidence start to land as I have found my footing in my personality and my perception of my body. I am the most confident I've ever been in fact, thanks to my boyfriend and friends and a healthy routine. 

Then, when we all started to have to stay home (understandable) and I lost my job temporarily (because of the pandemic), I have progressed right back into having issues with feeding myself. 

I am really not sure what it is about the long and many days at home that makes me want to have this competition with myself. I've been having around 600-700cals a day, usually consisting of a couple boiled eggs throughout the day, a low cal smoothie to sip on through the afternoon and a toddler sized dinner(not even wanting to finish the dinner by the end of the day). 

I don't want all the spare time on my hands to allow a nasty habit to form and would like to nip it in the bud.

Not sure what answer I'm searching for honestly, just; How do I not want to starve? It's such a simple little question but I don't know the answer. As I've lived for the the 'pro-ana' sites in the past, avoiding searching Google is avoiding that rabbit hole. 

I'm unsure of what to do for myself, I know it is not good though. I don't want to cause concern for anyone by losing more weight in the coming weeks. I'm already at my healthy weight, and my family has seen me when I was starving and purging. If I come out of this social distancing corner and see my family at a dropped weight, everyone will know, and I dont want to disappoint them. But, How do I stop the cycle before it begins? Is anyone else having similar issues?",10Apr2020,1

607,"I had been dating my ex for around two years when I really started to notice how unhappy I was. Around this time I was looking for support and posted on Reddit. I found a few people but they all fizzled out but one. This guy that is from a different state than me. I eventually got it in me I had to break up with my now ex and that was okay. I started spending more time with this guy and found myself loving and looking forward to the time I spent with him. 

Flash forward quite a few months and we have gotten pretty close. Then a guy I like at my school asked me out. I was excited and it was new and I said yes and we have been together a few months. He is a really nice guy and I love his family but he doesn't react well to be when I'm upset or moody he just kinda leaves me alone which is the opposite of what I need. I have told them that and that I need to be loved a bit differently and I really like attention and felt frusterated cuz I wasn't getting much. 

I'm at this point where I really care about both guys. The guy from out of state knows I have a bf and my bf knows I've been spending time with a guy friend of mine but he didn't know he is out of state. If he or anyone around here including my parents found out I had been talking to someone online I would have my head mounted on a wall. 

The guy from out of state I'm still just as excited to hear from him and I look forward to spending time with him moreso than my bf. 

I don't want anyone to get hurt and I've been not sleeping well for weeks because of this and my tendency to not be honest to myself about my feelings and insist I'm just in a mood.

609,"So I'm 22 yrs old and just got back to living at home on a 2 month work break (I work 6 months abroad then 2 months home, moving out soon though) My plan was to spend a majority of the time in Bali for vacation but because of Corona, I have no other option. 

I love my parents, they've provided me everything materially and love me, but coming back home I feel like I'm 15yrs old again, because the SAME issues, all the fussing and fighting and unhappiness is still their living situation. At 22, I don't want to be a part of it anymore, I don't want to hear ""your father this, your mother this, etc. etc. etc."" It's a broken record. I want their happiness above all. They don't love each other, the only thing that kept them together was us kids, and good memories being made are few and far between. I wish they would have gotten a divorce a long time ago to save us from all the yelling and being woken up at 5am to screaming. 

&amp;#x200B;

# I don't want to be that out of line daughter that forces their parents to do something,

# ****But I've told them it's either get a divorce, live separately, and be happier, or I won't come visit at home and won't have contact.  I could visit them separately and make good memories again. Cause right now the good times are few and far between. The cons outweighs the pros and it is painful to watch it still continue. I don't want to live the next 22 years seeing and hearing about it. 

I think they are afraid of change (they are both 65 yrs old), they have the funds and the means to move, but they are so use to this toxic way of living that they can't see the brighter side of how this would improve their life and our relationship. My intention isn't to be a control freak and tell them how to live their lives, more like a ""If you don't want to change, don't, but I don't want to be a part of it"" 

I plan to move out of their house in the next month permanently (at 22yrs old, it's definitely time) and eventually out of the States to Australia. I don't want the last few memories to be of me telling them off, but just can't tell them that I'm OK with them continuing to live in an abusive environment by choice- and that's all I hear about.

**Background:**

My mother has been a severe Alcoholic for the past 12 years (my childhood), and watches TV 24 hours a day in her bedroom, or is knocked out sleeping. She's gotten major hip surgeries but has failed to do rehab therapy on her own due to the alcohol and my dad waiting on her hand and foot. She also calls my dad at least 10 times over the phone per day to yell at him for things that happened 20 years ago, and barely comes downstairs to get food. She's the loveliest person  when she IS sober, she's so active and loving, but uses my dad to wait on her hand and feet as an excuse to keep drinking and not get better. 

My father is quite passive. He does little else but read the Bible, watch Fox 8 new and support Donald Trump, to each his own except that he ignores the reality that his wife and kids have suffered from the inability to ACT on things that have pained us. He's provided for us so much out of love, went to our school sporting events, etc. but his decisions regarding my mom, and my brother who is in jail, have affected us kids emotionally, and he understand why we aren't happy.

610,"About a month ago, my friend needed money to pay for a driver so that she could get her money she left mistakenly left behind and it was a half to an hour drive to the other community. She left $400 in a bag which was for her little brothers gravestone and promised to pay me back. 

I was fundraising for a trip and she knew I had money on me since she helped out one day, so she asked me because she was trying her best to get the money back and had no other options. I have really bad trust issues, caused by my mother, however my friend is the most positive and friendly girl I've met and her grandparents have their own mini business going on in the community so money wasn't a problem for her so I reluctantly gave her the money and she went soon after.

She couldn't go because of the curfew that had been placed that same day, the driver was a mutual friend of ours and Friend said that the driver would be the one paying me back because she had already used the money on gas. That didn't feel right with me so I asked around for others opinions on who should really be the one paying and they all said Friend since she was the one who borrowed.

I told her about it and she said she would work on it and so far nothing. She hasn't given it back despite it nearly being a month since. The trip was a week after I gave it to her, I didn't think her paying me back would be a problem so I trusted her. Luckily the trip was cancelled.

I asked her for the money back because food was running low back at home. That was two weeks ago. I've asked her a few more times however I'm afraid to keep asking because I don't want to be a bother.

But really fast he has complimented my face, body, called me a model and ""his princess"" and is constantly in this flirtatious state of conversation, for example, when i send him a meme with a bad dad joke, he answered with ""haha this i s why i love you, you're so perfect and gorgeous"" with a lot of emojis of course. I am in a state of being care towards him, kinda dodging when he says he wants me to lay next to him and such.

the thing is; yesterday when we face-timed, i got tired, because i do in fact have a type of Autism, and i was getting in a bad mood from being socially drained. I told it to him, he seemed okay with it, and then he sent me tons of snaps of himself crying, because he missed me.

It has just mounted to so much in so little time, i don't want to go into a relationship with him, because i can see it not working out even now.

for reference i did call him ""nice looking"" and as the stupid person i am, after he said he was ugly, i disagreed and tried to up his self esteem, which i think was what started the whole ordeal. I'm not innocent, but i dont know how to get out of this without hurting him.

He today played the socially drained thing as a thing that hurt HIM alot and i cant understand. He says he was so down he wanted to end his life. Because of my autism and being unable t speak for 5 hours a day, with no convo other than him giving compliments. its exhausting.

i want to be friends with him, it has just mounted to too much compliments, its constant. no other talk, just compliments. it just seems so meaningless to me.

My mum and I have been through hell together, we survived and got through an abusive household. (My dad... yay daddy issues :D)

She has always protected me.
She now has a “boyfriend” but their relationship is so toxic and mentally abusive that almost everyday she’s breaking down into tears. He’s verbally abused her, he says the most disgusting things, he wasnt there for her through her abortion, hes cheated on her. But any time she tries to break things off and get rid of him for good he screams and crys about how he will kill himself and has tried to multiple times just to trap my mum.

She’s always telling me to butt out of these problems but finally I snapped and spoke my mind and spoke out, instead she yells at me saying im just another problem and to stop trying to stir.

I feel so powerless and hopeless that I cant protect her like she has always protected me. I have never wished someones death before but when I see how unhappy he makes her I cant help but think ‘please God just do something’

Im kinda feeling the whole ‘damned if you do damned if you dont thing’ 

But she wont listen. Every time I try and explain to her that she is way happier without him she just shrugs me off saying Im too young to understand whats going on, but i SEE and i LISTEN.

i was happy at first because i couldn't really understand cantonese (i'm latina), but after living here for almost a year i can honestly say i've become miserable because of my mother in law.

she acts like she's constantly above the law, setting down rules and breaking them, even verbally abusing everyone around her. even when she has a bad day, she comes home and does this -- she is legitimately the centre of all negativity in this house. whenever someone tries to cook for example, she shits on them, only saying she can do it better and that they're garbage (whether it be her sons or her husband). she'll even make the recipe herself to try and prove it, all while insulting the other person, and INSISTING hers is great even though there might be a problem (like the dough being raw). she even yells at my fiance's grandparents (who are in their late 90s).

and while i understand sometimes cantonese sounds like yelling, i'm speaking of actual yelling. that results in tears, or leaving in anger, from the person this behaviour is being directed at.

lately she has also been telling my fiance and i to cook, but then monopolizing everything in the kitchen to ""teach us"" (even though she doesn't know what she's doing) -- or even screaming at us for being ungrateful and not eating what she made (despite telling us to cook a few hours prior). it's absolute insanity, and her behaviour is deplorable. 

there was even one time her husband fell down the stairs at work and opened his head. he had a weird baseball looking lump on his hand too, from this fall, and she still forced him to continue to work without ever seeing the doctor. money is all she talks about.

as for the racism, she absolutely hates anything from my culture and responds to any kind of food even when its similar to chinese food (ex. empanadas) with very dramatic disgust. she even tells me im cooking wrong and how to improve it when making food (ex. she'll turn tacos into burritos), and constantly tell me chinese people are the smartest and the best. she likewise hates on black people and anyone who isnt east asian.

everyone else in my fiances family has alienated his family unit because of the mom, and im honestly getting so burnt out. i cant even fight back or do anything because im in their house, and we have a language barrier. my fiance is so afraid of her that he doesnt even leave the room without me by his side and im so exhausted. i guess what im asking for is just some way to help my stress. some ideas for a hobby or self care that works. because of the quarentine its difficult to actually do something, so i understand if this post is difficult to respond to.

             It must have been the cutest, least scary doll I've ever seen. Even as a kid I had never felt attached to a doll before (Or an object in general) but I really felt a bond with this thing.
It doesn't feel like holding an object. It feels as thought it has an energy, like how a person feels.
I swear it breaths sometimes. And I've seen its face change, look angry. Just for a secound. And thats just when I'm awake.  
I kept having these hyper realistic nightmares about it moving around.
 I felt like if it was giving me these nightmares on purpose. So I locked it up in a closet. I put a blanket on it so it wouldn't be too angry.
The nightmares stopped but I feel bad keeping it in the closet. If it really does have a spirit, won't I just antagonize it locking it up in there? 
I'm Christian, should I pray with the doll? Or will that make it meaner?
I want to just treat it like a person, or at least plop it in front of the T.V. in the living room just so it can have some entertainment. But I'm afraid that treating it like a person/growing attached to it would give it more power? It seems to only have power when I choose to interact with it (Like how the nightmares stopped when I put it in the closet) 
But what if its just rightfully mad because it doest get any love?
I also have a serious  mold problem I can't afford to get fixed so maybe I'm just being paranoid because of the exposure? But why only with this doll? I have other dolls (from my grandma) and I've never had this issue from them.

I'm partly writing this to put my own thoughts into words but I am also interested in your opinions too...

&amp;#x200B;

I sold my business and took 4 months off. 

&amp;#x200B;

I found a decent job in an area I wanted to live in on INDEED. I flew up to visit. I liked the people/job/pay. 

&amp;#x200B;

I took the new job in FEB. I had to move a long way and it was some trouble/expense. I started the new job in MAR. Now I've been here three weeks. I'm on base 36,000 + 5% commission of what I sell. And they told me in writing very clearly in an email that when I want I can move from 36,000+5% to 10% commission.  We sell high ticket items. My commission, if corona virus wasn't happening, would normally give me an additional 1.5-4K at the 5% rate. But there are no leads closing due to the market/corona virus. So my commission is zero. All the clients/buyers want to wait a month or two until things clear up before they give me a 10K or 20K check to make a down payment. This corona virus situation isn't my fault or my boss's fault. My boss owns our small company of about 20-25 people. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have not been paid yet. 

&amp;#x200B;

My boss comes to me yesterday and says they let go of the other sales person and now we are just two people salespeople. That should give me more leads. He wants to talk about my pay situation because it has been almost three weeks and I haven't been paid. He says he will write me a check. But for now since business is terrible the best he can do is give me my 750 base and not any commission. I haven't sold anything anyway but I've bid a ton of stuff. So he isn't really taking money from me. But I'm getting completely fucked out of anything I sell in the future - lets say I close 20% of what I've bid over the last three weeks then I would be due a commission of thousands of dollars. There wasn't any clarity on when/how this would change. It was like we were just waiting for the corona virus to be ""over"" and new business sales to start coming in again and the bank would be flush before my situation would be addressed. I don't really have any reason to live in this town if I am going to be working here for 36,000 for six or twelve months. Maybe this virus situation will be over in just four weeks but I honestly have no idea and neither does anyone else. The cost of living where I am living is too high for me to live off of 36,000/year. I would literally be living off my savings. I would have less money each and every month. My rent alone is 1700 dollars. I'm living in a nice city in a nice area. 

&amp;#x200B;

Earning 36k while paying 1700 rent is foolish and I should have rented a cheaper place

&amp;#x200B;

How much should I rock the boat? If there had been more clarity I would call what happened somewhat reasonable but there wasn't any future clarity. I think I've been treated in a shady way and I am considering leaving. This could be a great job if I stick it out in a few months, I be patient, things clear up in terms of the economy/virus and I start earning 10% commission. The job is easy and it plays to all my strengths. But I don't trust the people above me anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have 24 months of living expenses saved in an account. I have no reason to live off my savings while working for someone else. But I would have to go back to the drawing board in terms of a job. I would move back to my home state. I would search on indeed and continue pressing through my contacts to find a good situation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Finding a job right now is probably going to be pretty hard with millions unemployed.

She’s feeling like we took her away from her new life and I’m having a hard time with her feeling this way. 

She can’t work here or there. It’s easier for us to support her here than there. I’ve tried explaining all of this and she’s just still so upset. We have to go clean out her dorm in May and I know she wants to stay.

630,"Hi,

I'll add a TLDR at the bottom.

I'm a 23y old guy in a relationship with a 21y old woman.
We've been together for over 4 years and known eachother for 6. We have a 9 month old child together and live in a rented place with her dog and my cat.
So now that the introdutions are out of the way.

I feel like this relationship has been dead for a long time.
To explain why, i finished school and bounced between jobs. Now i've landed a nice and steady job that pays well and fits my life (night shift, 4 days a week 8pm-7am)
My girlfriend dropped out of school, bounced between jobs and couldn't hold one to save her life. She then got pregnant, and now has been sitting at home for well over 18months. Every time she tried education or classes she drops out or does nothing with it.
She is incredibily lazy and does next to nothing in the household.

And yes, i mean next to nothing.
Her daily routine is, do the dishes, cook (if she feels like it, we get takeout more often than not) and feeds our child. That's it. Nothing else.
And it has been like this for the past 3 years.
I get home from work, still have to clean the entire house, do the laundry, get groceries and everything else that has to do with a household. And i'm just tired of it.
In the weekends i have to change my entire sleep rhythm so i can get up to take care of our child so she can have her ""rest"". Even though she sleeps from 8pm till 7.30am daily and takes naps throughout the day.
And then she just fucks off to wherever she wants on the weekends while i stay home taking care of our daughter and cleaning the house.
She has no financial responsibility and forgets to pay stuff constantly. She also doesnt contribute financially at all. She's on welfare so all the bills get paid by me. The ones she does get always get ""forgotten"" so they circle back to me eventually. She also decided to take out a loan for a brand new car we don't need so that's over half of her money already gone. Mind you, i had to sell mine because of a financial problem we had while she already had a car (wich she sold after buying the new one, so no car for me).I take care of the animals because she ""forgets"".
We have alot of arguments over stupid stuff. She treatened to leave and take our child multiple times. If i want to throw her out she just plays the ""you won't see your child anymore"" card.
She wants constant attention wich i am not able to give because i'm just swamped with work and both of our responsibilities.
She also started claiming she had fybromalgia so she would have a reason to stay home. I'm not gonna speak about weather or not i think she has it or if i even consider that a decease. But it's just incredibily funny to see that no doctor has been able to diagnose her with anything and she doesn't feel bad at all when she can do what she likes.

I just don't know what to do anymore.
I have to rely on her for transport to work because i had to sell my car.
I want to be an active father and don't want to lose custody over her. I'm also afraid her mother won't care for properly.
But i just can't take this anymore.
I'd be financially better off alone, i'd be at peace and the house wouldn't be such a fucking mess all the time.
What do i do?

TL,DR
Girlfriend doesn't do shit in the household and doesn't financially contribute.
The relationship is bassicly dead.
I don't want to lose custody over our child because she doesn't care for her properly.
What do i do?",10Apr2020,1

I told him that this girl whos my friend wanted to see him, (it’s a girl he finds attractive) and then he said she’s prob not gonna show up and then I asked him if he wanted me to give him her number and he said “if u want to” 


like what’s that supposed to mean, he usually never says that it’s either a ya or a no and lately he’s also been acting more distant after I said I didn’t like anyone like he takes hours to reply back and shii like that now",10Apr2020,1
632,"So I've got a bit of a situation on my hands.

I'll give a little background info: Last May, my fiance and I bought our first house. We both had decent paying jobs (well, he made almost twice as much as me), we got a puppy, our wedding was scheduled for May 16th, 2020. The house was a little expensive for our budget, but we didn't struggle to manage it. 5 months later, my fiance lost his job. Since then he's been unemployed. We've still been able to pay for everything, and we have been very fortunate for that. 

The current situation: We live in NJ. We've been in quarantine and under stay-at-home orders for 3 weeks now. The CDC issued a recommendation that nobody travel outside of the tri-state area.

Last week, my fiance was offered a dream job. In NH. He accepted, and is set to start at the beginning of May. How? I have no clue.

We have a house to sell now, ASAP. That obviously won't be easy, and will probably take some time although maybe not TOO much as the house is a modern, 4br new construction on a cute suburban cul de sac. 

I'm going to have to quit my job, and I have nothing else lined up. I have to put in 4 weeks notice, and I just found out that I'll only be reimbursed for my vacation time that accrued in 2020, so all of the vacation time I saved up for my wedding and honeymoon (lol, a sad joke) is time that I now have to use within my last 4 weeks. Problem is, I don't even know how much PTO actually carried over from last year. So, I have to ask my boss for that info so I can ask for the ""vacation time"" (whatever that means when you're already in lockdown), and I imagine I can't do that without actually putting in my notice at the same time. I work for a home care company, who just had a round of lay-offs this week (all admin, since they obviously need their clinicians). However, I am one of the few clinicians who was asked to work from home because my discipline is non-medical/ancillary. 

So I have a couple questions: Can a company just decide to let you go early after putting in notice if they don't want to pay me? Would it be a better idea to hold off on my notice for as long as possible? At this point I really need every paycheck I can get. If you were in this situation, how would you approach it?

I'm completely overwhelmed and feel stuck. And advice at all would be so appreciated.

Thank you!",10Apr2020,1

639,"So we were hanging out at my and roommate's place. We were 4 guys and 3 girls and we had a movie marathon in the living room while drinking and smoking a bit.

I was sitting on the far left side of the couch, my roommate's friend on the far right side and my girlfriend inbetween. Throughout the evening she kept adjusting her sitting position and going back between him and I kind of. So for, so normal. But towards the end of the night during the last movie, she had her head more or less in his lap and her feet in mine.

At one point she laughed and said she can feel that she's laying on his dick. He asked her if she approves of the size and she responded that she can't really tell. After some back and forth banter between them, she asked me if it's okay for her to check it out. I laughed and shrugged and said that I don't care in a semi joking way. Half expecting she was just joking as well and wouldn't do it anyway, half masking my jealousy while trying to play it cool.

So she undid his pants, got his dick out and looked at it. He started slowly rubbing it while getting hard and she joined in. She wasn't taking her eyes off it and commented on how it was veiny and throbbing before putting it in her mouth. I just sat there awkwardly, not knowing what to do and feeling like I'm thirdwheeling. I was jealous as fuck at that point but didn't want to come off as the controlling boyfriend so I just swallowed my pride and continued watching the movie.

After a bit she was done and when the movie ended, everyone was going to their rooms or home. We went to my bedroom and when she took her pants off, I could tell that she was really wet to the extent of soaking through her panties. I didn't say anything about it and instead we went to bed, falling asleep with her cuddling into me.

Now I'm confused and feel like I should've reacted differently, but don't know how. Should I have shut it down completely? Or finger her during the blowjob to assert dominance? Or just swallow my pride afterwards and fuck her when we were alone? I'm not sure and it's driving me crazy.",10Apr2020,1

643,"Initially I've always wanted to dye my hair some ""crazy"" colour"", baby blue or pink were my go-to, I wanted to dye my hair black while with my ex and he kept saying it wouldn't suit me, he suggested ombre brown roots to blonde (not my style or thing, cute on others tho) then the want to dye it something bolder got stronger.

I'm out of that relationship, and I've been playing a lot of rdr2, I tend to go with ""wild"" outfits but irl am boring. I'm wearing the blue tinted gator hat and the blue and black hunter coat with a blue corset, you get the gist. I have the silver or grey hair and it struck me, I want *that*, I've already got plans for dying my hair and haven't regretted the various hair colours I've done in the past.

Was naturally carmel or dirty blonde as a kid, did various highlights to then one day full honeysuckle blonde, auburn, various chocolates for texture as it's close to my actual hair color.

Now I've got chocolate hair and recently did more of a cinnamon, however picture wise it's hard to notice any difference. 

I craved having a bright color like both my siblings have, my eldest had slushy blue hair for graduation and my other had a deep red, unnatural but not extremely bright. Now my eldest experiments with hair a lot, she has almost black, does red and such and it always fits her.

I look a lot like her and tried making my rdr2 character look like me so I could see, but honestly I always loved dying my hair and I'm now allowed by my mom to do something wilder than normal hair colors like various browns, blondes, and auburns. The browns more or less were to color correct my hair back to what it normally was as I wanted a change.

I feel like this is the perfect time to do so, I've got more warranted freedom and it's for myself, he wouldn't lile it at all but I love it, I love wild hair colours on people.

Is this a good idea? I mean if it really is that bad I can just dye it back as I've done before when fixing my fade outs.",10Apr2020,1

652,"I (26f) normally live part time at my boyfriend's place and have been planning to eventually move in. My boyfriend lives with his two best friends. The three guys purchased and moved into a house 2 years ago. No one is perfect and there are hiccups on keeping the place clean but they get through it. 

I am currently quarantined with the guys and mostly everything is going well. 

One of the roommates, Flounder (27m), is consistently terrible at being respectful of the shared bathroom. My boyfriend and I share the bathroom with him.

When he has a movement he holes up in the bathroom for hours with the window closed, chain vaping, and watching videos on the internet. When he finally leaves the bathroom he sets off the fire alarm in the hallway outside the door. He is a night owl so the alarm goes off in the middle of the night. 

Flounder struggles to consistently pee into the toilet bowl. Things he is able to get wet: the wall, behind the toilet, toilet seat, side of the bowl, the floor around and in front of the toilet. The other guys think Flounder might have a small willy which is why he has difficulty aiming. 

We are lucky IF Flounder puts the toilet seat down, wipes the seat (for urine/pubes), flushes and closes the lid. Normally none of that occurs. Part of the reason we are so adamant is because we have a cat who likes to drink from the toilet but we put those toilet bowl gel cleaners in to help clean the toilet. The way he goes through toilet paper is probably why Karens are stock piling during the pandemic. 

We are supposed to take turns restocking and cleaning the bathroom. Turns out, until recently my boyfriend had been the only one doing it. He was regularly cleaning another man's urine. 

-
Flounder's excuses? 

He flushed and it must have come back up. We have a supreme brand new toilet that can flush 32 golf balls.

He grew up in a household where they conservatively flushed. Think: if it's yellow let it mellow, if it's brown *wait* to flush it down. 

He just forgot.

90% of the time my boyfriend handles it because it's his best friend and he doesn't want to embarrass the guy. 

We've tried privately messaging him so as not to cause embarrassment. We've tried talking with him about the problem. We've tried knocking on his door and having him come to the bathroom to flush/clean up the mess. We've tried yelling at him about it. Nothing is getting through or making a difference.

This person and I used to be inseparable for a couple years, and have been roommates for a long time (close to 5 years). I used to be very naive - I didn't know how to set boundaries, didn't have the confidence to stand up for myself, and was too forgiving. This person is incredibly controlling, bossy, non-empathetic, and borderline narcissistic and I have endured what some other people in my life have titled her behavior as emotional abuse. I have only within the last year or so realized how detrimental this relationship has been to my mental health, self-esteem, and other relationships. Below, you will find text screenshots of three different situations (only a few of many) that have happened within the last year and you can observe how she acts towards me and vice versa. I will also note that one of the biggest fights we have ever had is not captured because I was so upset and distraught that I deleted the entire text conversation and can't find a way to recover it. Summarized, she became enraged when I told her I was going on a date with someone (who is now my SO of almost a year).

659,so i've been very best friends with this girl for about a year and a half. she's really really important to me and we're both convinced we'll be something one day but we just don't know when the time is best. recently i found out she'd been talking to my semi-friend(more than acquaintance but not super close)  for a little bit and there's been talks of hooking up and such. i was really upset and surprised at first but her and i have never had a sexual or romantic history. just really loving friends. am i wrong to be upset? how do i look at this? how do i stop myself from being upset? and i am truly in it for the long run and i know i can't let this temporary hook-up ruin my chances for a future relationship with her.,10Apr2020,1
660,"I decided to leave my husband without notifying him because he can be dangerous when drunk.  Usually he's a decent person, but have a hard time controlling his drinking when there is stress.  I figured this corona-virus thing is just going to make it worse, I felt like I had no choice.  I still kept in contact with him afterward, saying I needed some distance.  I was trying to prepare myself for the shit that is going to go down, but seems like after a day he took it surprisingly well.  But he did lost his job, I try to make sure he can stay financially afloat.  

But now he is saying he's been getting no sleep and had seizures from alcohol withdrawal, saying that I need to come back cause I'm the only one who can help in case there's emergencies.  I am concerned about him, but I have people telling me he should seek out his family and I shouldn't get involved, or that he's using this as an excuse.  My parents even said they would not help me anymore if I go back.  I'm surprised he's saying that his family wont help him, more like he doesn't think they can help the same way I do. Right now he wont go to the hospital because he's afraid of the coronavirus, to him he thinks it's more dangerous for him.  I do want to help him, but I know he probably has the goal of trying to make me stay, I fall for that trap way too much.

We don’t know where she lives so we can’t donate cash anonymously. I thought of just saying “here is what the government will give us for a stimulus. We don’t need it. You do.”, even thought we won’t be getting a stimulus check. My best guess is coming up with a story to make the giving of cash more natural(?). If it matters she is first generation from Mexico.

666,"Hey guys. So, I'm new to Reddit, and I only made an account for this reason. I don't intend to use it often, if at all.

My mum has a boyfriend. Let's call him Bob. They have had a pretty normal relationship, some bumps here and there, but overall they have been really good together. I like Joe a lot, he's a great guy. God, almost like a father, and it's only been several months lol. 

There's an ex-girlfriend of his friend that recently divorced. She has hit on him often and seems to have a small crush on him. He seems kind of mutual with the feelings, but he swore he would never cheat. There have been issues with her in the past, but I'm not going to go into the details. 

Bob was divorced, too, but a while back. Some issues have been when he was in a relationship with his ex-wife. 

A little while ago was troublesome for me. Mum had passed out on the couch as it was late and we had some food that required a grill. Bob claimed that he had to ""go clean the grill and stuff"" and he left the living room. 

It was at least 30-45 minutes before I started to get an odd feeling, because who takes that long to clean a grill? I started to check back where the grill was, and he wasn't there. After checking around the house I noticed he was sitting on a chair on the front porch, on the phone. Usually when he calls people he goes into another room, but not the porch. It felt weird, and I scrambled away from the scene as fast as I could. He didn't even open the front door, as he usually would, when hanging around the porch. And it was quite late and very cold. 

I'm pretty sure it was something not meant for me or my mum's ears, which is really odd. I don't know what to do. Should I tell my mum? Or should I just brush it off my shoulder? Again, he's a great guy and I don't want to ruin my mum and his relationship or his and mine, but its been nagging at me for some days now.",10Apr2020,1
668,"All of this happened a while back(Oct 2019) and it's still stuck in my head. I guess I just want to get rid of this memory.

Here's the back story which may/may not matter: 
So I played official LAN tournament and basically I trusted a teammate/team head who was the most experienced amongst us. We won $2100 after expenses for the entire team. It was officially supposed to be divided 20% equally no taxes by the Event manager but my team head decided that the money collected totally by himself and distributed to some others who had helped us reach where we had. So with that intention I agreed and the amount being large was under TDS(Tax deducted at Source-31%) and after everything all I received was $55.

The best part? The guys whom they were going to pay weren't paid. Where did the money go? Him and his friend took $530 EACH! and gave another friend $328 leaving me and my friend with so less. We weren't under any contract and I do not have any proofs other than what amount they have sent to me. 

Another thing that has happened is I was almost selected to my dream clan in the game and I was selected into a roster as a selection process, we lost the qualifiers by 1.5kill average but then I was kicked out without any notice/reply.

I do know that none of these things matter when I'm 50yrs old but the problem lies in the fact that these memories come multiple times a day every single goddamn day and I'm unable to focus on an exam which I've failed twice already. 

Parents aren't closely supportive and first thing I want to do is move out for a bit of privacy and personal growth(they don't let me decide anything for myself, ordering things at me day in and out) but I don't have any clue how I'll execute it as I obviously have no money or contacts that could get me a part time job.

Main priority is passing my exam which can get me a guaranteed basic salary of $50per month and after clearing the next level (after 3yrs) I could receive upwards of $1500pm. 

Just help me out with some tips. These things annoy me everyday hindering my ability to think/focus. I don't want revenge, I prefer growth 😞",10Apr2020,1

So me 27F and my dad 64M are very close. We live together and I generally tell him pretty much everything, with the exception of my sex life generally. He’s my greatest champion and supports me always. I’m pretty confident I’m going to get diagnosed with herpes once I can get to a doctor, and he’s been quite worried about me as I’ve been very ill. I’m unsure about whether to tell him what’s really wrong once I get diagnosed, or to play it off as something else. I trust that he wouldn’t lecture me much or anything, I’m an adult and it’s not like I wanted this to happen. But I don’t know if he would be glad that I trust him enough to confide in him, or would wish that I’d not said anything because it’s personal..

672,"About a month ago I started a new job and am having a very hard time settling in. It is an industry I have loads of experience in so should feel very comfortable but I am really struggling. 

There seems to be lots of confusion over what my role should be. The person who conducted my interview and informed me I had been hired was not there when I started and I have since found out they work at a different location. There have been multiple instances that I have been assigned a responsibility only to be told the next day or week that ""actually, we've decided you don't have to do that"". There isn't a clear leadership hierarchy but who I assume is acting as the store manager is quite rude and dismissive to me and I get the vibe she doesn't want to train a new person or spend time helping me. There is an owner, but they are not frequently at this location and so don't have much to do with the everyday management. There seems to be a lot of contempt for the owner among the staff who have been there for a while.

I feel that all these things are big red flags and are really making it difficult for me to be comfortable in the job. Obviously, I am very lucky to still have a job during this time when so many people are losing theirs and so I doubt there will be any opportunity for me to change right now. 

So I am asking for two pieces of advice. Firstly, do these strike other people as red flags that are potentially worth quitting a job over? Second and more importantly, any advice on how to make this situation better for the time being while we are all stuck in limbo?",10Apr2020,1

674,"So some back story: when I started in my school choir, I knew I wanted to get into the top ensemble at my school. (Note: Choirs are 40+ people and Ensembles are 12-24 people). I started taking lessons and tried/gotten solos each year. The teacher my first year seemed to really like me. But he retired after my first year and a new director stepped in. He was really nice, but you could definitely tell he picked favorites. I took every opportunity he offered and worked as hard as I could. The people who ended up being his favorites were good singers, but a few had a horrible work ethic. Around April, we had our choir auditions. I was one of the first people to audition, and i felt like I bombed it. From then on, I went into class everyday with a fast beating heart and a passion to get in.  When I found out I got into our schools best choir, I literally cried. The next step was the ensemble auditions, which were during the last two weeks of school. I was so scared and I tried my best to prepare, but I felt like I messed up my auditions. Long story short, I didn’t get in, but I got into the one right below it. I was crushed and I felt like I wasn’t good enough. So I enrolled with a new voice lesson teacher, joined a community choir, and was given a type of leadership role for my concert group. I got a solo this year for my singing group. and I felt like I did pretty well.


Here’s why I am asking for advice: I literally stay up at nights thinking about it. I worked so, so hard, and I really want my hard work to pay off for this. I have spent basically all of my time and energy, and I have been lead on in the past.  I’m really scared it will happen again and I would be devastated.

677,"Hey Reddit this may start off as a rant since I am posting this while being heated. I just don’t know if I am handling my family well or if their is really something fucked up about them. I am constantly confused and anxious around them and am terrified of talking. I know anything I say will result in judgmental remarks, insults, or being yelled at. So I keep quiet. I apologize in advance for the long post but I got to at least talk about the most significant things.

I will just start from the beginning. So please bear with me. I have always been disregarded in my household. For years my mom used me as a venting tool. Talking about all her problems and the abuse my dad did to her. He was more emotionally abusive then anything else. They tend to cater to my sister. Giving her things that she wanted, providing her money when we all knew they couldn’t afford it, and even taking her into counseling. The last one was not bad, all in all I thought she needed it. But it is bad when they told me I was fine. And that I didn’t need counseling. 

Recently though I had started to stand up for myself. I told them when things upset and that I wanted them to not mention something. They refused to listen and even got mad when I would tell them to stop. That I was being immature and that I wasn’t allowed to talk to them like that since I was the “kid.” I had the chance to leave the home and finally got my own apartment.

Most parents would be proud however they are constantly saying I should move back in. That they can take care of me. That I can put the rent money back for my house. That I am not safe. But each time I say I love it by myself. When really I just can’t handle being yelled at or ignored. That or insulted every time I talk. I even went grocery shopping with them only to have my mom yell at me in front of tons of people. Saying that I need to shut up and that she understands. I feel so little and invisible around them. Anytime I smile it gets taken by some harsh words. 

I know that they are more stressed then ever not having me home. They are always yelling and my sister degrades my mom all the time. However they never fixed the problem so it’s impossible to fix it now that she is 18. They are supporting her in everything. Telling me she will be going out of state for college(they didn’t back me on my choice to go out of state) and that she is getting a job in another town(I was not allowed to go to another town to get a job; it had to be in town) and that they are helping her get a car(said they paid for half of my car when really they only paid 100 dollars. I am not complaining and appreciate it). All these things they support her with. But when it came to me they refused. I can’t even question it without having my faults thrown back into face.

I would say the best example was tonight. I recently found out my sister started dating a dirtbag. I have never liked this guy and by the way they talked about him you wouldn’t like him either. He told my sister that he only liked her because she was hot. He would ghost her( which I found out was only a few times and not months on end). He insults her and even got mad at her when he wasn’t winning a game of cards. The only time he had anything to do with her was when she turned 18. He started flirting more and was doing a bunch of things. My sister has never had a guy show interest in her and I believe she just got with him out of desperation. To top it off he paid a girl $500 to have sex with her. All because he didn’t want to wait. Yet here she is getting with him. She told him that she was going to college and was going to get a job. In which he decided to say they needed to make things official. If you ask me he is only using my sister as a security blanket. Someone he can use to make the family happy but not love her at all. 

When I got upset and told my mom that this was stupid and that he will only abuse my sister. She used the fact that I went out drinking as a comparison. That I do stupid stuff all the time but they don’t say anything because I am an adult. I tried to talk to them but she just put me on speaker and started talking. When I said that I wanted to have nothing else to do with this since I am not part of the family she got mad and said that I need to get counseling. That I need to use my therapy skills on myself and figure out how to fix things. 

I am honestly hurt to the core. I know I have always been the black sheep but now this is really taking a toll on me. When I mention anything they tell me that they never said or did what I say. That I was wrong and that they would never do that. I have been told how I look fat. That my drawings are shit. That I need to not dress like my friends. That I look like a butch lesbian when my hair is cut short. That I am not really trans I just have pcos. That I am stupid. That I need to shut up. That I am single because I am a bitch. That no one likes me because of something I do. That I didn’t cut deep enough. That I am not as ill as my sister. Just tons of things that make me insecure. But when I confront them about those things they say I am lying and that they would never say that. 

Sometimes I do think I am crazy. That I just come up with this shit. I don’t know what to do. I want to be involved with my family but I can’t stand being around them for more then a couple of hours. I miss the way my mom used to be. How me and her would spend time together and we would talk but now I can’t even get 30 minutes with her. And talking to her is impossible. I know not being around will only upset them more so how do I handle being around them. What should I say to prevent fights? I just need some solid advice. Thanks. And sorry about the long post.",10Apr2020,1

679,"I live in canada, quebec for reference. At the moment im doing a health science dec (physiotherpy) and taking health science courses at night. My goal is to be able to get into Mcgill university to get my doctorate there. Its always been a dream of mine to graduate at that school. Im doing a dec just incase i wont get in right away. As a plan b. And also because im learning alot of stuff i will be relearning in university, so as a bonus to not be so behind! And im doing health science because theres many prerequistes that i must take. 10 of them to be exact. 

This semester i have taken calculus enriched/science wing. It is really difficult and i was struggling as i also was taking 4 other courses in my dec that also involve alot of studying time. I never gave up and i studied reallly hard. For hours!!! All night many nights!! And in the end i got 95%! I was soo thrilled. Best feeling ever! Class average was 60%. 

Mcgill university is a pretty hard school to get into. Especially for their medical departement. Which is what i want to get admitted into. They look at your r-score. Its really hard to get a r-score in the 30's. And yet to get admitted into my dream program its a 34 minimum r score needed. How the r score work is they take your final grade and compare it to the rest. Its really hard to boost your r score unless your around 20% plus above the average. 

So this calculus grade of mine was going to be reallly helpful in getting my r score up! I was thrilled. 

Then coronavirus happened and we had to do online schooling. My dec program is still continuing to give us grades and tests and an r score will be given. But my calculus teacher just told us that for this class it will be a pass or fail only!! That it wont count for the r score at all. 

Now my r score currently is 28 (i slacked off before as i didnt know what i wanted to do) but average is normally 24-25 so im still in a good standing just not for my program. and i need it to get to a 34 in 2 years. Its going to be really hard but my calculus class was going to help alot in boosting it to atleast a 30. But now it wont because it will be only a pass or fail. Im reallly sad and hugely bummed and dont think its fair to do such a thing!! I was relying on this grade! And i think that the current grade everyone has now should stay as final grade as everyone did it in school and everyone had same chance to do good. I get that online can create cheating so yeah its harder to evaluate. But i think before online classes started that it was fair. 

We still have 2 assignments and a final test work 60% so you need to atleast pass that inorder to fully pass the class. And get a pass grade. The in school tests are worth 40% the ones we already did in school. I think the current grade we have now should be the final grade we get and if someone got for example 55% currently they can still pass the course aslong as they get 60% in the online aspects. So it wouldnt penalize the studemts that are not doing so good so they still got chance to pass but the final grade they get to be compared to the r score would be the current grade they have now. 

Its not fair that a 60% student gets same advantage as a 90% plus students who worked really hard. They both get the pass grade and thats it. It really blows!

Im currently a broke fulltime student in Germany, who is trying to manage his finances.
I get financial assistance from the government, but I have to pay half it back. With the other half im paying for food, apartment etc, so I only have little money left.

688,"I'm 20. I've heard 'move out' before and it's really not helpful advice because I have no idea HOW to move out plus there is a pandemic making everyone stay inside, and there is no way I'll find a job to support everything right now, even if I take out loans for college. That's not taking my depression and anxiety into account which I need serious help for or I may end up dead soon. My sister and I are full time college students and live with our dad out of necessity,, but all he does is get mad all the time at everything we do or don't do and even is a hypocrite about everything but he won't listen to us, or our friends, or our mom (divorced) telling him he needs to calm down and needs serious help. It's not like we deserve it. We're under lockdown so all we do is hw, hobbies, and chores, but that still isn't good enough for him. He calls us lazy, says we don't do anything for him, says we can't even do one thing for him when we do like a bunch of chores. But if we wait til he goes to sleep to do the chores, he gets mad. If we leave one thing on the counter, he gets mad. If we try to talk to him about anything rather than only letting him scream all the time about what he wants, he gets made. Then complains that we are due to him - but doesn't want us to 'talk back' to him?? If I so much as get a bubble tea even without the pandemic with my own money he will yell at me because 'we can't afford it'. Of course we can afford it!! And that wouldn't even matter because it's MY money I spent!!! 

&amp;#x200B;

The first thing I wake up to this morning is him yelling at me and I couldn't hear. So I let the dogs out and then he continues yelling at me, calling me a child, saying to listen when I turn to get some damn breakfast. Then he says leave the kitchen so I go. Then he comes upstairs and tells my sister and me to come here so he can yell at us more just because we couldn't hear what he was saying earlier because I just woke up and couldn't hear when he was yelling so much. Then he blames us for his temper. He says if we don't wake up before 11am and do the chores 'at a reasonable time' aka before he goes to bed (so he can have the chance to harass while we are downstairs doing them), then he will take our phones and car away. He threatens to hit us, throw us out on the streets, admits to wanting to hit us and jokes about killing us. Threatens to throw my hamster outside that I bought with my money just because I don't care for it exactly the way he wants.  I'm legitimately worried we won't come out of lockdown alive. I wish I were joking. And telling me to move out isn't helpful. I'm already trying to but without knowing how to do that and without being able to get a job that's not exactly feasible. I don't even have friends to have as room mates. I'm so stunted by my parents' abuse that I can barely do any of these things on my own, and when I try to I look like I'm mentally retarded because of how awkward I am.

As a 20 something single, I find that once a girl starts showing me affection (that can be just enjoying my company) and is single, I mistake that for ""maybe she's interested"" and fantasies of relationships with this person manifest in my head.

This has cost me a couple friendships in the past: I'm of course seeing a connection that isn't there. I'm 100% in the wrong for misreading the situations and more damming; letting the idea fester in my head.

I've managed to catch myself doing it to another friend who recently became single and i'm so scared. When i'm like this, I overthink everything I say/do; i'm not myself around girls. But then I fear treating them differently, so then i'm overthinking in the opposite way.

693,"Hello, uh, I'm most definitely overreacting and being too sensitve so I'm sorry for sounding so entitled throughout this post, I just wanted to make sure that nothing else is going on.

As the title says, I'm unsure if I've been mistreated, for lack of a better term, 'abused' by my mother. I know how much of a horrible daughter I am for making this post but I can't get it out of my head.

(NSFW-ish, sorry) The thing that has affected me most is some of the stuff she says about my body. As I was going through puberty, she would often make comments about how large my chest was, despite the fact that I said how much I hated it and I was (and still am) flat. Even after I told her how much I really hated her talking about me like that she still carried on and still teases me about it to this day. She always used to tell me how big (both in weight and chest size) I was compared to my sister, which didn't really help with the fact I didn't eat at all. 

I hate my body so much and what she has said and refuses to stop saying has really affected me. I know I'm being way too sensitive and need to grow up but I can't let myself wear anything like a shirt and leggings because it exposes the shape of my body and I hate not being able to let myself dress normally out of fear of her looking at me in those areas and making comments. I change in the bathroom at school because I'm deathly terrified of anyone saying the same things to me that my mother did.

Moving on, at times she'll be so kind to me, tell me how beautiful I am and be a gentle and loving mother before getting enraged by something small and going on tangents about how useless I am and how she wants to run away. Everyone has their limits and of course she's allowed to joke around but I hate having her dance around the house like a child before screaming and shouting about how shitty her life is. It really messes with my head. I feel awful for being such an awful, miserable daughter, which is due to other problems but I know how it makes my mom feel and I feel awful she has to put up with me, no wonder she goes on shouting fits each day. I’m too shy to talk to her about any of this and when I have in the past she’ll laugh it off or just say ‘everyone shouts’. She’s not wrong but I don’t think to this degree of screaming most nights.

This is normal, right? Please tell me I'm overreacting.",10Apr2020,1

696,"tw: sexual assault

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not going to go into all the details but long story short, theres a guy at a summer camp where I work who has assaulted and preyed upon many girls while he worked there. Some of them were other staff members, some were campers, all of them were under 18 when he did this. For about a year, this was kind of an open secret there. The year after it got out he stopped being a counselor but because of who his father is he wasn't fired and was just moved to a more part time position. I don't know all of the details but from what I've heard, a few of the victims wanted to take legal action but were worried about how it would effect the camp and decided not to, so that seemed like the end of it.

When I heard about this I just stopped talking to him and completely avoided all contact with him the next year. I still hated him but felt alright just putting him out of my head until my current girlfriend told me that he had assaulted her too when she was 16. We've talked about it and she says she's ok. It was years ago and she's mostly put it out of her head. I just can't get over it. I haven't done anything since it's not my place and I would never want to make things worse for my girlfriend but I really want to hurt this guy. I just can't stand that because of his family, he gets to just go off and live a happy life after everything that he's done. Every time I see him around things just seem normal. I see other staff members going over and joking around with him like he's just some normal guy. 

Is there anything I can do? I'm actually a little worried about what I'd do if I see him again (which is likely). Again, I don't want to make things worse for the people who he actually hurt so I really feel stuck. Any advice?",10Apr2020,1

I'm (23M) pretty much at my lowest point right now not going to lie (not remotely suicidal though) I just can't seem to hold on hope to being happy in the future, I've only been medicated for ADHD for a year and it's been a wild ride to be honest, finding and failing with coping mechanism and getting organized and trying my best to get to a self sufficient state, I live with my parents and am pretty middle class and really haven't had anything serious keep me from succeeding, aside from my ADHD (and I suppose the low self esteem and slight anxiety that comes from insecurity that's pretty common with it) I just feel like I never learn from my mistakes and keep messing up. 

I started getting really pessimistic around the same time I got diagnosed and this past year has been a roller coaster with a lot of ups, like coming to terms with my sexuality (Bi) and finding a really good guy who I've been dating for a year, and picking up my grades and GPA, really focusing on the gym and nutrition and getting (IMO) a decent physique that I'm proud of.

However what comes up must always come down, I started getting really negative about things like the ""The american dream"", politics, social issues (mainly because many of my friends face a lot of bigotry cause we live in the Midwest in a semi rural area, and I've faced it myself) wealth inequality, and since I'm a about to graduate with a psychological science degree, the very poor way we treat mental illness in the United States. 

I fear for my future (and the future of the planet) everyday and it's led to some awful mood swings and bad habits (lots of drinking and blowing up on my parents, friends and S/O, because I constantly feel like no one listens to me half the time (especially my dad, he seems to just think everyone complains too  much and thinks people just need to work harder. He doesn't even acknowledge ADHD is a real thing.) I feel like no matter hard I work, no matter how hard I try I'm going to end up as another person living paycheck to paycheck and eventually fuck up and end up homeless (might be irrational tbh, my parents and my friends wouldn't let that happen, but it still lingers in my head) I've tried therapy and it worked for a while but now it feels genuinely useless and it feels like I'm just paying someone to nod their head at me and tell me I'm right. My emotional issues has all but killed my relationship and my constant negativity and emotional outbursts have made him less attracted to me and now he needs ""time to think"" because it's having an impact on his mental health.

713,"I know there's no rationalization that can take away the pain. But right now, I have nobody, and I need to get it off my chest. 

Being stuck in self-isolation makes this so much worse. I know that going out and doing things would help, but outside is closed - so here I am... trapped in my room. 

Being trapped in my room all day is the same lifestyle I led when I was at my worst with respect to depression, and I already feel that darkness seeping into me. And this has nothing to do with the breakup yet. 

The breakup was yesterday. But a week before that, I had a major falling out with my friend circle. Long story short, I genuinely have nobody at this point.

So this is the worst possible hand I could be dealt as I enter my first major breakup. 

*sigh*

On one hand, I feel like there's so much to say - but on the other, I know pain is pain. Nothing for me to do except endure as time does its thing. But I guess I should talk anyway. I don't even know where to start.

I guess she just wasn't as committed as I was, or fell out of love, or something. The uncertainty hurts, but I know there's nothing I can do about it, and there's no rationalization that will give me respite. 

But I was so invested. We had so much comparability; it was the type of relationship we all dream of. I wanted so much to go all the way - I dreamed it. Literally. The night prior to the breakup, I had a beautiful dream where me and her had made it -- we were having a picnic in the backyard with our beautiful children. 

I need to stop torturing myself by replaying that. 

The breakup was one thing; I actually felt it coming as the relationship was dying down the weeks prior, so I at least had some guard up. What I was not ready for, was the discovery that she was on a dating app THE DAY OF the breakup. In her breakup letter she sent me, she said she was not ready for the commitment of a long term relationship. In her bio on the app, she said she was looking for a long term relationship. That hurt. She even bought the full version of the app, which was a nice cherry on top to see.

Our last point of contact was when I called her to ask if it was true -- if she had really just lied to me after a year of honesty and loyalty -- for hookups, no less. She said it was an accident, but my trust had been shattered. 

I put a lot of emphasis in the relationship on the trust I had in her to speak up if she was dissatisfied with anything, even on the most petty, minute scale. I trusted her, I really did. And she let me sit there thinking everything was ok, until she pulled the trigger. Clearly, she was dissatisfied if she was on dating apps this soon. She broke my trust, and now my memory of her is tarnished. 

I want to remember the amazing girl I fell in love with. Not... this.

That's what hurt me the most. I can accept that it's over, but having trust broken like this -- *that's* what really is causing my pain. 

I had the bravery to trust her, love her, go out of my way to be the best companion possible. And now I'm stuck alone in my room, too hurt to do anything.

What do I do? How do I get over the feeling that I won't find love? And how do I get over the uneasiness of picturing myself with another women? Even though she broke up with me, I almost feel like I'm still betraying her.",10Apr2020,1

716,"It's just one in one, but over the last 3 days he's had 3 different friends over. He also visited his parents who don't take the virus seriously and probably isn't doing enough social distancing.

Am I overly paranoid by telling him I don't want to see him for a while because of this? Or am I in the right in feeling like he doesn't respect the social distancing rule?

717,"My friend that I've known for 10 years is currently struggling with her family, and I'd like to know the best way I can support her. I'm also somewhat close with the family too.

The situation is mother has been cheating on the father. The father has recently found out about this situation and trying to cope by keeping his daughter by his side. He's telling her that she needs him and he needs her or else he'll end up murdering the mother's new boyfriend and her. He follows her everywhere and has her hold his hand and talk to him for hours on end. He asked her to sleep next to him, but said he requires to hold her while he sleeps. I know he might just be coping, but she says she's struggling to help his father and he's starting to sound extremely creepy.

So a little backstory so people can understand the situation.. the daughter has a disabled brother whom the mother has been taking care of for the past 27 years. Shes has trouble with the father in the past where he leaves her and the child to have fun. The father had anger issues in the past as well. Sometimes he would flip out and tell at the children, but has calmed down since then. The younger brother also has a temper and tends to get destructive when he gets angry, he also self inflicts wounds by biting himself.

Currently, the mother gives no fucks about the family and is trying to move in with her boyfriend asap, and she's trying get her daughter to go with her. She texts him every night and sleeps in a seperate room. 

Is there anything I can do?",10Apr2020,1
718,"English is not my first language, so sorry for any mistakes.

So, I have someone close to me that was raped a long time ago and recently told me what happened. He's a boy, an adult now, and it happened when he was about 13 or 14. He was very shy and still didnt know much about life, not the norm for most boys of his age and an older person, young adult, took advantage of that and used him for about a month, my friend doesnt remember well probably because of the shock. He sometimes cannot remember trivial things of the daily basis as well, but idk if that is a result of his trauma. Can it be?

The person that abused him eventually left, but my friend delt with depression for a while, having suicidal thoughts and different behaviour than what he used to have (he became unable to read the room, he got colder and he developed some sort of anxiety. He never went to the doctor so we don't know).

He is much better now. I didn't meet him when he was in that state but his friends tell that he got much more confident than he was before and he can deal with the situation better, but sometimes, when something bad happens, it mixes up with the past and he gets some small breakdowns. He never told his family because they're not the best people... he says that none of them would take it well or just tell him to man up and that he could have defended himself.

&amp;#x200B;

So, what I need advice with is: 

\- How can I help him deal better with the situation?   
\- Should he see a especialist, even though he says he can deal with it not thinking about it or doing jokes about it (although nor him nor his family have money for it)?

719,"I’m not sure if how I’m going about things is right. I’m a 26 year old female living on my own and in the past year and a half I’ve invested fully in my career. A new company in my area emerged a couple of years ago and has been wildly successful. I’ve managed to achieve two promotions within a year and another one being suggested within the next year due to expansion. My bosses love me and I landed a manager position with no previous experience or college degree. This is not the part of my life I’m questioning. In fact, I’m quite proud of myself and my accomplishments given my lack of direction years prior. 

The problem lies in my personal relationships. I’ve devoted all my energy to this job to get where I’m at. I go above and beyond for this company because I believe in their promises of a bright future. That means spending a lot of extra time dealing with business and what not. This job is socializing to the extreme and maintaining professionalism at all times. It’s absolutely draining on my introvert battery. I find myself barely managing to get even simple tasks at home done for how tired I always am. I’ve convinced myself it’s worth it, but less time is spent recreationally. 

My personal relationships are failing entirely. I have one sister who is incredibly understanding, but another who I haven’t spoken to for months now because she is offended by my lack of communication. I’ve explained to her prior how much energy I’m putting into this job and she says she understands but here we are... she’s passive aggressive if I do reach out. On top of all this, I’ve been going through a break up with someone I nearly married. We’d been together for 5 years and I ended it due to bad communication and a desire to focus on my career. It doesn’t hurt any less because we were extremely close and now we’re absolute strangers. I think that’s another reason I’ve thrown myself into my job. 

However, I’m not perfect. I can’t make excuses for my career preventing contact with friends and family. I feel in the past year I’ve distanced everyone. I have multiple friends who don’t reach out anymore because of how much I’ve neglected texts, cancelled plans, etc. My life has completely changed... people I was close to don’t have a spot in my life anymore. If it wasn’t for my roommate allowing me to vent when work gets rough, I’d probably go mad. But at the same time I lack interest in speaking to anyone. I feel while I’m proud of my accomplishments, I’m going to regret isolating myself. But I have no free time for myself let alone anyone else. I’m spent and I just can’t bring myself to care. But future oriented me wonders if I’ll regret losing everyone in pursuit of money and security. 


TL;DR: Focused entirely on my career in the past year and distanced myself from everyone because of lack of energy and some apathy. These are my choices, but I question if I’m in some mentally unhealthy hole or if I’m just developing into adulthood and this is a normal thing? Am I being selfish?",10Apr2020,1
720,"When CA first had shelter in place orders, I took a lot of precautions because I have asthma, and I don't how bad it would be for me if I got coronavirus. I have cough-variant asthma, so it's different from other types of asthma. It's mainly from allergies, and I can sometimes get a really bad cough. But this is more of an occasional occurrence than a frequent occurrence. The last time I developed a persistent cough was a couple of years ago. When my asthma flares, I'll got a cough for about a day or two, sometimes.

Still, I haven't left my house. My husband has only left the house once to go to the grocery store last weekend. He wore a mask, goggles, wiped down all of the groceries with lysol wipes, and scrubbed himself when he got home. He isn't showing any coronavirus symptoms, but about 4 days later, I developed a persistent cough. I have been hoping that maybe this is just my asthma flaring or I just have a cold or something. But each day, it seems to get a bit worse, and the time frame certainly lines up with my husband going to the grocery store. Today, I woke up actually feeling a bit sick, but I don't have a fever right now. I do feel sweaty and clammy, though. I don't really have shortness of breath right now, though.

725,"

Okay so I am a 18 yr f and dating a 19 yr make and we have been together for 3 1/2 years. Now I know we’re young and a ton of mistakes to be made. For most of my girlies out there what would you do or for guys tell me if you would have done this. Okay I am just not sure if I should m stay in this as much as I love and want him I just don’t know if it’s good. So here’s my concerns two months into dating he met up with his ex and his friend but nothing happened they just hung out for like 30 min I see the convo he did compliment her but nothing more really. I know it was two months on but still. He would also talk to his ex at school sometimes but nothing much really. 1 year into dating he got three girls nudes from his friend so he didn’t get them directly from the girl but still. Around that time also I was being hospitalized and I found out he was basically trying to get at this girl from school that week and told her he’d like to get to know her better and complimented her I just found that out a few months ago though but he says he doesn’t remember bc he was on xans most the week cause of me being gone and “didn’t feel good at all” me being hospitalized. I was pretty friendly with girls but he claims he didn’t have intent on doing nothing. He used to lie to me a lot about where he was or what he was doing but I understand because I was pretty controlling and didn’t like his friends and didn’t like that he would smoke weed so he’d hide it but I didn’t find out and it was always just with dudes so I kinda understand but still he wasn’t honest. 2019 he was traveling and hung out with a girl that was way older nothing happened I talked to her he just tried to smoke she said he left quick ( I was messaging her pretending to be him, Ik Ik crazy I am) anyway since that he didn’t do much would just watch porn or look at girls pictures which I DONT LIKE I don’t mean to be that way but I just hate it. Now 2019 nov I checked his phone and I found out that he had a fake account and added his ex’s but was only talking to one girl now the convos weren’t bad he wasn’t trying to hit on her or nothing we were just in a really bad bad place and idk still no excuse but he says he had no intent but I just think if it wasn’t bad why make a whole fake account. Now this guy does everything for me but I hate everything bad he’s done that I had said above and how it made me feel about myself. To this day he says he didn’t mean to do none of that and they’re just stupid mistake and I do make him feel like shit about it and he cries and get aggressive will throw his phone and etc. i just don’t know if I should stay with someone who’s done me like that even if I love him but a part of me just wants to leave until out of nowhere someone who will never do anything like that to me comes into my life. Now like I said we were you and still are and there is so much growing to do so I get it but at the same time I have never done that because I know when you love someone you don’t do things like that . I mean you can love them and do it but I’d it real love if you do that without thinking? I hate that he says it’s all mindless behavior. I have major insecurities and I’m trying to work on myself. Now these things no longer really hurt me. I used to cry every time I would think of it but now I just feel like damn he really did that and when he cries I don’t feel bad. Idk what to go about me not caring anymore I’ve just been in a state of numbness or like limbo not really thinking about it and I told him that I’m not gonna be making him my priority or anything because I need to love myself even without him and I told him I’d be open to him again once I see he can show me he’s doing better or truly wants me because every time before I just go back and give my all and he does some dumb shit again. So as the moment I am starting to love myself regardless of what he’s done. Let me add again I know a lot of girls don’t care if their man finds other girls attractive or looks at other girls naked or half naked pics and he tells me he doesn’t look at them the way he does me but idk I’m majorly insecure so I know it faults on me. Anyway I would really like anyone’s opinion and you can be as rude as you want or straight forward and honest. 

Tl;dr 
I know it’s a summary I should right but you really gotta read most of it to try and see what’s going on. Basically just confused and don’t know if I’m being too harsh on us and should just forgive or if I should go and get the love that this stuff won’t happen.

726,"Hello Reddit. I am currently in a weird but good situation and I thought some 3rd party perspective would be great. 

I am currently slated to begin my first career type job this summer in late July. I have been doing great at home getting myself back into shape, eating a healthy diet and my plan was to do this along with weight watchers up until my start date.

Today my employer reached out and requested that those of us who can or want to start early can start the first week of May. Not only does this start date conflict with my last finals week of college, but it is also only 3 weeks away. I keep telling myself that if i begin work I will be too stressed to take my diet as seriously as I have been. Working out has never been an issue but dieting has been a major struggle the last few years. 

In short, do I stay at home and continue my routine I’ve grown accustomed to? OR do I bite the bullet and begin working 2 months ahead of schedule? I believe my employers will be understanding with letting me start a week later because of finals. 

TLDR: I really just want to know that if any of you think it’s worth it to keep enjoying my free time and no responsibility or if I should jump into my career as fast as I can. It will be the last “summer” of my life.",10Apr2020,1

730,"Hi, 

I'm 18 years old and currently in my first year of university, however it's been terrible. I live on my own (because of a bad childhood with abusive parents) and live from welfare, which is about half of what a working person in a normal paying job would earn. It's difficult to make ends meet, and getting good grades is an important condition to keep my welfare, which put me under a lot of pressure because I have zero point zero motivation for my study anymore at the moment. So I have been contemplating between taking a gap year after this year to work and then start studying again and working part time after that, between studying and working part time right away, or between living a miserable life for the next 5-6 years, keeping my welfare and then start working after graduating.

Instinctively, I really want to take a gap year, because I'm just sick of it all and I'm stressed out at the moment, but then it will probably take a long time, perhaps 10 years or longer to graduate. However I'm sure that I will relapse into my depression if I keep studying. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",10Apr2020,1

I use to be a cashier at the food court in the local mall but it closed down for obvious reasons. My ""parents"" and I have an extremely complicated relationship. I was adopted by someone until I was in 7th grade. This was because my parent's married at a young age and was not able to support me until that time. Now they are barely getting by and since then I have returned to live with them. I normally don't ever ask them for money that is not related to school. The only times I would ask them for money is for signing up for APs/SAT prep/textbooks or school trips. It's not like I pay rent or anything either I just don't ask for money that is personal use. I usually use the money from the cashier job for going out and personal use. I had a laptop that is really important for my AP Computer Science class just break on me during this time period. I really need a laptop for my AP classes and distance learning so I want you guys to help me out. I don't want your money or patronage. All I want to know is an online job that I can get.

736,"Hi, so some context. I used to talk a lot with a girl, let's call her Z, and it was a weird thing that we had because we're very far apart from each other, I moved from Uni to another country and she's in my hometown with no plans to move out. So as there things go, eventually she decided we couldn't keep doing this, she didn't tell me much more, but I assumed she saw no point on something long distance and she thought it wouldn't last long so she just ended it, I myself never thought about all that and was just happy to have her in my life in any way, but anyway, we stopped talking at all, I once called her and she didn't answer, and that was supposed to be that. But then Z unfollowed me on Instagram and her best friend started following me, weird, and then I made my account public because I want to share my drawings on there, and I upload a story there every day, and every day I check the viewers list and I see her on there. So how does she show up there? 
Does she actively look for my profile everyday? Or does my story just show on her feed? (I'm thinking this is a possibility because I didn't stop following her)  
It wouldn't be crazy that she's looking at my profile everyday, but I asked a friend about her a few days ago and they told me Z had a boyfriend now, so with that in the mix it would be confusing at least.

741,"I (22m) have been with my girlfriend (22f) for around 4 years. We met in freshman year of college. My group of guy friends all became best friends with her group of girlfriends in first semester freshman year. We all became one big group, and it stayed that way all throughout college and even until today. We started dating the beginning of sophomore year and have been ever since. 

A lot has happened in both our relationship and lives during our time together which i won’t go into too much detail because it doesn’t have to do with my current question. But to sum it up just for reference, with all of the amazingly happy moments like vacations and making memories at college, there’s also been a lot of hardships. Some of those Include lying, cheating, summer long pill addiction, a month of rehab, grieving the loss of a parent, breaking up for 2-3 months a few different times and getting back together, fighting a lot , and finally moving into an apartment together and being happy. 

So fast forward to now, we live together. At the moment, She’s downstairs and I’m in our bed upstairs writing this. (On mobile so sorry) We have been out of work since March so we don’t really do much during the day except hangout on the couch and go on a lot of walks and runs together. Our relationship has a lot of flaws and obvious toxic traits which you previously read, but we’ve always worked through it and have made it through the other end with each other. 

I truly believe we love each other a lot. Even with her flaws , she’s an amazing girl. She’s beautiful, funny, smart, and the strongest girl i know. Despite any of the bad things we’ve gone through, there’s a lot more of love. Maybe not a lot of trust, but love. 

But, Our relationship has been sort of going downhill since probably around December after the thrill of living together finally wore off after a few months. We began getting on each others nerves, bickering like siblings, fighting resulting to one of us sleeps on the couch, etc. I think that’s kinda inevitable when you wake up next to someone, drive to work together, work together all day(were both waiters at the same restaurant) , drive home together, and then fall asleep next to each other and repeat. After months and months of that cycle, fighting and bickering would happen to anyones relationship, no? 

Well it just hasn’t really let up. And this has affected our relationship in a lot of ways. For me, our bickering and fighting has caused me to have a Lack of sex drive with her, and not desiring to do any special for her. This is especially frustrating for her because she’s someone who loves having sex often and needs a lot of affection. And I’m not doing it for her anymore. I just didn’t care too. For her, I’d say it’s just making her mean to me more and extremely negative throughout the day , and her being more comfortable with talking to anyone and their mother except for me. She used to love spending the night together watching movies and cuddling till we fell asleep drinking wine, but Lately it’s like I’ll watch tv on the couch downstairs at night and she will go upstairs to our room and FaceTime all of her friends and family while drinking . She’ll put the phone down if i come into the room or hang up quickly. (Almost like she’s hiding something???) We barely talk anymore, and when we do , 50% of the time it’s a disagreement. 

Well , after months of this going back and forth, She recently told me she’s done. She said she loves me a lot and will miss me tremendously, but she’s done. She can’t do it anymore. And quite frankly, neither can i. Before she said this, i was thinking about leaving her almost regularly. It’s just hard when you live in an apartment together. 

But now that she is so adamant about this, it’s made me have a complete change of heart. Idk why?!   Now it seems like all i DONT want to do is give up on our relationship. I want to work on things with her. For the first time in a long time, I want to see where this went wrong and fix it. 

But my problem is, quarantine and being locked up together in this apartment is making it impossible. (Were in NY so it’s pretty strict here.) There’s no room to have fun. No options to surprise her with a date night out at a fancy restaurant, or spontaneously buy movie tickets to a film we wanna see and walk around the city together holding hands and go shopping. There’s literally nothing exciting to do. And we live together and are around each other 100% of the day. 

So now, She’s asking me to text our landlord to terminate the lease. She said we can’t pay for it anymore, and she has an opportunity to go move in with her guy friends in the neighboring town.(they’re both gay and dating eachother, she’s not cheating and looking for an excuse to break up). But I just don’t know what the hell to do. And if she moves out, what the fuck do i do? We can barley afford this place together, let alone me pay all the bills myself? What do i do, Move back in with my parents?! Hell no! 

It’s making me sick even thinking about this. And she seems pretty dead-set on it. Like at this very moment i can hear them downstairs on FaceTime and having them tell her she’s can take the extra room in their apartment while they’re all laughing and shit. 

I just don’t what to do.  My anxiety is through the roof all day long everyday, while we’re  just kinda moseying around the apartment halfway avoiding eachother and making small talk. We’ve been together four years. I know the inside and out of this girl, and vice versa for her. I know her better than anyone on this earth. And now it seems like she’s a stranger. This is so god damn hard. 

For the past week that this has been going on, Sometimes we will watch tv together at night and cuddle, or make dinner together and it will feel like normal. She will hug me , kiss me. She’ll have a sad face on and just lay near me. But then it’s time for bed and I’ll make a little spot on the couch and she goes upstairs. 

Like i just don’t know what to do. I don’t want to break up. I don’t want to leave the apartment. I don’t want to not be together here? I love the place we’ve made and decorated together!

How do i fix this?  I’m naturally a really stubborn and closed person. I have a hard time articulating my feelings, so i normally Bottle things up. I don’t want to just sit there and beg for her. So i just have been keeping my mouth shut and agreeing. But in reality i just want to tell her i don’t want to break up. But I’m too afraid that her answer will be no and her ego will be boosted cause she knows she has the power. So if it’s unfixable, how do i get through this torturous time in my life.

Honestly, even aside from the relationship issues, i have so many other roadblocks in my way right now. I’ve racked up a lot of credit card debt through college and now getting this apartment. I’ve exhausted all my savings being unemployed and having to pay bills. I have no money at all, and right now I’m 1 month behind on all bills. On top of that, I’m living with my ex girlfriend while we’re both unemployed. We both Can’t get ahold of the department of labor so Were not even getting my Unemployment insurance. I Can’t hang with friends to take my mind off of it. All day i just have suffocating anxiety I try to to mask with a brave and happy face around her. Am i in rock bottom right now? Is being an unemployed, recently single, $5,000 worth of debt, behind of bills 22 year old guy rock bottom? It kinda seems like it to me. 

I guess i just need advice on How do i get through this, with or without her? Originally i typed this out in r/relationship_advice but it realized this is bigger than that. 

Im so Sorry this was as long as it is. I’m prescribed Adderall so sometimes i ramble, but jeez, my head is going a million miles an hour right now. It honestly feels good to get it off my chest though. And to just type it out. Even through an online alias, it’s nice. Anyone who read this long, thank you for your time.

It pays about 1.5x what I make right now at my dead end job and I’ve already discussed pay increases with the representative I’m in contact with. I’d be Gina for 6 months to a year at a time but would be much more capable of supporting my child financially. I would really hate to be gone for so long at a time but I think the benefits outweigh the negatives here. Plus I’d actually be able to retire, whereas right now it’s not very feasible.

744,"Long story short: This neighbor is a super nice (younger) guy, always willing to help. To be sure, I always return the favor as well. 

I asked if I could borrow his paint sprayer, and he happily agreed. Have me a quick rundown, and I had a good idea how to use it. 

Since then I've run into problem after problem. Replaced a filter and a paint tip, assuming these were the problems and it would be fair since he let me borrow it. Now, these items were probably a problem, But it all stems from a huge amount of disrepair. It appears that he has not cleaned this thing well at all. So paint chips and crumbs were clogging up the filter and the tip, and even the hose.

Now these were gray paint chips, so I know they were not mine as I was painting white. This thing is a mess as I found out. everything has plugged at one point or another, the sprayer tip, the sprayer gun, the filter, and even the hose. I'm not very experienced with paint sprayers, but I am mechanically inclined and after going through the troubleshooting it's obvious it just hasn't been cleaned well. 

Partially due to my ignorance and how often I need to prime it, and due to intermittently running into more issues I have now gone through a whole $40 gallon of  paint as well as 8 plus hours troubleshooting and cleaning up as I try to figure out what was going on.

Here's my dilemma, he was very nice and willing and lent it to me without question. But I've wasted so much of my time, and even put $30 in parts, and wasted a $40 gallon of paint. Also my project is unfinished two days later, and I hope the uneven spray due to the plugged sprayer will be able to be covered well. At this point it would have been better for me just to rent a well-maintained one and save myself a lot of stress and time.

Is this something I should just let go? Is it a risk that I take when borrowing things? Or should I press him on how it was kind of messed up to give me something in disrepair?

I'm generally a nice guy and this is something I want to let go, but at this point it's very frustrating and I'm sitting here with over $200 of my labor wasted and $70 and lost parts.

Thank you in advance and let me know?",10Apr2020,1

746,"I'm talking about my senior year. All the usual things like prom, graduation, just spending the last couple months of school with my best friends before we all venture into the unknown. All of that is gone. I know not everyone cares/cared about those things, but I do. I love my high school; we all made the choice to audition and come here, so most of the students feel that way.

School's cancelled through April 30, but with the way things are looking, it's gonna be extended through the whole year.

I've been working for 13 years to get to this point. I've been through hell, and the thought of this year, these last months, is one of the things that got me through it.

It's not really just the experiences I'm upset about, it's the memories. The nostalgia. The last year I truly made great memories like that was my sophomore year. I feel like I'll never have another opportunity to make those kinds of memories again. I'm going to be attending a community college, which is so much less social and connected compared to the arts school I'm at now. I'll hopefully be transitioning to my local university after two years, but I would have missed out on that ""true"" freshman college experience with living in dorms and not knowing what the hell is going on. Community college just seems like public high school part 2. 

I also feel like most friend groups in college form in the freshman and sophomore years and I'll just be lonely when I'm a junior transitioning. Also like a mentioned before, that lack of community because I wasn't there for the full four years, I'm not a 'true"" member of the school or whatever. Even if other people don't think that of me, I'll probably end up thinking that of myself.

I guess this turned into more of a vent about how scared I am about leaving highschool. I would've been scared either way; I think everyone is. But having an end full of memories and experiences (hell, I was supposed to be on a band trip to Hawaii this past week) would have certainly helped. I don't want this to have been the last opportunity to make them.",10Apr2020,1
747,"So I'm a bit of a social butterfly, I love being around people but I kinda dislike doing it through messaging or video calls, i just don't enjoy it as much.

And so this quarantine has had a big toll on me, as I've started to keep more to myself and spend my whole day watching series or playing video games I've lost the will to talk with people and socialize. (This happens alot when I'm on vacation) and I've become more reserved, barely talking to anyone all day and getting frustrated when people talk to me.

I hadn't really noticed it this time until my girlfriend told me she felt like I was absent and I just got really frustrated and didn't want to talk, I just felt like it was annoying.

Id say it could be good that I'm enjoying spending time alone but it worries me how annoyed and grouchy I get.

Does this happen to anyone else? Is there a way to go back to my open, social, talkative self?",10Apr2020,1

749,"Hi, as the title says, I was recently accepted to my dream school, as I type this, I am working on finalizing the supplemental application for my major, but it's still up in the air whether I'll be able to go or not.

My parents divorced when I was young, I am the oldest child and only daughter so I had to step up and become a ""little mom"" to help raise my brothers. My mom was extremely abusive and it caused a lot of hardships for us, so I didn't get the chance to go to college right out of high school; I had to go out into the world and work. Somehow along the way, I got caught in a toxic relationship with  seemingly no way out, until my dad offered me the opportunity to take care of my grandma who had started to suffer with dementia. He had also struggled with a lot of hardships since the divorce, partially because he was stuck in a small town with few employment opportunities. So when someone was needed to take care of my grandma, he immediately stepped in and life got better for him as he was finally in an area where he could find employment.

When I decided to help him take care of her, it was completely manageable. Of course it was still hard, Dementia is an awful disease, but she could still walk, knew who we were, was coherent, etc. So I was easily able to juggle being a full time student while being a caregiver to her. But this last year has been.... awful, honestly the stuff of nightmares. She needs to be in a home with people who know how to take care of her, we all agree on that. But I am powerless in the situation, my dad and uncle decide what to do with her, and if she was to be put in a home, we would have to sell the house.

I want to stress that of course I love my grandma, but taking care of her right now is hell on earth. It is single-handedly the most stressful, difficult, and overwhelming task I have ever dealt with, and I survived A LOT! To me, it is very obvious that my dad and I are way in over our heads. But for whatever reason, nobody knows what to do. I think my uncle just wants us to take care of her until she passes away at home, but I never signed up for that. I was always told that eventually, we would put her in a home when she needed it. But now that it's time to do that... nobody wants to do it.

I know it sounds selfish, but I have been taking care of other people my whole life and I am about to be 28 years old, I want out!! I am suffocating here, there is no room for me to grow here, I am stagnant. I want my own life! I want my own life so bad, I feel like I have never had it.

My dad was happy that I got accepted and told me to ""think about it more"", suggested that I wait another year and reapply to nearby schools in the area so I can stay here to keep taking care of her. I don't want to do that, I really don't. But, I know that it is because my dad is unsure where to go. He does not want to sell the house, I don't either to be honest. But according to my uncle, that's the only way that she can go to a home, because we can't afford it otherwise.

Part of the reason my dad needs me to stay is that I know he can't afford to live anywhere else on his own.  Even with his job, he still does not make enough money to have his own place (who the fuck does?)  I know my dad is tired and wants out too, but he doesn't see any other way out. 

I just don't know what to do, I feel that if I leave to go to school, I will ruin my dad's life. I'm afraid that everyone will think I'm selfish for trying to move on with my own life. It's just that I suffer from depression because I feel like such a failure. I am about to be 28 years old in June, and I have nothing to show for it but an AA degree and an acceptance to a school I should have gone to years ago. I have no money, no career, no significant other, I don't even have a car. I want to also mention that I am financially struggling because I don't get paid to take care of my grandma, and yet because I have been a full time student and caregiver, I don't have time for a job. This situation is not working for me anymore, and I think there needs to be a change.

I am severely unhappy and I want out so bad, but I feel like I'm betraying my family if I go. I just wanted to make a better life for myself, I want to work on getting MY shit together already!  I don't know what to do.

tl:dr - I got accepted to my dream school and would like to move on with my life, but I am a caregiver  for my grandma who suffers from dementia. If I move to go to school, my family will have to sell the house to pay for her to go to a home and I'm scared that by trying to move forward with my life, I will ruin my dad's life, since he has nowhere else to go.",10Apr2020,1
750,"My Parents divorced when I was in 4th grade and I’m almost 23 years old now. My dad has always been a hard ass as he is a very very very successful business man having rose to the title of CEO after being only being at his company for 16 years. He was around, but the more I think about it, he was not he would always come home late from what I remember sometimes I would not even see him until the next morning if my memory is correct. And you guessed it he was cheating on my mom with his secretary. 

I found this out at a way to young age due to the toxicity of the divorce and my parents often talking shit. My dads house was fun but, also not as he would lose his temper quite easily. This resulted me often times either A leaving once I was old enough or B walking a mile to the gas station so my mom could pick me up. We had a heart to heart a few years back about everything that has happened and what I was feeling, but I still feel like there is tension there and we aren’t as close as we should be. I often times do not like his approach as he thinks very differently than I do, so I avoid talking about very personal things with him. I instead talk to my mom as she “knows how to talk to people” given she was a masters in clinical psychology.

TLDR: How can I become close with my dad like I am with given past fights and arguments that left me leaving his house to go back to my moms when I was younger, resulting in a strained relationship that is better now but could have improvement.",10Apr2020,1

752,"So this is a really weird scenario but my girlfriend and I both stream on Twitch. We are very small and probably only average 4-8 viewers at a time but last week, my girlfriend got mad at me because after I got done streaming, she accused me of stealing her bits that she does on her stream and said I act like she is an inconvenience to me when she is watching my stream. Admittedly, I was caught off guard by this statement and was simply confused as to what she meant by that. She then goes on to say that I ignore her majority of the time in chat and say exactly what she says in her streams and then just straight up said she hates it when I stream. 

What I'm confused about though is that I feel like I don't do any of this. I try and read everything in chat and I'm always happy to see her pop up in chat. I even went back to watch the VOD of my last stream to see where I might have ignored her and I didn't really find any point where I did which confused me even more... As for stealing her bits, I still don't know what specific ""bits"" I stole but it's possible after watching her streams all the time that I may have picked up on some stuff unknowingly but it's not like I'm intentionally trying to steal her ideas. And there's even some stuff that I do that I've seen her done on her own stream but I don't care because it's not like I invented whatever it was that I did...People take inspiration from others all the time

But now I'm just really sad because I just miss her a lot and want to talk to her but now she doesn't want to talk to me and being in isolation doesn't help me at all... Can anyone make any sense of this situation?

756,"I (F16) and my friend (M16) have known each other for about a year. We dated for some time but mutually decided to break up because our feelings for each other faded. We both agreed to stay friends and said that the most important thing is that we're together as people, not necessarily as a couple. Lately, especially during the quarantine, we have started fighting a lot. We're always at each other's throats saying really mean stuff. I'm a really direct person and always tell my friends when I have an issue with them, including him. I thought it's okay since all my other friends are totally fine with it but he told me recently that it hurts him a lot. He hasn't told me that at any point in the year we've known each other and it seriously impacted our friendship. (I obviously apologised and we sorted it out - but maybe that's a reason for the fighting?) He's usually a very calm person who doesn't get angry easily but during the last few weeks he's been very brutally honest, telling me that my entire character is annoying and that I should stop feeling sorry for myself (those are from today). Quarantine has been really hard on me and I feel like he's deserting me when I need my friends most. He never really calls or texts even though he knows I don't feel well. Usually he's a great friend, he helped me get over the breakup even though that's obviously not his responsibility as the ex. He cooks for me, takes me on rides on his motorcycle and doesn't want any money for gas. He's fun to be around and I don't wanna lose that but I also don't know if it's normal that we fight so much and if it would be better to just stop being friends.

TL;DR: My friend and I fight constantly since the quarantine started, but he's normally a really nice and funny person who I don't want to lose so I don't know whether it would be better to stop being friends or if it's normal to fight this often.",10Apr2020,1

Thank you for taking the time to stop by and read my post. I firstly and foremost want to take a minute and express my deepest gratitude and thank all of the health care professionals who are currently on the frontlines battling COVID19 first hand and all of the essential workers who are keeping the world turning! 

I am a 26 year old living in Canada who graduated with a Canadian university nursing degree 3 years ago.

765,"So we were hanging out at my and roommate's place. We were 4 guys and 3 girls and we had a movie marathon in the living room while drinking and smoking a bit.

I was sitting on the far left side of the couch, my roommate's friend on the far right side and my girlfriend inbetween. Throughout the evening she kept adjusting her sitting position and going back between him and I kind of. So for, so normal. But towards the end of the night during the last movie, she had her head more or less in his lap and her feet in mine.

At one point she laughed and said she can feel that she's laying on his dick. He asked her if she approves of the size and she responded that she can't really tell. After some back and forth banter between them, she asked me if it's okay for her to check it out. I laughed and shrugged and said that I don't care in a semi joking way. Half expecting she was just joking as well and wouldn't do it anyway, half masking my jealousy while trying to play it cool.

So she undid his pants, got his dick out and looked at it. He started slowly rubbing it while getting hard and she joined in. She wasn't taking her eyes off it and commented on how it was veiny and throbbing before putting it in her mouth. I just sat there awkwardly, not knowing what to do and feeling like I'm thirdwheeling. I was jealous as fuck at that point but didn't want to come off as the controlling boyfriend so I just swallowed my pride and continued watching the movie.

After a bit she was done and when the movie ended, everyone was going to their rooms or home. We went to my bedroom and when she took her pants off, I could tell that she was really wet to the extent of soaking through her panties. I didn't say anything about it and instead we went to bed, falling asleep with her cuddling into me.

Now I'm confused and feel like I should've reacted differently, but don't know how. Should I have shut it down completely? Or finger her during the blowjob to assert dominance? Or just swallow my pride afterwards and fuck her when we were alone? I'm not sure and it's driving me crazy.",10Apr2020,1

769,"So this is a piggy back post on my last one, and some follow up on where things landed. 

So long story short I was messaging with this guy that was not my fiancé and it was not appropriate. Like hands on pants inappropriate. I told my fiancé the day after it happened, because I thought he should know, and I respect him and was on the verge of a breakdown for most of the morning. He was hurt, and quiet. BUT, he was incredibly supportive, said that he still loves me and still wants to marry me. 

Why am I having such a hard time with that?

I emotionally cheated. I talked to someone in a sneaky way, and it was wrong to do that. Even worse, I knew it was wrong and I did it anyway. My fiancé is being extremely supportive. I basically had a complete breakdown and told him I hate myself for doing that and hurting him and that I have some self esteem/self worth issues that I need to work on. But that it wasn’t an excuse for what I did. I fully own it. I feel shitty for it. But he’s not really acting bothered at all. 

I’m a wreck inside. Because not only did I hurt him and break his trust, but he’s being so damn supportive about it. He’s loving me through this and comforting me. He’s supporting me in taking my first steps to speak with a counselor. My first appointment is next week. I know I need to work on myself. I want to understand myself more. And I’m honestly looking forward to it. I just feel like he should hate me. Like he should push me away and call it quits. But he isn’t. 

Things will get better, but will I always question if my fiancé could regret our relationship? Will I always hate myself for this? Will things get better at all, or will I always be a horrible person?

I hate that I did it. I hate myself for doing it. I’m so deeply mad at myself. And I hate myself even more because he still loves me.

771,"It's kind of difficult to explain, but I'll give it my best. I was contacted on Ancestry.com a few years ago about a young woman who was searching for her adopted grandmother's birth family. I was contacted by this young woman's new mother in law (which is important later) as she had just married into their family, and her mother in law is big on researching genetics and is doing what she can on her new daughter in law's adopted connections. It seems that the young woman's grandmother, who was the one put up for adoption, was matching to my mother, and very closely almost as much as a half sibling. The mother in law is ""almost certain"" that my grandfather might be the father of this young woman's adopted grandmother (which would make the grandmother a older half sibling to my mother). I was very excited, and I wanted to welcome her, the young woman, to the family (she's the only one alive now) as I was convinced as well, at first. I told them a bit about the family, and extended family, and I was given access to her ancestry information data and her tree to research and see if I could confirm a connection to my grandfather.

While it is true that the adopted grandmother of this young woman matches very closely with my mom, I started to see a trend in the information I was seeing, without getting too specific,  it was essentially showing me that her line came from my grandfather's mother, rather than my grandfather. It also couldn't seem to identify a father for this young woman, only the line from my great grandmother showed for the adopted grandmother, no other parental sides, my grandfather's mother. 

I asked my mom what she could remember about my greatgrandmother, and she was able to give me some details. My greatgrandmother had several children, boys and girls, with another man before she had my grandfather, my grandfather's older half siblings. My mother had gone to visit that extended side of the family when she was very young once, they had a farm and they showed her how to castrate a bull, she remembered. 

What I noticed is that ancestry says the young woman and her adopted grandmother's line comes from my greatgrandmother, and not my grandfather, but she is close enough to my mother to almost be a half sibling. There are no genetic contributions from a father's line of the adopted grandmother, like it doesn't exist, and it tells me there is one more possibility than just my grandfather having fathered this young woman's adopted grandmother, and that is that two of my grandfathers half siblings had a child together and that child was put up for adoption.

It explains a few things, as why there is no genetic line for the father of the adopted woman, and why it leads directly to my greatgrandmother, instead of mentioning my grandfather, as they have my mother's dna and should be able to match to him as a father if it was so. 

Now, what I need advice about is should I cover this up. When I initially found out about a year ago after going through all the data, I just didn't mention it. I thought eventually they will find the connection themselves. I mentioned that line before I knew the significance, and gave them all the names. I also don't feel comfortable telling this kind of shocking information to the mother-in-law of this woman, as I don't know how the young woman would feel about her new family learning this and having to hear it through them. It is obviously a dark secret my extended family kept for a long time, probably thinking it would never be revealed. Maybe it was even my greatgrandmother who had to arrange for the adoption, I don't know.

I do know that the places and times this woman was born and adopted do not match my grandfather's movements at that time, possible but unlikely, but it could match his half siblings though. The grandmother was about 4 or five years older than my mother and her siblings. I'm about 98% sure this is what happened, but how do I handle knowing this dark secret. Should I just not mention it? I don't mind letting her think it was my grandfather, if it keeps her safe from the information hurting her. The mother-in-law is asking for my raw data from my test to give to a professional to look into it. I really don't want to give my data to another company, and just don't know what to say or where to begin. I think she must be convinced it's my grandfather that fathered the young woman's line, or she might have figured it out too and is looking to confirm to be sure. She is very smart and was able to look at the raw data, or have it be explained by a professional as least, and figured out the possibility of my grandfather, so maybe she has considered this possibility as well? It explains why we can't come up with a mother or father for the adopted grandmother, and says she comes through my greatgrandmother's line not mentioning my grandfather or showing the adopted grandmother as a half sibling to my mother (says first or second cousin but the dna is almost as much as a half sibling), but matches so closely with my mother. Why there is only one genetic line for the adopted grandmother. It really can only mean one thing. What do I do? They are extended family, but the incest is alarming and hard to wrap my brain around. My grandfather has been dead for many years now, so is all the young woman's line, her mother and grandmother. Her adopted grandmother had a daughter, who then had the young woman. It means they are sure about the maternal line reaching my greatgrandmother (mitochondrial), but have nothing for the father as the father would also carry the same dna as the mother. Should I keep this dark secret for my greatgrandmother, at the very least I probably shouldn't give the news through a proxy of this young woman's in laws? I'm uncomfortable loading my data on to Gedmatch, and I'm uncomfortable telling her this information as well. Any advice?",10Apr2020,1

So a little backstory (and I’m not focusing on grammar here)

My roommate and I are both musicians, the house lease is under my name, I’ve been letting him stay at the house for an insanely reduced rate, I am really hooking him up to live here. I lost my job due to Covid-19 crisis and I’ve been quarantined as best as I can, going out very little. My roommate has been working, and not really that careful about what he’s doing, refuses to wear a mask, goes to the store everyday. Last week he coughed into the fridge. I’ve told him that I have breathing problems and am susceptible to pneumonia and am very concerned about getting Covid-19.  He told me that he was flying to Vegas on like April 5 ( shelter in place where we are was in effect at this time) to get locked down with a buddy who he was gonna help set up a livestream for cause he was out of work. He said he would be gone for 2 weeks, and I had made it very clear that if he goes the circumstances of him returning might be really weird and he said he understood that he might just get stuck in Vegas. 

So my roommate is trying to fly back from Vegas to ATL on Saturday as in tomorrow and idk wtf to do. I've been quarantined the whole time, He said he was going to be gone for probably 2 weeks, Saturday would make it one week. A part of me does not want to let him back in the house at all until this is over, but a part of me doesn't want to make someone homeless during the pandemic. I am at a loss of words with how not seriously he's taking this. I considered him a good friend, now I don’t. I don't want him here at all. Anyways I just called him and told him I didn’t want him staying here, but I’d get him any of his things that he needed he just had to find someone else to stay with. He did not listen and said he’ll be there tomorrow. I told him I’d talk to him later,  This is all legally very weird cause all of his stuff is at my house, I am taking care of his cat and I don’t want to be doing any of this, I just want everyone to be safe right now.",10Apr2020,1
773,"should we still be friends??

should we still be friends???

this is kinda a long story &amp; i’m sorry but i really need help haha 

okay so, there’s this guy that i’ve been kinda on and off with for 2/3 years &amp; a lot of shit has happened in that time. it started freshman year of hs, he had been really into one of my friends and they kinda dated for a little while. he and i were friends but we weren’t super close. anyways, the girl breaks up with him and he starts talking to me romantically. i kinda liked him but i didn’t want to bc he was known to be kinda an asshole (in the teenage boy kinda way, he wasn’t a huge jerk or anything). we talked for a little while but i was clear that i didn’t want to be in a relationship mostly bc i wasn’t ready for one at that point. he starts dating another girl, and i’m fine with it but then it comes out that he still likes me. my class is super small (there’s 18 of us) so all gossip spreads like wildfire. his girlfriend ends up hating me but it didn’t bother me too much. i was just upset with him for basically lying to her, but it wasn’t my business so i didn’t get super involved. i also found out from his ex that he was basically using me to rebound after they broke up. she showed me messages of him saying that, but he insists he actually liked me. we became more distant after that. 

sophomore year we got paired together for a group project and we became close again. being the stupid person i am, i decide to catch feelings. i was in a really bad place mentally at that time though, so i want comfortable being in a relationship. we stay friends but we were a bit flirty. at the end of the year, he moved to another city and we became REALLY close. i think the distance made it easier for me to ignore the fact that he’s a bit of an asshole. we talked all the time and he eventually told me he loved me. i want sure how i felt, but i knew i liked him more than any guy i’ve liked in the past. anyways, after moving, he got really depressed and started sleeping around and doing drugs (he did that stuff before he moved but to a lesser extent) and he told me about all of it. i don’t really like that stuff, but i can’t control his choices, and we weren’t dating so i didn’t make a huge deal out of it. i just tried to be there for him as much as i could. 

one night, he hooked up with his best friend and felt super guilty bc he “was in love with me” so he told me about it. i asked if he had feelings for her (i was sus bc he wasn’t this guilty abt the other girls he hooked up with) he said kinda, but he loved me more. that didn’t make sense to me. i was pretty upset, but i didn’t tell him bc we weren’t officially dating, and he was far away, so i didn’t think it was worth fighting. a few nights later, he did molly for the first time and i tried staying on the phone with him as long as i could just to make sure he was safe. i was pretty annoyed with him bc he was fucking up his life and it was affecting me negatively. eventually, i had to hang up, but i told him to keep texting me. most of it was random gibberish but then he started spilling his heart out to me. he told me he was in love with me, he’d never felt that way about someone else, and he really wanted to fuck me. the last part kinda pissed me off so i told him to talk to me when he was sober. after that, i realized he wasn’t very good for me so i started to distance myself, which i felt really bad about bc he was in a bad place, but i was too and i needed to take care of myself. 

my best friends didn’t like him very much, but i had become close with some of his friends. they’re genuinely good people and i really like hanging out with them, and i know they like me. this year, (junior) we started hanging out a lot more and it was really great. the guy came to visit for christmas, so i decided  to put aside my annoyance with him and just have a good time with all of them. we were having a lot of fun, and one night i drove him home. we stayed in the car a bit just taking and it was honestly really nice. then, just before he left, he kissed me. when i got home, i told one of our mutual friends bc she asked if anything happened between us. she said “dude, he has a girlfriend. he told me he would tell you if you made any moves”. this was later confirmed by 3 other people. i was obviously really upset, and i asked him if he had a girlfriend and he said he was talking to someone but it wasn’t official. i also found out that he told the rest of our mutual friends about our kiss, all of whom knew he had a gf. it made me feel really stupid, so i stopped taking to him after that. 

i was angry for a while, but then i realized my anger was only hurting me so i let go of it.  he moved back here last week, and he reached out to tell me. i told him i knew bc i’d seen his dad before quarantine started, and i was happy for him bc he wasn’t doing well when he lived in the other city. he asked if i wanted to hang out and i said no bc a) quarantine and b) i didn’t want to be alone with him. he said he didn’t want anything sexual, he is taking to a girl and he thinks it’s going well, he just missed me, and that he had changed a lot after going to a mental hospital. he also said he would respect my wishes, he was just curious why. i told him about the kiss stuff and finding out he had a gf was really upsetting to me. the conversation actually went really well, i expected him to get mad, but he didn’t. he did say that he hadn’t had a girlfriend since that girl freshman year, he had only hooked up. i told him many people told me otherwise, and he said he understood and he was okay with us only hanging out in a group. 

we kept texting, and 2 nights later he told me that if he wasn’t “basically dating” this girl, he’d be flirting with me. i told him i think it would be better to just be friends, and he agreed. i expressed that i had really liked him, but a lot of our relationship was unhealthy for me in the past, and i only like him as a friend now. he told me he understood, he just needed to get that off his chest. this is the first time we’ve mutually agreed on just friends since freshman year lmao. 

anyways, a lot of my friends think i’m dumb for choosing to be his friend, but he was a big part of my life and i care about him, even though i no longer have romantic feelings for him. also, i really really like our mutual friends, they’re who i was spending most of my time with before quarantine started. i really don’t want to fuck up that friendship by wanting to exclude him. plus, so far it really does seem like he’s changed quite a bit. he’s sober, he wasn’t angry with me, and he’s respecting the just friends rule.

so, if you read all of that, am i dumb for choosing to stay his friend? am i overreacting by questioning if i want to be his friend? any thoughts are welcome :)",10Apr2020,1

775,"I’m a straight woman in her twenties that has many healthy relationships with women of all ages. The majority of my friends and mentors are women. 
But I hate the female body and I find it very unappealing even off-putting. Is this normal? I read a lot about how all women are a little bisexual but I don’t find that true at all for myself. I am strongly attracted to a male physique so it’s not that bodies don’t turn me on. I just don’t find beauty in women. A lot of my straight female friends talk about how women are more beautiful but I just don’t see that.
Even if I’m trying to look at some fun images it’s usually solo men or two men together. I know it’s a really strange question but I’m just wondering if there are other women like me?

777,"Hello friends,

if you've made it this far, I'm assuming you're interested in reading this lmao. I feel as if I need to tell someone so I can talk it out. So, this starts back in 2016, I'm using this anonymous account just to be safe. Okay so back in 2016 I was still in high school and I made a friend named (for the sake of this story)  Brad. Brad had been traveling all throughout Europe with a girl he met on Vine. At the time, he was Vine famous. She's European, Let's say she's Finnish. Brad and I became really good friends very quickly. He invited me to travel to Finland with him and his gf. Let's call his gf Delilah. Delilah went to a local college in my state, funny enough it's now my college. So fast forward to graduation... Brad, his gf and I all flew together to Europe.   
I met all of Delilah's friends and traveled to different cities within Finland with Brad &amp; Delilah. Up to this point, I had experienced probably a year and a half of their relationship. I knew they weren't a strong couple. There would be times when Delilah and I would just be talking and Brad would completely interject into the conversation because he felt left out. We continued to travel and enjoy Finland and then, in July of 2016, I met a Finnish woman. She and I fell in love almost immediately. Let's call my ex, E. E eventually came back with me to the states to study where Delilah studied. E and I spent a lot of time with Delilah and Brad. But I would still get thoughts of me being with Delilah. Despite me, being happy with E. I saw how Brad treated Delilah and I got really close with Delilah. E and I would often talk about how we'd last longer as a couple than Brad and Delilah. There was about a year lapse in time where I didn't think about Delilah. I bought an engagement ring to propose to E and move to Finland for her after college. Well, after being apart from E for a year, she broke up with me late last year. Brad and Delilah had broken up around the same time actually, maybe a month before E and I. They had a completely different situation though, they were living together in a different state. Brad found a new gf in that state a few weeks after him and Delilah split. Anyway, I've been talking to Delilah lately and the feelings I had years ago are back. I'm attracted to her beauty, her kindness, her ambition. The issue is, she lives in Finland. I've been learning a lot of Finish and prior to realizing that I had these deep feelings for her, I wanted to attend a master's program in Finland. She has said like, ""oh if you ever move to Finland, make sure to let me know"". I try to make excuses to talk to her without showing my feelings... Apart of me thinks she doesn't share these feelings, honestly. The reason being, I'm an overthinker and a legit hopeless romantic. However, I could see a future where I end up with Delilah in 20 years. I don't fucking know why, but I have a calling to Finland (It's not Finland btw lmao). I'm beginning to think maybe I had a past life in that country. Only because I have a very weird passion for that country. (I'm not religious, but they say.. ""everything happens for a reason"" so there must've been a reason why I went to that country specifically as the first trip that I paid for) For example, Brad did not want to move to that country to be with Delilah, but I was so down and honestly I still am. I don't know what the fuck to do. I'm thinking about just planning to attend the master's program but not telling Delilah for a while, that way I'm doing it for myself and not for her.   
Telling her how I feel over text is not the move, don't suggest it lol. This is all just an awkward situation for me, just because I really don't want to fuck it up. In fact, I'm very tempted to delete this post, but I need to vent it out. Honestly, if Delilah was American I'd feel the same way. The thing is, I've been single for about 4 months now. Dating sucks and I still picture myself with a woman I hardly talk to lmao. I always considered Delilah a very close friend, it's weird, I haven't seen her since the middle of 2019. I kinda wish she'd read this and message me...  I still think it's interesting that I was thinking about Delilah while I was happy with E.  Ugh... *People, am I just being a fucking idiot?*  


I left out a lot of details. This story pans out from 2016-2020 so if you have any questions, ask away.

TL;DR: I have feelings for my best friend's ex gf, she's foreign. I haven't told many people, just looking to hear what others have to say.

780,"**One of my biggest insecurities** since my early childhood, and I think my only real physical insecurity, **has been my double chin.** I got dealt a horrendously terrible genetic hand with body fat. I am actually several pounds within the normal BMI and **my body fat percentage is relatively low, but I’m stuck with this extra fat on my face that won’t leave.** I’m thinking of getting plastic surgery to get rid of it.

In 2019, **I dropped my body fat from 20% to 15%.** Losing weight sucks! You have to give up the food you love and you have to work out. I love pizza and whiskey but couldn’t have it more than once a week. I even had to wake up an hour earlier to make time to work out. I promise I’m not subtle flexing - I’m genuinely just saying how much it sucked. None of that was fun.

My waist size went down, and I started wearing my belt tighter. My belly got less round. My legs got way more toned too. **With all the fat I burned, the fat on my face hardly moved.** It’s so sad. Even when I was a bit chubbier, I was never really insecure about the rest of my body. Of course, I started living a more healthy lifestyle for more reasons (to prevent diabetes, hypertension, etc), but **losing weight didn’t really help me feel any more secure about myself since the one thing I was really *insecure* about hardly changed**.

The fat on my face is the only thing I’m particularly insecure about. And it feels like it’s here to stay.

**I’m thinking about getting plastic surgery to get rid of it, but that makes me nervous. It’s hard to explain why.** I think it’s because plastic surgery of any kind feels like it’s tied to psychological body image issues.

If a young kid, of any gender/size/etc, came to you and said they wanted to get plastic surgery because they didn’t like how they looked, you would want this kid to get psychological help. I know I’m not a kid, and I know I’m not overwhelmingly insecure, but I think that same worry lingers for myself. I don’t know if that comparison makes any sense.

781,"So I am a 21-year-old woman, and I have been seeing this man that is 41. That’s the first red flag, I know. We met on a kink website back in December, and silly me thought that it was love at first sight. At first he was perfect, he told me everything I wanted to hear and so I fell for him super hard and super fast. I found out that he was facing a legal situation for sexting a 15-year-old girl, but the way he explained it to me made him sound innocent and I didn’t think too much about it. As time went on, he stopped actually taking me on dates. We would just chill at his place for a few hours, and I started to just feel like a fuck buddy situation but I had feelings. He told me he had feelings too, but I kind of doubt it. I’ve never actually thought that I loved someone, so I’m having a really really hard time ending it with him. Often, he won’t text me for days at a time and then come back as if nothing happened or with some silly excuse. I have had the feeling that he is seeing other women from the start. He also wasn’t very supportive of me when I went through an assault right before I met him. I am never happy when I’m with him, the only thing this relationship has going for it is that the sex is spectacular. He’s racist, used to work for border patrol before he got fired for the Sexting incident, and he thinks North Korea has something to do with coronavirus. I know all these things about him, but I don’t know why I am having so much trouble just breaking up with him.

I also honestly don’t think it’s his absolute dream to get into the army. He kinda has a if I get in I get in mentally when it comes to it. It’s something he wants but he’s not going to be devastated if he doesn’t get in.

So he is pretty short for a guy. I don’t know his exact height but I would say 5’7 or 5’8 and he weighs about 180. He’s short and stalky. I would say he is slightly chubby but it’s just a small tummy. 

He isn’t training for the physical like at all. He doesn’t work out almost at all from what I know. He’s currently jobless so the only physical activity he is doing is helping friends out here or there. I would say he holds onto his muscle pretty well though.

Additionally, my 2018 tax says no one can claim me and no one has for past 2 years father nor mother.

The person who reached out to me did so under his personal name, not thinking I would know of any ties he had to the channel, but by coincidence I know who he is and know he is affiliated with them.

795,"I met a girl this semester, through an art class totally by chance. We had a mutual friend, and had a group chat to help us with the materials. Eventually the texts between me and her started transitioning away from just school and towards tv and music. Pretty quickly we were texting all the time about all kinds of stuff. I knew the whole time that she had a boyfriend who went to a different college in Canada but I never thought of her in a romantic way and I was always super open and was really able to be myself with her. At some point we starting hanging out more in person and she gave some vibes that she was interested in me as more than a friend (wanting to hang one on one, head on my shoulder while we watched tv, general flirty vibes, etc). She is very attractive and at that point I caught feelings for her, but I never made a move out of respect for her boyf. We hung out a few weeks ago and I told her that I had some feelings beyond friendship cause I was confused and I felt like I needed to know where she was at. She told me she had some feelings for me too, and that she found me attractive, and that when we started texting it was really new and fresh, but that now she was pushing her feelings away because she had a boyfriend and was committed to him. She went back to the east coast this week cause of corona so I probably wont see her until fall. We had a facetime to try to get total clarity, which helped although Ill never fully understand, but she said she really didn't want to have this conversation again. I started pushing my feelings away too and moving on, but I really do want to maintain our friendship, cause that was what it all started with and we were super close friends and the conversation was always great. However, I get that it will always be different than it was and totally understand that she wants to be respectful of her boyfriend and so she said we shouldn't talk for a bit, which I totally agreed with. We're in the same program at school and we have mutual friends so I know ill see her again, but I really want to bring the friendship back. When we talked she implied we could get there, but didnt give a time line, and just said that ""itll be totally normal fall at the latest"". I definitely wont have any communication for a few weeks, but am I crazy for thinking that we can go back to having a friendship? How should I play this?

798,"Slight fib. 

I learned to draw once as a child and was practically prodigious at it, but around eight, my parents decided they wanted me to pursue a career in Law or STEM and tossed my drawings. No arts for Tyrannosaurocorn! 

Since then, I’ve rubber banded between consistent practice and absolute neglect, mostly because of college. I’d like to take lessons to refine my ability to do line art, and then move forward with coloring and shading. I can draw cartoons just fine, but my understanding of anatomy is abhorrent, and I‘d honestly prefer to have consistent lessons, and the guidance of a teacher. 

As for the piano, I’m not looking to be a musical genius. However, it is my dream to be able to play, and I have an electric keyboard to practice on. It’s not the best, but it can float me until I save up some cash. 

I’d like to be able to learn to read sheet music, and not learn by ear, or by mimicry. Ideally, I’d want lessons in person (NY), but if there’s any such thing as online piano lessons that can provide me with some sort of basis to practice with during quarantine, I’d appreciate those recommendations. Or any resources I could read to begin learning to read sheet music. 

All price ranges are welcomed, except the most ballistic. I’m looking for a good way to learn, not a fast, cheap way. I really don’t want to half-ass these things, as they’re both important goals of mine.

My father has severe anger issues with mood swings that happen like the flip of a switch. I need help knowing if what he does when he’s mad is abuse, emotional or verbal. When he’s mad he yells really loud and says a lot of bad shit, calling me shit like a brat, a bitch, a little shit, etc; I’m always afraid the neighbors are going to hear and call the cops(believe it or not despite this I love my dad and having him arrested would crush me). He breaks things too, so far(or at least the things I remember) he’s broken: two closet doors, my phone, several dishes,  a lot of walls, and probably more I can’t remember. I’ve blocked it mostly, when he yells my brain just kind of shuts off, I go somewhere else. It’s getting harder to control myself and not yell back(which would make things worse), I’m going on 15 and that makes controlling emotions harder.

Also, I tend to be a little insecure and paranoid. BUT. He is working from home in the garage-office. I went out there for something and he immediately put his phone away. That happened three separate times. On the third time I said 'why does it feel like you're hiding something from me?' so he showed me his phone which just had a game up and he said he was playing games while waiting on a work thing to finish and felt ashamed to be caught playing games when he's supposed to be working. The thing is, the first two times it looked like he had some kind of chat program up (but I didn't get a good look at it) and he's not the type to hide things normally. He just is who he is (which is generally pretty nice) and people can take it or leave it.

805,"Before I start this I'm only in middle school so I have no intention to start dating and stuff like that, I just have crushes. Also, let me explain my middle school because my school isn't like others.

There are 3 middle schools in my district. All 3 are in 1 building and are literally separated by doors and each school is one segment of the building. The 3 schools names are STEM, SOFA, and CCA (can't leak what they all stand for for obvious reasons). SOFA has the part where you come in on the first floor, STEM has that same part, exept only upstairs kn the second floor, and CCA, my school is more kn the side having 7th grade on the upstairs part and 8th grade down on the first floor. Our school starts at 7th grade yes. All schools share the same buses in the morning and after school. We all use the same lunch, gym, health, and win classes/rooms just at different times. That's the most important things you need to know.

I have/had this crush that I recently started thinking about randomly and I don't even know whether i still like him or not but that doesn't matter because he goes to one of the other schools (though I do rarely see him coming into the school and going upstairs in the morning when we're dismissed to our classes in the morning (us in CCA have to pass through SOFA and STEM stairs are where we pass). Anyway, I started liking him in 5th grade when I realized we have a lot in common and we became friends before I started liking him. Just another thing to add, I was conflicted because there was this one boy I knew since kindergarten and liked him since 2and grade but hes not important in this because I stopped liking him this year after he and my friend started ""dating"" even though it was obvious he didn't like her. We were also best friends btw but we've drifted apart after that


Anyway, A, the person I'm mainly talking about in this could have possible liked me but I honestly don't knew whether he did or not. We talked a lot in 5th grade and talked almost everyday in 6th grade. I told my friend that I liked him this year and she said that she honestly thought that we were dating when she first came in 6th grade lol. Anyway, we talked almost everyday and once, idk how we started talking about it, but at lunch one day, we were talking about girly girls (a species of human in which I am not). He started saying how he wouldn't really want to date a girly girl, but someone more tomboyish (a species of human in which I am). When he found out that I also have an xbox one he gave me his gamertag for me to add him (I obviously did). I never messaged him because of shyness part of that.

After the tour of the middle school we asked each other which school we would pick and he said STEM but I chose CCA and he looked a little disappointed too. On the last day of the he hugged me (something he doesn't do often). My best friend that I mentioned earlier, she gets in the same bus as him and she said that he occasionally asks about me. I begged my parents to let me get on that bus and my mom almost found out about a crush (oop-) but they did let me ride the bus because my friend that I go home with (I ride her bus to her house and my dad picks me up after he gets off work. The bus that my crush gets on literally has a stop at the corner from my house so that's why I was able to get on the 2 days.) That one day I rode the bus he wasn't there, but the next day he was there and when we saw.me he was very surprised and he couldn't sit by us because the seats around his were full.

My best friend thinks he likes me but I don't know. He might have just thought of me as a close female friend. He might have liked me but yeah... Does anyone know if he probably liked me or not?",10Apr2020,1
806,"So we are in our second week of shelter in place and my girlfriend wants to keep doing things with friends. 

Backstory. She is a person who grew up on a farm and was almost raised with the thought of “if you’re bored, don’t worry, I’ll find something for you to do” by her parents. (As in chores or labor type things, cleaning etc.) 

She HATES the fact that I can sit and play video games and have that social interaction without having to leave. I play board games with her, I clean, I offer to watch movies with her, but there is only so much we can do as a couple in our home. A couple days ago, a couple invited us and 4 others to hang out on their deck and drink with them, I said I didn’t want to go, but she said “just for an hour”. Fine. 

She loves to bake, perfect. Something she can do on her own. Well she “overbaked” Easter cookies (made too many) and now she “has to deliver them to her friends around town”. She went across the street and hand delivered to our elderly neighbor, and she is currently driving around town giving these cookies away. 

Before she left I said I didn’t want to go because she is risking everyone she is giving that food to. She said “fine, if you’re going to be an asshole about it then don’t come.” Okay. 
Then before she left I said have fun delivering your covid bombs. (Probably not a safe phrase to utter online) (but I said that about her cookies FBI agents) . She said she hated me and left. 

So what can I do. She is so bored all the time. Needs social interaction on the daily (she is a teacher), and just won’t stay at home. If I bring it up to her she just says that she can’t just sit and do nothing, and that it’s not fair that I can do my video games all the time. 

So, just some advice on what I can say to help. I know that if she is the cause for someone contracting it and dying that she would be devastated. 

Thanks",10Apr2020,1

Basically, if you check my last post I mentioned this, my account was locked because I used only gift cards as a balance in my account, and I was planning to buy PC parts for my first custom build. (I have a debit card but most of my money was cash so I just quickly went to my local Walgreens to buy some gift cards.) My account got locked because it was a 720$ of gift card money being piled into a 2 month old account, so it seemed obviously like fraud. I actually got it unlocked in the first week by providing my receipt. Then 2 days later, after trying to buy my parts, my account got locked. Again. They literally saw me just trying to buy a large amount of expensive items and locked it again. But this time, they said my receipt was fake without any reason as why. They never tried to confirm it, and I even had to contact my local Walgreens. Walgreens just gave me a transaction sheet, and said that they would be happy to confirm that my receipt was real. I literally thought that's the end of my situation. But the account specialists take another week to reply, then sent the same email they sent in the beginning, but in different templates (infuriating AF). In fact, its been 36 days now since I replied to their email and my account has been locked since then. Support hasn't been much use, I called them multiple times and got hung up on 3 times (probably some issues with calls not 100% sure) and nothing changed. Please.

815,"The last 12 months have been extremely challenging. Up until last semester I had been pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science, but had to drop out due to  a number of issues (college is expensive and depression from my brother who died in August). With what little money I had, I decided to enroll in a software development bootcamp hoping to build a career that could help me to earn enough money to finish my degree. I was on a payment plan with the bootcamp, making payments just fine, until the coronavirus hit. I was working part time as a tutor, but since kids are out of school, they don't need very much help with homework. Suddenly, instead of working in the bootcamp from 9-5, we were all working from home. We have been learning remotely now for 3 weeks. I was doing great in the course until this happened. I suddenly found myself struggling with the material, and today was the due date of the final project. I had a semi-working project that I might have been able to finish in time; the only problem was that I had plagiarized a portion of it. In my rush to meet the deadline, I stole code from one of my classmates and used it in my own project. It's not something that I'm proud of but it happened. Long story short, I got caught, and I will not be graduating from the bootcamp. I really love software development and I want to make this my career, but now I feel that I have no avenues left into this career. I'm still in debt for my years at university, and now owe this bootcamp 2 more payments that I will not be able to complete because I currently have no source of income. How do I make the best of this situation? Let me reiterate I do want to make this a career, but with no certification, it will be very difficult.

818,"I am in my 20s and home from college due to the pandemic. My parents' marriage has been bad for a very long time, but they are still together because a divorce isn't financially feasible (along with other reasons). My dad is kind of a pathological liar and very emotionally manipulative, and he has done things like spy on everything my mother does on her phone and plant recording devices in her car and inside our house so he can listen in on her conversations. He's convinced that she's cheating on him. She's not — she's brutally honest and would just outright tell him if she was cheating. But he cheated on her previously, so it makes sense that he'd think that's a common thing to do or whatever. 

All of this is confirmed. My mother has found recording devices and he has admitted to spying on her. Now that I'm living at home, I'm scared that he's spying on me too, even if it's just accidental in an attempt to spy on my mother. We don't know if there are currently any devices in her car or in the house, but this is something that has gone on for months at a time in the recent past, and we have no reason to believe that he wouldn't currently be doing it. Today I had to have a remote session with my therapist in my mom's car (there was zero privacy in the house and no service anywhere else outside), and I feel sick just thinking about the idea that my dad might have my whole session on tape somewhere. My mother and I have also had very private conversations just between the two of us in her car, and it's very possible that he heard those too. We have to assume that anything we say could be being recorded anywhere on our property. It feels incredibly violating. At the VERY least, I deserve to be able to talk to my therapist without being spied on. 

My mom insists that there's nothing we can do to stop him, and that if we confront him in any way he'll just lie about it. They've already fought about it a million times. So I wanted to see if I can crowdsource any ideas for how to either find the recording devices, or somehow get him to confess or stop doing it. Maybe someone can at least think of some way that I can find some privacy to talk to my therapist over Zoom without my dad listening in, because therapy is the only way I'm going to stay sane. ANY ideas for how to make this situation better would be appreciated. Because of the pandemic, we're probably stuck like this for months, and my mom will be stuck with this even after I leave.",10Apr2020,1
819,"Hey guys, idk if this is the right place so ask about this so please tell me if it isn’t. And sorry this is gonna be long. 

So i’m 18, a senior in high school and i’m about to graduate, just for some background. in my freshman year i was pretty happy, but i never really felt like i belonged. Eventually that year i started dating a girl, but that didn’t last long and we broke up relatively soon after we started dating. For whatever reason this tore me up, but the main this it did was make me realize that i was the weak link when it came to my friends. I was in a bunch if different friend groups, but at the end of the day i really wasn’t that close with any one of the people in those groups. After i while i began to get really lonely and i started locking myself in my room and playing video games and ignoring the rest of my world, and eventually i started using online chat rooms to get attention from strangers, and this went on for a while and it became an addiction. Eventually i started dating this girl and the problem still persisted through the year, and around our first anniversary i broke down and told her everything and she understood and forgave me. After that we went on for another year and i broke up with her in December. Now here’s the problem: beginning in November i had a really horrible bout of anxiety about the online stuff and it essentially numbed all my feeling except for anxiety and i felt like i didnt care about her anymore. This girl gave me everything, we were each other’s first times for almost everything, and we spent almost every day with each other. She made me feel like i belonged and made me strive to be a better person than who i was before. When i broke up with her she was devastated, she lost interest in her hobbies, cried a lot, and tried to convince me to come back, but i couldn’t feel anything except anxiety. I started to go to therapy a couple months ago, in january i think, and it’s helped me to cope with that stuff, and now i can feel happy, and sleep at night, but more importantly i still care about her. When we broke up i said things that hurt her and eventually she said she needed space from me. I wanted her to be happy again so i said that’s cool and i understand, but she also said that if i change my mind then i should tell her. Well, around the end of February i realized i wanted her back, but i had also heard that she was dating someone else. When i told her that i was ready to be with her again she told me it’s too late, and shortly after that she blocked me and unfriended me on everything. She wont even say hi to me if we pass by each other, she wont look at me, and she just hates me now. We spent almost every minute together for two years and she’s with someone else less than 2 months later.  Without her everything just feels gray. I miss all these cute things she would do, or the things she’d say, or just the stupid stuff we’d do when we were together, and now all i can do is picture that guy (who’s a major down grade) . I miss her so much that i don’t know what to do. I feel myself falling into old patters like feeling lonely, shutting myself off from the rest of the world, overthinking if someone isnt talking to me at the moment (and i don’t mean ignoring me, i mean if i’m alone i just feel like certain people hate me when i know they don’t), or just sitting there wallowing in self pity. 

How do i move on? All i do is think about her, and if it isn’t her, then its me feeling like none of my friends care about me. I really don’t want to be alone, and i feel like everything i do is pushing everyone away.",10Apr2020,1
820,"I'm her 21 year old sister. When I was younger, I was pretty cringe worthy at times too. But around her age I started getting into drugs; so I am glad that she's hanging out with kinda the nerdier crowd for that reason - to keep her out of trouble. However, she's started to pick up some really cringey habits. She talks super loud in a forcibly deep, monotone voice. You can tell she's trying to edit her voice on purpose. It's really annoying and jarring. 

She also will start talking about something completely out of context when company are over, like her D&amp;D game ""Yeah today I killed a (obscure imaginary monster name) and took the witch's daughter as prisoner haha and the overlord gave me gold coins and my magica got increased to +40 proficiency."" (I have no idea what I'm saying btw I just am trying to give an example of something she would say lol.) And I repeat, this is with absolutely NO context, so it makes no sense. I think it's great she loves to share about her hobbies, I wish I did that as a kid, but it kind of just confuses and makes people uncomfortable when she goes on about it for so long without anyone knowing what she is talking about. If she gave context it would make sense.

She has poor hygeine, and she also repeats really annoying/nonsensical phrases like ""ooga binga"" over and over again really loudly.

Usually I have the opinion that kids should just be kids. This sounds really harsh and critical to nitpick her like this, but these habits are so abrasive that I came here to make a post about it. Again, I'm glad she's doing nerd stuff instead of doing bad stuff like I did, but like I wonder if I should give her a little gentle guidance. I don't want her to get made fun of behind her back. I just don't want to be mean or hurt her self esteem. Not sure how to go about it.",10Apr2020,1

824,"I'm 18 &amp; currently at a point in my life where I have no friends. I've only had a handful throughout my life. The longest friendship I've ever kept was 7 years, (and for a few years of that we considered each other best friends) but recently in the past year we've drifted away. Well, I should say he drifted away. We're now at a point where we don't talk, at all, and it's really getting to me. We never had a falling out, &amp; throughout this past year of drifting apart I've reached out to hang out at least a dozen times, included him in text threads etc, yet he just wasn't giving the same energy back so I finally decided it was time to pack up whatever small amount of pride I have left and let go.

And that's just the thing- as far back as I can remember, it's always been this way. It's always me who wants to keep things rolling, to stick with the other person. And it doesn't matter how close we were at one point, or how long we've been friends, eventually they find somebody who's funnier than I am, or wittier than I am, &amp; then it's game over. No more casual video chatting and getting included, they just drop me. I become the outcast. It's like people have a switch, one day they care deeply for you, &amp; the next day something mildly inconvenient happens and they're done with you for life. It's as if friendship is a competition to these people. Who can score the coolest friend? Who can I score that'll improve my image?

I just don't understand it because I've never been this way. I'm starting to think there is something seriously wrong with me. 

Then when I come to the conclusion that there's something wrong with me, I have the dilemma of changing myself for others. Am I really me anymore if I'm going to pretend to be interested in generic male interests just to score social points? (sports, cars, etc) Again, it's as if everyone I've met thus far in my life is playing this game to score points and all I want is companionship. I'm not even talking romantically, I just want a mate.

Honestly, awhile ago I was thinking of telling everybody about me but they seem homophobic. For some reason they are okay with guys being gay but not girls. (Probably because my cousin, a guy, is the only person part of the LGBT that they know)

I agree with my mom. I think it would be better for my mental health but the only problem is that the family would make snide comments about it to anyone that would listen. They are mean like that.

829,"Before I start this I'm only in middle school so I have no intention to start dating and stuff like that, I just have crushes. Also, let me explain my middle school because my school isn't like others.

There are 3 middle schools in my district. All 3 are in 1 building and are literally separated by doors and each school is one segment of the building. The 3 schools names are STEM, SOFA, and CCA (can't leak what they all stand for for obvious reasons). SOFA has the part where you come in on the first floor, STEM has that same part, exept only upstairs kn the second floor, and CCA, my school is more kn the side having 7th grade on the upstairs part and 8th grade down on the first floor. Our school starts at 7th grade yes. All schools share the same buses in the morning and after school. We all use the same lunch, gym, health, and win classes/rooms just at different times. That's the most important things you need to know.

I have/had this crush that I recently started thinking about randomly and I don't even know whether i still like him or not but that doesn't matter because he goes to one of the other schools (though I do rarely see him coming into the school and going upstairs in the morning when we're dismissed to our classes in the morning (us in CCA have to pass through SOFA and STEM stairs are where we pass). Anyway, I started liking him in 5th grade when I realized we have a lot in common and we became friends before I started liking him. Just another thing to add, I was conflicted because there was this one boy I knew since kindergarten and liked him since 2and grade but hes not important in this because I stopped liking him this year after he and my friend started ""dating"" even though it was obvious he didn't like her. We were also best friends btw but we've drifted apart after that


Anyway, A, the person I'm mainly talking about in this could have possible liked me but I honestly don't knew whether he did or not. We talked a lot in 5th grade and talked almost everyday in 6th grade. I told my friend that I liked him this year and she said that she honestly thought that we were dating when she first came in 6th grade lol. Anyway, we talked almost everyday and once, idk how we started talking about it, but at lunch one day, we were talking about girly girls (a species of human in which I am not). He started saying how he wouldn't really want to date a girly girl, but someone more tomboyish (a species of human in which I am). When he found out that I also have an xbox one he gave me his gamertag for me to add him (I obviously did). I never messaged him because of shyness part of that.

After the tour of the middle school we asked each other which school we would pick and he said STEM but I chose CCA and he looked a little disappointed too. On the last day of the he hugged me (something he doesn't do often). My best friend that I mentioned earlier, she gets in the same bus as him and she said that he occasionally asks about me. I begged my parents to let me get on that bus and my mom almost found out about a crush (oop-) but they did let me ride the bus because my friend that I go home with (I ride her bus to her house and my dad picks me up after he gets off work. The bus that my crush gets on literally has a stop at the corner from my house so that's why I was able to get on the 2 days.) That one day I rode the bus he wasn't there, but the next day he was there and when we saw.me he was very surprised and he couldn't sit by us because the seats around his were full.

My best friend thinks he likes me but I don't know. He might have just thought of me as a close female friend. He might have liked me but yeah... Does anyone know if he probably liked me or not?",10Apr2020,1

I really need the money but I’ve been feeling a little sick lately.

Most of the time I’m fine other than a scratchy throat, but every day or two I’ll have short, painful coughing fits. I’ve also been getting out of breath easier, like panting when I do as little as walk up the stairs, and my chest seems to have this constant ache.

832,"I (25), an atheist, is currently in a relationship with my muslim boyfriend (25). I'm not that open about me being an atheist, very few people are aware of it. My boyfriend and I are together for almost 6 months now. Just before we started dating, I already told him about it. He handled it quite well, he said that I don't need to worry about it since even he doesn't obey all that's written in Qur'an. I'm cool with him being Muslim and I really love him.

His father side are the Muslims while those in his mother's are Christians. We asked him what will be his family's reaction if they knew about me being an atheist, he just said he don't know and they probably be shocked. One time, we were having dinner at his aunt's house and she asked me if I am willing to convert to Islam, I said ""I don't know"" and laughed while looking at my boyfriend and giving him a hint that I'm uncomfortable. Then when we got home, he told me that I should've not acted like that since I knew that his family are religious. I was confused for I know for a fact I did not do something wrong. Eventually we reconciled and just shrugged it off.

Recently we had a talk about marriage. I'm just a type of person that really plans my future and I want him to be a part of it. I told him that if we were about to be married, I will convert to Islam only for marriage but still remain agnostic and will not follow their religion's norms. He said it's fine but I should wear appropriate clothes (not showing shoulders or knees, we always have an argument about it) and if we have kids, they will follow the practices of Islam. I'm also cool with it (still thinking about the clothes part).

But I read that Muslim man are prohibited to marry an agnostic woman not marry a woman who only converted to Islam just for marriage. And I still don't know if he already told his family about my beliefs and if they will still accept me.

However, when I have a crush, I have an unrealistic representation of love. I recently talked to this guy. I found hints that he was emotionally manipulating me. He might have had narcissism.

However, I really liked talking to him and he was very goodlooking to me - he was my ideal type. I liked that he said romantic things, was energetic/lively, and he was great at flirting. I know he didn't care about me, but in my head, I still was thinking I had a chance of a relationship with him. He cared about looks a lot, and I thought if I look better-looking, he would have considered me.

834,"I’m a senior in high school about to turn 18. I’ve only ever dated two people; my first relationship lasted for four months and was incredibly toxic, while my second relationship lasted for over a year. but we never had sex or really did anything remotely sexual other than make out a few times, and I was always the one who initiated even that minimal level of intimacy. It was pretty much a close friendship tbh and it took me a while to realize that, at which point I finally broke it off.

This long-term quasi-relationship obviously kept me from getting experience in other places, since I’m no cheater. It also pretty much ruined my self-esteem, since it was coupled with a rejection by a girl I was really into only a month after I broke up with my long-term girlfriend. I had already felt ugly and unwanted on some level bc my ex hadn’t demonstrated any sexual interest even though we dated for a year, but this rejection really hammered it home.

now I’m about to turn 18 in June and I’m still a virgin, plus my self esteem has hit rock bottom and I’m really struggling to even imagine anyone wanting to have sex with me. I know I’m not an ugly person objectively, but I’m a very masculine lesbian, and it seems like other gay women only want femmes and think masculine lesbians are ugly or cringe. now this dumbass “show your wild side” trend is going around Instagram and all my friends are posting their body counts and how many people they’ve made out with, etc, and I’m feeling really embarrassed and insecure.

841,"Hello! When I was born my mother gave me two first names, one in Greek and one in English. My English name was put on my birth certificate because my mom felt I’d have an easier time in school using that one. However, at home I was always called by my Greek name, so as I’ve grown up I have felt way more attached to that one and identified with it more. As soon as I graduated high school, I stopped going by my English name and went by either my full Greek name or an abbreviated version of it. I use my legal name for nothing except official forms and areas where I have to. 

I would like to just legally switch my name over but would just like some advice and info from people who have done so, because I’m having a hard time gathering all the info about what I have to do online.

First, do I have to petition to change my name in the state I was born in, or can I do it where I live?
Is my reason for wanting the change considered good enough to be approved for it?
Around how much does it cost? I see mixed answers.
After it’s approved, what all do I have to do to get it changed on my social, birth certificate, etc? I assume I also need to call any utility services to change it? How is it handled with the IRS?

After I’ve done all that, is there anything else I need to do?

850,"Hi, thanks for clicking on my post.

To be brief: I am a 20 year old college student (currently a junior) who has never been able to get the hang of the college experience. For my first semester, I moved 9 hours away to my mom’s state. Mom was an abusive alcoholic, so after that semester I moved back home to go to county college for 3 semesters. After I graduated, I went to a university in-state, at which I am currently in my 2nd semester. I really struggled emotionally here because I live with my parents and it is at least 2.5 hours of commuting every day. I’ve had many mental breakdowns about how much I hate this new school, but since I’ll be a senior next year it’s too late for me to fully transfer. 

I always dreamed of going to a school in the Pacific Northwest, but because of financial restraints it couldn’t be done. Now, through my new school, I have the chance to go on exchange to a school in Oregon for a semester for the price of in state tuition. Think of it like study abroad, but within the US. I’ve wanted this for so long and I was accepted into the program and now it finally feels real.

As soon as I accepted it, I started feeling really anxious and worried that I’m making a bad decision. I don’t have the support of my dad, who is very angry and doesn’t understand why I want to go so far away. The way I see it, this is a really good chance for me to live somewhere I’ve always been curious about and finally get the proper college experience away from family and in a dorm room. I know it will be difficult and different from how I imagine it, but I feel like if I’ve wanted to live in the PNW for so long I should take this chance and run with it. Even if it’s a bad experience emotionally, I’ll walk away from it knowing more about the world by living in a new region. 

However, I also worry that I’m going to continue my legacy of being a perpetual transfer student, not at any school long enough to form lasting friendships. I was 100% sure I wanted to go until I got accepted and now I’m just worried that I’m making a mistake. I don’t have any real justification for this feeling other than a vague sense of dread and the fact that it means I’ll have to take a couple summer classes and that I will be paying for these last 2-3 semesters myself.

I would like to add that I am nearly a straight-A student so academics isn’t a concern here, it’s just a matter of my emotional/mental health and decision making skills. I think that underneath my anxiety this is likely to be a good experience, and my father and I don’t have the kind of relationship where I can trust his perspective, so I just wanted to ask an older adult on here if it sounds like this is a good idea and not as life-shattering as my family is making it out to be.

TL;DR I have the chance to live somewhere I’ve always wanted to and I’m afraid now that I’m actually able to do it. Just want to make sure I’m being smart about it and not being irresponsible, as my family disapproves.",10Apr2020,1

852,"Around 2010, I was playing Left4Dead by myself in my room. I was 10 years old. In the game, In the midst of playing and killing zombies, I heard a player on my team say 'hello'. Me, who was an outgoing, social, careless 10 year old girl, I turned on my shitty microphone to talk to this player. I let him know I had a mic by saying 'hello!' back. 

This player and I spoke in a casual one sided conversation for couple of minutes. Which by the way, this player I spoke to sounded like he was either in his 20's or was younger than that, he spoke perfect english, his gamertag was english so I'm assuming he was either american or canadian, since I played on a canadian server and am canadian. I dont know. 

I dont know his gamertag anymore. By the way. But only the 'Donut' part in his gamertag.  

Anyhoo,

While me and him were playing together, he brought up how I sounded...

 He asked if I was a girl or a boy. Which I dont blame him because all 10 year olds can sound the opposite of their sex. 

I told him I was a girl. Then that's where he suddenly changed his way of talking. 

He laughed and said 'Okay'. I asked him something that I dont really remember right now.. and this is the part where he said something and ended this one specific WORD on his sentence. The word that is really stuck with me till this day. The word that gradually caused me, throughout these years to HATE my voice. And be EMBARRASSED by my voice. 

He called me 'Buba'. 

As a person who was genetically born with HSP (my dad's side) -(Hyper Sensitive Person) and am very meek, I take this word 'Buba' as an insult. But it could mean anything, right? I researched it one time and it was some word that Africans use it on another person to call as a brother. But it could mean ANYTHING. My own cup is even called Buba!! (Literally.) But no, I took as an insult. I still take it as an insult. To me and to my voice. 

This word scarred me. I cant get over it just like that. Because I have troubles of speaking in real life. To the point I either just nod and shake my head. If I get peer pressured to talk- I'd just say dumb things. I'm 20 years old and I answer questions  like a shy toddler. 

Yes, It's this bad. 

Everytime I am in a game, either PubG or Sea of Thieves- and I hear other gamers talk. I immediately get pure anxiety. If i had my mic on, i would turn it off immediately or just stay complete silent throughout the whole game and breathe so quietly. Sometimes I hold my breath. 

And if I suddenly have this courage- 'just do it' feeling inside of me, to just turn on my mic and talk to these random gamers on my team- I always revert back to me suddenly thinking about: ''what if I sound ugly? What if they also call me Buba? Nah, I sound too ugly so I wont talk''. Then I would just go back to the silent shy me. 
 
I never really thought about this being a problem or never even realized this was a problem because as a kid back then, i purposefully overlooked this issue so I wont remember of how ugly I sound. 

No matter how many years I have contained this self conscious feeling inside me, to hide this ugly truth about my unattractive voice, it always gets activated and shuts me up immediately the moment I either grab my xbox microphone and my iPhone. Telling me to not talk! 

.

It's crazy. 

One word caused this. Of course i caused it too on the long road.

This problem I have is so bad. I dont even have friends or xbox friends anymore. 

I play alone all the time. I go out alone. I am alone. 

People always judge the outside. Our voice. Our tone. 

I just want a voice that I like. I seriously need help.

Thanks, Donut. Thanks, me.",10Apr2020,1

854,"My boyfriend isn’t happy and sometimes he’d point out that I don’t show that I care. I guess that’s the person I am, it’s hard to show my feelings, but I really do care, I write my feelings and I share them with him but in the end I’m still not supportive enough. Lately, I noticed that he doesn’t show his curiosity when I want to tell him about my days but he doesn’t ask (or shows he cares). Yet, I still ask him how he’s doing or about the stuff he loves to do, etc. And now I feel like I can’t take it anymore, I know he’s going through a rough time but by supporting I’m losing my mind. So now I’ve been avoiding him all day today, I just need space to think and now I’m questioning whether or not I still love him. He used to laugh at my stupid jokes and would leave me little surprises to come across. I miss him when he was happy, I just want him to be happy. I don’t want to give up on him but it’s very hard for me to keep pretending everything’s okay. What can I do?",10Apr2020,1
855,"Hi! I'm a 14 year old girl in dire need of advice.

A few years or so ago (honestly tried to forget so idrk when it was, I was about 11-12), we were watching Rick and Morty with my mom and stepdad (her husband of 4 years - my mom and dad are divorced, I spend half time with each parent).

We regularly massage each other's backs/feet/shoulders and it's considered ok in my household.

My stepdad was massaging my feet, moved up to my legs, and went all the way to my upper thigh. I was visibly squirming bc I'm a bit ticklish and because he was too close to my privates, which made me confused and uncomfortable.

We paused the tv bc my mom went to get some water. 

He leaned over to me, passed his fingers over my underwear, and told me that he could massage me there but I had to promise not to tell anyone. I was very scared and said no several times.

He proceeded to do it a few more times until my mom came, at which point he quickly moved his hand away and kept massaging my legs.

I cried for days, years later still feel uncomfortable with him because I now feel like he sees me in a sexual way, making me feel incredibly unsafe in my own home.

I felt terrible but knew that if i told my mom, i might cause problems for her - they love each other, and I'd hate to make my mom unhappy. I know that my dad would go straight for my step dad's neck if he knew about all this.

I want to tell my mom because I've kept it in for too long, and had a very rocky relationship with my stepdad for years - now, it's getting better but this is the only thing on my mind. I don't know for sure how anybody would react but the mere concept of anything drastic happening brings me to tears.

Please help me. I hate keeping secrets from my mom and don't want him to keep pretending that nothing happened.

I haven't had any income associated with my social security # since then, and I havent filed any tax returns since then....

857,"So I am a senior in high school and I have to make a decision about where I am going to college in the next couple weeks. I have narrowed it down to two schools. I should mention that my interests lie in design, technology, business, etc. I have no idea what I want to do as a major/career, but I do know that these are my interests. School A is in the Bay Area. It seems awesome, and their graduates seem to feed into all the big corporations (Google, Facebook, Tesla, etc.) which I am a huge fan of. School B is in Chicago. It seems like a good school, but I am very far above their GPA/SAT range (I am slightly above the GPA/SAT range for School A too). Their graduates do well too, just not as well as from School A. Because my grades are a lot higher, School B gave me a good scholarship. School B's cost of attendance would be around $33,000. School A also gave me a great scholarship, although being in the Bay Area is expensive, their final cost of attendance around $51,000. School A is my top choice. I would attend School B, but I wouldn't be nearly as excited about it. My parents have said they'd contribute around $40,000 (maybe I could get a little more?) and I would have to pay the rest (loans) if there is any remainder. It looks like no loans for School B (obviously) but small ($5k-$10k) loans for School A. I live in Virginia. Any advice? Thank you.

She doesn't have people around her she could be with. No friends nearby, a sucky family of an insensitive mom and a dad that's not caring enough and lives elsewhere nowadays. She herself has an eating disorder that has both anorexic and bulimic signs to it (not eating almost whatsoever and throwing up to the point she might actually get blood to come out). Recently there was an appearance of Russel's sign too. 

There has been times when she has felt very suicidal in the past, but I feel like this one is topping all of those, due to her being very depressed over the lockdown in UK due to the pandemic that's been around. 

She's not feeling needed and I can't be there for her. I'm sadly a minor, nor would I be able to just fly there whenever I want to.

I'm offering her my full support in any way possible, but I doubt she'll ask for any and I'm very scared of what might happen to her. She often doesn't reply to my messages properly either.

864,I never loved anyone I came from a broken home and I’ve been hurt my whole life I didn’t have a childhood and I never learned how to love I fell for this girl cause she made all my problems go away she was beautiful funny and cool I loved everything about her and I felt so happy being around her I was learning to love while in love I was with a girl for 5 years (year 2) it was a good going relationship still in my eyes I was wrong a at times because I’d cuss at her through text when she’d hurt me so she started telling lies to not get me mad and she became a liar (year 3) so we broke up for a while but still kept close contact and would practically act as if we’re dating but we wouldn’t see each Other in person we went a year without physical contact but I still remained loyal and (year 4) she started being out going and met new people and I saw her kiss a guy and confronted her about it and all she said was she was drunk so she felt bad (didn’t fall for it ) but I still stayed cause I loved her :( she said how sorry she was and I said can I see you to end things and she hung out with me the next day we talked and she cried in my lap then we became close again then she went on a trip with her family and when she came back her and the guy were closer then ever she saw him the day she came back and she started being shady and doing stuff with him and every time I’d ask if anything was going on she’d say no and I’d believe her cause I was already heartbroken by other things so one day he tweeted about it and I sent it to her and she blamed me for the reason why they had sex and (year 5) she kept me around while they were doing there thing and I stayed cause I loved her and while they dated she would still talk to me but not see me then all of a sudden I built up the courage to leave so I left for a month and ran in to her at a party and hugged her and the same night she called me and we talked and I talked about how good I was doing and we remained in contact for the next two days and she went ghost to be with him then months later in the summer she came and seen me we had this deep talk about us and she seemed like she still loved me so we hugged and I asked if she knew I loved her and she said yes (she still with the other guy this whole time ) and then I went home and she blocked me two days later on everything with no words or nothing and we haven’t talked since.... fast forward to (2 weeks ago) I don’t know how to move on I still love and care about her I tried to reach out when they broke up for a little but she didn’t answer I don’t know what to do I want her but I know she doesn’t want me she blocks and unblocked me on social media so many times and looks through my stuff and when they broke up she unblocked me on everything again it’s confusing I’m so hurt not just by the break up but life’s so hard I’ve been through a lot and I’m stuck on this girl cause she was my only break from everything I loved her a lot our break up didn’t even hurt her it’s like I never meant anything it makes me so sad,10Apr2020,1
865,"18m, currently not in school for obvious reasons. Long story short a few months ago I finally cut myself loose from an extremely toxic friend group and have gone a few months with very few friends. 

My question is, how do people make friends after highschool? What ways can you make friends online and irl?",10Apr2020,1
866,"I am an 18 year old dude and my friend who we will call Claire is one of my best friends. It has been a known fact within our friend group since freshmen year that Claire’s mom is batshit crazy. I could go very in depth but I’ll give a quick example: freshman year when Claire was 15 we were at a party, and her mom knew that she was drunk. Her mom was texting her paragraphs while my buddy and I were doing everything we could do to sober her up, but she was really drunk. We expected that Claire got yelled at on the way home, but found out the next day that her mom made Claire get in the drivers seat and DRIVE THEM HOME! Her mom definitely knew she was drunk, and did this as a “got ya!” , thankfully they made it home safe. Her mom definitely has some loose screws and it has been apparent to me since I met her. 

Anyway I’ll get to the point. I recently went on a trip to Claire’s family’s lake house with a few of our friends. We have known that Claire’s mom does crazy things like calling Claire every time she sees her location near a fast food shop, but I was shocked at what it was really like. At first, Claire’s mom would just text her paragraphs while we were at the dinner table about how she needs to not eat that much, she essentially wanted Claire eating a half-portion of everything, including beverages. Also, I should mention that the ‘paragraphs’ I’m talking about were texts the entire length of an iPhone screen with insane rambling and nonsensical anger. My friends and I didn’t see the texts until after dinner, when we were reading more insane paragraphs that she had texted after dinner, about how Claire didn’t tell us that we could eat on the deck (???). 

On these second morning, Claire received a loooong text from her mother and asked our female friend to come read it. I didn’t ask any questions about it, but for that entire day Claire absolutely refused to go upstairs and see her parents. She avoided them the entire day, Claire made us go up and pretend to get food for ourselves and give it to her. The third day, Claire’s mom yelled at her several times (not uncommon) about how she needed to stop eating. She searched our rooms and was not too upset about finding vodka bottles, but lost her shit over finding 7 granola bar wrappers under Claire’s bed. Claire’s dad is present, somewhat normal, and sometimes yells at his wife when she makes comments about Claire’s eating habits. However, he is unaware of the literal CONSTANT barrage of texts that Claire gets from her mother. I should also mention that it is commonplace for Claire’s mother to serve us all Taco Bell and pizza rolls for dinner, it’s not like she serves her daughter healthy food. 

Claire’s mother had anorexia as a teenager, I know this from Claire but I don’t know the extent of it or if she was treated ever. I believe that going to college next year will be extremely beneficial for Claire, but I’m extremely worried about her mother’s impact on her mental health. Claire is no doubt more athletic than most (her mom forces her to be), and she is all around very healthy. As a guy, and a stupid 18 year old, I really don’t know what I’m supposed to do to address this. I may not have expressed it well in this text post, but Claire has literally been psychologically abused for as long as I’ve known her. Can we please have some discussion and advice if you feel like you may know more about how to respond to this than me. All of our friends (including Claire) are as close and comfortable with each other as humanly possible, so bringing it up with Claire wouldn’t be an issue. We’ve talked to Claire about this issue a lot and we have talked to each other about what to do about it. If I didn’t provide enough info just mention in the comments, with Claire’s discretion in mind. 

tldr: My friend’s mother, who used to suffer from anorexia, acts like a nazi guard when her daughter eats food. Her mother sends paragraphs of text to her every day about her looks, athletic skills, and popularity, compared to the ‘mean girls’ group of girls in our grade.",10Apr2020,1

Anyways. we have gone on a date before quarantine. She JUST got out of a very bad relationship. shes scared. shes worried that's where this will go and or that I'll switch up on her if we start dating. right now we have no title. anyways.

I'm 20m for the record. we call on discord every night and well. According to her we have problems every time. They're never big, I dont even remember them most of the time. but this mainly started when I wasnt having a good night, didnt really wanna talk about it and she was nice and giving me space but when we were saying gn I accidentally hung up early and cut her off.

I felt horrible and wanted to rejoin but just couldn't, I was embarrassed. she stayed in the call for a while too, I watched. so instead I texted her that I was sorry and it was an accident. she left me on read. we talked about it the next day. she said we shouldnt be anything more than friends. but we're still acting like a couple.

so two nights ago, my mind started wandering and said yo shes just w you like this bc shes lonely, and I told her, I reassured her I was telling her bc I trust her, it upset her a little, but I did it to let her know that those little intrusive thoughts won't make me doubt her. 

Last night, we had a conversation about how she was going to be drinking today. I have a very bad history w alcohol so I was a little worried but I trust her to take care of herself so it wasnt a huge problem if at all for me. but she took my initial hesitation as lack of trust that she could be safe. we moved past that and she said one of her brothers friends might bring edibles. I told her about my bad past w marijuana and once again told her, I trusted her. and that I know she'll be fine and it won't become a coping mechanism. 

At the end of that night. She texted me and told me I cut her off again. she told me she felt like we had an argument every night, I dont consider these arguments. but this morning she said everything was okay, genuinely. and now I'm just scared theres a rift between us. only time will tell. advice??

at first they'd call me and tell me there's no work, but then they stopped so I called in the next day I was scheduled to work and the lady had said they'd call if there was any work for us. yesterday I was called in, but no one called me today so I assumed there was no work. I called twice but no one picked up, so that just made me assume more that I wasn't supposed to go in today. 

20 minutes after my normal shift would start, I got a call from a supervisor saying I was scheduled to work and it would count as a no call no show earning me a total of 4 points and asked if I would come in. I already told my ride that I hadn't gotten a call so I guess I wasn't supposed to go in and I told her that, but she said yep it'll count as a no call no show despite the fact I called twice and no one picked up.

872,"Hi, 

I'm 18F and currently in my first year of university, however it's been terrible. I live on my own (because of a bad childhood with abusive parents) and live from welfare, which is about half of what a working person in a normal paying job would earn. It's difficult to make ends meet, and getting good grades is an important condition to keep my welfare, which puts me under a lot of pressure because I have zero point zero motivation for my study anymore at the moment. So I have been contemplating between taking a gap year after this year to work and then start studying again and working part time after that, between studying and working part time right away, or between living a miserable life for the next 5-6 years, keeping my welfare and then start working after graduating.

Instinctively, I really want to take a gap year, because I'm just sick of it all and I'm stressed out at the moment, but then it will probably take a long time, perhaps 10 years or longer to graduate. However I'm sure that I will relapse into depression if I keep studying. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",10Apr2020,1
873,"I work at a locally owned international grocery store, and from the beginning of the scare surrounding covid 19, my employers have not taken it very seriously. the store manager thinks that everyone is overreacting. The owners never had the store fully disinfected. Over half of the workers still don’t have any masks, even though a significant majority of customers have them. The state has issued the order to allow only x amount of people inside the store at a time, but all that’s been done regarding the order is a sign put up at the entrance. There is no one to enforce the limit though, and I know that, throughout the day, the number of people inside the store exceeds the number allowed. This Sunday, Easter, we are the only store in the area, that I know of, that is open, and I’m genuinely concerned about the number of people that will be here. I do get anxious easily, so I don’t know what part of my concerns should’ve taken seriously. It just feels like the owners care more about their money than they do about their workers. I get that it’s not easy to just shut the store down or keep track of how many people are inside at a time. I don’t feel safe though. It’s not like there’s a hundred people at a time in there but there’s already at least 15 workers in the store at any given time so I know when I see a dozen people in front of me in produce I start panicking.

878,"i'm posting on a throwaway acc so no one i know is able to find out its me. my bf and i have been dating for almost a year now and everything has been fine and dandy for the most part. i had only been out of my old abusive relationship for a year so i was (and am) still healing from the trauma i endured and my current bf was nice and understanding about the whole situation. anyways, ever since the whole quarantine thing my bf hasn't been acting the same and even before our county went into quarantine something was up. i asked him a few times what it was about and if everything was alright and he says it was but i knew something was up. 

here's why i think he's falling out of love:
1. every time i tell him i love him or something cute he just stops responding. like, we could have a normal conversation and then all of a sudden i tell him i love him he just stops responding
2. although we live in the same county we're technically long distance because he's away at college and i'm still in high school and usually we discord chat almost every week but lately for the past 3 months or so it has maybe been once a month sometimes not even once a month and i guess that just hurts
3. i get that he's a boy but i feel as if sometimes he brushes me off to play video games which is fine because sometimes i do the same but it's been more often and almost every day to the point that i feel unwanted 
4. with that i feel as if i can't consider him a safe space anymore. i barely ever talk to him about what's going on because he barely answers and he barely tells me what's going on in his life so it seems as if we're complete strangers at this point and we're almost a year in

i know that high school sweethearts usually don't last and our age gap seems ""inappropriate"" (i promise it's legal in our state for us to be dating) but i'm most of the time genuinely happy in our relationship, it's just this past few months have really upset me and i'm not sure what to say to him or do in this situation because i've only had one relationship before him.

881,"Me, my mom (53F) and my step-dad have been staying home very strictly for the past 27 days in New York State (the state hit hardest by COVID-19 so far) and have been doing a really good job not going out at all, we have a lot of groceries. My parents were self-employed as private house cleaners but shut that down when the pandemic picked up around March 13. We are all fortunate that we are not sick and that we have the money to be able to stay home for a few months and be fine.

He told us today that he has been talking to a job over email and they want him for working in the manufacturing field (not sure the exact position, but he used to work for IBM for many years before the layoffs started early last decade so he has a history in that area) and he said yes. I was shocked because we do not need jobs right now, we 3 have been trying to preserve our health and prevent the spread in our community by staying home. We DO NOT need the money and my mom is telling him this, that we can stay home through the summer if we needed to.

He (61yrs old) has a bad medical history. He has had a heart attack (2012) and has 8 heart stents. He has high blood pressure and takes medication for that. He has coronary artery disease. He smoked for 30+ years before quitting in 2013. He has had double pneumonia and bronchitis multiple times in the past 15 years. He's been my stepdad for 8 years this month.

My mom (53 yrs old) is somewhat healthy, but also smoked on and off for many years. She had Lyme disease which may make her at least slightly immune-compromised, and she has insomnia, which has also weakened her immune system in the past. Luckily, I (27M) am healthy other than slightly elevated cholesterol.

When he first mentioned it he kept saying ""the economy has to open up again eventually"" and spouting other Fox News talking points about how the economy being closed will hurt us more than the pandemic, which may be true after many months, but not after only 27 days of lockdown when NYS is about to break 800 deaths per day. He has noted that the hospitalization rate is going down and taken that as a sign that it's okay to attempt to resume his normal life soon.

He is very stir-crazy and has cabin fever and finds it very hard to stay home. My mom and I do not have any trouble with this lockdown. My mom and step-dad's relationship is strained and they don't communicate very well and it usually devolves into an argument or blaming.

I am so afraid he can't be stopped, I'm afraid he's going to bring this virus home to us and potentially kill himself and potentially kill my mother and infect me, completely unnecessarily. We are so fortunate to be a middle-class family that can financially survive this without putting each other at risk and he's squandering it.

What can I say to confront this issue while maintaining a physically and emotionally healthy home environment during this stressful time?

**TL;DR: My step-dad with multiple comorbidities is trying to get a new job during a pandemic when it's completely unnecessary, potentially risking our entire family's health for no real reason.**",10Apr2020,1

883,"Most of the time I just feel indifferent towards everything. I do have emotions but I don’t feel them as intensely. It’s like I feel a hint if it. There are times where I do feel strongly but it doesn’t happen often. Sometimes I even have trouble identifying how I’m feeling because I can’t tell. 

Sometimes when I do express an emotion, I feel like I come across as a robot because it doesn’t feel genuine or I just feel really hollow inside. An example of this would be when I’m laughing. I’m laughing because I found the joke funny but I don’t feel joy or anything. I should feel something right? But it don’t. It’s not there. I’m just doing an action. It’s quite a weird thing to experience. 

So because of this, I tend to keep myself neutral. I only react/express myself when I feel strongly. 

I used to feel much more but it’s like my emotions have gradually dimmed over time. Is this normal?",10Apr2020,1

When I was younger I really enjoyed eating my family’s cooking and the traditional meals they would make. Over time as I have gotten older I have come to realize that the way that the food is prepared beforehand is not sanitary or clean and it has grossed me out. On top of that, no one in my immediate family believes in storing left overs properly after it’s cooled down and that has also grossed me out because of the amount of bacterial growth that will grow on the food. They will literally leave cooked food on the stove in the same pot for 24 hrs and either still eat it or go and offer it to someone In the family “so it doesn’t go to waste.” I am frustrated because first, we don’t live together and during this quarantine my mom has been bringing me the left over dinners they make almost every day or every other day. When I say no it’s okay, I have plenty of food and no room in my refrigerator, she will push and will not take no for an answer!! It’s not only her pushing it’s her and my grandmother, god forbid I don’t want their food because now I’m a troubled and rebellious girl lol. She will say stuff like it’s so that you don’t have to cook today or make me feel like I’m being disrespectful and rude. After, I am left to find a place to store the food or responsible for cleaning the dish. Not only is the food thing frustrating but she is also completely ignoring the fact that she can’t visit me? She isn’t one to just put food outside my door she HAS to see me and talk to me. Ugh!!!! Any advice?",10Apr2020,1
885,"[Before the quarantine]
I'll start by saying that I feel I'm way behind on the ""growing up"" thing. I'm 18f, but I've never had a job, can't drive, can't go out on my own, and it's not my choice. My parents have been pretty overprotective my whole life and I'm getting sick of it. They refuse to teach me how to drive, ""threaten"" me by making me take the bus, but won't let me take the bus. They also constantly joke about me being 14-16. 

[Somewhat related] For my birthday last year, I wanted singing lessons because that's just something I've wanted for a long time. They agreed at first. They bought one class which was breathing exercises. They didn't want to get me another because of college expenses and I understood. I really wanted to save up to afford more lessons but job hunting has been difficult. 

My dad has a business and I translate their emails, unpaid. I've asked my dad to give me an official job but he never did. When I asked to be paid for the email work I do, I got yelled at because this is a family business and I shouldn't be expecting money. When I tell them job hunting is hard they tell me not to get a job, what do you need a job for, or what do I need money for. My parents also made it a point that if I get a job, it'll affect their taxes and they don't want that. Should I get a job anyway?",10Apr2020,1
886,"Hi, first time posting on reddit, I don't know where else to ask.

I am a father of 3 children 24 year old guy, 21 year old girl, and 18 year old girl. I love all of them with my full heart. My 24 year old went to trade school to be an electrician which I fully paid since it cost around 10% of a college education. My 21 year old attended a local college with partial scholarship which I helped her with. Now my 17 year old would like to attend college.

She would like to attend an out of state college to study communications. But she can not get a scholarship due to her GPA so she would have to pay full price plus extra for being out of state. She expects me to pay for all of it including rent in a very expensive city.

Now I can scrape together just enough but my wife and I would have to live on fried rice and eggs. But, I do not think the education is worth it. Communications is a low value major where you can go into most jobs with any kind of college degree and you do not necessarily need to major in communications. I tried to explain to her that by choosing that degree she is following a passion rather than choosing a career path that may provide the best support for her life after college.

After I said this, she flipped out at me calling me a sexist for not letting her go after her career path and stating that unlike the boomer that I am she cares more about living life to the fullest and not destroying the planed rather than money. To which, I said 'Great to hear then you don't mind me not paying for your college tuition'. After this she refused to talk to me for a few days and started saying 'Bernie will get rid of my student loans, I don't care I' ll move out of this toxic family and never call you again!'. I was deeply hurt by this and wanted to sit down and talk to her with the whole family.

After refusing to talk to me, I had a conversation with my wife who told me that my daughter was going around telling her friends that I am forcing her to be a stay at home uneducated family woman to fulfill my sexist fantasies. I told my wife what happened and she told me that I should let her make life choices and not force her into things she doesn't want. 

Then we both sat down with my daughter and my wife to explain the situation. I told her that if she would like to persue a career at that college in communications she is free to do it, I've never said otherwise, I just don't want to spend a large portion of my savings on a way too expensive college in a field that will never make back the money she spent on it. My wife advised me to just pay her tuition even if we may have to live worse for a couple of year. I suggested to my daughter to pick a local college or go to community college for a yea ror two while getting a scholarship to the out of state college. 

She didn't want to waste her time rotting away in this dump of a town and said she will do take out student loans to attend college in the out of state university since Bernie would pay it back anyway. To which we all said sure it is settled then. 

Cut to today, my daughter is crying all day and telling my wife that I will have to pay her tuitions because she doesn't want to get trapped in debt. My wife then comes to me saying that either we pay my daughter's tuition or we are losing out child. I've been out of work for a 2 weeks until COVID-19 is dealt with and without consistent work I can not commit to paying someone's tuition fees until I'm solidly back to work. She said it was fine and not to worry about it. I replied stating that to pay it I would need to reach into my retirement fund or she would have to get a job after which she told me she wouldn't get a job and to stop acting selfish.

I don't want to lose my family but I can't pay a third of my salary just to make one of my children happy.",10Apr2020,1

888,"So when I was a kid, my mum always had family around. We were all very close. 

Turns out my auntie was into drugs. My sister had gotten into my aunties purse, whilst she was babysitting her, and taken an ecstasy tablet. She nearly died, and my auntie wouldn’t admit what it was my sister had taken. 

Eventually it came out that it was E and my sister was fine, we consider ourselves lucky. She’s grown up to be a very intelligent and healthy young lady. 

My mum tried to keep the family together but the family eventually fell apart after that. We never saw my nana (who left us because she believed the drug addict aunt needed her more than her grandchildren needed her) and we never saw my aunt for about 14 years (still haven’t seen them to this day!). 

My sister didn’t know until last year what had happened to her when she got the medical records. It hit her really hard, and she has struggled to deal with the information. 

We got a phone call on Boxing Day. Turns out the nana has terminal cancer, and it is unknown how long she has left. The aunt asked for my mum to contact her. 

We tried to convince her not to contact her, and she didn’t. She seemed shaken up by the news that her mum is dying, but I think it is hard to get too involved with someone who completely walked out of your life around 14 years ago. 

Life continued as normal. A couple of days ago we got another message asking for my mum to contact my aunt. The nana is now basically on her death bed and could go at any minute. 

This might sound horrible, but to me she is not my nana. I think it’s really sad that she is dying and I am so sorry for her, but she isn’t my family. I’m not willing to get involved with that side of the family again after everything that happened. It is too much for me and I believe it is too much for my sister too. 

We found out my mum has been speaking to the aunt in secret. I understand I can’t force her to stop speaking to her sister, however I’m really not comfortable with it. 

How do I continue to have a relationship with my mum if she starts to be involved with that side of the family again? 

Are my feelings about the situation unreasonable?",10Apr2020,1
889,"So I assume everyone has had this problem before. So here’s my background, I have downstairs neighbors who constantly smoke indoors and outside their apartment unit. These neighbors are extremely loud and inconsiderate all the time and constantly have 4-5 cars coming and going and parking in other assigned spots, leaving trash everywhere, blocking my parking spot and just in general being rude b-holes. They will smoke with their children inside in their bedroom which is right below ours and we can no longer even open our window. Now here comes the part where I need advice. My partner and i smoke marijuana in our bathroom, with the fan on constantly (we live in Oregon). There is also nobody above us and the bathroom is not near any windows. I do not notice the smell after we have smoked and neither has anyone visiting us and we make sure to vacuum and mop and clean very regularly. Also please don’t judge but we also have a cat not reported on the lease (he’s a very polite good kitty and we got him right before being laid off so no money to pay pet deposit) and we are late on rent due to the ‘rona. I am worried the neighbors will try to retaliate and it will cause more problems for us but I can not stand the smell anymore and we can’t even open our windows and it’s HOT.

I never loved anyone I came from a broken home and I’ve been hurt my whole life I didn’t have a childhood and I never learned how to love I fell for this girl cause she made all my problems go away she was beautiful funny and cool I loved everything about her and I felt so happy being around her I was learning to love while in love I was with a girl for 5 years (year 2) it was a good going relationship still in my eyes I was wrong a at times because I’d cuss at her through text when she’d hurt me so she started telling lies to not get me mad and she became a liar (year 3) so we broke up for a while but still kept close contact and would practically act as if we’re dating but we wouldn’t see each Other in person we went a year without physical contact but I still remained loyal and (year 4) she started being out going and met new people and I saw her kiss a guy and confronted her about it and all she said was she was drunk so she felt bad (didn’t fall for it ) but I still stayed cause I loved her :( she said how sorry she was and I said can I see you to end things and she hung out with me the next day we talked and she cried in my lap then we became close again 


then she went on a trip with her family and when she came back her and the guy were closer then ever she saw him the day she came back and she started being shady and doing stuff with him and every time I’d ask if anything was going on she’d say no and I’d believe her cause I was already heartbroken by other things so one day he tweeted about it and I sent it to her and she blamed me for the reason why they had sex and (year 5) she kept me around while they were doing there thing and I stayed cause I loved her and while they dated she would still talk to me but not see me then all of a sudden I built up the courage to leave so I left for a month and ran in to her at a party and hugged her and the same night she called me and we talked and I talked about how good I was doing and we remained in contact for the next two days and she went ghost to be with him then months later in the summer she came and seen me we had this deep talk about us and she seemed like she still loved me so we hugged and I asked if she knew I loved her and she said yes (she still with the other guy this whole time ) and then I went home and she blocked me two days later on everything with no words or nothing and we haven’t talked since.... fast forward to (2 weeks ago) I don’t know how to move on I still love and care about her I tried to reach out when they broke up for a little but she didn’t answer I don’t know what to do I want her but I know she doesn’t want me she blocks and unblocked me on social media so many times and looks through my stuff and when they broke up she unblocked me on everything again it’s confusing I’m so hurt not just by the break up but life’s so hard I’ve been through a lot and I’m stuck on this girl cause she was my only break from everything I loved her a lot our break up didn’t even hurt her it’s like I never meant anything it makes me so sad",10Apr2020,1
892,"Alright y’all hold on for this ride. Here’s some drama to help you get through quarantine. So back in July 2019 I really needed to find some roommates for a place to live. I found 2 people on a college class page. I graduated in 2019. One is a female junior &amp; one is a freshman (he’s a gay male to put the picture in prospective). I did not really know either of them but it seemed like it would be fine ya know. I was really in a pickle &amp; needed somewhere ASAP. My living plans had fell through. I saw the first red flag when I had to spot my roommate (the girl) $1,000 to pay her first months rent &amp; deposit bc she didn’t have the money but again I needed someone to move in. It took her almost 6 months of me being on her ass like “hey I need that money” “do you have the money” “what’s going on”. She works part-time at Lowe’s and calls in all the time. So we have now lived together almost 8 months &amp; more often than not she gives the rent to me late because she has to scramble to find the money. I get it being in college &amp; supporting yourself is hard but... it’s apart of life ya know? Now here comes the next part. I’m an idiot, the biggest idiot, trust me I know. So I get paid cash at my job (nanny). For multiple months I was saving half of my cash. I had around $4,000 saved. Until one day I looked and it was just gone. It wasn’t out in the open, but wasn’t hard to find. Yes I know I should of put it in the bank but out of sight out of mind? Haha. So $4,000 gets stolen. Obviously my first thoughts is my roommate. I told the boy about it bc I did not at all suspect him, he and I are pretty good friends. I said dude literally last month she was talking about how she wasn’t going to be able to go to school next semester because she owed thousands of dollars from this semester. The girl roommate also drives him crazy. I got them both together and was like ok look this disappeared out of room do you know anything? Obviously they “didn’t.” I said that I was going to file a police report &amp; obvi give them their names if they asked. My girl roommate freaked out a bit bc she is already on probation. Apparently she got pulled over and the cop found “crumbs” of weed in her car. She got 2 years probation so that doesn’t add up to me? Anyway she said she was worried bc she was on probation. I said 🤷🏻‍♀️ filed the police report. After filing I never heard from the police report. I had pretty much lost hope but was holding on to anything. During this time we also had a sketch maintance man that had been in our house alone a few times (lockbox for key.) after filing the police report in February &amp; talking to my housing company there was nothing further done. Fast forward to this month. Typically I don’t spend a lot of time at home. I was working full time previously so would just be at home max 3 nights a week to come home at like 7 &amp; go to sleep (stay at my boyfriends a lot.) since this quarantine I’ve been at my boyfriends 95% of the time. When I was home lost neither roommate was home. I went upstairs to find my roommates cat and I looked in my roommates room (girl) and saw my bra on her bed. I knew this was mine 100%. And tbh I rarely wear real bras =never wash them. So it wasn’t mixed in laundry or something. She had to of gotten out of my room. I texted my male roommate about it and he told me a few days before he had gone in her room because she uses his towels, and there was a pair of his underwear on her floor. And they were floods.... Rewind to September my boss gave me a $100 visa gift card. I was planning to give this to my friend  last week because I owed her money but I couldn’t find the card. I lose shit all the time so this wasn’t anything new. When I was home yesterday I got this hunch... and I know I’m terrible for it but I went into her room again. And wow long and behold there was the packaging to my gift card and the receipt with everything INCLUDING MY NAME. Obviously the card was gone. I was fummmming. I honestly had no idea what to freaking do. I called my other roommate and he was like no way dude, she had to of been the one who stole the $4,000!. Neither roommate was at home. they are both supposed to be back Sunday.like I said I am not staying at home currently. I hate confrontation so so much.... so I wrote her a letter &amp; put it on the fridge. I know I should of called her or idk something but ah this is just to wild. I called the police station and filed another report &amp; gave them all her information. And I told her that I find it so hard to believe that she didn’t take the $4,000. I tried to scare her and I said that the envelopes that had all the money in them still remain where they were (person took the money out of the envelopes &amp; left them) and that i May be able to get fingerprints off them. She hasn’t been home yet to see my letter and gah idk what’s going to happen. Help",10Apr2020,1
893,"Hey everybody! Thank you all for the comments on my previous post, but in this post I have a new problem. For everyone who didn’t see my last post I’ll summarize it for you. Scroll pst the next paragraph if you have already.

     When the Nintendo switch released, I (now 14 m) decided to buy it with my own money. From then all the way to about a month ago I bought all the games on it with my own money (and with occasional gifts). But recently when the new animal crossing game released, my sister (15) wanted to get it on my switch so she could play it. I let her because I’m nice like that, but problems quickly arose. Whenever she would play it she would use my controller and get grease all over it from the chips she was eating. Because of this I showed her how to take the switch out of the dock and play in handheld mode. She usually played in handheld mode on the couch near the tv, but as of recently she started taking it into her room more frequently. Around the same time I put my switch in my room, so it was more convenient for me to use discord with my friends and play smash, but when my sister wanted to play animal crossing she just barged into my room without knocking and demanding for it even if I was in a meeting with my teacher. She eventually started using it more than me, but whenever I went into her room to ask if I could use it after I finished my homework, she would just say no. I even brought up the fact that it’s my switch but she would keep saying “I paid for the game so I should be able to play it.” I agree with that statement, but if she’s been using it all day and I want to use it for a bit, I should be able to. This is when I made that post I was talking about earlier and everyone seemed to agree with me that I should be able to use it when I want.

Recently (as in an hour ago) I was doing my homework and when I finished I decided to play smash bros on my switch. I asked my sister if I could use it and she just flat out refused me, again, and told me to go away. I walked away from her and towards the door and I told her to give it to me or else I would evict her favorite villager (and at the time that was supposed to be a joke and I don’t even know how to do that). Then she said that she was sorry and slid my switch across the floor, screen down. I picked it up and noticed a crack on the screen which I thought was from her sliding it across the floor, since I’ve never seen it before. I told her about it and she just said “cool bye”. I got pretty upset for obvious reasons and I asked her to give me 10 dollars to help fix the screen. Like she does most of the time, she just refused. What can I do to get her to give me the 10 dollars?",10Apr2020,1

898,"Hey everyone! I hope all of you are safe and healthy at the moment. As the title implies, I(22M) would like to see if there's anything there with someone I like. We were in a few theatre classes together in high school and I always thought she was a very attractive person, but my immaturity and shyness kept me from making an effort. Currently, she is in her senior year of university, while I am about a year out of college and looking to apply to some masters programs for sometime in 2021. Due to the stay-at-home orders in my state, she is now back home from school. I realize that with her being a senior, this may be my final opportunity to put myself out there for her before she moves far away.

   In terms of how she felt about me- I may just have been naive or seeing things the wrong way but I believe she might have made a few flirty attempts with me, although she's friendly with everyone in general. On time she said something to the effect of ""keep growing your beard bc it looks good on you"" while putting a hand on my face. The most recent time we interacted was when I came back on senior night for high school theatre at the end of my freshman year of college and her senior year of high school. When she saw me, she hugged me a lot and seemed like she wanted to have a conversation but I'm not sure.

   The problem lies in the fact that I haven't spoken/communicated with her for many years. I'm sure she'd recognize my name and face, but I'm not sure what else besides that. I also have her Snapchat( and no other form of communication), but I wouldn't want to appear creepy by sending her any old message out of the blue.

   So I have to ask- should I even do this first of all? I wouldn't want to appear creepy or weird, especially since I haven't communicated with her for so long. If you do think I should do it, what steps should I take and what sort of approach should I go with? I really wouldn't want to mess this up.

I [21 y/o, FtM] suffer from depression, PTSD and (social) anxiety and have been in a relationship with him for over 2 years now. He generally treats me well, cares for me and supports me but it becomes more frequent that the way he talks to me during a discussion/fight, behaves and touches me, also in day to day life, causes me to have major flashbacks and triggers me into a panic attack or even causes me to fear him in those moments as my brain somehow compares him to my parents and my uncle (people who seperately abused me). I started hurting myself again, I feel myself slipping into a major down again.

I know he isn't like my parents nor my uncle. I go to therapy and work on my trauma and how it affects me in daily life. But I start to worry that this situation isn't healthy for me. That those incidents set me back in my progress over and over again. That I won't be able to heal while being with him.

I talked with him about this already on multiple occassions. Told him what exactly triggers me and that I try to fight against it but he could try too to not get loud or personal/insulting during fights. Nothing changes.
I also mentioned it to my therapist but he doesn't give me advice regarding this situation.

Can anyone help me? Give me advice on what to do? Should I break up for my own sake and hope that it will help me heal? Continue this way and hope therapy helps me even with those incidents?

Feel free to ask more questions if you need clarification. I would love to get some perspective on this since I don't know what to do anymore.",10Apr2020,1
907,"Some of my former friends betrayed me and I reacted with all of my pent up anger, and that’s all I can really say. A lot of people turned their backs on me, and I realized a lot of my friends were only there in fair weather. My former roommate doesn’t even want to associate with me anymore. A lot of people still talk behind my back and when they see me in public (small town), they turn away from me. Some people have forgiven me knowing who I truly am, but that’s the few. What I did didn’t hurt anyone, but it ruined my very good reputation, got me kicked out of college, evicted, and left me jobless. I turned to the life I did because I was insecure and unhappy, and I assumed I’d never get caught. People thought I was weak, so I put up a front like I was hard. I figured people would respect me doing what I was doing. If I never got caught, I thought I’d have the resources to escape the life I hated. I was supporting myself on my own, but I was doing what I thought would make my parents happy. I still have some real friends who keep in touch, but I can’t bring myself to talk to them. I never check my phone because I find too much comfort in being alone. Anytime I go out to town for groceries or whatever, my anxiety overtakes me. I’m always looking over my back, and I don’t even know what I’d do if I saw some of the people who betrayed me. I know the only thing I can do myself is keep working and keep striving to be better, but I get caught up in my own failures before I even start toward new goals. I’ve changed for the better, but my mind is still so weak and my anxiety drives so many of my decisions. I’ve told my parents (before COVID-19) that I wanted to see a therapist, but they guided me to talk to their pastor instead.

# My cousins probation

📷

Last summer, my little cousin got arrested in New Jersey for a bullshit marijuana offense. Long story short, at his court date back in January, because it was his first offense ever, he got entered into the conditional discharge program, for 6 months. It’s basically a really low level of probation for first time drug offenders. The conditions are he keeps out of trouble and he’s subject to random drug testing. Anyway, originally he had to submit for a drug test, and sign an agreement to abide to the rules of the program, by April 15th. He made an appointment for the third week of March. With everything that’s been going on with the coronavirus, he received a letter from the court saying that the deadline has been pushed to the end of April. After speaking with his probation officer on the phone to confirm, he was told that he could submit the results of the pee test, and the signed statement, online through the officers email. So he got a test done with his doctor, and did just that. This was about a week and a half ago. The officer did not respond, so he sent the email again, as well as called his office. Again, no response. He’s been calling everyday because he’s trying to get confirmation that the test was valid. He tried calling the NJ courts, but no one is there. He is very worried that he’ll be held in contempt of court. He doesn’t know if he should go to his scheduled End of April appointment, just Incase. The court has not sent out any notification to him whatsoever, and he has no way to contact anyone in the courts. He has left voice messages, and he has even called different departments. What happens in a situation like this ? I know obviously he’s still on probation till his CD ends in July, but he’s paranoid as fuck that they’ll try to screw him or something. Should he do anything ? He tried calling his attorney but unfortunately the law firm he has retained the services of, sucks major and doesn’t return his phone calls. Id appreciate any advice so I can tell him to calm the hell down Lol. I’d tell him to just smoke a blunt and chill but obviously he can’t do that 😂. Thanks people",10Apr2020,1
911,"I used to study for a few hours a day, and complete schoolwork on time. I used to partake in my hobbies / passions such as music and computer programming. 
Now, I play video games for most of the day, or watch YouTube, or Netflix. I've become very lazy during the quarantine, and I've been ignoring most of my online schoolwork. My days are just me trying to pass the time, even though I have much better things to pass the time with. Throughout the day I constantly think ""I should be doing my homework"" or ""I haven't played any music in a few days, I should do that"". However I don't take any action because there is a much stronger thought telling me that continuing to watch the 100th YouTube video of the day is *easier* to do. I have only done 10% of the online homework so far that I was supposed to finish a week ago. Each day, the virtual 'pile' of classwork increases, becoming more overwhelming, giving me more reason to procrastinate on it because its much more effort now. I used to create lots of 'code projects' and learn about new concepts - it was *fun*. Now I resort to *more fun* and *easier*
things, which are much less useful or productivity.

913,"We just had a college take home physics exam in which several students uploaded parts of the exam to chegg in order to get the answers. My school has recently threatened to start an academic integrity case against all these people. Many of us didn't directly use the posted pictures, but instead looked up the questions on chegg independently (to find pre-existing versions of the questions and what not). Our school claims to be working with chegg right now and is potentially threatening all the chegg users (they didn't specify that punishment would only be for the uploaders).. My account has no name associated with it besides the one used for billing information. The name on the payment info would likely be enough to link the account to me. I'm wondering if anyone has had a similar situation and/or knows if Chegg will give up the name on the payment cards that the ""anonymous"" accounts are payed for by. Also, does Chegg know which questions certain accounts have viewed/visited and at what times? Knowing the answers to these questions will strongly guide my course of action (the school offered a way out of getting the case but it is an absolute last resort).

914,"My friend “Liz” has a child in elementary school. She recently made a “joke” Facebook post telling teachers to mind their own business if her kid starts flinching at raised hands after going back to school. Liz has also said on other occasions that children only grow up right if they’re beaten and that her parents did it to her so she does it to her child. I’ve never seen her hit the kid, but this seems like solid enough evidence that it’s happening at least semi-frequently. This recent Facebook post is especially worrying, as we’re all in the middle of quarantine and she’s with her child 24/7. In general, Liz is not a great parent at times (she did coke at her kid’s birthday party, for example), and I’m also concerned because she just told me she’s pregnant with her 2nd child.

I’m not sure that calling CPS would be the right thing to do though, especially as I’ve personally had a really terrible time with them as a victim of abuse when I was younger. I’ve asked my friends about this and one of the points that was brought up was that intervention might lead to more abuse, which was certainly true in my case. Another friend also said that CPS might contact Liz’s family, who probably wouldn’t be super helpful, since I think they agree with this kind of upbringing. I genuinely have no idea what would happen if I did alert the authorities. I feel bad because it seems like she loves her kid a lot, and the kid loves her too.

Our original plan was to move out at the end of April, and we are trying to stick with that original plan, because due to the pandemic, we’ve both lost our jobs and can’t afford to stay where we are much longer. 

The original plan was to drive cross-country. We booked a Pod to hold most of our stuff and the remainder (irreplaceable valuables) would be coming in the car with us. We would pack non-perishables and eat only in the car, avoid rest stops, avoid driving through “hot spot” areas, and we figured hotels would hopefully be relatively empty (we have one more tub of Clorox wipes we would use to prep the 3-4 hotel rooms we will have to stay in). I would also like to mention we also have our furbaby (cat) that we will be bringing along with us too.

This was our original plan until yesterday, my fiancee’s parents so generously offered to ship our car and have us fly to our new home to make it easier on us. There are no direct flights, unfortunately, so we would have one layover. Three airports, two planes. 

There are many factors to consider in either scenario and we are having a really difficult time determining which approach is really the lesser of two evils and need some help!

930,"So, my brothers (21M, 17M) and I (23F) all mostly live at home. 21M and I live near our colleges during the semester and are home for breaks, though, and 17M has been in and out of juvenile hall and various camps run by the Department of Juvenile Justice for awhile, his most recent stay being 9 months, so we're usually not all home at the same time.  This has changed recently, since our colleges went to online at about the same time 17M was released. 

This brings us to the issue of the internet. The internet is bad here. It used to be fine, but after then 15M started sneaking out, our parents put up motion-activated cameras at points he would leave from to catch him in the act. These needed wifi to work, and he would just unplug the internet to disable them, so they moved the router to a locked cabinet. The wifi is MUCH worse with its current placement. It's significantly slower, and it doesn't work from my room at all, so I'm doing all of my homework from the kitchen table. 

I have ADHD and while I am medicated, medication doesn't fix everything, so I'm having difficulties focusing when I have to do my homework in a common space. The internet speeds are also getting in the way of effectively getting things done even if I could focus well. While how bad it is varies, at its worst it can take 10 minutes to load a page. I'm trying to get everything done and keep my grades up. I'm at least \*trying\* to do school stuff from about 9:30-10:30 am to about 3 am every day, though admittedly, I do get distracted easily and I am taking breaks (5 minute break for 25 minutes work, then 4 of those before getting a 25 minute break). This is driving me nuts and I know it'd be so much easier if the internet was working properly. It's worth noting that 21M's room is right above the router, so it works in his room but it's slow, so he found a way to get an ethernet cable through the roof and his floor, and into his bedroom. 17M hasn't gone back to school since getting out of his most recent camp yet, and probably won't for another couple of weeks.

So, yesterday, I had some online labs to do. We're using a program that has pretty good simulations, but it takes a long time to load, and loading pauses if you go to another tab or window to do something else, so you're stuck during those periods. It'd been an hour, it was at 28%, and I mentioned it to Dad. He said he had looked into upgrading our service about a year back, and they said the only way to get it any faster is to replace the modem, which he doesn't think they're doing right now. We can't move it back to where it was, not sure why. He said he'd go see what my brothers were doing and to see if they would pause it, because he agreed that it was ridiculous. 17M had found a way around the cameras, so he wasn't home, but 21M said he was downloading some games on the PS4. He said he'd pause them if he could, but wouldn't stop it because they're big files.

Does anyone have any ideas on how to effectively share it, so it isn't as slow when I'm trying to do work? Personally, I think that we should all be avoiding big downloads of anything unnecessary and that 17M should just use data (unlimited plan) and never be on the wifi, but I don't know if stress and sleep deprivation are making me unreasonable or not.",10Apr2020,1
931,"What would you do? I’ve posted in various other health subreddits but I think they’re overloaded right now and I don’t know if I really need doctor advice for this anyway at this point. I just need general advice. I’ve been sick for the last 2 1/2 months with something that no one can quite figure out.

My symptoms are that I have had on/off burning sore throat and throat tightness. I’ve had lots of congestion in my throat and now in my nose. Some ear plugging too on one side. Tickle in my throat on the right side. Swollen lymph node on the right side under jaw on/off. No fever or cough, but temperature can go up in the 99s (mines normally 97s). I’ve had some pus spots on my tonsils on and off too that have been getting worse progressively over the two months. I have some trouble breathing due to the congestion, feel stuffy, sometimes feel like I can’t get a deep breath in. I literally always feel crappy. I haven’t had a day I’ve felt good in two months. Doing too many activities seems to make me feel worse too, like rest is the only thing that helps and the time I felt best was after an entire week of rest at the beginning when I took off work. If I do too much, I literally feel faint or like I could pass out. 

I went to urgent care in the beginning thinking I had a bad flu. They said what I had was likely viral and they couldn’t figure it out exactly, but to just wait it out and see my PCP. Mono and strep came back negative. A CBC was done which didn’t show infection with an elevated white blood cell count. I basically stumped them. I finally got to my PCP later in the month who diagnosed me with GERD (an acid relfux disease) and said acid was burning my throat causing these symptoms. I was referred to a Gastro doctor who said he didn’t think that was my issue, but I was put on meds to see if it would help. It didn’t really do much. He referred me to an ENT. I could only see the ENT virtually and he thought I had allergies, so on allergy meds I went. I was on them (antihistamine, nasal spray, sinus rinse, singulair) for a month with no improvement. My pcp prescribed me an inhaler for the trouble breathing but that didn’t really help and it’s not really my chest that gives me the trouble if that makes sense. Finally, after all of this and seemingly feeling worse and worse, I went to my PCP again who just said it was anxiety and prescribed me Xanax. I’ve tried the Xanax and yes it relieves anxiety and I feel I guess relaxed, but doesn’t fix my congestion or throat issues. I then went to a new doctor by happenstance when I needed a follow up appointment and my usual wasn’t available. At this point, the pus on my tonsils had gotten a bit worse and more pronounced. She thought I might have bacterial infection, which is what I thought I had at the beginning but no one would give me antibiotics. I have ten days of amoxicillin. I’m on day 3 now and don’t really feel better, if anything I think I feel more fatigued and my throat feels a little more irritated or something, but the pus seems to be diminishing somewhat. I can’t really tell if it’s working or if it should’ve been working better by now. I have an image attached if my tonsils if anyone wants to look and see if they think it’s improving too and I’m not insane (left top day 1 on antibiotics, right too day 2 on antibiotics, left bottom day 3 morning, right bottom day 4 afternoon). 

At this point, I have so much health anxiety from feeling crappy for two months and I have this fear of my throat just closing up where I can’t breathe. I feel like I’ve gotten a huge run around from everyone and people want to throw everything to anxiety. If these antibiotics don’t work, I’m not even sure where to go from here.

936,"So, I don't like being home usually because my parents are snippy with each other, but I went home last weekend and loved it so much because I felt I could be myself and have alone time and my family is quiet. At school, I feel so pissed off and stressed out all day I can't figure out how to fix it.

&amp;#x200B;

Here at school, I can't seem to relax if my roommates are around at all. I feel like they disrespect my stuff, use my things even when I say no, expect to be able to just touch my stuff etc. Its been like this for months, but a lot of progress has been made on me feeling comfortable voicing my thoughts.

&amp;#x200B;

Now though, I just feel like they are inconsiderate towards me, take me for granted, and expect me to give them my stuff because I tend to be very kind and forgiving. One roommate asked me not to have people over so he could study, then the next day he had a ton of people over when I was trying to study and he didn't even check with me. Plus, he's crazy loud in general and when I keep track of how often he try's to bug me its several times and hour (more if I ignore them) and I'm already so ADHD. Plus they're huge homebodies so they never go out, only have people over. I just bought ANC headphones so I can better ignore the constant knocking on my bedroom door.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to live alone. I think I just want a quiet house, and I want them to go to other peoples houses to hang more, and I don't want them to touch my stuff but I don't know how to justify saying no. And they make jokes that I hate them, but I love them at friends and them I'm stressed all day.

I'm much cleaner, more productive, and have more hobbies than them and they play video games all day making noise and bugging me.

937,"Hi everyone, hope you’re all safe and healthy. I’m posting a question here where I need some advice about my little cousins conditional discharge. I tried positing it on legal advice but for reasons not even the moderator can explain, I’m not allowed to ask it 🤦‍♂️ and at risk Of getting banned from reddit I will refrain from saying anything further. 


OP: Need advice about cousins probation / conditional discharge



Last summer, my little cousin (22 years old) got arrested in New Jersey for a bullshit marijuana offense. Long story short, at his court date back in January, because it was his first offense ever, he got entered into the conditional discharge program, for 6 months. It’s basically a really low level of probation for first time drug offenders. The conditions are he keeps out of trouble and he’s subject to random drug testing. 

Anyway, originally he had to submit for a drug test, and sign an agreement to abide to the rules of the program, by April 15th. He made an appointment for the third week of March. With everything that’s been going on with the coronavirus, he received a letter from the court saying that the deadline has been pushed to the end of April. 

After speaking with his probation officer on the phone to confirm, he was told that he could submit the results of the pee test, and the signed statement, online through the officers email. So he got a test done with his doctor, and did just that. This was about a week and a half ago. The officer did not respond, so he sent the email again, as well as called his office. Again, no response. 

He’s been calling everyday because he’s trying to get confirmation that the test was valid. He tried calling the NJ courts, but no one is there. He is very worried that he’ll be held in contempt of court. He doesn’t know if he should go to his scheduled End of April appointment, just Incase. The court has not sent out any notification to him whatsoever, and he has no way to contact anyone in the courts. He has left voice messages, and he has even called different departments. 

What happens in a situation like this ? I know obviously he’s still on probation till his CD ends in July, but he’s paranoid as fuck that they’ll try to screw him or something. Should he do anything ? 

He tried calling his attorney but unfortunately the law firm he has retained the services of, sucks major and doesn’t return his phone calls. Id appreciate any advice so I can tell him to calm the hell down Lol. I’d tell him to just smoke a blunt and chill but obviously he can’t do that 😂. Thanks people

Edit of original post: instead of asking what happens in a situation like this, I will normally ask what happens when probation departments don’t respond to their supervisee, and the supervisee has a court order to do something that they did but haven’t received confirmation on whether it is fulfilled or not? 

Thank you again guys: reddit I really hope this is an acceptable question because I really wanna give the kid some answers.",10Apr2020,1

939,So yesterday my friend and I spent a good amount of the day together. We went to go wash our car around 5pm and then after that we went fishing for about 2- 3 hours. I had a lot fun even though we didn’t really catch anything just because we got to spend time together. When he wasn’t looking I would be checking him out. I felt bad for it but I couldn’t help myself. When we got back to his place we just sat out on the back of his stepdads truck talking about life and whatnot. When we first started I remember seeing it was 9pm but the next time I looked it was 11. It didn’t seem like that much time had gone by but I guess it’s because we were enjoying ourselves. I then asked him why he called me back because we had had an altercation where we hadn’t talked for a while. After he explained himself I went to shake his hand and he said he loved me and went in for a hug. I said that I loved back so fast and hugged him too. I just wanted to find a warm place with him and just hold him tight but I didn’t want to be weird or anything so I let him go. Once I got home he FaceTimed me and asked me something I’ve never been asked before. He put his face up to the camera and asked if he had any ejaculation on his face because he just finished. At that point all I could think of was his face covered in my you-know-what. I feel so ashamed and I don’t know why. I guess I just want a sure answer of if he feels the same way as I do. I know it’s a lot but it would mean so much if you guys could get back to me. Thanks,10Apr2020,1

941,"I was never into selfies and people who used to take photos of me were usually doing that next to some landscape/landmark, so full-body and a normal pose, quite from afar.

Now because of the lockdown, I’m living alone in a small room in a student dorm, and I wanted to take some pictures of myself. I have a great body but I can’t really take photos from afar, and I’m really not used to my face in photos - not when it’s a close-up. My features are ok-ish, but I have a biggly nose and would rather not take a photo from a side. I feel like every photo turns out ugly/awkward. 

How do I discover my best angles? What props could I use in a small student dorm? What poses?",10Apr2020,1
942,"Before we start, I want to get three things cleared up:  

My boyfriend is a transwoman but prefers he/him pronouns because he doesn't feel as though he deserves to use she/her until he transitions.  I am using he/him because that's what he prefers.

I do not feel comfortable referring to his daughters as my stepchildren.  I have met one and adore her, I haven't met the other.  I feel as though stepchild is a term for after marriage.

I am using a throwaway because I talk about him at length and do not want to accidently have a family member or friend find out he is trans.

**TL;DR:  My boyfriend blindsided me by saying we will never have biological children together because he will have bottom surgery and cannot afford to freeze sperm before we can try for a baby.  Prior to today, I was under the impression that when we were in a better place financially we would try for a baby.  How do I get over the sadness of finding this out?  I know I will eventually, but how can I do it faster?**

Today me and my boyfriend were discussing what we would do with money in the future and I suggested we put back money to send the children to college.  This involves his daughters and whatever baby I thought we were going to have.

This is when he tells me that me and him will not have a biological child as he will have bottom surgery before we could afford to freeze his sperm.  Prior to this, even a month ago, we were discussing having a child when we financially could.  He said he never wanted to have a child with someone before (both of his children were the exact opposite of planned.)  We discussed baby names, looked at baby products and clothes, all of that kind of stuff, I used to regularly scroll through subreddits for baby planning and waiting to conceive.

I knew it would be a while before we could actually start trying, but I was still shocked and saddened by this.

The likelihood of us ever conceiving was low to begin with.  Despite him having two kids himself, his sperm quality is low and I have a irregular period (have not had one since december, 10 Wal-Mart pregnancy tests, 3 urine tests at the doctors, and a blood test later I am 100% not pregnant) and cysts on my ovaries.  But to know that there's now 0 chance was a bit hard to take.

I went silent and he told me to say something, so I only said I was sad.  I wanted to be able to collect my thoughts fully before opening the discussion up because I do support him transitioning and want him to see himself the way I see him and didn't want him to feel like he can't transition because of me.

I am still sad and this conversation happened a few hours ago.  I'm still working on gathering my thoughts in a constructive way and not speak from sadness (and/or anger as my sadness can present as anger) because sometimes when I try to discuss things that are more serious he just resorts to ""well fine, I won't do (x).""

How do I get over the realization I will never have biological children unless it is by accident?  I know this is usually something that breaks couples up, but I know eventually I'll get over it and I genuinely love him and i know that he loves me.  I am just sad that I'll never get to really be a mother and stuff.

943,"So- I got married to the “nice guy” and ended up getting framed as “abusive” by him. What do I do? 

So- quick little back story- I married a absolute nice guy who was lazy af and womanized like crazy. I was stuck in the kitchen, he made me drop out of college and used my remaining FASFA money and savings to buy himself video games while I cleaned after him and worked a full time job. It was hell. 

I got smart and realized he needed help. So I wanted to go to couples therapy or at least get him some help and up to this point I never told my family about who he really was (we lived in different states so they never really met him that much) and he freaked out. 

Next thing I knew all of my friends had blocked me on Facebook? I went to his families house and they treated me like I was Invisible- LOL, okay? Then I get a call from my parents. My at the time husband had within two days convinced everyone I knew that I was secretly abusive/toxic- what ever. He made up a bunch of shit I won’t even go into but yea it’s not true, and when I confronted him about it he yelled at me and told me it was my fault for asking him to get a job. (By the way, about a month before this he started hitting me- so in reality it was him who was abusive but whatever) 

SO. He also handed me divorce papers which I signed and it was done in a week. Whatever. Well I lost all my friends (excluding one, my bestie) and a few family members. Well time passed and I remarry and honestly I thought karma was going to just get him and when everyone saw how happy me and my new husband were (which we very much are and will probably honesty be my last marriage just from how we work out) I thought maybe my old friends would be like “huh, maybe he lied about her??” BUT NAHHH. 

This DUDE gets remarried like a friggin month after I do. The girl just got home from a two year exposition in France or wherever and boom he snatches her up (props to him, I mean that’s pretty impressive) well. Obviously I don’t care about him and I pray for his poor wife that I’m sure will find out who he really is soon and I don’t want to get involved, ew lol, but I miss my old friends. 

I’ve reached out to many of them trying to ask why, trying to explain my side but I get no responses so I’ve left it alone. I know they wernt true friends either, but it also bugs me that people that know me pretty well could believe that even to today, and it really gets to me mentally. Any advice?

946,"I am currently a second-semester freshman enrolled in my college's (Saint Louis University) computer engineering degree program.  This semester has proven to be a lot more work-intensive than lasts, and for the past month or so I have been questioning if this is what I really want to go into and do for the rest of life.  What drew me to computer engineering was a strong passion for technology and interest in how computers work, during my last 2 years of high school computers became one of my favorite hobbies, I built a computer for myself and built 3 others for some friends.  I am really interested in the hardware aspect of computer engineering, I think designing and working on computer components such as a CPU or graphics card would be an extremely rewarding career to take on.  But I am having doubts, I know for a fact that coding is not my favorite thing to do in the world, and that is a huge component of the degree.  I'm not terrible at coding, I just hate doing it and find it annoying and monotonous and don't want to be writing code for the rest of my life, I think I would go insane.  So I guess right now I'm toying with the idea of switching majors, I'm not too deep in the program where switching would force me to go to school for another year, but I just don't know if this all is stemming from me being overwhelmed by the course workload or me actually wanting to change my degree.  If I did make the switch I think it would probably be to finance, something I was originally going to do if I had not done engineering.  Any help would be appreciated reddit!",10Apr2020,1
947,"I understand that dating in general for me is at its highest difficulty for me being a short Asian male at 5’3”-5’4”, especially in the America continents.  It doesn’t help I’m in my mid 20s, and even with a full beard and decent clothes (not graphic tees and fitted the best I can find without spending an entire paycheck for clothes catered to short men since that demographic is small, thus results in crazy high prices), I still get comments saying I look like a freshman in high school. 

However, I don’t want to just settle for anything.  I don’t want to jump on the train that is the first women who shows even the slightest bit of interest in me (side-note:  I’ve never been on a date and will be in my 30s in a few years).  Last two women who were my friends I expressed interest in, they ended the friendship after telling me my physical attraction towards them isn’t mutual (blocked my phone # and social media accounts) 

I also have a rule of no fat women or single moms.  Trust me when I say I tried to be open minded for the former, but it just wasn’t there for me. I couldn’t date someone who looks like they don’t care for their own health (I understand that there are conditions that make this beyond some people’s control, but physical attraction is as big a factor as emotional attraction to me).

I also couldn’t date single moms no matter how attractive they are.  In all honestly I really don’t want to be a father.  A child is a massive expense, and in the times we live in where everything keeps going up but living wages (how far can this go before most people can’t afford basic necessities?), it’s too big of a risk in my eyes.  Plus seeing the parenting styles of many couples, I realized most shouldn’t have been parents in the first place.

My grandfather passed a way a year ago, and it was pretty sudden and very sad for my dad and his family. My dad got a lot of things from him that were important to him, but instead of giving those to us kids equally, he basically gave everything to my brother. So I asked my grandma for his SS, got his signature, and had it tattooed on my body. I was so happy with it and it felt like I had a part of me with him. My dad was even really happy with it!

Until my mom found about it.

To put it into perspective, I already had 2 tattoos. My first one she literally went with me to go get it, the second was a birthday gift from my parents. Both of my parents even have tattoos. I literally had no reason to think this would be any different.
My mom FLIPPED when I got home, saying I should never had gotten someones name on my body, that she would never do that (even though she has my name on her body as well as my siblings),that I wouldnt get a job (Im in art school btw), that I owed her parents something, and even went to point out how my grandpa was a shitty person, all while my dad just kind of let her talk about his RECENTLY DECEASED FATHER. The whole thing resulted in me “not being allowed to get more tattoos” until I was done with college.

I have taken a lot of crap from my mom, but this really stuck with me, and I have grown to not like the tattoo. I hate where it is placed now, I think it sticks out bad compared to my other tattoos, and it constantly reminds of my mom bad mouthing my grandpa for no reason. 

It has been well over a year since I got it, and I dont know if I should get it covered up. My dad’s family are so proud of me for having it, and I know deep down he is too. I just find myself not enjoying it anymore, and dont know if I will.",10Apr2020,1

960,"Physics are my absolute passion. I (15M) would love to have a physics research job, it is what I love and what I want to end up doing. There's a small issue however, since most jobs regarding this would collide with the fast-paced lifestyle I'd love to have at least during my youth; let me explain it further...

**NOTE:** Have in mind that I'm talkinh about a future 5-10 years from now, so forget about the current situation when reading my post

Currently living in Spain, which, to be honest, sucks in my opinion; I really admire and would love to have the Eastern Asian megacity lifestyle (*work hard, play hard*); I'd love to live in Singapore, Hong Kong, Tokyo, Shenzhen, Shanghai, etc, etc, etc. and being moving around that area, working really hard and never having a heartrate below 80 BPM (a bit exaggerated but you get the point). I should also add by this point that I'm quite socially inept; in most of my life I have had an average of 0-1 friends and I doubt I would ever even be able to get a romantic relationship...

Now, time to discuss the issue. You'd think many of the job offers in physics would be near the places I described, right? It's the most logical thing, just that according to my ""research"" (many queries in Google throughout the last 5 years) shows that apparently not... CERN is in Geneva, which is a city I personally really like but it's just no Hong Kong; DESY is near Hamburg, which is not a small city by any means but it's just not as constantly busy as Eastern Asia; Fermilab is in Chicago, which is probably one of the nearest cities with a major laboratory to the ones I described, but it simply isn't the same; etc. Meanwhile, all the real physics research job offers in Hong Kong are, well, none, according to Glassdoor last time I checked; in Singapore, just at the university (with some not so good reviews)... There probably are some cool projects or facilities in mainland China, but its government still needs some time to be sorted out...

The thing is, these megacities are business centres, they're meant for the finance people and that stuff, not quite for scientists, which is my problem...

i’ll save the details but in the past couple of months we’ve met up quite a bit at his house. i’ve interacted with most of his family, his little sisters know my name, we’ve spent hours just watching netflix in his bed, we’ve cuddled, he’s even opened up to me about some things, and i was also the first person he ever had sex with. we’re comfortable with each other, and although our relationship is mainly physical, one time we just watched tv the whole night, didn’t do anything sexual, and we still had a good time.

i always knew i liked him since we started this up but i wanted a physical connection more than an emotional connection. now, i can feel myself becoming emotionally attached but i’m not sure if i should fight it or allow the feelings to continue. he’s very attractive by societal standards and i get so jealous and insecure because he’s only friends with girls but he’s told me he’s not talking to anyone else and that he’s selective (i guess that’s flattering?) so he’s not gonna be leaving me any time soon. still i can’t tell if i should risk what we have by trying to pursue more with him or just learn to be satisfied with what i have now. help!! sorry that was a lot and there’s more if anyone’s willing to listen.",10Apr2020,1
962,I’m considered an essential worker and have work on Monday but my friends planned a hiking trip and told me today (friday) to call out of work to go. I said I will check if I have any vacation days and don’t want to lie to my boss since it’s really hard to get anyone in especially nowadays. I feel bad for canceling but i feel they could’ve also scheduled it on a Saturday or Sunday since we do have full time jobs (I’m the only one that’s working at the moment) What do I do?,10Apr2020,1
963,"I was about to do a 2 month long internship starting from mid May overseas at a reputable company and due to coronavirus obviously it's not possible. Company hasn't confirmed but 99% hinted at it being online. Meanwhile my college has instead of going online decided to prepone our summer vacation to now and 'pause' the semester and continue in June which I'm sure won't be possible as it definitely won't be safe to do so (physically) so I'm assuming they continue in an online fashion June onwards. Now since June was our original summer vacation it seems like both will overlap June onwards but I can technically do my classes in the morning/afternoon and internship at night due to time zone difference. 

If my university conducts our end of the semester exams, class and labs online then no way I'll be able to both at the same time however for the university to conduct our labs and our pretty complex 3 hour exams (Engineering) online sounds very difficult however if they only do online classes and our smaller tests and assignments I can definitely balance both. I don't know what to do since our college has said we won't have class till June and probably won't tell us shit till end of May meanwhile I have to inform the company my scene by start of May atleast. I don't know what to say to HR without losing the internship. I know this sounds pretty confusing, any advice appreciated!",10Apr2020,1
965,"This post is going to be structured horribly.

I have known this girl that I've liked for 5 years. We always talk to each other. About a couple months ago she came out to me as bisexual. I am the only person she came out to. I, being a respectable human being, saw no issue with her sexuality and was happy she was able to come out to me. I found out that she had leaned more towards liking women. I am male, and felt hurt by that fact, and I shouldn't be upset at that. But I am pretty much in love with this woman and don't know how to feel.

I've known her most of my life and always relied on her to talk to. She sees me as her best friend. However I've wanted more with our relationship. She has had two relationships during our friendship, which were brief due to the fact she gets incredibly stressed out from relationships. I always felt happy when she ended the relationship with them. It sounds terrible but how could I not feel happy about it. However when ever she brought up the stress of the relationship I felt discouraged.

That's probably the word I should of used for the first segment. Discouraged. I digress.

She is a very shy woman, and doesn't like much human interaction. Despite being best friends me and her would actually physically hang out once every couple months. She dislikes physical touching and crowds discourage her. Pretty much some social anxiety.

I am the opposite and personally love having physical contact. Correction: I love the thought of having physical contact. I haven't had a relationship ever, and the people I've talked to were either in a relationship before I could do something.(asking them to prom when I had planned to at her locker, 6 ft. away. Again off topic.) Or they moved away. So I don't have any relationship experience at all.

I have asked her out twice, both fairly early in our friendship, around the one year mark. And both times she said no. It's been a long ass time since then and have had lowering and raising levels of hope for this relationship ever happening.

In a couple months, we're both going to be having different situations. She's moving on my birthday to another state for college, and I have no clue what I'm going to do with what I'm doing after school. We're definitely still going to be in contact so it's not like I'm not going to be seeing her again, it's still far away.

I want to let go, without ending our friendship. Or I want to be able to talk to her about our relationship and see if I can change her mind. I just know I'm gonna be butthurt if I don't do anything about it. Any advice/words of encouragement on how to handle this?

TL;DR: my best friend prefers women, dislikes relationships, and is moving away soon. How do I function?",10Apr2020,1

971,"I (26/f) had been with my ex (28/m) for about two years. I loved and cared for him. He was my first everything. 

Over a week ago, he was caught on a dating site talking and flirting with girls. Idk if he met with anyone but it doesn’t matter. Him being on the site in itself is a betrayal.

Anyways, I was pretty much obsessed with him. Totally head over heels and couldn’t envision life without him in it. 

My question is: why is that after he pretty much cheated, I just don’t care about him anymore? I know cheating happens a lot and people grieve a lost partner... 

I don’t feel that way. I feel like I sucked the poison out of my life. 

Is this normal to not care?",10Apr2020,1
972,"Howdy! I am in a situation where I want to leave my old friend group, but its really hard to just forget them . 

I actually wanted to leave in late December/ early January and tried but it blew up in my face so I ended up sticking around. Now with Miss Corona out here closing my high school I think I might actually have the opportunity to leave and not look back. 

But how do I forget them? I see them on instagram and i've unfollowed them and I stopped doing anything that would remind me of them, but we knew each other for 2 years and I'm not sure how to stop feeling like I miss them, because I shouldn't, they kept doing mean stuff to me and I want to stop feeling like I need them. 

Any advice on how to truly forget them and move on?",10Apr2020,1
973,"Seeking advice for if I’m reading too much into a situation at work or not.

I work for a large food distributor in the USA. 

Today, we got a company wide email that detailed our next paycheck is our last bi-weekly paycheck. From there, we would be moving to weekly paychecks. 

Normally, this wouldn’t concern me in the slightest however I work in supply chain. Given the current issue with COVID-19, we have been told business has never been better, but with many large vendors and manufacturers physically unable to meet demand, and us unable to fulfill orders fully for weeks now, my fear is that this change may have something to do with the state of the company? There has been no talk of this anywhere within company updates, team meetings, or anything else. We also had a warehouse have employees test positive recently (not officially disclosed, but people talk) and closed that location for now until further notice. (One of our largest warehouses) A few weeks ago they had announced they were giving incentive bonuses weekly to warehouse workers and truck drivers for the company, but us in office (now work from home) employees were obviously not included in that. (Totally ok with that, they are working very hard in those two areas) Now I’m beginning to wonder if that ended up backfiring and they aren’t sure of the liquidity of the company anymore? 

In the transition of having all non-physically essential employees work from home, the company has had to invest in tons of IT equipment including servers to assist with the VPN, WiFi adapters for employees, and for some laptops and monitors. Not too long before that was an entire office wide transition to “updated” “new” computers. (Different topic to go on about underperforming tools)

The root question I have is, should I be worried the company is going to lay people off due to cost or possibly worse, or am I just worrying for nothing with cabin fever brain?",10Apr2020,1

976,"Okay so I’ve been in a youth club for around 3 and a half years now and before that I never had a passion I could stick at. Once I found this I fell in love with it and it really stuck and ever since it’s changed me so much it’s given me more confidence I’ve met great friends and I wouldn’t ever be the person I am today without it in so many positive ways. 

However it’s always been an anxiety causer for me as I’m in charge and put under a lot of pressure and responsibilities and I get anxiety over performing well and others liking me. This is something about going there which I can’t change I wouldn’t be able to reduce my responsibilities if anything in the future they’re going to increase. However this pressure and responsibility as much anxiety as it gives me I thrive off of it when I perform well and it really boosts me and I love that feeling to pieces and wouldn’t want to throw it away so hastily. 

I’ve started to realise however whilst we’re in lockdown and I’m not going my mental health without as much to think about and to stress over has improved VERY drastically. The anxiety of it has been lifted from my shoulders and it’s left me feeling so so conflicted, I don’t want to give it up however in the place I’m in now the anxiety that used to be there is gone, yes it’s in other parts of my life but nowhere near. I really don’t know what to do and even what approach to take going back, I would hate to quit it I really would I’ve never had a passion like it before but I’m now realising that this break is beneficial for me and it was causing me some serious mental health issues that have now relieved significantly.",10Apr2020,1
977,"I work at a gas station and every day, multiple times a day, this family will come in and use our restroom. Mind you, they don't exactly smell the best and the smell lingers. I've recently found out that this family, two adults and about 3-4 children ranging in age from 6ish-to maybe 15, live out of their SUV. It's a compact SUV. Not exactly much room for a family of that size. The kids come in, rarely wearing shoes, ragged clothing, and all around unkept. The parents aren't much better. Most of my coworkers don't like to let them in and one has told me they want to call CPS on them, I partially understand, but I don't meddle because it's not my business. However, it's not safe for these kids to live like they do in my area, lots of heroin addicts and just a sketchy part of town. The family is nice, but I'm at a complete loss on what to do.

979,"First of all, im 18 years old, english is not my native language, i'm a virgin, introverted, never even had anything close to a relationship not even a kiss from a girl that isn't my mom. I must also say, i have real life friends and a nice supporting family

I feel a constant need of love, every day, the only thing i crave is being on a relationship and i know that's not healthy but i don't know what to do about it, it must have something to do with loving myself which i don't, really the only person i hate in this planet is myself, but i don't feel like i can love myself before being loved by someone else.

And on the more important subject, i've had 2 real strong friendships with girls in my life and i feel i've ruined them by being a creep, the first one is a bit less important, because it has been going on for 5 years and it's not going that bad, at least compared to the other one, but i will talk about it later. The second friendship was with a girl i met in a videogame about 3 years ago, so when i was 15, we had a language barrier between us because she could barely speak english (i know my english is not fantastic but at least you can understand me) but i still got a huge crush on her almost instantly, I was happy every time we could chat, and my emotion that day would be determined by the chat i had with her, if she answered my msg's positively then i would become happy, but if she didn't answer me i would get paranoid and think that she hated me, she of course didn't hate me at that point, she just had another things to deal with in her life, but with time i became more confident? or at least more daring, i started making perverted questions about her body or whatever fetish i had by at that time, i then instantly responded with ""omg im sry don't answer that"" and, she would almost always respond to what i was asking even tho she clearly felt uncomfortable about it and say that i didn't need to apologize, i feel now that i was manipulating her, eventually she would realize what kind of person i was and thanfully ended our relationship, i know have realized that even thought i had a huge crush on her, because she told me what i was doing was wrong i didn't felt bad about it, thought she was unreasonable, i for long time thought she was exageratting and that i was in the right, now i see i was being a disgusting manipulative creep. And this other girl i am friends with well, we still talk daily, but i have been a pervert when talking to her and using the ""Oh im sry pls don't hate me"" tactic, thankfully she just disregards those msg's not even acknowledging them and talks about other stuff, i also have a crush on this girl, and my mood is currently based on how texting goes with her for that day, if she responds to my msg's  im happy, if she doesn't i feel sad.

Before i hated myself mainly because i couldn't get a girlfriend, now i hate myself because i'm a creep, i want to change that, and i have no idea how, sure i could stop texting her weird stuff, i already know that, and i will stop doing it as, well, i just realize all of this the last couple days,i never even thought about it before, i thought that was just normal nerdy kid stuff

I know this a poorly written text but i needed to get this out, and i am asking for advice, if there are any methods to not have my mood determined by another person and to, well, stop being a creep in general. I have heard that loving yourself is a nice way to do that, so i have been doing exercise and eating better, to have a better body (because the body i have right now is not exactly good) and maybe regain confidence in myself, which i lack a lot. But, if there is any other advice i would be very grateful.",10Apr2020,1
